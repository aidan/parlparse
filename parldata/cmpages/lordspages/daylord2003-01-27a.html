<a name="30127-01_head0"></a><H3><center>Inland Revenue: Interest Rates</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>In the most recent tax year for which figures are available, what has been the income generated by the Inland Revenue through interest charges for late payment and what has been the corresponding repayment to taxpayers for overpayment.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, in the 12-month period to October 2001, the most recent for which data are available, interest payments received by the Inland Revenue amounted to some £417 million and the Revenue paid out some £397 million in interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that reply. Will he confirm that if the Inland Revenue is owed money by a taxpayer it charges the taxpayer at 6&#189; per cent interest, whereas if the Inland Revenue owes money to a taxpayer it pays 2&#189; per cent interest? Will my noble friend justify the difference?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the first thing to be said is that one person is not being charged interest at a higher rate on what he pays than on what he receives. The rate of interest on late payments does not constitute a penalty; it is designed to cancel any financial advantage for those who pay late. The rate of interest is set to encourage payment on time and to compensate the Exchequer for loss. The rate of interest on overpayments is the average commercial rate for return on deposits. The Inland Revenue is not a source of cheap credit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall the claim of Ken Dodd that he was a pioneer of self-assessment? Is not the problem now with the Revenue itself? Is the noble Lord aware that some offices are now claiming a three-month delay in processing returns? That is before the big logjam caused by the January rush. Therefore, is not there a case for looking for carrots rather than sticks and giving a positive incentive to those who send in their returns early? I understand that that worked very well in persuading people to submit their tax returns online. There is evidence to suggest that instead of expensive advertising campaigns a little incentive to early payers would work very effectively.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I refer to the principal incentive for early payment; that is, if you send in your tax return before 30th September, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord McNally, does, the calculation is done for you rather than a person having to go through the self-assessment procedure. If the noble Lord, Lord McNally, is suggesting that there should be financial benefits from early payment, I believe that those who have more complex tax affairs would find that rather unfair.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, is correct in the two rates of interest he mentioned&#151;I must infer that he is, as the Minister did not correct him&#151;is it not the case, therefore, that the Inland Revenue owes the taxpayer a great deal more than the taxpayer owes the Inland Revenue? Will the Minister explain why that is so?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, my original Answer detailed not the interest charged but the payments received. I confirm the figure of 6&#189; per cent mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. Different figures apply for different kinds of tax. Late payment of inheritance tax is charged at only 3 per cent. However, from the figures available to me, I cannot confirm the rate of interest for overpayment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, is it any wonder that we have this merry-go-round of over and underpayments of tax when just one branch of Her Majesty's Government now generates 1,185 pages of claim forms relating to taxable benefits, non-taxable benefits, allowances, credits, reliefs, tapers, disregards&#151;an endless list of paper?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I assume that as the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, used the phrase "merry-go-round", he assumes that there is a large figure of overpayments and underpayments. In fact, the Inland Revenue collects £215 billion, so the plus or minus £400 million interest on overpayments and late payments is roughly 0.2 per cent of the total. I do not call that a bad figure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action the Attorney-General is taking on the evidence presented to him by the chair of INDICT, Ann Clwyd MP, of criminal offences committed by Iraqi leaders under the Taking of Hostages Act 1982.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </B>  My Lords, INDICT asked me to grant consent to the commencement of prosecutions against Saddam Hussein, Tariq Aziz, Ali Hassan Al-Majid and Taha Ramadan. Having considered the material and with the benefit of the advice of Treasury counsel who <P>


<a name="column_911"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 911</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reviewed it all, I wrote to Ann Clwyd MP at length on 24th January to explain my conclusions that in none of these cases is the admissible evidence that INDICT provided by itself sufficient to commence a prosecution now and that a full police investigation would be needed. Saddam Hussein is in any event immune from criminal jurisdiction here while serving head of state of Iraq.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord agree that many lawyers would disagree with his attribution of immunity to Saddam as head of state and that, as a matter of public and international law, crimes against humanity and war crimes, whether committed by a head of state or not, are not granted that immunity? Does he also agree that in addition to the evidence which has been submitted by Ms Ann Clwyd, statements have also been made by 1,800 people who were traced and interviewed by the Ministry of Defence in relation to Operation Sandcastle? Is he really saying that in spite of all this mass of evidence, there are not sufficient grounds on which to prosecute Iraqi leaders? Will he place a copy of the letter to Ann Clwyd in the Library of the House so that others may judge the validity of his conclusions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord raises three questions. First, I do not agree that other lawyers would take the view that Saddam Hussein was not immune from prosecution. The immunity of heads of state was confirmed by the judgment of the International Court of Justice in Democratic Republic of the Congo v Belgium on only 14th February last year. I understand that INDICT's advisers agree with that view.
<P>

<a name="30127-01_para0"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord raises a question about the adequacy of the evidence. Someone believing that they know what happened is one thing, but proving it in a criminal court is a wholly different proposition. Having taken the advice of experienced Treasury counsel and considered the matter myself, although the evidence that INDICT has presented to me is telling at face value, I am not satisfied that it goes sufficiently far to justify a prosecution now.
<P>

<a name="30127-01_para1"></a> Thirdly, having regard to the confidentiality of prosecution matters and the fact that the evidence came from Ann Clwyd herself, I shall consider the noble Lord's question about whether I would place in the Library of the House a copy of the letter that I have sent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord's explanation of the Government's attitude appears to be wholly satisfactory, but I cannot understand why it should now always be assumed that the evidence would warrant a prosecution. Why should Her Majesty's Government have to prosecute? Is there no one else who would wish to prosecute?
<P>


<a name="column_912"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 912</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, of course I am grateful for the noble Lord's statement that he finds what I said satisfactory. However, I ought to point out that what I have said is not a government statement: it is a statement of my view as an independent Law Officer, having considered the detail of the evidence in the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, while Saddam Hussein is head of state he is immune from prosecution, but would the noble and learned Lord tell us whether, if he were displaced, he would be liable for offences that he might have committed while head of state? Surely he would be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I have been asked to consider the question as of now, and as of now the point that the noble Lord makes is entirely hypothetical.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has raised a very interesting question as to who could be prosecuted for war crimes. What would be the position if, for example, there was an intervention in Iraq in which civilians were killed by British and American troops operating together, and that was considered a war crime? Would President Bush be immune from prosecution, but Tony Blair liable for prosecution?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, that question, raising a number of hypothetical issues as it does, seems to me to fall outside the terms of the Question tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister kindly answer the other question that I put to him, which was whether he had examined the evidence accumulated by Operation Sandcastle, conducted by the Ministry of Defence at a cost of more than £400,000, in which 1,800 witnesses were traced? I believe that statements were taken from more than 1,000 of them. Does he not take all that evidence into consideration, in addition to that submitted by INDICT, in determining whether prosecutions should be instituted?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030127/text/30127-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I most certainly have. The Sandcastle material to which the noble Lord refers does not relate solely to the issue that I was asked to consider, which was that of hostage taking. It covers many other areas as well. I can confirm that that material was looked at in detail.
<P>

<a name="30127-02_para0"></a>I give the assurance that I have taken the matter very seriously. I have given it my full and personal attention. In addition, members of my staff have spent days reviewing all the material, including the Sandcastle material. Treasury counsel experienced in such matters has also considered it. I assure the noble Lord that it has all been taken into account.

<P>

<a name="30127-02_time0"></a><H5>2.48 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Barnett </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have any plans to scrap the Barnett formula with respect to the allocation of public expenditure.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government have no plans to change the Barnett formula. The Government's funding policies for the devolved administrations were set out in the updated statement of funding policy published by the Treasury on 15th July 2002.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, I think that I am obliged to my noble friend for that Answer. However, if he has no plans to scrap the formula, the simple question must be, "Why not?". After all, I am sure he is aware that it is grossly unfair. It was never a formula when I invented it; it became one only after 18 years of the previous administration and under this one. It is grossly unfair and should not have been continued. Will the noble Lord therefore reconsider his Answer and ask the Treasury to look again and consider why it does not propose to scrap it? It can keep the name; I would be very happy about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Barnett is fully entitled to disown his offspring; there is no law against that. However, I do not accept that it is wholly unfair. The matter was given great consideration by the Constitution Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Norton. Although it has many criticisms to make of the Barnett formula, paragraph 105 of its report states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We do not have a neat ready-made alternative to Barnett to propose".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-02_para1"></a>
It proposes instead a needs review, the use of a periodic basis rather than an annual one, and a phased transition to any new system. That does not sound very attractive to me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, while the Barnett formula has become a legend and has proved acceptable to public opinion in Scotland, thereby consigning the noble Lord's name to posterity&#151;deservedly&#151;is there not wide misapprehension about its precise effects?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we had a very detailed debate on this matter in the House some 14 months ago. A majority of speakers were broadly in favour of the formula, largely because they came from Scotland and Wales and had a significant interest in that respect. It is important to make clear what the Barnett formula is. It is not the basis on which higher payments are made to Scotland or Northern Ireland in particular, but it may reflect a higher baseline, which was produced on the basis of a needs assessment involving the Scotland Act 1978. It applies only to block payments, not to annual managed expenditure <P>


<a name="column_914"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 914</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and only to changes in block payments and excludes such matters as the common agricultural policy, National Health Service expenditure, housing expenditure and so on, when those matters are devolved. It does not even involve all devolved expenditure because devolved expenditure funded by Barnett money has to be added to borrowing, local taxation and European Union receipts. It is really not such a big deal as all that.

<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, we have plenty of time if we start with the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, followed by the noble Lord, Lord Hughes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that if there is devolution in England, the Barnett formula will not last the course? If there is devolution in England and people are asked to vote for it, should they not know the financial settlement for which they will have to vote?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that, to use the phrase of my noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith, is a hypothetical question. We do not have devolution in England and, even if we had, it is by no means certain that all regions of England would wish to take advantage of it. Under those circumstances, we should face the issue when we come to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, although it is certainly true that the Barnett formula has very little effect on the total grant in Scotland, does my noble friend accept that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, is a cult figure in Scotland and that his formula is regarded as immutable? Perhaps we had better accept that he is immune from prosecution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has already said in this House that he does not want the arrangement to be called the Barnett formula. I believe that he wants it to be called "the Barnett granddaughter's formula" because that is the nearest relation that he is prepared to have accepted. I certainly accept that he is a cult figure in Scotland, but not just for that reason.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, is a cult figure in Wales in his own right, and not on account of his formula. Does the Minister agree that a formula that was devised for the transfer of funding between territorial departments is not acceptable at a time when financial transfers are bound to be the subject of political scrutiny by elected bodies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Not necessarily, my Lords, no. I can see circumstances in which that might be correct but the basic experience of the Barnett formula is that it has avoided the heroic jousts that <P>


<a name="column_915"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 915</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>took place in the Star Chamber between the end of the Goschen formula in 1959 and the start of the Barnett formula in 1978 or 1979. It works and it provides a degree of security and certainty. It is based on known facts about populations and the known baseline. I do not believe that those advantages should be taken too lightly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, if it is not the Government's intention to apply the Barnett formula to regional assemblies in England if they are established, will that not be very unfair because, as we have heard, Scotland and Wales, where the Barnett formula operates, have done rather well by its use?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I did not say that it was the Government's intention not to apply the Barnett formula to regions in England and Wales; I said that we have yet to see finalised legislation involving the regions of England and Wales. In any case, the Barnett formula in the devolved administrations has never been based on statute. There is no legislative backing for it; the current Government's use of it started with the White Paper on Scotland in 1997, not with the Scotland Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, would the noble Lord agree&#151;

<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is now the turn of the Liberal Democrats, followed by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   My Lords, while acknowledging, as the Minister said, that the Barnett formula may provide a degree of certainty, having been operative since 1978, does he also recognise that there is growing uncertainty about its equity? Although the Government may be losing the head of steam for constitutional reform, they are in the process of legislating to allow views to be expressed about regional government in England. It can only make sense to give this arrangement some serious discussion, perhaps by establishing a commission with broad terms of reference that can take account of the criticisms being made by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, and others, and come up with a more dispassionate view of its equity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, there has been doubt about the Barnett formula on the grounds of equity since it first came into operation. I do not accept what the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, says about there being growing concern about it. After all, it was thought at the time that, because it was applied only to increases, there would gradually be convergence between the government funding per head of population in the nations of the United <P>


<a name="column_916"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 916</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kingdom. That has not happened, partly because the formula has been bypassed on a number of occasions, particularly during the 1980s. However, on the whole I do not believe that there is increasing concern, except perhaps in your Lordships' House, spurred on by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, himself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, when the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, says that he is irrelevant, perhaps we should listen to him. Is the Minister aware that people in the south of England, who are being told that their rates might increase by 20 per cent, and people in the north of England, who see Scotland being treated in a preferential way, feel great resentment, especially when they see that in Scotland students are treated better than they are in England, Wales and Northern Ireland? Moreover, old people get better treatment in Scotland than they do in the rest of the United Kingdom. Does he understand that that resentment will boil over one day and cause the Government much trouble?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I gather from that that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, feels resentment but, since his resentment is based on so many misconceptions about public finances in this country&#151;in the south of England, the north of England and in Scotland&#151;his claim that there is resentment outside does not stand up very well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend seemed to argue that the reason for not scrapping the formula is because of all the various changes that have been made and the fact that there are a number of exclusions. Is he now saying that it is all right because it is only a little bit unfair?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I did not say either of those things; I said that the formula works and is understandable, predictable and challengeable only on the grounds of different calculations of population. Those do not seem to be virtues that should be lightly thrown away.

<P>

<a name="30127-03_para0"></a>The Question was as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="30127-03_para1"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in cutting new rail freight grants from over £50 million this year to zero for 2003&#150;04, the Strategic Rail Authority is complying with its purposes under <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>Sections 205 and 207(2)(f) of the Transport Act 2000 to promote rail freight and "to enable persons providing railway services to plan the future of their businesses with a reasonable degree of assurance".

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="30127-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Strategic Rail Authority is acting in a manner entirely consistent with its purposes under the Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that Answer. Is he aware that, apart from affecting seriously business confidence in the industry, it is estimated that cutting these grants is likely to put 5 million more lorries a year on the roads? How is that in line with the Government's 10-year plan to reduce congestion and transfer more freight from road to rail?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I believe that we should put this issue in context. The budget of £40 million for freight facilities grant and track access grant has become exhausted for this year. The Strategic Rail Authority has said that, until about the end of this year, no more applications which have not been contractually committed will be entertained. The advantage of doing that, and the purpose of doing so in relation to the purposes under the Transport Act 2000, is to avoid wasted effort and expense by bidders and, at the same time, to honour existing contractual commitments. In the context of a £33 billion budget over the 10-year period and virtually a £12 billion budget over the period of the current spending review, that does not seem to me to bring about the kind of conclusions envisaged by my noble friend Lord Berkeley.

<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister share my concern about conflict of interest where large sums of public money are expended on the railway, mostly in the interests of train services operated by Virgin Trains? Does he agree that the fact that the chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, his deputy and the rail regulator were all involved in that deal raises questions, and what does that mean for the rest of the railway, which will get virtually nothing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I believe that if the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, is to make accusations of conflict of interest, he had better do so other than with the benefit of parliamentary privilege. This is not a matter for me to comment on. He will know that the balance between expenditure on passenger services, which is what I believe he is referring to, and expenditure on freight services has been greatly affected by the freight charging review introduced by the rail regulator, to whom he referred, in October 2001. That has already halved the access costs to freight operators. The £500 million extra cost has been paid for by the Strategic Rail Authority in its grant to Network Rail.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para2"></a> If the substance behind the noble Lord's question is the balance between passenger and freight expenditure rather than accusations of conflict of interest, then I do not believe that he has any grounds to go on.

<A NAME="30127-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, I return to the Minister's reply to the supplementary question of my noble friend Lord Berkeley concerning the relationship of this matter to the 10-year plan. Can we infer from the Minister's reply that the Government are still committed to the 10-year plan? In particular, can we infer that the figure of 80 per cent for growth in rail freight provided for within the 10-year plan is still government policy and that the Government are committed to achieving that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government are, indeed, committed to their 10-year plan. As I have already said to the House, a full review of that will take place within the next 18 months. As to the immediate future, it is a little difficult for me to comment because the Strategic Rail Authority will produce its strategic plan only this week, on Thursday, 30th January.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew13"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Hereford: </B>   My Lords, if certainty and predictability are good arguments for maintaining the Barnett formula, can the Minister tell us why they are not equally good arguments for maintaining rail freight grant where the ability to plan ahead is essential if businesses want to make the transfer? Furthermore, if he is not persuaded that the legal or business arguments are decisive in this case, will he agree that the environmental arguments should be and that the transfer of freight from road to rail is of enormous environmental importance? It is a policy to which the Government are committed. Will they not make an exception in this case to enable the grants to continue? Can he also confirm that, even if the grants are not to be continued in England, they will be continued in Wales and Scotland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the thrust of the intellectual argument follows the same course in both Questions. Certainty and ability to plan are good things. That applies to the Barnett formula and to the action of the Strategic Rail Authority. The authority said that it has no money for new applications under the freight facilities grant or the track access grant this year. Therefore, it said that time and money should not be spent in producing anything now but that thought should be given to submitting applications towards the end of this year as money will be available next year.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para3"></a>However, that is against the situation where tonnage of rail freight has increased over the past 20 years or so from 17.6 billion tonne/kilometres in 1980 to 19.4 billion tonne/kilometres in 2003. The commitment to the extension of rail freight&#151;this is the environmental argument&#151;is still as strong as ever.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that, when Mr Bowker took over as chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, the West Coast Main Line modernisation plan was in such disarray that there was no prospect of that line carrying even existing levels of freight in the future? It is only because <P>


<a name="column_919"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 919</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the way that Mr Bowker and his team have rescued that project that it is now able to plan for growth in freight in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, Mr Bowker and the Strategic Rail Authority inherited from their predecessors and from Railtrack not only a bow wave of renewals, which was inevitably necessary after Hatfield, but, as my noble friend Lord Faulkner said, also a whole series of projects with unclear specifications and poor project management. The West Coast Main Line was a very good example of that. Happily, not all projects are like that. I refer noble Lords, for example, to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.

<A NAME="30127-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para7"></a>We are here today to debate a Bill that aims to bring an end to widespread delayed discharge, bring increased clarity to the roles and responsibilities of health and social care agencies, and increase the choice available to older people. On any given day in England, on average, 5,000 mainly older people are delayed in acute hospital beds across England. For each of those 5,000 people, something has gone wrong. Each of those individuals remains in a hospital bed unnecessarily when he or she can no longer benefit from acute treatment. First and foremost, that is bad for individuals who are delayed because, with each day that they remain on an acute ward, they are at risk of losing their independence and of becoming institutionalised.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para8"></a>Secondly, the effect upon the NHS of 5,000 delayed discharges per day is extremely worrying. As for each delay, other individuals will be waiting to enter <P>


<a name="column_920"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 920</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hospital. We must stop this colossal failure of the system. We must ensure that every patient who is likely to need services upon discharge receives a joined-up assessment of his needs as soon as possible and that, where services are needed, those are made available on the day that the patient is ready to go home. That is what the Bill will achieve.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para9"></a>I know there are those who argue that the Bill is unnecessary and suggest that as good progress has already been made on delayed discharges the issue can be tackled in other ways, such as through partnership and central performance management. I am the first to acknowledge the progress that has been made. I do not believe that the current level of heavy central intervention and top-down performance management that has brought about that reduction is consistent with the devolution and earned autonomy that we want to introduce across the health and social care system. It is also true that, even with the recent successes that we have achieved, the level of delay remains unacceptable. I do not believe that any older person should be delayed in an acute bed when he or she is ready to go home.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para10"></a>At Second Reading in another place my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced that an extra £100 million per full year on top of the allocations already announced would be transferred from central NHS budgets to local authorities in order to meet the estimated costs to local authorities of the scheme. That means that lack of funding can no longer be used as an excuse for under-investment in delayed discharges.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para11"></a>Of course, there are issues around care home capacity in some parts of the country but we have a problem if we think that the only way to care for the older people in our society is to place them in care homes in ever increasing numbers. The National Service Framework for Older People makes clear that local authorities need to reduce their reliance on institutional care and instead invest in a wide range of alternate provision, including interim care, intermediate care, extra sheltered housing and intensive support at home. In other words, that means increasing our capacity so that services can be used flexibly to respond to an individual's needs rather than using capacity problems as an excuse for local authorities not having met their responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para12"></a>I make clear that the Bill does not place any new responsibility upon local authorities. It does not require them to do anything other than what the best local authorities already do. Put simply, we expect local authorities to meet their existing responsibilities rather than, intentionally or unintentionally, passing the financial burden for some of those responsibilities on to the NHS. The Bill places a strong financial incentive upon local authorities to ensure that all individuals ready to leave acute hospital care are provided with the right care in the right place at the right time. It also places new duties upon the NHS that will ensure that robust discharge procedures are in place. I stress that the robustness of the new arrangements will be just as thorough on the NHS as on personal social services.
<P>


<a name="column_921"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para13"></a>I shall explain the main provisions of the Bill in more detail. Clause 1 sets out its scope: that is, those patients to whom its provisions will apply. Under the Bill a qualifying hospital patient will be someone who is accommodated in an NHS hospital (or in an independent hospital following arrangements made by the NHS) receiving care of a description that will appear in regulations. In the first instance, the Bill will apply only to patients receiving acute care, but it is our intention that its scope should be gradually extended to other sectors as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para14"></a>Clause 2 places a new duty upon the NHS formally to notify a local authority in cases where it looks likely that an individual will not be able to be safely discharged from hospital unless community care services are provided to him or her. We know that the earlier discharge planning begins the more successful the discharge will be, so we shall be stating in official guidance that that notification should take place as soon as the patient is admitted to hospital for emergency admissions and prior to admission for elective admissions.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para15"></a>Under Clause 3, once the local authority has been notified of a patient's case by the NHS, it will, in consultation with the NHS, carry out an assessment of the patient's needs and determine what community care services the patient will need in order to be safely discharged. As I said, the duty to assess the patient's needs is not new. The aim is to improve information flows and assessment procedures so that the NHS informs the local authority as early as possible that an individual may need services upon discharge and the local authority immediately acts upon that notification. That is vital. At the moment around a fifth of delays are due to patients waiting for the completion of an assessment of their future care. At the moment, in some cases the hospital may not even tell the local authority that it has a patient who may need community care services until just a few hours before the proposed time of discharge.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para16"></a>We have also taken the opportunity in Clause 3 to place a new, reciprocal duty upon the NHS to carry out its assessment of the patient's needs in consultation with the local authority. That will benefit the patient because it will ensure that he or she has the complete package of care that he or she needs without any gaps in services. It will benefit the local authority and the NHS because it will lead to improved communication and greater partnership as they work together to determine what is best in the interests of the patient. Under the clause the NHS must also provide the local authority with a formal notice of the proposed day of the patient's discharge. We shall use regulations to state that that must be given at least 24 hours before 9 a.m. on the proposed discharge date to ensure that the local authority has enough time to put the necessary services in place.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para17"></a>Clause 4 of the Bill introduces the financial incentive for local authorities to carry out promptly an assessment of the patient and to put services in place. The local authority will have at least two clear days in which to carry out an assessment of the patient's needs and to put services in place. However, in most cases it <P>


<a name="column_922"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 922</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will have more time than that because, on past figures, approximately 70 per cent of patients over 65 who are emergency admissions&#151;the group most likely to be delayed&#151;will spend longer than three days in hospital. Therefore, in the majority of cases, the local authority, together with the NHS, will have longer than the minimum to continue planning.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para18"></a> If, by the end of the pre-notified day of discharge, the patient cannot be discharged because the local authority has not carried out an assessment or because the social services needed to discharge him or her are not available, the local authority will be required to make a payment to the NHS for each day that the patient is delayed in order to reimburse the NHS for the costs of providing bed, board and personal care to a patient who should be the responsibility of social services. It will be required to make a payment only where the reason for a delay is that community care services are not in place. If NHS services are also not available, the charge will not apply. I believe that it is completely fair to expect local authorities to meet their responsibilities and where they fail to do so to make a payment to the NHS in that way. We have provided them with the funding to put in place the services and capacity needed to avoid delays, and they also need to live up to their side of the bargain. I do not believe that the NHS should pay the price for local authorities' failure.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para19"></a>I return to the point I made at the beginning of my speech. The Bill is not just about placing an incentive on local authorities. The NHS has responsibilities too. There are many cases where the NHS is responsible for creating the delay because it does not have effective discharge practices and procedures in place. Perhaps I can give an example of one area where consultants used to do a weekly ward round at which decisions to discharge were made with the unbelievable result that some patients had to wait an extra seven days before the decision to discharge was made. The contents of the Bill will be as tough on the NHS as on local government in relation to sorting out its act and ensuring that robust procedures are in place. In effect, the Bill will force local authorities and the NHS to look at how they handle their discharges and to put formal systems in place to deal with them. That alone will make an enormous difference to the numbers who currently experience delay.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para20"></a>Some consider it unfair that there is a financial incentive placed upon local authorities but not upon the NHS. The NHS already has considerable incentives to tackle delayed discharge because it is the NHS that loses out from the delay&#151;both financially and because of reduced ability to meet its access targets. The NHS will also be judged for its star ratings on performance with respect to delayed discharge.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para21"></a>The intention is to introduce a financial incentive only in that part of the system where we believe that it will have a genuinely beneficial effect, rather than simply for its own sake.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para22"></a> In Part 2 of the Bill, the purpose of Clause 12 is to make the provision of intermediate care and community equipment services free of charge. <P>


<a name="column_923"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 923</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Charging often stands in the way of service integration and patients wait too long for the care they need. Delayed discharges rise too. We want to break that cycle. With charging removed, it will be easier to arrange packages of intermediate care with inputs from health and social services, or a piece of equipment from a joint equipment store. Clause 12 will remove one of the last barriers to integration and should contribute to reduced hospital discharge.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para23"></a>The new powers are general in scope but specific in intent. Clause 13 means that it will be for the National Assembly for Wales to decide how independently of England to exercise the new power. The only limitation to the powers applying to both England and Wales is that accommodation under the National Assistance Act 1948 and personal care, including to carers, may only be provided free for up to six weeks.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para24"></a>The Bill is not intended to penalise local authorities, as has been suggested by some. It is intended to create a genuine incentive for them to use the funding increases that they have been given as we intended&#151;to put a wide range of services and capacity in place for older people in the community. It is also just as much about placing new responsibilities on the NHS to ensure that it notifies local authorities in good time and works in partnership with them to effect prompt and effective discharge.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para25"></a>The Bill represents an important opportunity to ensure that the money invested in older people's services results in older persons having more choice about where they go when they leave hospital. It will bring an end to thousands of older people suffering needlessly each day as they wait in an acute hospital bed. The Bill deserves the support of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew18"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has&#151;as always&#151;presented a clear and helpful analysis&#151;and for that I readily thank him. Regrettably, however, today is not one for rejoicing. It would have been pleasant for me to welcome the content of the Bill, not just its exposition, but the most I can say is that Part 2 will not cause us to fall out.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para27"></a>Part 1, however, is so fundamentally misconceived that I tend to feel that there is no help for it. At one time I was tempted to table a Motion to defeat the Bill on Second Reading. With some reluctance I concluded that that would have been wrong, bearing in mind the customs and practice of the House. I did feel, however, it right to express my deep reservations about the Bill in the form of an amendment to the Second Reading Motion. In doing so, I align myself fully with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones&#151;whose amendment takes precedence over mine.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para28"></a>The fact that my party and the Liberal Democrats are united in opposition to the measure is a reflection not of party politics but of a united opposition in the country at large. This is not a party issue. After all, the Bill is designed to tackle a feature of our health and <P>


<a name="column_924"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 924</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>social care system that everyone agrees is wasteful and damaging; namely, the undue delay that patients often suffer before being able to leave hospital for a more appropriate care setting. The Minister told us that on any one day about 5,000 beds are unnecessarily occupied in that way. It would be wonderful to hit upon a formula or remedy that would solve the problem at a stroke&#151;a problem that, not surprisingly, affects elderly patients more than younger ones.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para29"></a>When someone is fit to leave hospital, it does that person no favours to be left in hospital when they could be looked after at home or in residential care. The longer an elderly person stays in hospital, the more their confidence dwindles and the less accustomed they become to ordinary life. At the same time, other patients in need of that same acute bed have to wait longer. If at the last minute the bed is not available, they may even find that their operation has been cancelled. For the hospital itself, a blocked bed&#151;if I may use that rather insensitive expression&#151;is a serious waste of resources.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para30"></a>One of the Government's achievements, for which I give them full credit, has been to encourage hospitals and local authorities to work in partnership in an effort to minimise delays in discharging patients. In many parts of the country those partnership arrangements have worked well for a number of years. There is no doubt that best practice and a spirit of co-operation are more and more in evidence.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para31"></a>From the statistics, it is striking that not only is the number of people waiting to leave hospital on any one day coming down but also fewer people are waiting for a lengthy period. Of course there is still a long way to go. Even now, more than one third of people who suffer a delayed discharge wait for more than one month. That is unacceptable. Equally unacceptable is the rising number of patients who are discharged prematurely, then readmitted soon after as emergency cases.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para32"></a>Among the root causes of delayed discharges, one above all stands out. That is the current lack of capacity in the care home sector. Estimates vary as to the number of care home beds lost since the Government came to office. The most authoritative indicator is that of Laing and Buisson, who found that more than 60,000 places in long-stay residential settings disappeared between 1997 and 2002&#151;14,000 of those in the past year alone.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para33"></a>That decline has occurred at the very time when the key population group most in need of social care&#151;the over-80s&#151;has been rising. The average level of occupancy in care homes for the elderly is currently over 90 per cent. Some parts of the country, especially southern England, are experiencing an acute shortage of care home places, not only as a result of closures but because London boroughs are able to purchase places outside their own areas at top rates.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para34"></a>The closing down of care homes is a subject that the House has debated on a number of occasions, so I do not intend to take up time today reiterating my diatribe against Government policies that have brought about that situation. The key point in the <P>


<a name="column_925"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 925</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>context of the Bill is that to penalise a local authority for its failure to find a care home place is to blame it for something that is almost inevitably beyond its control.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para35"></a>In Sweden, where the policy apparently originated, there is no shortage of capacity in the care home sector&#151;which, in the main, is publicly owned. In the UK, the care home sector is a diverse mix of private and public. There are simply not the same levers for a local authority to pull to ensure that the right care home place is available when needed. It is not clear, either, that the Swedish experience has been entirely happy. Both in absolute terms and in proportion to its population, Sweden still has more people blocking hospital beds than does the UK. That alone should cause the Government to think again as to whether their policy will actually work.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para36"></a>But other more serious considerations should have instilled doubt. The Government believe in partnership. What happens to a partnership when one partner is issued with a gun and told to fire it at the other? To move from a situation in which trusts and social services co-operate in a common cause to one where trusts have the whip hand over social services and can exercise it with impunity is a recipe for conflict. It moves diametrically against the flow of recent policy designed to cultivate joint working.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para37"></a>Joint working will not disappear, of course, but instead of being creative it will be confrontational. Sometimes it is not easy for two organisations to build up a relationship of trust, but it is easy for that trust to be broken. I have no doubt that some hospital managers, given the opportunity, will decide to put their own budgets before the interests of external partners.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para38"></a>The Bill will foster a claims culture between two arms of the public service. One has to ask whether that is healthy or constructive: I do not believe that it is. We should not underestimate the extent to which local authorities whose budgets are stretched to the ultimate will wish to dispute and contest the payments imposed on them. The threat of such penalties will undoubtedly skew the day-to-day priorities of social services. An elderly person living at home in need of domiciliary care will take second place to an elderly person waiting to be discharged from hospital who is also in need of domiciliary care. The threat of financial penalties will create an imperative to find the hospital patient a place to go before others have a look in. It may not be the right place or the best place.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para39"></a>That will, in turn, lead to a certain culture. We will move from services centred on the needs and wishes of patients to a situation in which the patient becomes a parcel or commodity to be shifted from here to there, so long as he does not continue to occupy a hospital bed. The patient's voice and choice may no longer influence the care setting selected. The Bill says nothing about the right of patients to be consulted on what happens to them.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para40"></a>The Minister may believe it is harsh to call the Bill dehumanising, but I do not think so. It opens up all kinds of questions; for example, patient confidentiality. The Bill contains no rules or criteria <P>


<a name="column_926"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 926</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>governing the way in which a referral to social services should be made; the consent of the patient would be a good start. But what happens when the patient finds out&#151;as he will&#151;that the hospital wants rid of him and that he represents a liability to the local taxpayer?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para41"></a>Not all patients are assertive about their wishes. I dare say we all know people who adopt a stoical approach to life. It is not hard to imagine an elderly person, who is made aware that every day he or she is occupying a hospital bed will mean a fine for social services, deciding that they do not want to be a nuisance to anyone and agreeing to go wherever they are told. The Bill brings no benefit to such people if they find themselves discharged into the wrong setting.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para42"></a>It is not a satisfactory answer to say "Ah well, there is always the local authority complaints procedure". Making a complaint after one has been shunted out to somewhere unsuitable is no substitute for being able to exercise an element of choice in the first instance. Many elderly people will find making a complaint far too daunting and will simply not do so. We will find patients being moved to any old care home as a temporary expedient and then being moved on again; or else having to stay permanently somewhere they do not like. It is in these subtle ways that the dehumanising effects of the Bill will be felt.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para43"></a> All this presupposes that a system of financial penalties&#151;or "incentives" in the new speak of the Bill&#151;will reduce the incidence of delayed discharges. The example of Sweden should suggest that there is a limit to how effective such a mechanism can be. But the shortage of care home capacity means that there is another dimension to the policy; it will create unintended perverse incentives. If a GP is looking for a care home for his patient and is unable to find one, the obvious thing will be to refer the patient to hospital. The problem will no longer be his, but the local authority's. That is not a fanciful hypothesis. The net result will be more hospital beds that are blocked, not fewer.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para44"></a>A further perverse incentive will arise for care home owners. In a suppliers' market, with local authorities managing tight budgets, the existence of penalties will enable some care home owners to hold social services to ransom by ratcheting up their weekly charges. It will be cheaper for the local authority to pay up than to pay the fine. The existence of the fines is therefore unlikely in itself to act as a spur to the one thing we need, which is the creation of additional capacity in the system. It will simply be a spur to inflation and a drain on resources.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para45"></a> That is just one way in which a system of financial penalties risks distorting the market. It would of course be helpful if the new money that has been promised to social services next year were to enable them to launch an expansion of home care services. However, regrettably, that is not likely, at least not to any great degree: the number of households receiving community care has gone down quite sharply in recent years, so there is a great deal of ground to make up at a time when the recruitment and retention of care workers is almost intractably difficult.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para46"></a>What we have in this Bill is someone's bright idea for tackling a single symptom of a problem that is much wider than blocked beds in hospital. The Bill does nothing to address inappropriate admissions to hospital&#151;in fact, as I suggested, it may exacerbate them. It does nothing to promote preventive care, which is one of the key ways to help keep elderly people out of hospital in the first instance. I am a paid-up fan of two rather unsung professions: chiropody and physiotherapy. I am convinced that investing in those areas would reap dividends far in excess of any that are likely to emerge from re-erecting barriers between the NHS and local government. Certainly, we should aim to try to spread best practice in hospital discharge procedures, but do not let us imagine that this Bill will help to do that.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para47"></a> It is depressing to have to be so negative about a Bill whose origins, I am sure, are well-intentioned. But it cannot be allowed to pass through this House without the severest of protests. No group of people whom it directly affects will gain from it: not patients, not social services, and not the NHS&#151;despite the extra money that may flow to it. I await the speeches of other noble Lords with interest, but I hope it is not too late for the Government to recognise a poorly thought-through idea when they see one and withdraw this measure before it has the chance to do any damage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew19"></A><B> The Lord Clement-Jones </B>   rose to move, as an amendment to the Motion that this Bill be now read a second time, at end to insert "but this House regrets that the Bill fails to tackle the causes of delayed discharges of patients from hospitals, creates perverse incentives which will undermine joint working between local authorities and the National Health Service, and will distort priorities for care of elderly people by placing the requirement to meet discharge targets ahead of measures to avoid hospital admission".
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para48"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I join the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in thanking the Minister for his succinct introduction. I did not feel it had his usual enthusiasm, but perhaps I am reading into his speech something that did not exist&#151;perhaps I should hope that it did not have his usual enthusiasm.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para49"></a>In the Bill we have yet another product from the hyperactive Secretary of State for Health's department of bright ideas. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, mentioned, the model adopted in the Bill hails from Sweden, yet the Swedish system operates completely differently, with responsibilities for health and social care allocated in very different ways to very different bodies.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para50"></a>Furthermore, the evidence is that the Swedish model has actually worsened relationships between municipalities and county councils, which run the hospitals. As it is, 6 per cent of Sweden's acute beds are apparently still blocked despite the reforms. But the Government have such faith in their health tourism experience that no pilot scheme is planned in the UK. <P>


<a name="column_928"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 928</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>In sum, the Government clearly think that the solution set out in the Bill is like a piece of flat pack furniture that can be bought in Sweden and reassembled here without modification.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para51"></a>The timing planned for the introduction of the Bill ensures the maximum penalty on local government. The increase in funding of 6 per cent to social services announced last year will not have flowed through into improved or new services by this spring. At the very least, pilots should be conducted and implementation delayed across the rest of the country until 2004.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para52"></a> The dangers of the Government's approach are enormous. Their own figures show clearly that taxpayers' money is being wasted in ever greater sums on readmitting the elderly to NHS beds. During the past two years, there has been an increase of 19 per cent in emergency readmissions to hospital within 28 days of discharge. Figures from the second quarter of 2002 show that 8 per cent of people aged 75 and over are now being readmitted within 28 days of discharge.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para53"></a>Delayed discharge figures are running at about 5,000 patients at any one time. As both the Health Select Committee and Wanless reports highlighted, that is due to a major loss of beds in residential and private nursing homes between 1997 and 2001. The Government do not like the Laing and Buisson figures cited by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, so let me put the Wanless figure to them. Wanless estimates the total at 25,700. However, it is only this year that the Government have committed to above-inflation increases for social services to address that crisis.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para54"></a>Allied to that is a great shortage of occupational therapists&#151;15 per cent&#151;who are so necessary to the discharge process. The Government have finally come up with increased funding for social care that will start to match the rise in NHS funding, but it is doubtful that that increase will be enough to make up for past underfunding. It is hardly surprising that in those circumstances, coming on top of that major care bed crisis, the Bill has generated something akin to panic in both the NHS and social services.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para55"></a>The catalogue of problems with the Bill is long. As the Wanless report said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"targets must be used with care, especially in a service as complex as the NHS. In particular, they must be designed to minimize the risk of creating perverse incentives".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para56"></a>
But the Bill will by its nature create a series of perverse incentives. It will mean that the quickest way to get care will be to get admitted to hospital. Social services may concentrate more on those who are in hospital, rather than on those who are at home. More people may therefore try to get admitted because that will be the route to get a fast initial assessment.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para57"></a>NHS trusts will also take the risk of readmission by discharging early, which may lead to more emergency readmissions. The Bill may encourage the simplest residential home solution rather than the more complex home-based solution. There may be pressure to move into second-best residential care if a place is available, rather than wait for a more suitable care home.
<P>


<a name="column_929"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 929</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para58"></a> As a result of the Bill, social services will prioritise NHS patients over those in hospices, because of potential fines, so the former will be assessed urgently and will benefit from quicker service on home adaptations. We have already had plaintive briefings from the hospice movement, which says that it wants to be included in the Bill because of its fears in that respect.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para59"></a>A further, central criticism of the Bill is that it sets up a blame game between the NHS and local government. The arrangements will be carried out in a punitive, blaming spirit, not one of partnership and collaboration. They tear up the slow and painful progress made in the Health Act 1999 and the Health and Social Care Act 2001 from joint working through to partnership arrangements and care trusts. The Government used to talk of tearing down the Berlin Wall between health and social care. Now we have the equivalent of the reintroduction of Checkpoint Charlie by the same Ministers.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para60"></a>Voluntary and statutory sectors are unanimous in their view that the Bill will do massive damage to joint working. Even before the Bill's details were available, the Select Committee warned:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "There are real risks that perverse incentives will be created that will undermine partnerships that have taken time to develop, and foster an unproductive culture of buck passing and mutual blame between health and social care. We agree that appropriate incentives have a role to play, but we would also urge the development of positive incentives that reward good practice, rather than any precipitate and over-zealous emphasis on penalties. We recommend that any new scheme should be subject to piloting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para61"></a>
How true.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para62"></a>Despite what the Minister said, the sanctions for failure set out in the Bill are totally one-sided. There are no sanctions on the NHS. The Bill unfairly shifts all the blame to local government. Even the Minister, in his briefings to Members of the House, admitted that that is not how to approach the situation. The Government first claimed that local government would be able to cope with the 6 per cent increase and then announced that £100 million extra would be given to local government. But in another place, the Minister, Jacqui Smith, admitted that there had been no consultation on whether that £100 million was adequate. It seems to be based on some spurious calculation of an estimated 4,200 delayed discharges. I wonder whether the Minister can clarify that.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para63"></a> Furthermore, the £100 million, if levied in fines, will go in entirely the wrong direction. The fines will be a drain on local government resources, not directed to creating more capacity in social care. Money spent on fines should go to those needing social care, not to the NHS. At the very least, it should go to primary care trusts and should be applied only following consultation between health and social care stakeholders. To cap it all, under the Bill the dispute procedure between the NHS and social services will not be independently conducted but will be under the aegis of strategic health authorities.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para64"></a>However, for me, the key problem with the Bill is that is puts beds before patients. It sets up the potential for trench warfare between relatives, patients and <P>


<a name="column_930"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 930</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>NHS acute trusts. This is not some disagreement between Opposition parties and the Government on the niceties of a bureaucratic solution to a problem. It involves the fundamental issue of patients' rights. Vulnerable people may be kicked out of hospital to fulfil a Government target, not because they are well enough to leave or will receive appropriate care. Harrowing cases are already coming to light in which inappropriate pressure has been placed on patients to ensure early discharge.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para65"></a> It is well known that early discharge from acute care settings can have ill-effects on older people or the terminally ill. The Hospital Discharge Workbook, a revised version of which will, I believe, be available today, may set out the procedures for discharge, but it does not set out the circumstances in which a patient is considered fit for discharge. The definition of eligibility for discharge is crucial, but can be specified by each acute trust. Without provision for proper consultation of patients and carers, the procedure for disputes on discharge, with appeal to continuing care panels, will become ever more frequently invoked. I fear that patients and carers will have to become legalistic entirely as a result of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para66"></a>The Bill even runs counter to the National Service Framework for Older People, which states that older people must be treated as individuals and enabled to make choices about their care. I see none of that in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para67"></a>As for assessment under the Bill, it is clear that there is no time for comprehensive assessment while patients are in an NHS hospital; there will be only a partial assessment. The Bill will disrupt progress towards the single assessment process between health and social care envisaged by the NHS Plan, which stated that a single assessment process was meant to come into universal effect in 2004. Older people need good care provided at home or a good care home. It is imperative that there is a clear statement of rights of patients and carers and that they have the right to a single assessment process within a set time. The Bill provides neither.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para68"></a>Let me emphasise once again that my criticisms are not criticisms derived only from these Benches. The common theme among all those involved in this field is that the Government have not listened to any alternative. Let us look at some of the responses to the Government's consultation document issued in July 2002. One hundred per cent felt that April 2003 was too soon for implementation of the Bill; all felt that three days for putting together a care plan was unrealistic if patients and carers were always to be involved; 77 per cent of respondents believed that reimbursement proposals could damage partnerships.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para69"></a> Those are substantial criticisms with substantial support. But does the Secretary of State take any notice of that consultation? What is the point of consultation if the Secretary of State takes no notice? It always seems that the Secretary of State knows better. Yet there is massive agreement between the Association of Directors of Social Services, the NHS Confederation and the Local Government <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Association on alternatives. They want to see a whole systems approach which looks across the board at the care of older people and does not simply concentrate on delayed discharge. In particular it includes preventive services.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para70"></a>The Wanless report, coming with the seal of approval of the Treasury, talked of whole systems modelling to provide better understanding of the interaction between health and social care. "ithink" is the whole systems model being put forward by local government, health service managers and social services directors. It involves joint local protocols and local action plans prepared in co-operation. Yet in another place the Minister, Jacqui Smith, cast doubt on all this in her anxiety to make the argument for the Bill. The Government have not even listened to the Chief Inspector of Social Services. As we often find to be the case, there are also lessons to be drawn from Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para71"></a> In conclusion, this Bill puts a price on patients' heads. The Government are turning vulnerable older people into commodities to be haggled over by the NHS and social services. Fining social services for delayed discharges is a simplistic solution to a complex problem. Our view is that the Bill in summary does not tackle the fundamental problems of delayed discharges. It creates perverse incentives. It will undermine joint working between the NHS and local authorities and will distort priorities for the care of older people.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para72"></a>When this Government were in opposition, the Labour Party bitterly criticised arbitrary mechanisms like the internal market. But this Bill is creating a far worse monster which will be far more divisive to health and social care. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="30127-03_para74"></a>Any scheme that reduces the number of delayed discharges from hospitals, particularly acute hospitals, should be welcomed because more patients can then be admitted for essential treatment. Reducing delayed discharges will also reduce the cost of caring for older people who no longer need hospital treatment. The local authority, through its social services, is responsible for putting in place the community care needed by older patients in order that they can be safely discharged from hospital.
<P>


<a name="column_932"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 932</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para75"></a>Through this Bill the Government aim to reduce the number of delayed discharges affecting older people by a system of reimbursement whereby a local authority makes a payment&#151;in reality a fine&#151;to the healthcare provider, usually a hospital. The Bill also provides the power to remove, in circumstances set out in regulations, local authorities' power to charge for certain community services. The Bill makes no mention of any measures to prevent the admission of older people into our hospitals, or to their readmission.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para76"></a>The care of older people in the community requires partnership between local councils and the NHS, as emphasised by the Minister and by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. But the scheme described in this Bill could undermine existing local partnerships by creating financial and practical barriers. Social services are liable to make a payment amounting to £120 per day in London and £100 per day elsewhere in England and Wales for every older person whose discharge is delayed. That payment will be seen as the penalty for social services failing to make or complete the assessment and for failing to provide the community service they decided was necessary.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para77"></a>The NHS trust must give formal notice that a patient is likely to need community care on discharge from hospital. Social services must then assess the patient and determine what community care is needed. Social services have a minimum of three days to carry out an assessment once the NHS trust notifies it of the day of the patient's discharge. After that period social services have to pay a fine for the delayed discharge.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para78"></a> It does not take much imagination to realise how easy it will be for disputes to arise between the NHS trust and social services. My first question is therefore to ask what steps have been recommended to prevent disputes from arising and what mechanism will be in place to deal rapidly with disputes between NHS bodies and local authority social services in order that disputed delayed discharges do not take more than two weeks to resolve.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para79"></a>In order to strengthen local partnerships between the NHS and social services, a preparatory period is needed to ensure adequate numbers of social workers are available to respond to assessments for the discharge of older people from hospital. In many local authorities there continues to be a 20 per cent unfilled vacancy for social workers. The Bill will add pressure to an already understaffed service.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para80"></a>In order to reduce delayed discharges, adequate nursing home beds in the community should be available as one important measure. In Wirral, for example, so many local authority and private care homes have closed in the past five years that there is now a shortage of accommodation. In addition, intermediate care facilities are poorly developed. Equipment for older people with chronic conditions and disability to help them live at home in the community is another essential. But such equipment is currently in short supply as we cope with an increasingly older population.
<P>


<a name="column_933"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 933</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para81"></a>The Government have decreed that the reimbursement scheme should be implemented from April this year&#151;less than three months away. By comparison, as mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, when a similar scheme was introduced in Sweden a two-year preparation period was in place. I therefore ask my second question: should not more time be given to local authorities to ensure community care provision is adequate for older people before this Bill and the penalties to be paid are introduced?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para82"></a>Finally, the money paid by social services under the reimbursement scheme will go to the NHS hospital where the patient's discharge is delayed. There is no guarantee that the money will be used to improve services for older people. There is a suspicion that it will go to cover the increased costs of general hospital services. Would it not be better to give the money to PCTs to improve community services for older people?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para83"></a>The Government have announced the allocation of £100 million every year for three years from the NHS budget to social services to help fund this scheme. However, the total annual cost of 5,000 patients&#151;the number currently involved in delayed discharges&#151;is estimated to be £180 million. At worst, the scheme could become a perverse incentive so that delayed discharges from hospital do not become a priority to be tackled, particularly if partnerships within the NHS and local authorities break down. It may be more convenient to pay the fine and keep the patient in hospital rather than increase expensive home and community-based services in districts where older people form a substantial part of the population, as in Wirral.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para84"></a>Finally, I ask the Minister to make a statement about money generated by the scheme being used to improve services and equipment for older people in the community. I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones.

In the course of the Second Reading debate there on 28th November, there was general acknowledgement that this Bill addressed a real and pressing problem of bed-blocking in acute hospital wards. I need to declare a non-direct interest as my wife is a non-executive director of an acute hospital trust. She knows all about blocked beds and the problems they create for the trust.

<P>

<a name="30127-03_para92"></a>Honourable Members would say that, wouldn't they, because they were speaking from the Opposition and Liberal Democrat Benches in another place. However, sharp criticisms were also levelled at the Bill from the Government's own Benches. The Secretary of the Church of England Board for Social Responsibility has called it an "appalling Bill".
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para93"></a>I have a strong sense of deja vu. I am reminded of the Animal Health Bill. There was a real and acknowledged problem, but the Government tried to tackle it with a Bill that was provocative, punitive and divisive. Here, once again, we have a nasty little Bill which really ought to be stopped, but at the very least will need to be amended. Therefore, I gladly support the Motion in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, regretting only that it did not go further. I would have been glad to see it echoing more fully the Early Day Motion put down on 5th December by Mr Paul Burstow in another place. I quote it because it seems to me to summarise ideally what is wrong with the Bill:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That this House believes that the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Bill proposes simplistic measures that fail to address adequately a complex problem; further believes that the Bill treats a symptom rather than tackling the cause, which is a failure of successive governments to invest in community-based services to prevent admissions and support people after discharge; regrets that the Bill will undermine partnerships between health and social care; deplores the Bill's failure to take note of the needs of the patient or the concerns of the carers; believes that it will give rise to an increase in emergency readmissions of older people; notes with concern that the Bill will distort priorities for the care of the elderly and create perverse incentives by placing the need to hit delayed discharge targets ahead of offering timely and appropriate care to those in their own homes".

<a name="30127-03_para95"></a>If the outspoken criticisms of the Bill that I have just quoted may be dismissed as coming from the fevered brains of party politicians, the chorus of condemnation from a very wide range of highly responsible professional organisations simply cannot be ignored.

<a name="30127-03_para96"></a>The Association of Directors of Social Services, the NHS Confederation and the Local Government Association joined together to issue a statement. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Real progress has been made in forging partnerships between health and local government . . . It would be a retrograde step if the current proposals undermined the trust and led to the development of adversarial relationships rather than co-operation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para97"></a>
There is a clear implication that there is a serious danger of that happening if the Bill is passed.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para98"></a>The Royal College of Nursing remains unconvinced that charging social services for delayed discharges from hospitals will lead to better discharge practice. The British Medical Association is opposed to imposing immediate penalties on social service departments which have been faced with historical underfunding. The move could distort decisions taken by social services departments, influenced by the need to avoid fines, with funds diverted from "non-fineable" areas such as children's services and services for the disabled and people with learning difficulties. Therefore, the BMA is asking at least for some delay and for some kind of pilot scheme. It points to the real risk that money will be taken away from other areas simply to avoid the fines that will be imposed for social services not receiving patients discharged from hospital.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para99"></a>The BMA also points to a seldom-recognised aspect of early discharge simply to release blocked beds, which is that 17 per cent of elderly people currently living in nursing homes no longer need nursing care. The decision to admit to a nursing home may have been prematurely made before it was known how far rehabilitation could go. That argues for constant monitoring and review of what the needs of elderly people really are and for the provision of an adequate range of care home places offering a variety of levels of care.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para100"></a>It has already been pointed out that the statistics for the reduction in the number of such places in care homes are alarming. There was a rapid and fairly unplanned increase during the 1980s, but in recent years there have been dramatic reductions, including a net loss of what I calculate to be 12,800 places in 2001 alone&#151;and that in the context of a rapidly growing population of old people. It is vital to see the whole picture. This Bill addresses one part of what is a huge problem with many interrelated issues.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para101"></a>Concentrating on delayed discharges avoids looking at the whole picture. It is as though we were looking at a jigsaw puzzle with various bits missing. The Government have found one piece of jigsaw which does not quite fit any of the gaps and they are pretending that forcing that piece into one of the holes will somehow do the job as a substitute for a painstaking and thorough organising of all the missing and misplaced pieces.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para102"></a>There are upstream and downstream questions. Why do so many old people go into hospital? It is frequently because of a serious lack of preventive care, <P>


<a name="column_936"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 936</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sometimes in the simplest areas; for example, a failure to ensure that they have adequate heating or a failure to reinstate presently non-existent home help services. Such services can do so much to keep people at home, stop them deteriorating in health and stop them reaching the point at which they have to be admitted. That kind of simple action could avoid admission to an acute ward.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para103"></a>There are downstream questions, too, about convalescence, follow-up, proper post-hospital care and the whole care pathway. In introducing the Bill, the Minister mentioned that and made some encouraging comments about an attempt to see a slightly wider picture. The trouble is that the Bill as it stands does nothing but address this one particular issue. Financial incentives to discharge people even sooner, in the absence of a total-care package, will add to the problems of readmissions. There were 500,000 readmissions in one single year. It is hardly believable. But if there is further pressure to discharge patients, how many more will there be? And what will that do to the people who are readmitted, having had a great deal more pain and anxiety meanwhile? It is medical and financial nonsense. Worst of all, it is pastorally insensitive and profoundly unkind. It ignores the real well-being of elderly people. As has already been said, it treats them as commodities and as financial liabilities to be shunted around. It is contemptuous of the interests of carers.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para104"></a>My Lords, there must be a warm welcome for the promise of better funding for social services and for the provisions of Clause 12 of this Bill. But it remains deeply unsatisfactory in its present form. It addresses one aspect of a hugely complicated area of care. As we have already heard, it derives, in part, from one aspect of Swedish practice, not fully understood nor related to its own context. It then parachutes this into the United Kingdom system, where, like a piece in a jigsaw puzzle, it just does not fit. Far from encouraging or enabling growth in co-operation and an harmonious partnership, which we all wish to see, it introduces a concept from the criminal law&#151;the concept of the fine. It does not hold out the prospect of a better deal for vulnerable and anxious elderly people, whose needs deserve to be much more imaginatively and sympathetically met. It will encourage suspicion, hostility and confrontation from all the hard-pressed professionals having to cope with this on top of everything else.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para105"></a>I hope that there will be very strong support for the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and for further amendments which will be needed at Committee stage.

<A NAME="30127-03_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   My Lords, improving hospital discharge procedures has always been very close to my heart. In the mid-1970s I wrote a book entitled When I Went Home which detailed the experience of older people when they were discharged from acute wards. I well remember some of the experiences of those interviewed: "They only gave me 10 minutes' notice"; "They told me that I was fit to go <P>


<a name="column_937"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 937</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>home but I knew I wasn't and was back in two days"; "They left me at the gate in a snowstorm", are some of the more memorable comments that I remember from that book.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para106"></a>Over the years I have revisited those experiences, especially in my work with carers, and the story has been depressingly familiar: lack of notice, lack of planning, no consultation with either patients or their families, lack of communication with general practitioners and, above all, the lack of a co-ordinated approach between health and social services. Furthermore, we are all aware of the very distressing number of readmissions that take place because discharge was not properly planned.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para107"></a>The solutions which everyone has agreed upon over the years have also been depressingly familiar, and we have never had any problems agreeing on them: discharge planning must start on or before admissions, the needs of both carers and patients must be properly assessed, information must be exchanged in good time and communication between agencies is vital.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para108"></a>It is my impression and that of many other people, too, I believe, that things have got better in recent years. I speak here not only as a professional but also as a long-term patient on an acute ward. I do believe that some improvements have been made. With the advent of computer-held patient records, it is now common to consider the discharge plan when the patient is being admitted. That would have been unheard of hitherto. The much quoted Berlin Wall which always existed between the NHS and social services departments is, in many areas, a thing of the past. Pooled budgets and agreed care packages have gained momentum. Integrated care trusts are another very helpful development.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para109"></a>Clearly, there are still some consultants who swoop down on a ward on a Friday afternoon and declare the patient not only fit but essential for discharge. However they are very many fewer than they used to be. I am particularly glad to note that the discharge workbook about which I have been asking for some time, has now been updated and reissued today. The Government are to be congratulated on that.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para110"></a>However, there are still some pockets of resistance to proper discharge planning. There are, we know, some 5,000 patients occupying hospital beds when they should be discharged to more suitable care. I am in favour of anything which tackles that. I say that not from the point of view of saving money for either the NHS or local authorities, but because I know only too well how easy it is to become institutionalised in a hospital bed. It is tempting for any person, old or young&#151;and I speak from personal experience&#151;to settle back into that hospital bed and that hospital routine. They then lose, in an amazingly short time&#151;amazingly short&#151;the ability to manage outside in a setting which will enable independence not dependence.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para111"></a>So I do not start from the premise that the Bill is necessarily bad. Indeed, I find elements in it to praise. Your Lordships will not be surprised to know that some of these concern carers. The original drafting of <P>


<a name="column_938"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 938</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Bill left out any mention of carers. That was of grave concern to Carers UK as research has shown many times, that carers bear the brunt of poor hospital discharge procedures. The issue was consistently raised with the Government and on Report in another place the Government amended the Bill in two vital ways. Part 1 was amended to improve carers' rights upon hospital discharge so that they are assessed if they ask, and carers' services, needed to ensure the patient is safe for discharge, are put in place before discharge.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para112"></a>Part 2 was also amended to ensure that, following discharge, certain carer services would be free of charge for a limited period of time, in the same way as disabled and older people's services would be free. Carers UK has warmly welcomed these amendments. They not only improve the rights of carers, but move closer towards ensuring that carers are an integral part, rather than an ignored part, of the hospital discharge process. I should like to pay tribute to the officers and Ministers who worked so hard on these amendments.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para113"></a>The amendments are an important step forward towards ensuring that the assessment is holistic, both in looking at the needs of the disabled or older person, and the carer. They should ensure that carers are assessed quickly at the right time; that their needs for services are considered; and&#151;this is an important development&#151;that services are put in place before discharge. The original drafting of the Bill omitted any reference to carers' services but we very much welcome the amendments which now ensure that certain community care services provided following discharge will be made free for a limited period of time. I am sure that your Lordships will agree that that is essential since carers already save the state an estimated £57 billion annually.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para114"></a>I want also to celebrate the acknowledgement that has been given to the great improvements which have been made in the relationship between the NHS and social services in recent years. I believe that that relationship has been transformed in terms of understanding and co-operation. It is entirely because of those improved relationships that this Bill will apply, we are assured, to so few people. Commitment and partnership working, which these agencies have shown, is very much to be praised.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para115"></a>I turn now to my concerns about the Bill which I want not only to flag up but to suggest ways in which they could be overcome. My first concern, as many other noble Lords have said, is that the Bill may have the effect of influencing negatively the very much improved relationship between health and social services which I have just welcomed. I know that that is not the Government's intention, but I am concerned lest it happen by default.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para116"></a> Secondly, there may not be enough choice for older people and families at a very important point in their lives because the timescale suggested is so short. I understand the reasons for this but I worry that unsuitable decisions will be made simply because of the short timescale.
<P>


<a name="column_939"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 939</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para117"></a>That also links with my concerns about the outstanding issues for carers. As carers still have to ask for an assessment, with the exception of those who requested an assessment in the previous 12 months, they will need to know their rights before they can exercise them. Legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland has placed a duty on local authorities and health trusts to inform carers of their right to an assessment. I believe it is vital to ensure that carers are aware of their rights. I hope that the Minister will be able to acknowledge that making carers aware of their rights is part of the Government's intention.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para118"></a>My concerns could be addressed by placing more emphasis on the fact that this is an NHS as well as a local authority problem. Again, I know that it is not the Government's intention to say that. But the presentation of the Bill thus far has been unfortunate and I am glad to hear the Minister's reassurance that it is a mutual problem. If we emphasise that, it will go a long way towards continuing the development of the co-operation which is now so excellent in many areas, while encouraging areas in which it is not so good to tackle what should be seen as a mutual problem. I certainly do not wish to see the fining element become a cause of suspicion and lack of trust between agencies.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para119"></a>In that regard, increased budgets for social services departments are especially welcome. We must monitor very carefully how the money is spent. We must ensure that it is spent on discharge services and not on extra bureaucracy, a risk run by any new system. Of course we need good systems of paperwork&#151;or, more likely, better computer communication&#151;between agencies, but we must ensure that the money is spent on services which will benefit patients and carers. Of course more money may be spent on residential care places, thus increasing supply and choice for older people, but it must also be spent on innovative services provided in the home.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para120"></a>As to carers, I am particularly concerned lest the fines reduce the funds available for other community care services. In areas where hospital discharge practices are poor, local authorities might be tempted to cut corners in order to avoid fines, with disastrous results for carers should that happen.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para121"></a>I am also concerned about the way in which patients and carers will be able to make complaints. It is important that the principle of patient and carer participation is carried through. The success of the Bill must be judged not by the experience of the provider but by the experience of the receiver of care. We must monitor extremely carefully the timescale and what can be expected within it. Patients must be at the centre. Can that be ensured within three days? I should like to be reassured about what exceptions to the three-day rule will be acceptable. I understand that a panel will be established in each strategic health authority area. How will fast tracking of complaints be carried forward? I hope that the Minister can assure me about that.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para122"></a> Finally, I should like to be reassured about readmissions and how they will be monitored. If too many result from these new proposals, the <P>


<a name="column_940"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 940</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government must be prepared to modify them. We must never forget that successful discharge&#151;and I mean successful from the patients' and carers' point of view&#151;depends not on systems but on relationships, in which co-operation and communication are of the essence. If the Bill helps in that respect, all well and good, I shall not support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones; but if monitoring shows that the Bill is hindering relationships, we must be prepared to review the policy.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak to the problem from the point of view of a county council. I declare an interest as a member of Oxfordshire County Council.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para123"></a>The plain fact is that we cannot recruit people to give home personal care. For example, in Henley we paid £6 per hour&#151;the national rate&#151;for the provision of such services. This rate has recently been revised to £6.35 by direction of the director of social services. But people in Henley demand £10 per hour to clean middle-class homes and, given the choice between cleaning middle-class homes and providing personal care to an elderly person, I am sorry to say that most people will go and clean middle-class homes.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para124"></a>In north Oxfordshire, we have about 13 people waiting for every home care place. We have done our very best to provide more home care places&#151;one centre is being built by the St John Ambulance care trust in my own town for 60 old people, including the nursing care which is now essential in an old persons' home&#151;but there is an enormous gap in the finances between what is received by the county and what has to be spent. In the year about to end, we have spent £105 million, and yet the SSA applicable for this year was £85 million. Therefore £20 million was required from the general rate account. Because of the extra money flowing through this year the difference will be less, but there will still be a substantial gap between what we believe we have to spend and what the Government believe we should spend. That causes enormous problems in providing the kind of services referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para125"></a>If carers are to receive the kind of help they require to provide services to old people, the local authority must have the resources to pay for it. Those resources are not available. This year there will be a Band B council tax rise of 13.7 per cent&#151;a lot of money&#151;which I am sure many elderly people will have difficulty in paying. A large proportion of that money will be going into social services because we are trying desperately to meet the targets laid upon us&#151;an uphill battle which will not be helped by the Bill at a time when co-operation between the National Health Service and social services is beginning to bear fruit.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para126"></a>While £100 million extra may sound like a lot of money, by the time it is divided up our share will be small and will take time to pass through the system. It has taken nearly three years to build an old people's home, which is quite quick. We have followed the advice of the Government in terms of harnessing the <P>


<a name="column_941"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 941</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>private sector into the process, so it is not a question of ignoring advice. We have appointed a new director of social services to bring fresh energy into the process, but we keep coming up against nasty phrases such as "tightening the eligibility criteria for home help". In plain language that means "You do not get it", although it does not sound like that when you use fancy words to describe it.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para127"></a>I shall not speak for long, but I plead with the Minister not to go ahead with implementation in 2003. We need to see the benefits of the extra money working through into the system now that we can at last see the development of serious co-operative relationships, not the kind of antipathetic relationships that will be created.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para128"></a>We do not have the infrastructure in the county to manage these enormous problems. My county is a nice place in which to retire, which means that it contains an enormous number of elderly people. My own town is very popular for building the kind of residences to which old people are attracted, but it is the council which will be left to care for them. I ask the Minister to think very carefully about the impact of the proposed legislation on social services. They are trying to do a good job but find that the goalposts are ever being moved further away.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew24"></A><B> Baroness Greengross: </B>   My Lords, poor and inefficient discharge procedures for elderly people have been a festering sore for more years than I care to remember. In the 1970s, I was involved, as was the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, when an admirable woman, Geraldine Amos, from Birmingham, led a campaign to end poor and delayed discharge practice. The organisation with which I work, Age Concern, was involved in many hospital discharge schemes, as was the Red Cross and other voluntary organisations.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para129"></a>I set out my views and my concerns in the debate on the Queen's Speech. I am still concerned, but I support the Government's aim to try at last to get this matter right. I recognise the important improvement in relationships between health and social services in the past few years. The Government recognise that they have to balance the equation, as the Minister described, by preventing hospitals from discharging patients prematurely. I would like more details about the extent of the tough approach towards the NHS, which the Minister mentioned. The Government need to publicly demonstrate their commitment to fair play and an even playing field between health and social services. They need to demonstrate as well that it is part of a wider and comprehensive reform which includes the free aids and adaptations covered by Part 2 of the Bill and more money for intermediate care and social care announced last year.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para130"></a>Efforts should be made to gain higher status for people working in community care, which I am sure will emerge eventually as the National Care Standards Commission does its work. But we are talking about the problems which exist now. Can the Minister further clarify what those free aids and adaptations <P>


<a name="column_942"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 942</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be? Will they be available to adapt people's homes as well as help mobility? Will there be sufficient equipment available? I acknowledge the important amendments made in another place. I support strongly what the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, said about the work of carers and their right to be assessed.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para131"></a>I shall give three examples of cases which have come to my attention in the past couple of months. The first concerns an elderly gentleman who was delayed for discharge over Christmas and the new year. Nothing was in place until mid-January when his health had greatly deteriorated. He was sent home. That was a relatively straightforward case, but it revealed enormous complexities. It was a nightmare for everyone directly involved.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para132"></a>My second example shows how the use of agencies contracted by social services needs to be looked at because of the importance of social care standards. There is a need to raise competence; otherwise, as we know, it leads to emergency re-admission. Polly Toynbee's articles over the past few weeks show how care workers are very much undervalued and underpaid. That is an importance point which we need to take into account.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para133"></a>The third example involves a person discharged one day after it was decided that she needed a place in a nursing home but before that place had been found. That was not entirely the fault of the social services department. The problem needs to be properly looked at so that procedures can be genuinely improved.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para134"></a>Those cases demonstrate that hospital discharge is a shared responsibility including extra care housing options and nursing home placements, not just domiciliary care. All sectors are involved, including the private and voluntary sectors. The key point is flexibility of approach. It is not always possible for a person to be rehabilitated and to cope at home after six weeks. For people who have had strokes it can certainly take longer. That is the maximum period for intermediate care and for the free aids and adaptations. We must have greater flexibility than that.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para135"></a>Schemes which encourage a convalescent period are very valuable. I hope that the Bill will encourage more of that type of intermediate care. There are some wonderful schemes, not just here, but in Europe. They involve flats where husband and wife can work together to develop new skills because a person needs to be rehabilitated slowly and with care.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para136"></a>Best practice must be shared much more. We must not re-invent the wheel. Many organisations, including Age Concern England and the Local Government Association&#151;I am vice-president of both&#151;have very deep reservations about the date of implementation. I ask the Minister to reassure us that there is enough time for the new social care arrangements and intermediate care schemes to be set up. Has the National Care Standards Commission yet had the impact it needs to raise standards?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para137"></a>It has been suggested that the Bill could be delayed. Can we ensure that any "directions" to the NHS and its robust procedures are speeded up so that both are <P>


<a name="column_943"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 943</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>better synchronised? One possibility is that instead of waiting a full year to introduce this measure there is a compromise of six months so that the NHS procedures can be brought in a little earlier and the local government measures delayed, each by six months, so that they are introduced together. That might help. These are very deep concerns which must be taken seriously.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para138"></a>I have other points for clarification, which I hope the Minister can answer. There has been mention of the danger of perverse incentives by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. A GP might well admit a patient into acute care to get social care packages quicker. The dispute mechanism could be used as a delaying tool because people will be desperate to find ways round the procedure if it is not properly introduced. We know that it is based on an apparently admirable Swedish model, but as we do not have unified health, social care and housing services we ought to consider in the longer term whether these should be brought together. That is a bigger question than this Bill can deal with.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para139"></a>Extra money is always welcome, but can the Minister clarify how much it is, for what and for how long? We also need to know the cost. I understood that the figure was £100 million, but the estimated cost is said to be £180 million. Is there some clarification which would help me in understanding this matter?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para140"></a>Are we certain that the older person's and the carer's consent are always sought on the care plan and for bringing social services into the equation? It is essential that watertight monitoring is carried out on re-admission rates; otherwise we shall be unable to tell whether the Bill has worked. I plead for this detailed information to be on the Department of Health's website in full.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para141"></a>I share the regrets of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, but I shall give the ill my support if the Government can clarify the points I have raised and reassure me it will make life better for a group of very vulnerable older people. I am totally committed to that goal.

<A NAME="30127-03_spnew25"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My Lords, I begin by declaring a personal interest in that today I entered my 80th year, so this Bill is of some considerable interest.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para142"></a>While I have much sympathy with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and its truncated clone proffered by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I believe that their Bill blocking, to coin a phrase, is perhaps regrettable for the basis of this Bill does address in rather crude terms an extremely worrying problem. Surely, it would be better to live up to all the claims that we made in your Lordships' House last week, that we are brilliant at revision, and ensure through persuasion, debate and sheer common sense, that a thoroughly amended Bill, humane and meaningful, agreed by all noble Lords, returns to another place for its final approval.
<P>


<a name="column_944"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 944</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para143"></a>At least this Bill sets us somewhat unsteadily on our starting blocks. Let the starting pistol be fired as long as we are not arrested under new firearms legislation and let the reformers be the winners.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para144"></a> I now offer my initial contribution with some hesitation. I want, somewhat predictably, to speak as president of Mencap and focus on people with a learning disability. I am sure that I would be ruled out of order if I succumbed to the temptation to link the purpose of this Bill to those of the White Paper, Valuing People, in seeking to rescue people with a learning disability from long-stay hospitals in which about 1,000 of them still live. So with Lent and resisting temptation looming up, the concept of financial incentives to secure homes in the community for people who have spent a lifetime in hospital, before they die, does appeal to me.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para145"></a>But this Bill is not just about older people stuck chronically in an acute hospital. It is about people with a learning disability, younger or older, in the same position. Some hospitals support them very well. I know from personal experience that others struggle: a few hardly try. A busy hospital ward is not a good living environment, at the best of times&#151;most of us want to get up and go home. If you do not know what is going on and you have difficulty communicating with others, and they with you, it is, of course, much worse.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para146"></a>I share the Government's desire that nobody should stay in hospital longer than necessary and should be able to go home&#151;whether home is the family home, a residential home or supported living. But going home must be planned and supported, and it must be going home to live&#151;not going home to struggle and to suffer. Moreover, it should not mean being dumped inappropriately in a nursing home. In short, I am concerned that a policy designed to improve things might inadvertently make them much worse. I commend the care programme approach in its new&#151;how I loathe this phrase&#151;person-centred planning guise in which the individual is consulted, those close to them are consulted, personal wishes are respected and support, accommodation and back-up are all planned.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para147"></a>Sadly, people with a learning disability who have a longish spell of hospitalisation face an increased risk of not going back to their own home, because their family can no longer cope, their residential home is reluctant to provide increased support or their supported housing is not geared up to providing enhanced support.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para148"></a>Fining social services does not and cannot provide an adequate solution if it means rushing into a nursing home place where the person is going to be even more unhappy, and stuck indefinitely. We want planned and tailor-made solutions as a result of this increased financial investment, and a place in the community, not a place in a small institution.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para149"></a>If we are to secure the principles of choice, rights, independence and inclusion, as set out in the White Paper, Valuing People, we need to ensure that choice is not replaced by expediency. The Government have <P>


<a name="column_945"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 945</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>committed themselves to improving the quality and choice of housing available to all, including people with a learning disability. That means investing in housing and in support on a much greater scale than anything we have either had or been promised so far. The Bill, as it stands, does not, of course, address these issues&#151;but I trust that, in the near future, the Government will.

<A NAME="30127-03_spnew26"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   My Lords, being unable to leave hospital because there is nowhere else that can meet your needs is a miserable fate. It is one that I have been too close to not to welcome the Government's determination to take effective action on the problem of delayed discharge. For far too long, this has been an area in which older people and disabled people have been particularly vulnerable to the boundary disputes between health and social services.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para150"></a>The Government should be commended on the many broad-ranging measures that they have put in place to encourage health and social services to work together to provide "seamless care". Measures such as the new flexibilities empowered by the Health Act 1999, with its pooling of budgets for agreed projects, the ability to delegate responsibilities to a lead commissioner working on behalf of both agencies and the possibility of integrating NHS and social services staff are all leading to far more effective forms of local partnership.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para151"></a>The working through of the national service framework for older people's standards of care, with the emphasis on integration and prevention&#151;including a single assessment process and the promotion of intermediate care&#151;also challenge local health and social services authorities to work together. Furthermore, the Department of Health's joint health and social care unit is actively promoting "whole system working" throughout the country. That directly encourages local partnerships to focus on hospital discharge, supported by the new manual of discharge practice, and intermediate care and extra-care housing.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para152"></a>However, I join with other noble Lords in serious concern that all this positive activity to encourage joint working could be seriously jeopardised by the Bill's precipitate imposition of fines for delayed discharge. I ask the Minister to think again and delay the date of implementation for at least a year after the proposed date of April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para153"></a>Surely it would be more effective if the Bill could be seen as a warning shot across the bows of under-performing local authorities. If the implementation of sanctions were delayed for a year, it would give time for the new resources given to social services to be used to good effect in developing alternatives to hospital care. It would also give notice to the under-performing authorities to match the example of those where the complex issues of hospital discharge of older and disabled people have been tackled successfully.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para154"></a> There are many factors involved in the reasons for delayed discharge. The lack of alternative facilities such as nursing homes, convalescent homes and <P>


<a name="column_946"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 946</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intermediate care settings come first to mind. But they take time to develop and that gives strength to the argument that there should be a delay in the implementation of the Bill and its imposition of fines.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para155"></a>The vast majority of older and disabled people are, however, discharged to their own home and that is what they prefer. Ensuring that those homes are fit and adapted can contribute to fast and efficient discharge, as well as enabling people to live independently.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para156"></a>I argue that the housing dimension needs far greater attention than it receives in the Bill. Home improvement agencies and other service providers have developed fast, effective, small repairs and adaptations services which help to improve discharge arrangements and reduce the risk of hospital admission. The following example, taken from On the Mend, the 2002 publication of Care & Repair England, demonstrates how essential it is that local authorities and health bodies should incorporate housing in the discharge process. It says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "Mr Watt is a private tenant. He was unable to be discharged from hospital because his landlord refused to mend a dangerously broken banister. Discharge was delayed for 6 weeks whilst both social services and the health sector solicitors were involved in negotiations with the landlord's solicitor. The hospital discharge service was approached and they immediately sent in the handyperson (acting upon Mr Watt's instruction) and the banister was repaired within hours, enabling Mr Watt to return home immediately".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para157"></a><P>

<a name="30127-03_para158"></a>It is where the local housing authority, social services and the health authority all work together and each allocates resources for hospital discharge repair and adaptation costs that the most effective hospital discharge services can be established.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para159"></a>Bristol's rapid response hospital discharge service is an excellent example. The social services department provides the home improvement agency, Care & Repair England, with a budget for small adaptations; the housing authority makes available a ring-fenced home repairs assistance grant budget&#151;operated on a fast-track system for hospital discharge cases&#151;and the health authority co-funds a handyperson service. Consequently, many repair and adaptation jobs are completed within 24 hours and the majority are done within a week. As a result, a very small urgent response team manages the interventions and repairs needed for some 500 older and disabled people to return to their own homes from hospital each year.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para160"></a>It is schemes such as these which need to be replicated throughout the country. Paying attention to the housing dimension is vital if delays in hospital discharge are to be diminished. The Bill puts notice on health and local authorities to put services for effective hospital discharge high on the agenda. However, it would be a tragedy, as many noble Lords have said, if the precipitate time scale in the Bill for the imposition of fines resulted in jeopardising all the excellent work that is taking place.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para161"></a>The Government can take pride in their determination to improve joint working and to end the disgrace of disabled and elderly people being buffeted between authorities, having their needs ignored while the authorities fight interminable turf wars. I hope that <P>


<a name="column_947"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the Government will heed the concerns expressed from all sides and that the Minister will be able to see a way to delay the imposition of fines for at least a year.

<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew27"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I share many of the concerns about the Bill outlined by noble Lords this afternoon and, of course, support my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones in his amendment. I wish that I could share the optimism of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, that what we say in this House will have a big effect on what happens in another place.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para162"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford said that this was only part of a jigsaw. My contribution forms a piece of that jigsaw and concerns the role that the condition of housing plays in the area of delayed discharges. That matter was described eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, and forms part of a much wider connection between the condition of our housing and the health of our nation.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para163"></a>Money must go into improving homes if we are to change the health of the nation. I declare an interest in that I am associated with many housing bodies, particularly the National Home Improvement Council. There is a great deal of evidence that putting money into home improvement is an extremely cost-effective way of enabling many patients to return home quicker. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which is well-known to many noble Lords, has researched this matter. It reached the conclusion that minor adaptations produce a range of lasting, positive consequences for virtually all recipients and that they constitute value for money.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para164"></a> As other noble Lords have outlined, the installation of aids and adaptations can cause particular problems for people who are waiting to leave hospital. The legal and financial framework for the provision of such adaptations is complex. Often, reaching agreement on the assessment of what a person needs and where the money will come from takes an interminable time and adds to the slowness of discharge.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para165"></a>I refer to the scale of the problem of unfit housing in this country. There are 1.5 million unfit homes in the UK: that is, one home in every 16. The majority of those unfit homes are owner occupied. Some 75 per cent of the people living on the lowest incomes and in the worst housing are of pensionable age and 1.7 million people need adaptations within their homes. The tendency to live in poor housing conditions increases as people get older, particularly after the age of 80. Lone older women are more likely to live in unfit housing.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para166"></a>A proportion of the finance for dealing with home improvements comes mainly from local authorities&#151;the very same local authorities in many cases which will see money taken away from them if the Bill is enacted. The sums spent in this area have diminished over a number of years now. Admittedly, the Government recently freed up the way in which local authorities can tackle home improvements by allowing them to allocate grants. However, the overall spend is still very low. The Minister did not mention that <P>


<a name="column_948"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 948</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matter in his opening remarks although one of my colleagues searched the relevant website and found a brief reference to housing and the major repairs that are needed.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para167"></a>How can we improve the situation? Obviously, policy making on health and housing needs to be linked up and requires appropriate funding. We do not want money to be taken away from local authorities. The good, joined-up work that is undertaken between health authorities and local authorities needs to continue. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, mentioned some good examples of that. I shall mention others later.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para168"></a>I am sure that the Minister is fully aware of, and has been well briefed on, the work of Care & Repair England in the field that I am discussing. I hope that he can reassure me that priority for financial support will be given to such bodies and to other home improvement agencies that are involved in this area. I draw his attention to a point that has already been mentioned this afternoon; that is, the role of prevention, particularly as regards handyperson schemes, of which there are many around the country. Such schemes are particularly important in terms of preventing people entering hospital. West Devon has a very good handyperson scheme for elderly people to replace light bulbs, fit door chains, repair rotten window frames, rehang doors and put up shelves and pictures. Those involved in the scheme get up ladders and carry out the kind of jobs that can result in elderly people falling in their homes.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para169"></a>I hope that the Minister will reassure us that priority will be given to preventive work. As I said, much of Britain's housing is old and poor. Many people end up in hospital as a result of falls or because their homes are cold. Cold homes have been mentioned briefly. In this country many winter deaths and many winter illnesses are still caused simply because people cannot keep warm in their own homes. I hope that the Minister will mention that point when he replies to the debate.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para170"></a>Handyperson schemes have made a big difference in some areas. In the On the Mend document, Care & Repair England refers to the case study of Mrs Long. The document states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Mrs Long is 78 years old and lives alone in her own home. She was referred to the home from hospital service by the hospital social worker and OT who were concerned about the difficulty Mrs Long was having in getting up and down stairs. A second stair rail was installed by the project technician within 3 days of referral. When the caseworker visited she realised that Mrs Long's gas fire had been disconnected following a safety check. Funding applications were made to a number of charities and the money raised to repair and reconnect the fire. A successful claim for attendance allowance was also made".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para171"></a><P>

<a name="30127-03_para172"></a>I refer also to the connection that was made with Sweden. I lived in Sweden some 30 years ago. The standard of housing in Sweden is much higher than that in this country, and was 30 years ago. No one in a hospital in Sweden will have a discharge delayed due to the condition of his or her home or because they cannot keep warm in it. Noble Lords have said that the <P>


<a name="column_949"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 949</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposals in the Bill are based on the system adopted in Sweden and that we should study carefully the situation in Sweden and that in this country.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para173"></a>Will the Minister assure me that best practice will be drawn up with regard to partnership schemes and delayed discharge? I could not find any mention of that in the Bill. Perhaps it is the Government's intention to provide best practice recommendations in guidance notes or secondary legislation. Local authorities, which are so often partners in such schemes, will have less money to spend working with others on the kind of issues that I and others have highlighted today. There is a better way to provide the mechanism and funding to assist the work that I have outlined and it does not involve starving local authorities of much needed money.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para174"></a> I hope that the health Minister will put the case for improving housing to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister as such a measure would certainly save his ministry much money. If he wonders from where to obtain the necessary funds, I suggest that he talks to the Chancellor about the £6 billion extra that the Government have received since they came to office in stamp duty due to rising house prices. A very small amount of that money would go a long way to improving the condition of housing and our nation's health. As I said, we are talking about just a small part of the jigsaw. However, I believe that it is an important part that has long been undervalued in our country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew28"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a professional social worker and an associate member of the Association of Directors of Social Services. I have links with the board of the National Care Standards Commission. I do not speak on behalf of any of those bodies but, obviously, those interests clearly influence the way I view this issue.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para175"></a>It seems that the Government have made a distinctive impact on services in health and welfare since coming into office. In recent years, they have revolutionised relationships with professionals in the caring sector, which in my working life had reached an all-time low. They have developed an image of being a listening Administration, and were recently praised by Care and Health Magazine, which said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The present government has shown a real desire to take the level of professionalism higher in social care and make the delivery of services more client-centred . . . One notable feature of this approach is that the level of consultation with professionals and service users has sharply increased . . . For the first time we all have a voice in the changing landscape of social care".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para176"></a><P>

<a name="30127-03_para177"></a>As that commentator points out, the response from the Government is not necessarily a response to majority views, and that is right. However, there are many including me who hope that, as we progress through the Bill, the Government will listen to the voices asking them to think again about much of the proposed legislation.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para178"></a>The principle and aim are splendid: the timely move of people out of hospital into alternative care, either at home or elsewhere, following proper assessment and planning. I welcome the thought that we will have <P>


<a name="column_950"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 950</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more than two days' notice. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, as a social worker I have faced having to move people very quickly, but replacing two days with fines is hardly an equal-handed measure.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para179"></a>Through that process, hospital beds will be freed up for patients on waiting lists, which meets another government target. However, that is to be achieved by a very curious mechanism, which appears to penalise one part of a complex system without consideration of the whole. I had thought that the Government had started to think in terms of framework and strategic systems.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para180"></a>Of course, there remains a conceptual problem. Are the fines for social services failure, or do they, as a Minister put it in another place, simply ensure "appropriate financial flows" between services? Are they incentives, reimbursements or just plain fines? That is curiously important for local authorities. The Minister has spoken positively about local government throughout my time in the House, but the device in the Bill will further bring down the feeling among local authorities about how the Government perceive what they are trying to do in very difficult circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para181"></a>Those on the ground working to implement the policy day-to-day know how complex the system and the decisions can be. Most, if not all, want to provide the best service possible to the user. Will the listening Government hear the objections raised by those who see the implications for the whole system of care?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para182"></a>During the consultation, it was not only social services that saw flaws in the proposals. Other noble Lords have mentioned the BMA and the Royal College of Nursing. Both indicated that a scheme that penalises one partner can only damage relationships with the others. Partnerships and joint planning, under government guidance and encouragement, have been steadily improving. There will be a very heavy spanner in the works.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para183"></a>If users are central to the thinking, what has happened to the question of choice? When the clock starts ticking on the day that the hospital notifies social services, I fear that all sensitivity will disappear. Where assessment indicates the need for a complex package of care, two days is simply not enough to put the services into place. Instead, between the pressure of targets on the one hand and fines on the other, it would be a case of finding an alternative place.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para184"></a>I can think back to the days when we had to find placements for children in care under fit person orders, and sat in waiting rooms with poor children. I can see how old people and people moving out of acute care from other groups will be placed in real difficulty. If people rather than systems are at the centre of government thinking, I am sure that the Government will listen to the carers' organisations, which relate that 77 per cent of carers&#151;that is a figure for now, not for the past&#151;were not given a choice about taking on caring.
<P>


<a name="column_951"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 951</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para185"></a>When those assessed are old and frail, recovering from a serious illness or facing a future of disability, preparing for that requires time and sensitivity. As we have heard time and again this afternoon, proper planning will avoid readmission, a real and continuing problem in healthcare. What happens if, despite assessment, the patient exercises his or her choice not to accept what is on offer? Delay can arise from a patient genuinely disputing the suitability of an offered placement, possibly through a complaints procedure or judicial review. If the preferred service is not available, will users be forced into the next available slot? Will someone have time to listen and discuss alternatives? Will the clock stop ticking while the reassessment takes place?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para186"></a>As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, the measures will increase pressure on social services already struggling with problems of capacity. That is not an excuse. However much funding the Government make available&#151;I am sure that every pound is more than welcome&#151;providers know that it takes time to build up alternatives decimated by years of cuts. Capital and revenue projects are affected. Shortage of placements in residential care, and workforce planning problems run throughout the system. Noble Lords have only to read the two recent and powerful reports from the King's Fund, which demonstrate the shortage of skilled workers in residential and domiciliary care. Even without the device in the Bill, that shortage is likely to lead to a crisis, so strategic planning is needed.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para187"></a>Add to that the need for good social work assessment and the problems are compounded. If social services are to meet the assessment timescales to respond to the ticking clock, will social workers be diverted from other areas of social work&#151;from mental health, family support and, most worrying, child protection? Home care is already in crisis. I can tell noble Lords of dozens of old people whom I have met who need only two or three hours, but that time is not available.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para188"></a>I know at first hand what happens when pressure is placed on one part of the system and there is a shortage of capacity in the whole. Something else gives. Next week, when we discuss the Climbie report, we will want to put pressure on yet another part of the system. What else will give?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para189"></a>If the Government take a strategic view, will they also look at the role of the voluntary sector and the problems that it faces in supporting provision of good-quality alternatives? I have campaigned for most of my working life to remove adult disabled people from inappropriate hospital placements, but there are still difficulties. For instance, the problem of agreeing appropriate fees for residents has been well documented, but still needs addressing.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para190"></a>As vice-chair of John Grooms, a charity providing services including cutting-edge residential care for severely disabled people, I am totally disheartened not only by the issues of appropriate fees and raising money to subsidise both capital and revenue projects, <P>


<a name="column_952"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 952</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but by new legislation about staff pensions, plus the most unbelievable issues about rate disaggregation. Those are real disincentives. Such issues conspire to put voluntary organisations out of business, rather than working in partnership with them to provide even better alternatives for people who need residential care.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para191"></a>Were there more time, I would want to raise issues regarding the dispute panels. Surely the make-up of such panels, if we are to have them, should not be left to draft regulations. Some even-handedness of representation should be placed in statute.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para192"></a>I welcome the introduction of free aids and minor adaptations, but wish to ask questions about funding and assessment. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, pointed out that one of the skills shortages was in occupational therapy. The key is that there needs to be more discussion on timing, and questions should be asked as to why the statute cannot wait for better overall planning when it becomes extended to other areas such as mental health.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para193"></a>There are financial questions to explore. The London project on the commissioning of services for older people has worked with London directors of social services to monitor the delayed transfer of care data. It estimates that, at current levels of delay, the potential reimbursement fine for London alone is approximately £24 million. How will that central pot be redistributed?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para194"></a>I have read the arguments and thought carefully about the Bill, but I still cannot understand how, at a time of improving relationships and response, the Government still see a financial penalty as the only means of achieving proper performance from local authorities. With the frameworks, including that for older people, a whole strategy is being developed in the interests of users which gives a sense of value to professionals. This is a mature approach. In such a climate, where there is a complex matrix of service provision, which government adviser could be so ill advised as to see this arrangement as the best way forward? It might move people around the system faster but if my mother was involved, I should certainly want to have the time and space in which to plan for her care, to listen as she moved from independence to dependence and to know that physical and emotional needs had been taken care of for the future.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para195"></a> I realise that this approach is government policy and that we in this House are not here to frustrate it. However, I hope that we can ensure that the arrangement will work for those using the system of care and that it does not create a way of moving funds from the welfare sector to the acute sector when there is no real improvement for people. For it is people who should be at the centre of what we are trying to do, not simple mechanisms for shortening waiting lists. I will therefore support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, but I want to hear what the Government have to say and how they intend to take the thinking forward.

<A NAME="30127-03_spnew29"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   My Lords, we spent two days last week discussing various matters involving your Lordships' House. One of the points that came out most strongly was the importance of expertise. In this debate, we have had an immense amount of expertise; practically every speaker has displayed it. I must apologise for not having any particular expertise although, like one or two speakers so far, including the noble Lord, Lord Rix, I have, at this time of life, reached the stage at which quite a lot of my friends and people with whom I have worked over a period of time are running into the kind of problems with which the Bill is meant to deal. I am for ever fascinated and appalled by the difference between the way in which people cope if they are well off as opposed to if they have very little or virtually no money.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para196"></a>Every noble Lord seems to agree that this is a Bill of good intentions, that what it seeks to achieve is worth achieving, and that those behind it should be congratulated on trying to achieve that. There is also a widespread feeling that it is not going the right way about it. If we are to put the people who really matter and should be looked after at the centre of these arrangements&#151;if we are to look after the carers, the old, those who are ill and those who have been discharged&#151;and if we are to give them control over their lives, we must ensure that the Bill is changed significantly.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para197"></a>I do not wish to detain the House by dealing with various points that have been dealt with in this debate by noble Lords with more expertise than I have. However, of all the points that have been raised, the three-day allowance for coming to an arrangement about what should happen is so imbecilic as to be almost unbelievable. I do not see how anyone can think that one could achieve such a target even at the best of times. That must be altered.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para198"></a>I have been briefed, as have one or two other noble Lords, by the National Federation of Post Office and BT Pensioners, which sees that its members will be hardest hit by the Bill if it is not amended. It has produced a number of amendments, which I hope I shall advance in Committee. I hope that I shall do so with the support of other noble Lords, and I hope to support them.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para199"></a>I opened by saying that I thought that one thing about the Bill was agreed by everyone: this is a Bill of good intentions. However, we all know what good intentions do: they pave the road to hell. In the worst cases&#151;there are always worst cases&#151;the authorities do not agree, there is not enough time to consult patients, and there are not sufficient places for people to go. We should also consider what will happen to a person with little money and who feels rather ill, having just come out of hospital. The good intentions could well lead to something that can be described as closely resembling hell for those people. For that reason, I intend to support on behalf of my party the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the approach of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I hope that we will manage to make the Bill a far, far better thing by the time that we have finished with it.

<A NAME="30127-03_spnew30"></A><B> Baroness Howells of St Davids: </B>   My Lords, at this stage, every side of the argument has been put. Having recently become a carer, I have been a recipient of the very service that the Bill seeks to address. I speak with the voice of the consumer and welcome the Bill's passage though the House. The Bill is a package which, with a very few minor adjustments, will work.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para200"></a>The requirement for a written discharge plan is reassuring for the patient and the family. That is vital so that all concerned with the welfare of the patient can be satisfied that all that can be done is in place for the continued care of the patient on leaving hospital. In my case, the written discharge plan was not available because the computer had broken down. That caused me, as a carer, no end of problems. Every family member had a different solution and no one from the NHS was available to answer my very legitimate queries. I shudder to think how those who are in my position but who are less able than me to contact the director of social services would have managed. It was a nightmare and I hope that the Bill will ensure that no one ever gets into the position in which I found myself.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para201"></a>Having contacted social services, the patient&#151;my husband, whom I was removing from hospital on that day&#151;became less fragile when he realised that things could improve. Two days later, after several phone calls and not very pretty language, everything was arranged and has been working satisfactorily ever since. He is now 12 weeks into his care.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para202"></a>That illustrates how well a plan that is put in motion can work if we are patient and give it time. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that social services are not the only authority to be penalised. My experience was that the plan was not in place because the NHS was not able to set it in motion at the time that my husband was expected to leave hospital. That was not because the staff did not know when he would leave but because no one in the hospital was responsible for ensuring that social services would be contacted.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para203"></a>The Bill speaks of "joint working", but joint working will work only if both partners have equal responsibility as well as equal penalties. I am afraid that, in a complex organisation such as the NHS, we shall end up with buck-passing unless there is a named individual whom carers, patients and social services can contact. My experience showed that there was no such person. I want to appeal to the Minister because I heard myself asking, "Where is the matron?".
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para204"></a>The Bill needs to ensure that those who need the service feel secure. Social services should not be forced into a position where the patient's needs are secondary to the risk of being fined. I trust that the Minister can reassure the House that patients and their carers will not be left in limbo at the point of discharge. The medical team should be expected to work closely with social services. I believe that that can be achieved only if there is a postholder who can follow through with both partners the patient's best interests. I ask the Minister whether there are plans in the Bill for such a post&#151;I cannot see any.

<a name="30127-03_para205"></a>I hope that, by giving noble Lords my personal view, I have not wasted the House's time but have explained that the Bill is needed. The sooner it is on the statute book, the better.

<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew31"></A><B> Baroness Richardson of Calow: </B>   My Lords, I believe that it is generally agreed that hospital is not a very healthy place for most people&#151;particularly for the elderly and for those whose admission is unplanned and who therefore often end up in wards which are inappropriate for their condition. I recently had experience of an elderly man with a chest infection who was put in an orthopaedic ward. His condition deteriorated, perhaps mainly because the nurses did not have the time or the inclination to help him to feed himself with the food offered. That type of inappropriate admission needs to be looked at carefully. I shall return to that point.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para206"></a>It is in everyone's interests to discharge patients into appropriate care as soon as possible. The intention of the Bill is said to be just that. It is intended to provide an incentive, encourage better communication and increase choice. It seems eminently reasonable that proper notice will be given when the patient is to leave hospital. The patient will be put into the hands of social services where a duty of care already exists and where a proper assessment of needs will take place.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para207"></a> However, the Bill seems to introduce a culture of blame and a system of fines into that mutual arrangement. That threatens the good working arrangements envisaged in the Health Act 1999, with its pooled budgets, integrated provision and commissions.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para208"></a>Many noble Lords have received, as I have done, information regarding creative schemes of community care which are being entered into across the disciplines, including GP and primary care trusts, NHS and social services, and charitable and independent sectors. Those bodies are all seeking to work together to develop new solutions. If those practices are working well, it would seem possible to think ahead about the needs of the elderly person before he was admitted to hospital. Thus, it would not be such a surprise when an assessment had to be made before he left. However, there has not been time for all that to be put into place. The Bill now seems to depart from whole-system thinking and seeks to make one department take responsibility for what could be a failure in a number of those different arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para209"></a>The Bill also fails to address other issues. One is the inappropriate use of hospital beds in relation not only to discharge but also admission. I am astonished when I see television advertisements saying that, if a person adopts a certain healthcare plan and is admitted to an NHS bed, he can then be paid money. I heard of an elderly gentleman who managed to get himself admitted to hospital three times last year and funded a holiday in the Canaries on the basis of it.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para210"></a>When you ring NHS Direct, in order to cover themselves if their advice is not correct, the staff will often tell you to attend the hospital emergency <P>


<a name="column_956"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 956</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>services. Overworked GPs who seek to help elderly patients know that, if those patients were given appropriate diagnostic services, they would have to attend different hospitals or clinics and wait for the results of those tests for many weeks. The GPs would find it far easier to arrange for their patients to be admitted to hospital where all the tests could be done at the same time. But often that is not in the best interests of the patient.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para211"></a>Once a patient has been admitted to hospital, decisions on future care become acute rather than planned over time. Three days seems to me to be rather precipitate, particularly for putting into place specialist services. Having recently had responsibility for finding dementia care, I know that three days would be an impossibly short time for such a package to be found.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para212"></a> As has already been said, there is a need for additional capacity in community care, with additional services for the inevitable increased demand for homecare services, care home places and housing-with-care solutions. The Bill could divert finance so that local authorities would have to have a line in their budget reserving funds for the payment of fines whereas other initiatives could have been put in place. However, it is not only a matter of diverting finance; it is also possible that energy will be diverted from creative solutions into simply meeting this other need.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para213"></a>Other concerns have been mentioned, such as the fact that it is intended to implement the scheme quickly in 2003, whereas it would seem better to operate a pilot scheme in order to see how it works. It is unclear how the money generated in the scheme will be spent. I know that many of the provisions will be in the form of regulations. To my mind, the Bill will be either helped or greatly harmed by the regulations, which, of course, we have not yet seen.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para214"></a>Not much mention has yet been made of possible disputes arising between local authorities. That is perhaps of more interest to me than most since my husband is in residential care. That care is funded by Calderdale Borough Council in Yorkshire but is supplied by Enfield. I would hate for the decision as to where my husband is normally resident to be in the hands of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para215"></a>It is clear that the Bill has not been welcomed without reserve by any of the organisations that will be involved in its implementation. Therefore, I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones.

<A NAME="30127-03_spnew32"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as an employee of Age Concern England. However, the views that I shall voice will be my own. We have had an extremely thoughtful and high quality debate. It is clear that on balance even those who support the intentions of the Bill have significant and grave reservations. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford put the matter most forcefully. He outlined to the House the extent to which a wide range of <P>


<a name="column_957"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 957</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bodies&#151;not bodies that one could have predicted&#151;believe that the Bill is potentially a flawed and disruptive piece of legislation.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para216"></a>A number of the clauses are quite deep and have been mentioned already. There is a gaping hole in the Bill: the Government have given us no evidence of local authorities failing to fulfil their responsibilities for reasons other than a lack of capacity. Given that that is a fundamental assumption behind the Bill, I believe that it is right for us, as parliamentarians, to ask for evidence of that.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para217"></a>Many speakers have referred to the proposal to levy fines on social services departments as a service model copied from Sweden. In fact, the system currently operating in Sweden originated in the Jutland area of Denmark. The system was adopted in Sweden only after consideration of how it should be modified to apply to the particular needs of the Swedish context. Moreover, it was introduced only after substantial preparation, including radical reform of the taxation system and investment in community services such as extra care sheltered housing, increased home care packages and, crucially, investment in joint planning systems. That is a stark contrast to the situation here.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para218"></a>The proposal to adopt a similar system to that of Sweden surfaced in March 2002 in Chapter 6 of the Wanless report into the future of the health service. That report stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the current balance between health and social care is wrong: in particular, care is too focused on the acute hospital setting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para219"></a>
On delayed discharge it went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "Effective integration between health and social care, supported by the right financial incentives is the key to tackling such delays".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para220"></a>
However, as my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones pointed out, the Wanless report also noted that approximately 26,000 residential and nursing care places have been lost. The report advised that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Appropriate financial incentives are required to sustain a viable nursing and social care home market. The need for regulation and improved standards must be balanced with stable financing to support the quality of care".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para221"></a>
Wanless did not say that money should be diverted from the social care sector back into the acute sector, nor that a system that diverts money away from health promotion and prevention of hospital admission should be adopted. On the contrary, he advised that a thorough review of social care needs is crucial to the future of the health service and should be conducted as soon as possible. However, the Minister in another place, Jacqui Smith, in a response to my honourable friend Paul Burstow recently ruled out any such investigation. But without such an analysis, health and social care planning will suffer and be prone to ill-considered measures such as the one before us today.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para222"></a> Noble Lords may not have noticed in the Government response to the Wanless report, Delivering the NHS Plan, published in March 2002, that Chapter 8 contained an explicit commitment to introduce a system of fines on acute hospitals for re-admissions caused by inappropriate discharge. That received very little coverage at the time, and although it represents a significant safeguard which would <P>


<a name="column_958"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 958</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protect older people, it does not appear in the Bill. When challenged on that point in another place, the Minister offered the somewhat lame explanation that in 2004 a new system of financial flows will be implemented under which money will follow patients. The Minister in another place argued that if a patient is re-admitted to acute care, the PCT will simply not pay for that episode of care.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para223"></a>It is impossible to tell from the Bill how such a system could be made to work in the best interests of good patient care. Apart from the unpredictability and unwieldy bureaucracy that must be required to track such a system, a reactive approach to discharge based on fines and failure must inevitably lead to patients being passed around like hot potatoes. A vicious circle of blame is not the basis on which to build good quality, sustainable services.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para224"></a>Like many noble Lords I read the report of the Health Select Committee into delayed discharge and I found myself strongly in agreement with its statement that delayed discharge is always a symptom of something else that is not happening or a failure in the system. If those problems are not addressed, the slickest discharge procedure in the world will not work.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para225"></a>In preparation for the Bill I looked at figures of actual delayed discharges in London. The figures are compiled by the London commissioning of older people's services project, which analyses the reasons for delayed discharges. Those figures for April and May 2002 reveal that the reasons for delay were as follows: 24 per cent was due to people waiting for an assessment; 30 per cent was due to the unavailability of residential and nursing care; 9 per cent was due to lack of funding; 6 per cent was due to people awaiting domiciliary care (in the past two years while the number of hours of domiciliary care has risen, the number of households receiving domiciliary care has dropped); l0 per cent was due to patient choice; 10 per cent was due to other reasons (one discovers that that was housing, especially adaptations, as mentioned by my noble friend Lady Maddock); and 11 per cent was due to delays within the NHS. Even a cursory run through those figures is enough to show that fining local authorities, as set out in the Bill, will exacerbate rather than solve the problem.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para226"></a> For many older people a condition which is sufficiently serious to require hospitalisation is likely to lead to a need for either installation of aids or adaptations, as my noble friend Lady Maddock has said, yet there is no mention of that in the Bill. Can the minister confirm that when an assessment has been carried out and a discharge is delayed because of lack of suitable housing and housing adaptation, the local authority will not be penalised for something that is not its responsibility?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para227"></a>This is a short Bill and, as ever, much is left to regulation. However, even as it stands it contains some measures that cause alarm. The proposal to permit discharge to an intermediate care setting on the basis of a partial assessment without any requirement that a full assessment be carried out within a specified period <P>


<a name="column_959"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 959</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is frankly alarming. It opens up the potential for older people to be discharged speedily from hospital&#151;agreed by all to be desirable&#151;although into a setting which is intended to be temporary but which could become permanent even if it is not suitable for long-term needs. As the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, and anyone who works with older people knows, time spent in care, without appropriate support, tends to lead to much greater dependence.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para228"></a> Furthermore, the Bill as it stands has a particularly worrying omission. While it refers to a patient having been assessed as no longer needing acute care, there is scant regard for the fact that moving older people is often damaging and in some cases dangerous. Being able to be treated in a care home, or even with a care package at home, is not the same as being able to withstand the process of moving, which can often be extremely problematic. The Bill does not mention transport, and yet anyone who has been involved with enabling an older person to leave hospital will be aware that not knowing how or when they will be transferred is a matter of immense concern to them and can be deeply distressing.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para229"></a>The priority and focus that the Bill will inevitably place on hospital discharge will undoubtedly mean that in many areas resources will have to be switched from preventive and rehabilitative services. Any local authority desperate to avoid fines will have to invest in OT services. That in itself is no bad thing, but if it is done at the expense of handyperson schemes&#151;I am one of the biggest fans of such schemes&#151;which are an extremely effective means of enabling older people to live independently, it will lead to increased hospital admissions.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para230"></a>My noble friend Lord Bradshaw exactly set out the dilemma facing social services departments&#151;not because they are unwilling to get people out of hospital but because they do not have the resources. Any GP with any nous will soon realise that the best way to get patients to the head of the assessment queue will be to get them into hospital. The Bill will cause huge distortions in local care planning and is bound to cut across much of the good work done in the NSF.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para231"></a>As to assessments being done in three days, I will bet money that the Minister's response will be that most patients are in hospital longer than three days so that will be a minimum, not a maximum. True. But the point at which the information passes between social services and the hospital is crucial. It is not often that residential care places become available at three days' notice.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para232"></a>A further concern is the lack of funding. Much has been made of the £100 million but there are other real pressures on social services. Any department that is not planning to increase its children's services is mad.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para233"></a>When the system was introduced to Sweden, the tax system was changed to provide the crucial sustainability. That is in stark contrast to this country, where much of the health and social care funding introduced by the present Government is short term and piecemeal. The 6 per cent increase in funding <P>


<a name="column_960"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 960</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>personal social services is welcome but it does not apply to older people and is not guaranteed beyond 2006.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para234"></a>Furthermore, although the Government have invested much in the personal social services funding formula, as my noble friend Lord Bradshaw said, social services throughout the country are spending way in excess of their existing assessment. For example, the Social Policy Ageing and Information Network reported a year ago that local authorities are spending in excess of £1 billion over and above the Government's figure. Spending on promoting independence totalling £155 million and building care capacity costing £190 million comes to an end in March.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para235"></a>When one considers that most social care is labour intensive rather than capital intensive, it can be seen that the churn and turnover in the people required to do this job is a debilitating factor. One can set up the best computer systems in the world but if the people using them change frequently, the resulting lack of continuity is alarming.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para236"></a> My noble friend Lord Clement-Jones said that the Bill is health tourism at its worst and it is. The Government are taking a system from a country, Sweden, that has a high tax base and where health and social care are provided by sole suppliers&#151;public local authorities. This country has a lower tax base and, while the level of private health care remains low, social care is provided by a range of suppliers&#151;including the voluntary sector.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para237"></a>Given that the Bill is such a radical departure from previous health policy, one wonders whether the Government are setting social services departments up to fail&#151;particularly when one considers the amount of administration required to make it work.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para238"></a>Evidence to the Health Select Committee in another place made it clear that far and away the most problematic discharges are those where the older person is mentally frail and the necessary care package is complex. At a time when the number of places for people needing dementia care is decreasing, the Bill's lack of protection for patients and patient choice, of any mention of advocacy and of any requirement for older people to consent to discharge is worrying. There is not even a requirement for patients to consent to information about them being given to a social services department, with which they may previously have had no dealings.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para239"></a>The Minister made much of the fact that the Bill merely compels social services departments to do what they are already required to do. When the noble Lord responds, I am sure that he will make much of varying performance in delayed discharges between different authorities. But he cannot say the extent to which a local authority which has good levels of delayed discharge does so at the expense of other admission and rehabilitation services.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para240"></a>If the Government really wanted to develop good models of integrated health, they would learn from the Swedish system and give time for the development of good practice on information sharing, patient <P>


<a name="column_961"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>information and involvement. They would enable the development of joint planning by health and social services and consider the role that GPs play in hospital aftercare&#151;one finding of the Swedish system that has not been considered. Models such as ithink should be given time to become established.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para241"></a>I urge noble Lords to visit the Department of Health's website. The draft regulations are not yet available, but under the Joint Unit section of the website the frequently asked questions about the Bill do not make happy reading and increase concern about leaving much of the detail to regulations. For example, the statement that anyone who refuses a care package will be deemed a self funder is extremely worrying.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para242"></a>Ministers in another place repeated the mantra that the Bill is about patients. It is not. It is about beds. It is about removing from practitioners the flexibility to do what is right for individual patients. It is about whether medical staff can stand up to pressure from bed managers and accountants. It is about removing from intermediate care managers the ability to decide that an older person needs seven weeks of care after a stay in hospital, rather than six. It is about grudgingly giving older people and their carers information when they ask for it, not as of right.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para243"></a>During the debate on the gracious Speech, I referred to this measure as the community care congestion charge Bill. Nothing during its passage in the other place makes me think that I was wrong. This Bill is bad. It is flawed in its assumptions and incomplete. It is being rushed through Parliament at a speed reserved by the Government for measures about which they are particularly worried. In this case, the Government's concern is not misplaced. Members of these Benches make no apology for giving the Bill a deservedly rough ride and the most thorough scrutiny.

<P>

<a name="30127-03_para244"></a>We have heard some powerful speeches&#151;not least from my noble friend Lord Howe. There is no disagreement as to the policy aim of not keeping people in hospital unnecessarily, but the Minister cannot take much comfort from most speeches today. I hope that he has got the message that the Bill in its current form is unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para245"></a>When my noble friend Lord Howe was drafting his amendment, he was persuaded by the Clerks to use the word "regret", so that it would read

Members of these Benches indeed deplore the Bill. It is not wanted by the NHS, local authorities and social services departments in particular. It will do irreparable harm to partnership <P>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 962</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>working between health and social services bodies and could be positively harmful to patients who, under the Bill, will be no more than piggy-in-the-middle. It is a thoroughly deplorable Bill.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para248"></a>My noble friend and others have already explained the scale of concern that exists about partnership working and the impact on patients. I want to dwell on some areas that are mundane but not without importance.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para249"></a>I start with money. We know that the Government tried to buy off opposition to the Bill in another place by announcing that £100 million per year would be paid to local authorities to allow them to pay the fines. The Bill is about fines, whatever euphemisms the Government use. That £100 million is part of the lunacy surrounding the Bill. It is not new money. It is part of the money obtained from the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the NHS. The Secretary of State pinches £100 million of NHS money to pay to local authorities which will then pay it back to NHS bodies by way of fines.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para250"></a>That would be silly enough on its own, but noble Lords will see that the money will pass through two public sector bureaucracies: local authorities and the NHS. The Explanatory Notes say that the administration costs will total £5.5 million. I tried to investigate that figure&#151;which seems low&#151;in the regulatory impact assessment. But despite paragraph 58 of the Explanatory Notes, the Minister may like to know that the regulatory impact assessment is not on the department's website, at least not in any obvious place. We will have to take at face value the claim that the bureaucrats will spend £5.5 million. Hey presto&#151;£100 million that could have been spent on a multitude of provisions if allocated to primary care trusts has turned into £94 million.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para251"></a>There are other problems. The latest estimate by local authorities is that the new fines will cost local authorities £165 million. So, with the costs of bureaucracy, there is a gap of over £70 million. We can forget about the 6 per cent increase in social services funding about which the Government have been bragging; there will not be anything left. In many cases, council taxes will have to rise.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para252"></a>Local authorities remain in the dark about how the £100 million is to be allocated between them. The £100 million was announced last December but no one knows how it will be shared out. Will it be given to the local authorities that have the most problems in avoiding the new fines? Many local authorities face particular difficulties, particularly those whose care home capacity has been decimated by the Government's disastrous policies towards the care home sector. Will the money be given to such authorities? I ask the Minister to give a clear view and I should say to him that many believe that the Government will use this £100 million as yet another excuse to allocate public money on a wholly partisan basis to the areas from which they derive the most political support. Will the Minister say categorically that this will not be the case?

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para253"></a>My noble friend Lord Howe talked about the incentives that will exist for NHS trusts to discharge patients early. That takes me to the lack of reciprocal obligations and penalties on the NHS. The Bill lacks symmetry and is unfair in that respect. Last April the Government outlined a system of fines that would apply both to social services and to the NHS. But somehow, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, pointed out, the NHS part has disappeared.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para254"></a>The Minster in another place, Jacqui Smith, claimed that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"under the new financial flows, acute trusts will not receive funding for patients who are readmitted to hospital within a certain period, so there will be a financial incentive for them".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, Standing Committee D, 10/12/02; col. 47.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-03_para255"></a>
The Minister made a similar claim in the briefing session for Peers last week, for which we thank him. I was glad to hear nothing claimed today for financial flows. The truth is that there are no incentives for the NHS to balance the fines on local authorities. Documents such as Reforming NHS Financial Flows do not deal with the issue. The Bill is one-sided.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para256"></a>This system does nothing to provide compensation for local authorities. What happens if, under the Bill, an NHS trust notifies an intention to discharge? The local authority has two or possibly three days, including weekends, to rush around to make arrangements for the patient. Then on the day the NHS trust changes its mind and says, "Sorry, we got it wrong". It may not even say "sorry" because it does not matter to the trust. The local authority might have made commitments to care homes or to providers of domiciliary care. Why does the Bill not require the NHS to reimburse the local authority for such incidents? It is quite likely that the incentive structure of the Bill will make this happen much more than in the past; and there is nothing to stop inappropriate behaviour by trusts.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para257"></a>We are becoming used to the Government drafting Bills with major regulation-making powers without having given any thought to the details. This Bill is no exception in terms of regulation-making powers. But we understand that the Government want to implement the Bill on 1st April and therefore we expect that the details must be fully worked out. The Minister agreed informally in the briefing meeting to share the draft regulations with noble Lords when they were available. Will he say when he expects to do this? I hope that he will not expect this House to start Committee stage without having had an opportunity to consider the draft regulations carefully.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para258"></a>The last area that I shall address is the need to review the impact of the Bill on patients. Patients are almost forgotten in the Bill. Nobody believes that delayed discharges are good for patients. Most people loathe being in hospital for extended periods. But equally bad for patients are inappropriate discharge arrangements, perhaps forcing an old person into a care home because of a timing or other delay with home-based arrangements. So too is the prospect of being moved from pillar to post because the NHS has washed its <P>


<a name="column_964"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 964</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hands of the patient but there are genuine difficulties with establishing long-term arrangements. We have heard many examples today. Will the Minister say how the consequences of the Bill for patients will be monitored and how they will be reported to Parliament?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para259"></a>I do not want the Minister to be in any doubt about the view of these Benches: this is a bad Bill. The best possible outcome would be for the Government to accept that the Bill is misconceived. My noble friend's amendment urges the Government to reconsider. They do not have to take the Bill further than today. There are precedents even under this Government for that. If we find ourselves in Committee, I give notice that we shall propose a number of significant amendments to take out the worst features of the Bill and that we shall pursue them vigorously.

<P>
<A NAME="30127-03_spnew34"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, this has been a good debate. I look forward to Committee stage with keen anticipation. I join the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Rix, on his 80th birthday. He looks no different from when he trod the boards at the Whitehall Theatre a few years ago. It was good of him to speak in the debate today.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para260"></a>The one issue on which we are united is the need to sort out the problem of delayed discharges. I do not underestimate the challenges facing local authorities and the NHS. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that I am a strong supporter of local government. When I criticise local government, I try to do so as constructively as possible. I do not underestimate the potential of partnerships nor doubt the need for a holistic, whole-system approach to health and social care collaboration for older people.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para261"></a>What troubles me is the recognition that if 5,000 mainly older people are delayed in hospital beds when they no longer need to be there, we are failing them and their families. All of us have known or seen the consequences for older people of losing their independence and becoming institutionalised. That is my direct response to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para262"></a>I accept, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, that there is any number of reasons for delayed discharges, including delays in assessment, in providing a care package, in waiting for a placement, in putting a domiciliary package in place and in the performance of the National Health Service. The developing partnership between the NHS and local government and a top-down performance management approach could all be expected to play their part in improving the current situation. I congratulate many local authorities on their success in improving their performance on delayed discharge. But that cannot be left to chance.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para263"></a>The outcome for older patients delayed in acute hospital beds is so serious that it warrants a more robust approach. As I see it, the problem is that, despite the many examples of good practice, there are still too many flaws in the system and too many <P>


<a name="column_965"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 965</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>examples of bad practice. We know that long-standing practice can get in the way of smooth discharge from hospital and that simple communication breakdowns can make it much harder for patients to get back out into the community. My noble friend Lady Howarth gave us one example; I could cite many others. Examples such as those convince me of the need for a more robust procedure under which statutory agencies must sharpen up their act.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para264"></a>I do not accept the suggestion of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that the Bill will undermine partnerships. Where the current partnership arrangement works well, it has a positive impact on the outcome for the individual who is ready to leave hospital. The Bill will foster good relationships and partnerships because it will clarify much more effectively the role and responsibilities of the various agencies involved in discharge procedures. Under the Bill, there will be less scope for disagreement about who is responsible for a delay. That will help to smooth the discharge process. In other words, I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that it will become a name game.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para265"></a>The Bill's approach enhances the need for partnership and creates an incentive. That is the whole purpose of transferring the budget in the way that we propose. It will create the right incentive to bring partners to the table to discuss how best to increase capacity and make any other necessary changes in working practices.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para266"></a> The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, is right: we must demonstrate that that approach will be as rigorous and tough for the NHS as it is for local government. It will be. I can confirm to my noble friend Lady Howells that there will be no buck-passing in the NHS and that regulations will include the requirement to have a named NHS individual.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para267"></a>Sweden has been mentioned several times. Although various countries can offer us a clue towards the solutions that we need, I point out that the health and social care system in England is not the same as that in Sweden. In fact, the Swedish reforms that introduced reimbursement also involved a major transfer of responsibility for primary care for older people to the municipalities. That threw up many tensions that will not exist in this country.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para268"></a>I said that the Bill will not undermine partnerships. In fact, it will build on them while providing the robustness that is often missing in some local health authorities and the NHS. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, mentioned the Climbie inquiry. It would be entirely wrong for me to anticipate Lord Laming's report, but we have only to read other inquiry reports to understand that time and again, alongside any structural or funding problems, what comes through is sloppiness in practice and the failure to record decisions and to communicate between agencies. Under the Bill, we will start to grip that issue as it affects delayed discharges.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para269"></a>I know that some noble Lords consider that we should delay the introduction of this system. All that I would say is that local authorities and the health service have been under notice for a considerable time. <P>


<a name="column_966"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 966</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>They have been making preparations. I have been encouraged by some comments that we have received from local authorities about their state of readiness. Of course, statutory agencies always want to delay the date of implementation; that is the normal reaction that we expect. The problem with postponing the date of implementation is that that postpones the date by which older people can take advantage of the new arrangements in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para270"></a>I have listened with care to the points raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Richardson and Lady Howarth, about the time taken for assessment. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, always anticipates my response; it is uncanny how she can forecast what I am going to say. But the fact remains that the average length of stay in an NHS hospital for a person aged over 65 is 11 days. So in most cases there will be more time. However, equally, we should surely want to encourage health and local authorities to get their act together and get the assessment done as quickly as possible. Why should we delight in delay?
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para271"></a> Of course, some individuals will have complex care needs. I readily accept the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that there will be individuals for whom it will not be possible to draw up a full discharge plan within three days. But I contend that an acute ward is not the place for such a person to be cared for while that care planning is completed. Surely in such cases it is much better for patients, while their long-term care is being planned, to be transferred&#151;with all due care and attention to the issue of transport and the new place where they are to be cared for; I accept the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, about that&#151;to a non-acute and more comfortable environment.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para272"></a>I was asked about bureaucracy and associated costs by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. I confirm that we want to keep the transactional implementation costs to the minimum. Clearly, there will be costs&#151;there is no point in running away from that fact&#151;but they are significantly outweighed by the benefits. I return to the point raised in so many previous inquiry reports into failures of statutory services. I refer to the ability to track what is happening to individuals and to ensure that individual officials are responsible for making and implementing decisions, and the bearing that that will have on the necessary accompanying paperwork. Getting to grips with that&#151;seeing who is responsible and making sure that those statutory agencies deliver&#151;is worth some additional paperwork.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para273"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Clement-Jones and Lord Chan, were worried about the whole question of dispute resolution and understandably feared that the procedure would lead to a great many disputes, which is not how we would want health and local government authorities to work. I agree: we do not want a huge number of disputes. The guidance that we will give to health and local authorities will point out that for reasons of time and resources, it is clearly desirable for two public bodies to reach amicable agreement rather than having constant recourse to the panel.
<P>


<a name="column_967"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 967</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para274"></a>Noble Lords put great store on partnership. The test of partnership is to enable these arrangements to be bedded down in the most agreeable way possible, where everyone recognises that they are dealing with a series of cases with clear protocols and where there will not be a need for the disputes procedure. Of course, if there has to be dispute resolution, so be it. We shall give strategic health authorities the role of oversight. But I can assure the House that the panel itself will be composed of a local authority and an NHS representative with an independent chair. I hope that that gives comfort because it will ensure a dispassionate overview of a specific dispute if such a panel needs to meet.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para275"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, were worried that the Bill would produce a system where the patients revolve around the system, and that perverse incentives would come into play causing real problems for the individual. That is not the intention of the Bill. Perverse incentives will not come into play. The whole point of transferring the resources to local authorities and of the new funding flow system we shall be introducing to the NHS starting in the new financial year, fully implemented in 2005&#150;06, is that there will not be financial incentives for health and local authorities to cause real difficulties for the patients involved. I do not accept the suggestion that general practitioners will seek to admit patients purely so that they have access to social services. I have greater confidence in the responsibility of GPs in that arena.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para276"></a>My noble friend Lady Wilkins quoted some excellent examples of good practice, about how rapid repair teams can sort out aids and adaptations very quickly. I agree. We issued good practice guidelines to the NHS today about the whole discharge area. I can say to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, that it includes housing issues. The noble Baroness made some excellent points in that regard. I hope that the whole process of introducing this Bill, of ensuring that health and local government have the incentives to sort the matter out, will grip some of the issues that the noble Baroness raised. The examples given by my noble friend and by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, about how some of the rapid handyman schemes can quickly sort out aids and adaptations are an example to those parts of the country where it takes months for similar situations to be sorted out. That gives me confidence that in the end we can ensure that the Bill will be implemented as effectively as possible.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para277"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, expressed concern about the distortion of social service priorities. We are not seeking to add additional responsibilities to local government. These matters are already the responsibility of local government. We are trying to put in place incentives which will make it deliver those responsibilities more effectively.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para278"></a>In response to the right reverend Prelate I can say that it is not our intention to undermine a holistic approach in dealing with these difficult issues. That is far from the point of this Bill. The Bill seeks to get right <P>


<a name="column_968"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 968</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the incentives for health and local government to come together and agree a holistic approach to the difficulties.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para279"></a>I recognise the issues raised by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, in relation to patient choice. These proposals are aimed at putting the patient firmly at the centre of care. The whole point is to encourage local authorities to put into place more community services to give the patient more choice. The Bill does not in any way affect a patient's legal right either to choice or anything else. The Bill does not cover that issue.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para280"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley for her welcome of the amendments made in another place concerning carers. However, I was disappointed that so many noble Lords raised the issue of care home capacity. Of course care home capacity is important. But it has not fallen to the extent suggested in the figures quoted from Laing & Buisson; and care home places are not the only option. I pay tribute to local authorities for increasing the provision of the alternative forms of care home that are becoming available. Part of the process of the Bill is to encourage more and different care support packages to be made available. Also, it will encourage local authorities to get together with care home owners to talk about longer-term arrangements to encourage stability in the market, the absence of which has been a long-standing complaint from the care home industry. We are already seeing, as a result of the increased funding we are able to put into local government, increases of more than 3 per cent in the fees paid to those care homes.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para281"></a>I was asked a number of questions about research and monitoring. I confirm that we shall be monitoring the situation extremely carefully. I confirm also, for my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that we will be commissioning research into the impact of reimbursement, not only on the delayed discharge as it happens in hospitals, but on the system as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para282"></a>On equipment issues, which were largely welcomed by noble Lords&#151;I look forward to Part 2 of this Bill in Committee&#151;I accept the importance of OTs in the assessment process and the importance of the single assessment process. Again, the incentive here is to encourage that assessment process. OTs have an extremely important role to play. We must ensure that we use their scarce resource as effectively as possible. The signs from the NHS and local government are that that is indeed happening.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para283"></a>Many interesting points were raised in this debate. I say to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford that I do not underestimate the challenges. I note the concerns of the organisations and the hard-pressed professionals. In the end those organisations and professionals are well able to stick up for themselves. My concern is for the individual older people who need sticking up for.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para284"></a>I reject absolutely the suggestion that patients will be shunted around. I refer again to the many past inquiry reports into failures in public services which <P>


<a name="column_969"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 969</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>showed that a lack of robustness, a lack of codification and a lack of getting their act together cause real problems for individuals. My noble friends Lady Pitkeathley and Lady Howell, and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, talked about the present problems in delayed discharges. They concern lack of notice, lack of planning and lack of communication. But we were also told of local authorities which have got their act together and cracked the issue of delayed discharges.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para285"></a>We know that when older people are stuck in care in an acute bed, it can lead to rapid institutionalisation. The longer they stay there, the harder it is to be discharged back into the community. This Bill will go a long way to improving the situation for those individuals. We have transferred sufficient resources to local government to enable it to do its job properly. This Bill will be a measured improvement on current conditions and circumstances and I invite the House to give it a Second Reading.

<P>

<a name="30127-03_para286"></a>The Minister gamely replied to the debate, but it is clear that this Bill arrives virtually friendless in this House. Even those who had a good word to say about its intentions were beset with doubts and anxieties about its effect. I was particularly struck by the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley. The adage, "With friends like this . . .", springs to mind in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para287"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford supported the amendment, but complained of the weak language used in it. I am afraid that we are bound by convention and I regret the fact that we cannot use the word "deplore". If we could have used stronger language, I would have done so and for that reason&#151;and that reason alone&#151;we on these Benches will not press the matter to a Division. We believe that the words of the amendment go only half way to demonstrating exactly how strongly we feel about the contents of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para288"></a>If by convention we could throw out the Bill in this House we would&#151;and I believe that the same applies to the other Opposition Benches. We have the absolute determination to improve and make radical changes to the Bill on its way through this House. One of our first demands in Committee will be for a sunrise clause to delay the introduction of these measures at least until 2004. On these Benches, we will also want to see a range of other improvements: for example, proper safeguards on patient and carer consent and mental incapacity; and a time limit by which a full assessment of care and carer's needs will be completed so that people are not ultimately stuck in care homes. We shall want to see many additional amendments.
<P>

<a name="30127-03_para289"></a>The Bill's passage through this House will not be an easy one. I advise the Minister to fasten his seat belt and prepare for a rough ride. We will be doing all we <P>

<a name="30127-03_para290"></a> While I have the attention of Back Bench Labour Peers, perhaps I may advise them that when they go to No. 10 tonight they should tell the Prime Minister what a bad Bill this is and how little support it has in this House. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30127-04_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving the first Motion standing in my name, I shall speak to all the following regulations. I and my noble friends on these Benches and those to whom we spoke during the passage of the 2002 Bill feel entirely vindicated. We predicted that numerous regulations and guidance notes would be spawned by the Bill and they have. Ministers responding to concerns about the introduction of admission forums argued that it would be straightforward&#151;merely reflect best practice&#151;and be simple to apply. We now have nine sets of regulations, and perhaps more to come, two voluminous jargon-written codes of practice with endless cross-references to further guidance and other statutes, and the constant threat of the heavy hand of the adjudicator and/or the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para1"></a>Many schools of all categories and other relevant interested parties are baffled about the laying of the codes of practice before Parliament which, for reasons I shall explain, we are unable to deliberate upon today. I shall deal first with consultation. A mere 25 days was given for consultation, which was wholly inadequate. The Government breached their own guidelines and code of practice on consultation when they said it should last for at least three months. Previous consultation is no substitute for what are now to be regulations couched in law. The date of 18th September is early in the term for primary and secondary schools. To invite them to respond to such a complicated set of regulations and two large documents in only 25 days is more than any school can cope with.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para2"></a>However, only 637 out of 20,000 were told about the process. The Campaign for State Education, which is anti-choice and anti-selection in education, was consulted. The Campaign for Real Education, which is pro-choice and for selection in education, was not consulted. The Secondary Heads Association was consulted. The National Association of Head Teachers was not consulted. The hierarchy of the <P>


<a name="column_971"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 971</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Anglican and Catholic Churches were consulted but they did not consult their Church schools, nor did the Government. Of the only 187 written replies, 94 were from local education authorities which in turn did not consult their schools; 50 were from schools which happened to know about the process or were some of the lucky 637; 16 were from Churches and other faith organisations; 17 were from education and children organisations; and only 10 came from parents and other individuals. Consultation has been limited and has been arbitrary.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para3"></a>One argument used by the Minister&#151;perhaps it will be repeated today&#151;was an intention to cut down on bureaucracy to schools. There are two responses to that. First, when the law effects real changes to parents, children, LEAs and schools they should know about it. Secondly, a simple letter explaining the nature and import of these changes to local authorities, schools and other relevant interested parties informing them that regulations and codes had been laid&#151;better still, that they were to be laid, thereby giving notice&#151;and access via the website, or hard copies from the department, should have been made available.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para4"></a>I turn to the incompetence of the department. I called the department before Christmas, as did Dr Marks, the education researcher, and Mr Nick Seaton from the Campaign for Real Education. All of us were told by an official at the department that he could not tell us when the documents would be published and when the code would be laid. The code had been laid on 15th November.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para5"></a>Subsequently, we were told that these documents could have been seen on the website, but they disappeared from the website. I was telephoned by a number of schools&#151;three on a particular day&#151;and by the Campaign for Real Education asking me for news of the codes of practice. Eventually, I telephoned the department and spoke to three different officials that morning. They did not know when the code would be produced. Later that day, I was telephoned by an official who told me that it had been published and laid before Parliament on 15th November and that it was then too late to lay a Prayer to Annul.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para6"></a>The official was puzzled as to how I and others had been misled. I was offered an apology, which I accept. Nevertheless, we were misled&#151;and not only us, but schools, too. Those points alone&#151;the poor and patchy consultation and confusion over the introduction of the code&#151;provide good grounds on which to take the regulations away and reconsider the matter further.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para7"></a>Head teachers, teachers and governors will continue to take a jaundiced view of ministerial promises to cut the level of regulation and bureaucracy. Even now, it is not possible to understand what problem the Government were seeking to resolve by introducing admission forums underpinned by copious secondary legislation, plus two volumes of codes of practice. Ministers from time to time boast about the numbers of children or percentages of pupils who receive their first preferences for choice of a school. If there is a problem&#151;and it does not appear that there is&#151;it is <P>


<a name="column_972"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 972</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that there are not enough good schools and places. Clearly, when one looks at the competition for entry to the city technology colleges and grammar schools, the problem should not be resolved by this over-mighty, over-bearing and complex set of regulations and codes of practice, but by the expansion of those places, which would gain greater pupil and parental support.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para8"></a>Where a school is over-subscribed, playing around with the admissions system will not allow access for more pupils. The system proposed simply removes control from heads and governors and puts it into the hands of admissions forums, but more seriously, into the hands of an unelected, unaccountable, government-appointed adjudicator. Worse, there is no appeal, other than resorting to expensive judicial review to challenge any decision made by an autocratic adjudicator.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para9"></a>Who in the education system, especially heads and governors, has the time to interpret the convoluted legalese of these documents? Why should a third person intervene when, if an admission goes wrong, it is the school governors and the head responsible for the response. Should fault be found to lie with a third party outside the control of the school, will the costs of any litigation, appeals process and where necessary, the remedy, be met by the Government?
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para10"></a> Local education authorities will not be obliged legally to operate the model scheme. However, it is clear from reading these documents that there is pressure to do so. I should like it made absolutely clear that they have no obligation whatever to use the model scheme.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para11"></a>Referring to Paragraph 52 of the annex to the code, why should any school be forced to adopt a home school agreement, if the parent is not required to sign it as a condition of access? Why should a school be forced to take a pupil whose parents are not even prepared to sign up to the way in which the school is run?

<a name="30127-04_para19"></a>My own local authority is bound by Norfolk, Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Essex. Are we talking about masses of consultation countrywide? In a London authority, there are schools which will have to talk with 40 local education authorities.

<P>

<a name="30127-04_para23"></a>As regards the second set of regulations, and Regulation 2(5), if a school has met the conditions to earn exemption from the duty to consult, why is it necessary for the local education authority to inform the Secretary of State? The heads, the governors, the parents, the local education authority are the local people. So why do they need to tell the Secretary of State? Why must all those who would have been consulted, had there not been the exemption, have to be notified? If there is no change, what is the point of having to consult?
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para24"></a>What on earth is a composite document? It reminds me of a trade union document, as I read this. The composite document has to be produced. They can be separate for primary and secondary. They can be produced, two or more separate ones, for different parts of an area. They have to be produced by the 1st October and made available to anyone who wants them. Who will pay for that and if there is to be no charge, then clearly the cost will fall on the local authority, so what is that cost?
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para25"></a>Every governing body must provide specified information no later than such time before the time required for publication of the prospectus, which is 1st October.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para30"></a> The fifth set of regulations on the list prescribe: the manner in which an appeal is to be constituted, the duty of the admissions authority to advertise for lay members, the procedure an appeal panel is to adopt when hearing appeals, the relevant considerations which an appeal panel is to take into account, the payment of allowances to appeal panel members and arrangements to indemnify appeal panel members against expenses.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para31"></a>Who pays for all of that and what are the costs?
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para32"></a>I turn to the sixth set of regulations. Regulation 6 deals with tenure of members. Regulation 7(5) says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the office of chairman and vice-chairman may be held by a person who may or may not be a member of the forum".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-04_para33"></a><P>

<a name="30127-04_para34"></a>Is that really the case?
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para35"></a>My final detailed point is about the adjudicator. Any parent may object to the adjudicator about a school where the admissions capacity is lower than the net capacity of schools. I assume that the adjudicator makes this decision alone, that there is no appeal against that and that is an autocratic decision on the part of the adjudicator. Can a parent object to city technology colleges, city academies, specialist schools, schools of partial selection and also grammar schools?
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para36"></a> It is worth recording the lengths to which the Government will go in their philosophical objection to selection by ability or even their perception that a school could be selecting by ability. The codes and regulations are littered with prohibitions, checks and unsubtle comments which will exert pressure on parents and schools. Those who will be affected are bright, talented and academically able young people. Those most affected will be those from poorer homes, unable to make alternative arrangements, either by paying for private education or moving house to a better catchment area.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para37"></a>What powers will the adjudicator have over grammar schools? What can a parent complain of and what is the limit of the adjudicator's powers over grammar schools? Delaying preferences on the preference before test requirement will disadvantage many children, again, some of them bright children from poorer homes. Does this requirement apply to CTCs, academies, partial selective schools as well as grammar schools? Why not allow all applications to selective schools, either in part or whole, to take place first, giving all parents of children a level playing field to apply? Then, following allocation to selective places, parents could state their preferences for all the other schools which would also create a level playing field. Again, the children most likely to benefit would be bright ones from poorer homes.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para38"></a>If Ministers are not aware of the deep disquiet among Church schools, they should be. Under present regulations, interviews form part of the admissions process; they have done so for decades. If the Anglican and Catholic hierarchies were concerned about a perception that there was a lack of objectivity&#151;or, worse, a perception that interviews are used to breach the rules on selection&#151;and they knew it not to be the case, they should have stood by their schools and defended them; they should not have deserted them. If <P>


<a name="column_975"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 975</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Church hierarchies believed that interviews should be banned, they should have convinced the governors, heads and parents of their own schools and not done a deal with the Government.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para39"></a>There is an excellent article by John Clare in today's Telegraph. I know that everyone wants to go to a party, and so I shall not read it out in full. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The head teachers complain that they were neither informed nor consulted&#151;and nor were Catholic parents or governing bodies.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-04_para40"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>'We believe good, conscientious, Catholic parents who are trying to bring their children up in the faith in the face of enormous odds will be aghast when they realise what their bishops have done', said one Catholic head teacher . . . 'We believe that parents have a right to an interview and an opportunity to represent at interview their commitment to Catholic education and how they meet the criteria of the school'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-04_para41"></a>
The article continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'Although we write to parish priests for references, our experience has shown that these references alone are frequently not reliable', he said. 'Without an interview if would be more difficult for us to determine the degree of practice and commitment.
<P>

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>There is a serious danger'"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-04_para43"></a>
this is an important point&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'that the references from priests would determine which applicants would be offered places, and the admissions process would be less reliable. In many cases, parents would be relying on the reference-writing skills of their priests, and there would certainly be a significant rise in the number of appeals'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-04_para44"></a>
 And of course the schools would be held responsible.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para45"></a>Popular schools draw their pupils from a wide catchment area, particularly popular Church schools. It is true that at least one London school has to liaise with 40 local education authorities and independent schools. The way in which this system overlays those procedures is absolutely monstrous and unacceptable&#151;but the voice of such schools was not heard in the consultation process.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para46"></a>It would take a genius to interpret the rules and regulations governing "class-size prejudice". The code of practice, which is meant to be an explanatory document, does not help.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para47"></a>I have merely scratched the surface of the points I wish to make about these regulations. I know that there is to be a party and that there are some fairly anxious noble Lords behind me, so I shall not labour the issue. But let the Minister be in no doubt that what I have said is but a fraction of what I would have said had there been more time.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para48"></a>Finally, I cannot do better than to quote from a letter sent to the headmaster of a former grant-maintained school. After listening to a speech made by David Bell, the head of Ofsted, the headmaster of another school said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"His [David Bell's] statement that schools are now more autonomous than ever before beggars belief. My experience, and I am now in my 26th year of headship in the maintained sector, is exactly the opposite: we now have less autonomy than ever. LEAs may no longer have the whip-hand but central government certainly does. The system is now tightly controlled by a system of regulation so complex, overbearing and labyrinthine that to call it Byzantine would be a serious understatement".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches share the unease of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, at the peremptory consultation procedure in regard to the codes of practice that underlie these regulations. The time allowed for consultation was totally inadequate and the time of year at which it was undertaken was most inconvenient for all heads. We cannot expect to have proper consultation on codes of practice as important as these at that time of the year and over so short a period. It was thoughtless of the department to proceed in that way. If it intends to introduce these kinds of procedures, the department should give a little more thought to the best way of consulting people. If the Government want to get codes of practice and regulations that have a reasonable chance of being implemented onto the statute book, they should carry with them those who have to implement the regulations. Nowadays we seem to place more emphasis on the whole idea of ownership, and that is an issue that the department should think about to a greater extent.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para52"></a>Having said that, I have read through the regulations and I believe that they implement the Act we passed last year. As the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, said, they embody all the bureaucratic details that we predicted because of the degree to which the department is trying to micro-manage them, but, broadly speaking, the regulations derive from the changes brought about by the Act. We had lengthy discussions on those changes during the debate and we on these Benches are broadly supportive of them.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para53"></a>We are glad to see the more inclusive arrangements for admissions. We supported the whole concept of admissions forums, but I have one question for the Minister. I understood at the time the Bill was passed that admissions forums would relate to a local area, not necessarily to an LEA area; for example, that in Surrey we would take a group of schools within Guildford and establish an admissions forum to cover the Guildford area. This has been happening within Surrey, where we have tended to work with schools on admissions in local areas which have been broken down to provide geographical cohesion. It is quite clear that the regulations are concerned with LEA-wide admissions forums rather than in terms of breaking down areas, and I wonder whether the Minister wishes to say anything about that.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para54"></a>Regulation No. 2897 seems unnecessary. It relates to the publication of the information that LEAs, heads and governors are required to produce. Do we really <P>


<a name="column_977"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 977</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need to tell LEAs that they must publish the names and addresses of schools; that heads have to publish the names and addresses of governors and so on? That seems to be teaching LEAs, heads and governing bodies to suck eggs. However, the Government have made it quite clear that they do not trust them to do these things and have decided that it is necessary to go into this kind of detail.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para55"></a>I am sad about that because, as I said, there are aspects of the regulations which we welcome&#151;particularly in relation to the inclusion arrangements. We also welcome the fact that these arrangements cover simultaneously a whole range of schools&#151;voluntary aided and voluntary controlled, foundations and CTCs. I know that the Conservatives are not happy to see this, but we are pleased with the more comprehensive regulations and, in particular, with the attention given to looked-after children and children with special needs in regard to admissions regulations.
<P>

<a name="30127-04_para56"></a>Sadly, we accept that, ultimately, the regulations have to be detailed and bureaucratic. They fit in with the whole ethos that the Government are pushing forward. It is sad, but we on these Benches are prepared to back the Government in bringing the regulations forward.

<P>
<A NAME="30127-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, I can assure the House that I shall not keep anyone from their social engagements. I shall be brief. I wish to speak to these regulations because I have been approached by many people, through the various posts I hold, to express the deep distress that they feel about the way in which this issue has been carried through.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para0"></a>I need not dwell on what my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, have said about the consultation period. It was&#151;I use the word advisedly&#151;a disgrace. I am a governor of a Roman Catholic school, surprisingly. The Roman Catholic hierarchy had not a chance to consult each other because such a short time was allowed for consultation immediately before Christmas. I cannot speak for my own Church, but the same case applied. I am president of the National Grammar Schools Association which represents almost all the grammar schools. Not a word was sent to us. I am also a member of the National Association of Head Teachers. I seem to be unfortunate in the Government's spotlight as regards this matter.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para1"></a>I speak for four Roman Catholic schools of some excellence. The regulations will hit denominational schools hard as interviews are forbidden. As the Minister knows, denominational schools take their pupils from a very wide area. People from Downing Street go to Fulham, for example. The scope is even wider in the country. Priests in very large Catholic churches cannot know in detail the family situation. There may be six masses in the morning in an urban area with hundreds of people attending. How can a little cyclostyled letter, which is often what it is, give the headmaster the knowledge that he needs? The headmaster of a Catholic school, but not in London, I hasten to say, asked me this. The Government have <P>


<a name="column_978"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 978</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>done something which is quite wrong to denominational schools in the interests not of religion but of bureaucracy and interference.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para2"></a>The Government profess that they are not hostile towards grammar schools. They say that it is up to the communities. If they want to vote against them, that is all right, but the Government want to be counted out. These regulations do enormous harm to grammar schools because there is selective entry and the regulations make it impossible for parents to have second choice of the most decent school in the area. In essence, if a pupil fails to gain entry to a grammar school it goes to the school with the least pupils. That is not parental choice. It is an awful dilemma for parents. I cannot understand how a decent, democratic government can do this sort of thing when they are not prepared to abolish the schools themselves.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para3"></a>I wonder how these much-vaunted specialist schools can exist without interview or approach. For example, I may wish to go to a language school, but it would not know whether I know French from Dutch or whether I am interested in languages. What if I want to be a plumber and I find myself at a language school? How are the Government going to organise that?
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para4"></a> These proposals are a disgrace. I rarely become passionate about these things. I have been approached by so many people. There is a lack of consultation; lack of care for parental choice; bureaucracy and control from the centre. The only people who will benefit are of the independent sector because those who have money and who cannot get their child into the school of their choice will choose other schools. The Labour Party's policies kept me in a job and gave me a pension for 40 years and the same will apply to my successors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as editor of the Good Schools Guide. I am enormously disappointed by these regulations. They do nothing for parents, as my noble friend Lady Blatch and the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, have said. They make life more difficult for parents. They reduce choice in a practical sense and they inhibit the free exercise by parents of their choice which, in the end, is what drives schools' policy. It is difficult for parents and ultimately it will be damaging for schools in taking this route.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para5"></a>The regulations are a monument to bureaucracy. It is astonishing to have regulations which go into the detail of prescribing the order of examinations in which GCSE results are to be published. Does one have to go after every jot and tittle in regulations such as these and leave nothing for the schools as to how they choose to express themselves. They have to study the regulations to make sure that they have not put an English exam where it should not be, say, after biology rather than at the beginning. Why do these things need to be specified? The situation is the same throughout the regulations. There is far too much unnecessary detail.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para6"></a>I also find it sad that these are such backward-looking regulations. Last week value added examination results were published nationally for the <P>


<a name="column_979"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 979</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>first time. But there is no requirement in these regulations to publish value added data at all. We have the old-style results, but there is nothing about value added. But schools generally have a great deal of value-added information, which would be of great interest to parents beyond the examination results published in the league tables. If we had value-added results on the same basis as the publication of straight examination results published by schools, parents would have a great deal more information about how schools were performing in individual subjects and a greatly improved ability to compare schools, particularly when they have different catchment areas because the raw figures are always distorted by the quality of intake. But by not providing school by school value added results one is again making things much more difficult for parents seeking to choose between schools.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para7"></a>My own particular hobby-horse is the Internet. The year 2005 is supposed to be the time when we have electronic government. The composite prospectuses are to be published by local education authorities. They cannot pretend that they do not have the money and that they are not on the Net. The prospectuses do not have to be published on the Net or made available in an electronic form, yet nothing is being done to make it easier for parents to gather information on schools and compare them. It is astonishing how backward-looking the Government are and how full of froth and air on electronic government when the chance occurs to put something into practice. There is not even a requirement to publish e-mail and web addresses for schools. I find that astonishing and extremely disappointing.

<P>
<A NAME="30127-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, for drawing attention to the absence of my colleagues. They have been invited to No. 10 in order to tell the Prime Minister many things. I never intended to go. The first time I went there was in the company of Pierre Trudeau, John Conteh and Robert Morley. I am sure that my colleagues who have gone to No. 10 tonight will have an equally good evening.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para8"></a> The intriguing thing is that although my colleagues are absent, how is it that 25 Members of the Conservative Benches are here for regulations of this kind?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for allowing me to reply. I am surprised that he asked that question coming, as he does, from the same city and when he knows the disaster which will occur to parents choosing a school. He and I had the advantage of a system where he went to a grammar school as I did. Why does the noble Lord believe that we should not worry about this matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, one is always looking for pegs on which to hang a speech. I come from Newcastle upon Tyne and I was born on Scotswood Road. I passed the 11-plus to go to a <P>


<a name="column_980"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 980</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>secondary school. It was not a secondary modern. I went to an elementary school and then passed the exam. But because my dad was means-tested and I was the eldest of five kids, I could not go. Two years later I got the chance to sit an examination to go to a technical school. I passed that exam, but I could not go. It was only when the Open University arrived in the late 1960s that I had the opportunity of testing what I had always felt&#151;that I had a degree in me. The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, had the same privilege as I did to sit on the governing council of that university and I know that she will speak highly of that body.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para9"></a>Everyone has spoken with a detailed knowledge of the regulations. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, has asked many questions. I have every confidence that my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham will be able to respond to them. I was somewhat puzzled because the first part of her statement deal with the discourtesy contained in the consultation procedure. I shall remind the noble Baroness of many issues raised when she was the Minister on this side of the Chamber. Whenever issues of this kind were raised there were constant complaints about the quality of the consultation which had taken place. I can remember my noble friend Lady Blackstone, my noble friends Lord Peston, Lord Morris and others raising these kind of issues, but not in detail. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, was out of order when she talked about the incompetence of the department in this procedure. That may well have been the case, but I do not think that it is on for any Member of this House to castigate the civil servants who are here to look after our interests.

I cannot remember a single occasion since I have been a Member of this House when only 25 days were given for a consultation process. Nor can I remember such arbitrary handing out of the documents to be considered, which will impact on every parent and child in the land.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para10"></a> Secondly, I was not looking for a debate on which to hang my speech. I have spent a lot of time this weekend that I would rather have spent with my daughter working on these documents. It has taken a lot of hard work, and I positively resent what the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, has said. We care about this issue passionately. If the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, goes back to the statute book, he will find that I had this kind of debate when the Bill was going through Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30127-05_para11"></a>Finally, when I have to make three calls to the admissions section of a department which professes not even to know what I am asking, I have the right to call that incompetent.

<P>

<a name="30127-06_para0"></a>Forty years ago tonight, I was leader of Enfield council. During that period, I had the pleasure of serving on the governing body of a local school with Iain McLeod. He and I had a good rapport on all matters relating to the London borough of Enfield. In the middle and late 1960s, we were plunged into the process of comprehensive education. There is a great deal of understanding across the Chamber&#151;but not with the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch&#151;about the difficulties of managing a situation to which Enfield is no stranger. Because we have some excellent schools and because of the Greenwich decision, it is possible for pupils to have places in Enfield schools to the detriment of Enfield parents who wish their children to go there. That is a fact of life. It is not made any easier by the language used by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, this evening.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para1"></a>Some Enfield children are unable to go to Enfield schools because children from Barnet, Haringey and Waltham Cross have made a case to go to them. The Latymer School Edmonton in Enfield is a first-class school, which was top of the recent published lists because of the quality of its education and results. I simply say to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, of course she is the master of her own language, but it does no good in trying to get an understanding, not only from the Ministers but from the people out in the country, when she castigates the decisions that have been made.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para2"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, talked of the simplicity with which these matters could have been put right. In my experience, which is not as great as that of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, or of many others, it is a constant problem. Some thirty years ago, as a Member of Parliament, parents would plead with me that their child deserved a place in a certain school. It was impossible.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para3"></a>The authority in Enfield has changed hands&#151;it now has a Conservative majority. The same kind of problems and anguish that were visited on Enfield parents in the past few years will continue because there are far too many children for the places available. We will hear from the Minister on the detailed points, but I do not think that the debate or the issue is enhanced one bit by the language used by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mowbray and Stourton: </B>   My Lords, I have always regarded the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, as a friend of mine, and I have great admiration for him, but I think he is being a little unfair when he says that we are looking for something on which to hang a speech.

<P>

<a name="30127-06_para4"></a>I do not like making speeches; I bored your Lordships in years gone by when I was younger, time and time again, and I do not want to bore you again, but I feel very strongly about the Christian ethos in our schools. For quite a long time, when Roman Catholics were a small minority, I and my family fought for the right for Catholics to be educated in Catholic schools. We fought hard and have been very successful. I am occasionally asked to make the odd speech and give the odd prize at the odd Catholic school, so I know a little about this. The bishops of the Anglican and Roman Churches seem to have been hustled&#151;that is the only word that I can think of&#151;into agreeing something which, if they think about it, cannot be right. I find it very hard to understand that a school should have to take children without going into the ethos of their backgrounds.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para5"></a>One of the troubles in this country today is that so many people and so many children quite often do not realise what is wrong and what is right. It could be said that I am out of touch but, as your Lordships know, there are people who think some things are quite all right which we were brought up to think were sinful and wrong, and we know it in our hearts.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para6"></a>We will never get back a question of ethos if we once lose it. To think of denying it to these schools by trying to hustle them to stop interviews is quite impossible, as people in this House, with all their background knowledge, common sense and Christianity, should realise. Indeed, I do not mind what religion people follow&#151;believing and following one's beliefs are the only things that are important. But to tell me that we are looking for something to hang a peg on is not good enough.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to say that I was not educated in this country, so I do not really have to display the variety of backgrounds that we have seen. I could have come from or not gone to one school or another. But in the 38 years that I have lived here, I have found education, especially school education, to be the most class-ridden and prejudice-ridden subject that I have ever come across. I am astonished by that. It is not as if the old education system&#151;whatever that was&#151;of the glorious 1950s, 1960s and 1970s actually did the country much good. That was when we were known as the sick man of Europe. Therefore, whatever ethos or manners that the school system taught, it was a derided, class-ridden system that harmed the country no end.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para7"></a>In trying to repair the system, we sometimes need elaborate regulations. I am surprised that people say that these are very elaborate&#151;that is the legalese that we have to use. We pass Acts that contain Henry VIII clauses which require us to lay orders before Parliament, and it is not surprising that those orders are very detailed. That is the way that the law functions.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para8"></a>I refer to some recent reforms which sought to remove burdens by annulling certain regulations. I refer to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and documents of up to 300 pages in length that were drawn up just to keep pubs open on New <P>


<a name="column_983"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 983</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Year's Eve. Why do we draw up such documents? I do not know, but if you are going to do it, you must do it properly.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para9"></a>I have read the regulations and I wish to comment on them in some detail. They have one common theme; that is, to try to simplify the admissions procedures for primary and secondary schools. Many people talk about parental choice. It is a fallacy to believe that somehow choice can be permitted in a system in which the market does not apply. We are not talking about buying cheese or bananas but rather school admissions. If, as my noble friend Lord Graham said, a school is popular, it cannot raise the price of admission as that system does not apply in the schools we are discussing. There must be some kind of rationing mechanism in order to allocate places in schools where too many children apply for the available places. How can one do that? Obviously, one cannot do it without consulting other schools. As has been said, a popular Church school in west London is in consultation with 40 different local authorities surrounding it. That is the way such matters should be handled. We want to be just to the people who want to send their children to the best schools, but without being unjust to other people who also want to send their children to those schools. That is a difficult outcome to achieve.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para10"></a>I believe that the admission forums mentioned in Regulation No. 2900 are an excellent idea. The regulation seeks to co-ordinate admission policies of different schools in a wide catchment area to take into consideration the needs of an entire community. If a child cannot go to his school of first choice, the knowledge of all those running the various schools in the community, that of the local education authority and so on, can be co-ordinated to offer the second best choice to the particular pupil concerned. I do not see what is wrong with that as it is obvious that not every pupil can attend their school of first choice in a system which is based on rationing and not on the market. If people are suggesting that we abolish rationing and completely privatise primary and secondary education, that is a different matter. One hears stories of young mothers with small children staggering to a church to attend services when they are not interested in the relevant religion. They attend the services as that makes their child eligible for admission to the relevant Church school. Some people attend such services not through religious conviction but because they want their children to jump the admission queue for a certain school. Distortions occur when people claim to belong to certain religious sects when they are interested only in sending their children to certain schools. We have clearly reached a point when the present system will no longer function unless we take great care to improve it. As I say, I genuinely believe that the admission forums mentioned in Regulation No. 2900 are an excellent idea.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para11"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, pointed out, an interesting aspect of the matter is revealed in the relevant Explanatory Note. Like the noble Baroness, I prefer to use the Explanatory Note to Regulation <P>


<a name="column_984"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 984</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>No. 2900 as a background to my remarks rather than the body of the regulation itself. It states that one of the roles of an admission forum is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to monitor the admission of excluded children, looked after children, children with special educational needs and children who arrive outside the normal admission round; and to consider any other admissions issues arising".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-06_para12"></a>
When we talk about admissions we talk about parental choice, Church schools and grammar schools as if the only thing that the education system is supposed to do is to cater for those who are considered to be the brightest and the best and the rest can go hang. As my noble friend Lord Graham succinctly said, he was not given the best chance in his early days as, due to the way in which the education system was structured, it did not give the bulk of the people the best chance. What we are trying to do is improve everyone's chances.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para13"></a>Noble Lords may wonder why I am discussing secondary school education as I do not usually speak on that matter. I lived in Islington for 25 years and was chairman of the campaign for the advancement of state education. I used to publish a magazine from my house to advance the case of state education. Islington co-ordinated the running of secondary schools to improve quality. I was also chair of Islington Labour education group for a number of years. All my children attended local state comprehensive schools. I took a great interest in secondary schools as a manager and as a governor. Therefore, I am not a johnny-come-lately to the secondary school debate.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para14"></a>As I say, the admission forums are a good mechanism to look after the interests of excluded children. I am also impressed by Regulation No. 2899, which is inclusive, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said. I refer to appeals against expulsion. I refer to the welcome procedure outlined in the Explanatory Note which enables parents,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to appeal against school admission decisions, including decisions refusing permission to children already admitted to a school to enter the school's sixth form . . . to appeal against the authority's decision to admit a child who, at the time decision was made, has twice been permanently excluded from a school".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-06_para15"></a>
Exclusion from schools has made the headlines in recent times. It is to be welcomed that the Government are laying down detailed instructions on the matter.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para16"></a>I refer to the co-ordination of admissions to primary schools. I do not see what is wrong with that. I refer to the Explanatory Note to Regulation No. 2903 which states that local education authorities,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"are to refer their proposed schemes to the Admission Forum established for their area and to have regard to the Forum's advice or recommendations before consulting each governing body to whom a scheme is to apply".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-06_para17"></a>
That is a welcome proposition which will improve the way in which our schools are run. I refer also to the welcome proposition that local education authorities are to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"designate the single day in each year on which their determination as to the single offer of a primary school place which the parents of children in their area are to receive is to be communicated".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-06_para18"></a>
Those are good policies.
<P>


<a name="column_985"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 985</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para19"></a>Regulation No. 2901 concerns how objections to admission arrangements should be dealt with. The Explanatory Note to Regulation No. 2901 states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in circumstances where the admission authority for a school have determined an admission number for any relevant age group which is lower than the number indicated by the net capacity assessment method set out in guidance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-06_para20"></a><P>

<a name="30127-06_para21"></a>It is interesting that that relates to the parents' right to object, where parents may think that they have been unjustly handled. If the school has capacity but someone is not admitted, the parents are right to object because, after all, total capacity is the only rationing criterion one can use when prices cannot be used.
<P>

<a name="30127-06_para22"></a>There are a number of good detailed recommendations that we should definitely welcome because they will immensely improve the state of our schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak briefly on a particular point arising from an observation in the letter of the angry head teacher quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. Before I do so, I thank her for the opportunity to consider this important matter again.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para0"></a>I spoke to the head teacher of the Star Primary School in Newham near Canning Town this morning. She had taught for 30 years and been a head teacher for 18 years. From what she said, my clear impression was that she felt that head teachers were more in control now than they had been in the past. If I understood her correctly, she put that down to their having more control over the spending of the money that they received.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para1"></a>That may have been peculiar to that head teacher's position, because she was in an education action zone and various other zones. It is a deprived area&#151;it has a high level of free school meals&#151;so it is a beneficiary of many additional funding streams. Perhaps there is another issue about increased regulation if head teachers are more in control of funding. I look forward to hearing in the debate some more clarification on that subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   My Lords, the small group of my Labour colleagues who will speak tonight will enjoy two distinctions in the parliamentary history of this House. The first will be our unique numerical presence&#151;small but powerful&#151;and the second will be the fact that each of us, at different lengths, has something important to say.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para2"></a>I speak as a volunteer, not a conscript, to make three points. Access to education is the objective of all decent families for the benefit of their children, but that access needs to be achieved in a way that balances the autonomy of schools and the ability of people to exercise a choice to try to get into good schools.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para3"></a>First, I am dismayed by some of the comments made about the faith background to the regulations and how they may affect faith schools. I attended the debate on the Bill on admission forums, and I do not recall anyone suggesting that the relevant part of the Bill or <P>


<a name="column_986"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 986</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the regulations would act as a vehicle to undermine, in broad terms, the ability of faith schools to regulate the number of pupils from their own faiths.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, that is why the schools are also very cross. I too was present at those debates, and I think that I supported the noble Lord in what he said then. However, I can tell him that nothing in those debates indicated that interviews as part of the process of faith schools were to be abolished. One of my questions is to ask where in the legislation is the basis for banning interviewing as part of the process, rather than it simply being in the code of practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   My Lords, to return to the point that I was making, I do not regard the regulations as some back-door opportunity to subvert the right of faith schools to regulate in decent proportion those numbers of children in their schools from their own faiths. If I am wrong, I invite the Minister so to state. If I am right in thinking that the regulations are not such a back door, I am sure that he will make that abundantly clear.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para4"></a>My second point goes to the issue of interviews. I understand from my own experience that, in times past, admission to faith schools has not been solely determined by interview. Therefore, we do not have a state of affairs in which an existing system of admission by interview is being abolished, to repeat the phrase used by the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para5"></a>I wish to make a practical point as a lawyer. It seems to me an illusion to think that faith schools throughout this country can manage entry by interview alone. The numbers will be enormous, and the practicality of it fraught with difficulty for the schools and the teachers. As a lawyer, I am afraid to say that the interviews, especially for those who were disappointed, would become the vehicle for appeals and, perhaps even worse, judicial review.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para6"></a>It is an ideal that children and their families should be interviewed, of course, but it is hopelessly impractical. I simply do not recognise the validity of any suggestion that the bishops in my Church, the Catholic Church, have deserted their faith schools or been hustled into something that they do not approve. That is simply not the case as I understand it.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para7"></a> On my third proposition, I invite the Minister to give his express views. Autonomy for schools and choice for parents need to balance, in terms of regulation. The one must be fairly set against the other. I must confess that having nine sets of regulations seems a volumetrically excessive attempt to achieve that balance. They are so complex in their detail as to suggest that there may be trouble with them. I invite him to confirm that, in view of the comments made by the Opposition, in the course of the coming year the implementation of the regulations will be reviewed, and that changes will be made if necessary. In introducing such a new system of debate about admissions, it would be wrong to give the impression to people that the system was fixed and irrevocable.
<P>


<a name="column_987"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 987</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para8"></a>Those are my three points. First, will the Minister confirm that the standards of faith schools will not be subverted by the regulations? Secondly, interviews are not the only route. Thirdly, in due course the effect of the regulations should be reviewed. The objective that I first described should be the objective at the end of such a review. Is the system working fairly, so that people are being given a choice&#151;so that parents who want their children to go to faith schools know that they will go to such schools? I would not dream of voting for any regulations that subverted that democratic principle.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, I share the noble Lord's view. I do not think that anyone said what he suggested they had done of Roman Catholic bishops; it was that they did not have much time. I am sure that he will support me when I say that Roman Catholic parents who cannot afford independent schools should have the same rights as parents who can afford independent schools to send their children to the faith school of their choice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   My Lords, I heard the intervention, but I must confess that I did not entirely follow it. I understand that the present set of regulations seeks to allow a reasonable opportunity for parents to make application to the school of their choice. Irrelevant to that is the ability to pay or not, which I am afraid reflects the economic facts of life.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_time0"></a><H5>7.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to help the people in Downing Street any more; many others have done that for them. My point was that a person who could afford independent Catholic education could send their child to Downside, Ampleforth or wherever. However, if the child's education were dependent on a chit from the parish priest, very devout Catholics could fail to get into the state school of their choice. That is where I support the noble Lord on review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   My Lords, I confess that I still do not understand the comparison between a rich person who can pay for their child to get into a school and those who are not rich and need to approach a priest for a chit, as the noble Lord called it. The fact is that in times past entry to Catholic schools and other faith schools has worked with reasonable efficiency. I do not accept that the regulations are cloaked with the dire effects that Opposition Members have suggested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I have listened to this debate with great interest. Everyone seems to agree for different reasons that this is an important issue. It is therefore difficult to understand&#151;this is the point that still worries me&#151;why there was not time for consultation, particularly of the people who would have to operate the <P>


<a name="column_988"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 988</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arrangement and those who will have to suffer from it or&#151;this may be so&#151;benefit from it. If this is worth doing, it is surely worth proper consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who participated in this debate. It is far better to be here than at some rumoured party at No. 10. I have enjoyed every moment of the debate.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para9"></a>I hope to respond adequately to the wide range of points. I shall begin with consultation, which was raised last&#151;it was also raised first, by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. I shall endeavour to answer the wide range of questions raised by the noble Baroness. Should I fail in any respect, I assure her that I shall write to her with the answers to any questions that I may have omitted to answer. At the start of this debate, I was in the blissful state of hoping that we were engaging in a limited debate to which I could give extensive time and consideration to the noble Baroness's every question. However, she will recognise that I should need to speak for three-quarters of an hour to respond adequately&#151;I must respond to a number of other contributions&#151;which would bring considerable criticism on me.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para10"></a>I shall deal first with consultation. We sought to ensure that admissions for 2004 should work on the basis of the new arrangements. Working back from 2004, we are fiercely constrained by parliamentary procedures and time limits in terms of the stage at which we must table the code. Our difficulty involved the 40 days of parliamentary time available for praying against the code. I give a straightforward apology to the noble Baroness, who should have been informed that the code was to be laid. I gather that such an undertaking had been given but it was not fulfilled. That is a straightforward apology.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para11"></a>It was necessary to lay the code on 15th November in order to meet the parliamentary timetable, and it was up to the Opposition in this place and another place to pray against the code if they wanted to do so. Laying the code at that date in order to get the principles in place for January and therefore the implementation of the new arrangements meant that the timetable for consultation was more limited than we should have wished. We recognise that that placed considerable pressure on people who wanted to respond.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para12"></a>We set out so far as we could to meet the needs of those who deserved to have been, and should have been, consulted. We were aware of those who have a direct interest in the matter. We targeted admission authorities because they would have the most direct interest in the changes to the regulations, and we consulted LEAs as the admission authorities of community and voluntary controlled schools. We consulted a representative sample of foundation and voluntary-aided schools that were responsible for admission to their schools, and a smaller sample of other non-admission-authority schools. We are open to the criticism that we did not have a consultation process that meant that every school in the country was consulted directly. That would have been a gargantuan task. Our process of consultation involved <P>


<a name="column_989"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 989</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>all those most directly affected as admission authorities. We did the best for them in our time frame to ensure that the consultation was carried out.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para13"></a>We acknowledge all of that. The Act was passed, as noble Lords will recall, in July last year. The time frame in which to implement the regulations has been more limited, which imposes constraints. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, suggested, the regulations and the code fulfil the concepts, ideas and themes of the Bill that was before the House last summer and which passed into law at the end of the summer. She said that within the framework there now appeared to be only a reference to local education authorities, rather than to sub-divisions of such authorities, which would be more appropriate in terms of admission arrangements. I give her that assurance. We recognise her example from the Guildford area and that, more widely across the country, it might be appropriate if the admission authorities were a sub-division of the local forum and not the local authority in total.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para14"></a>We are dealing with a code, the regulations prior to the code and a framework that was embodied in the Act, which was duly passed by both Houses. We are committed to ensuring that the admission arrangements work to the best possible extent for all parents and children in an area. That is our objective.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para15"></a>Inevitably, the moment at which one uses the word "admission"&#151;to say nothing of "selection", which was raised earlier in our debate&#151;the House responds with considerable passion; those are fundamental issues in education. That is perhaps why we had a larger number of participants in this debate than would normally be expected for such orders. Views have been expressed with considerable passion. I respect those views entirely; I entirely respect the views of my noble friends Lord Graham and Lord Desai, who emphasised why we regard certain processes of selection as unacceptable. However, that does not apply simply to us; I need not reiterate the old and obvious fact that it was Conservative administrations who ended selection in more authorities than Labour governments have done. There is consistent emphasis from the Conservative side on choice, but they also know that parental choice does not hold sway in relation to selection but the decision of the school about whether the student should be accepted by the school authority.
<P>

<a name="30127-07_para16"></a>There was a word from the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, about headmasters and headmistresses not being involved in the selection process. That is merely because the regulation refers to the legal concept of the governing body being responsible as a legal entity for admission. The headmaster and headmistress play their part within the framework of the governing body and under the arrangements that the governing body makes.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the code states that head teachers have no role in the admissions process. Those are the words in chapter 7 of the code, and there is a full stop at the end of the sentence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the code seeks to emphasise there that we do not expect individual <P>


<a name="column_990"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 990</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>students to be interviewed by head teachers and then be selected by them. Heads play their part in governing bodies. It is absolutely clear that heads are involved in a school's admission policy. How could they possibly exercise their dual authority and responsibilities to a school if they did not influence the governing body significantly in relation to the school's admissions process?
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para0"></a>Another dimension of this debate which aroused considerable passion was whether the regulations suggested to Catholic authorities that interviews were no longer permissible. That is not the case with regard to the ethos of Catholic schools. The Government were approached by the Catholic authorities, which, like the Anglican Church, took the view that interviews were no longer regarded as the best basis for admission to faith schools. The code merely responds to that initiative. As the noble Lord, Lord Mowbray, indicated, better ways exist than interviews to ensure that the ethos of schools is protected and there are better ways of ensuring that the requisite information is received in evaluating the student. I give way to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. Of course, everyone involved in the process must have regard to the code. The code refers to all the Acts of statute that must be obeyed and by which everyone is obliged to act. Where in statute does it say that interviews cannot, should not and may not take place? The code cannot ban them; they must be banned in legislation. I cannot find that in the regulations and I do not believe it was set out in the Bill that became an Act. Therefore, will the noble Lord tell me which law a school will be breaking if it includes interviews as part of its admissions process?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the school will be offending the code, which derives from last year's Education Act. It was not the first education Act to have implied a code of this kind, and this is not the first code that we have had. The code is a derivative of its predecessor, which embraced a large number of the same concepts. For a considerable period of time&#151;ever since the introduction of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998&#151;we have had to have admissions procedures.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para1"></a>We are cogniscant of the fact that admissions procedures arouse controversy. Nevertheless, 96 per cent of parents are offered a place for their child at a school for which they have expressed a preference. That is good news but we know that we can do better than that. Our research shows that parents find the process of choosing and applying for school places less stressful and easier when admission arrangements are co-ordinated. That is the basis of the new code and that is why it was presaged in the Act passed last year.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para2"></a>It was felt that, through the construction of admissions forums, more effective communication could take place with people in a locality so that they would better understand the co-ordination of admission arrangements. That would result in one obvious benefit. Parents fill in one form for all the <P>


<a name="column_991"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 991</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>available schools and they include their order of preference. Instead of parents having to weigh up whether or not a school is likely to offer their child a place, holding that position against an alternative choice and often being in considerable distress in balancing one possibility against another, we are now ensuring that there is co-ordination in the admission arrangements of a local authority area. That benefit from the code was presaged in the Bill which became an Act and it was generally approved of in the House.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para3"></a>We recognise that a number of questions have been raised about many other parts of the regulations. If the noble Lord will forgive me, I have a considerable argument to deploy in respect of the admissions forums regulations. I shall also seek to answer the questions properly addressed to me, many of which came from the noble Lord's Front Bench. I emphasise that the admissions forums regulations make provision for the establishment of forums, which will ensure that co-ordination exists across the local areas. I emphasise once again to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that local devolution will ensure that such areas can be smaller than the local authority.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para4"></a>With regard to the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, about co-ordinating arrangements and the legal obligations in respect of parents' preferences, of course the obligations will be honoured. Parents express a preference. The LEA simply sets up a co-ordinating scheme in deciding which single offer should be made where a child is eligible to be admitted to more than one school. Of course, a place will usually be offered at the school which the parent has ranked the highest. That is why the majority of places across the country are allocated according to the first choice of the parents involved. Controversy inevitably occurs where that does not obtain.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para5"></a>There will also be a single offer date. All parents will find out the results of their application and will receive an offer of a place at the same time. That is significantly better than our current arrangements and is the basis upon which the code is established.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para6"></a>The regulations also clarify the conditions under which a proposal to vary an admission number, following approval of statutory appraisals, need not be referred to the schools adjudicator. Therefore, we are ensuring that the admission arrangements for each school and the numbers involved are public and are recognised as part of the overall provision for the local authority.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para7"></a>The objection to the adjudicator's admission numbers&#151;a matter addressed to me by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch&#151;replicates the existing provision whereby parents can object to standard numbers variations through the statutory proposal system. The adjudicator will consider such an objection, as he does all others. Therefore, we are not changing the role of the adjudicator with regard to the crucial matter of the numbers which each school makes available.
<P>


<a name="column_992"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para8"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, also raised questions on a number of other issues. I shall deal with one aspect, which my noble friend Lord Brennan emphasised strongly. The noble Baroness also referred to the article in today's Daily Telegraph. That is not based upon fact. Nothing is imposed by this Government that makes issues connected with the interview process compulsory for Catholic schools. We have been involved in consultation on the best procedures for selection and for ensuring that the ethos of schools is maintained.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para9"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, also asked about the adjudicator's powers so far as concerns grammar schools, colleges of technology and academies. The powers of the adjudicator are not extended by these regulations; it is not possible to remove selection. As she recognises, the only way that selection can be removed is through a ballot sought by parents&#151;a process which, as she knows only too well, thus far has been pursued on only one occasion.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para10"></a>The noble Baroness also raised the question of additional burdens on schools and reference was made to the LEA composite prospectus. That is not an additional burden and there is no new requirement here. LEAs already publish prospectuses with all their schools' admissions arrangements and this regulation merely updates that.
<P>

<a name="30127-08_para11"></a>I take on board the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that we should have additional information on the basis of "value added" with regard to schools. We could not make that provision now because at present we do not have a full range of value-added statistics. The noble Lord will know that in certain areas the statistics relating to schools were first published only recently. However, in due course, value-added information will become available and the noble Lord is right to say that it should be made available. He is also right that we should encourage the development of modern technology, such as websites, so that parents can consult and obtain the information that they need on-line. All that lies a little way in the future. However, we recognise the validity of the case that the noble Lord makes and shall seek to respond to it as and when we can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, the first question that I asked of the Government when they were first elected in 1997 was whether they would reply to my Written Questions by e-mail. I received a similar reply to the one that the Minister has just given. They still cannot do it. I hope that the Department for Education and Skills can do better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I take on board what the noble Lord has said. I have heard him mention that he received such a reply before. I was not seeking to repeat it verbatim. I was expressing the intention that as much as possible we seek to make education information available on-line. He will be aware of the enormous drive to put computers in schools. We shall make the information available to parents as rapidly as we can, although he will recognise <P>


<a name="column_993"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 993</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the quality of the information with regard to value added requires a substantial amount of work. For that reason it is bound to come out in discrete areas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-08_spnew6"></A><B> A noble Lord: </B>   Is the noble Lord going to sit down?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030127/text/30127-09.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, as ever I am seeking to be fair to participants in the debate as well as to colleagues who have joined us a little late. I am mindful of the fact that if I were unfair to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, in my attempt to answer her questions, she would upbraid me the moment she gets to the Dispatch Box, so perhaps I am saving time by answering the questions as fully as I can.
<P>

<a name="30127-09_para0"></a>We have had an interesting debate on the code. As I have indicated, we would have wanted wider consultation before the introduction of the code. We did our best to consult all the major parties. The noble Baroness always makes the point that all schools should be consulted on everything at all times, while at the same time saying that all schools should have the minimum amount of bureaucracy, mail and paper coming through their doors. I shall leave that small contradiction for another day.
<P>

<a name="30127-09_para1"></a>I appeal to the House to recognise that in the code the Government are implementing legislation that was duly considered at great length last year&#151;I participated in one or two of the debates&#151;and passed by this House and the lower House. The code merely implements the principles that that legislation brought into force.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, there are many happy bunnies on the Government Back Benches. They have all been to their party&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-09_spnew2"></A><B> A noble Lord: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-09_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I can tell the noble Lord a story. I was approached by the Minister's Chief Whip and asked to keep all the speeches on this side of the House to a minimum. We tried to arrange it so that I would speak, then my noble friend Lord Pilkington, followed by perhaps one or two others. I was told that the speech from the Front Bench opposite would be brief so that everyone could go to their party uninterrupted. However, there has been the most successful filibuster that I have ever witnessed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Baroness would recognise that a 21-minute opening speech may also be considered part of the filibuster.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the Minister and the Chief Whip knew that there were nine regulations and a code of practice and that they could not be dealt with quickly. I could have talked for another 20 minutes because I am unhappy about so much in the regulations.
<P>

<a name="30127-09_para2"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Pilkington that the consultation was a disgrace. It was not right, at the beginning of term, to give primary and secondary <P>


<a name="column_994"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column 994</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>schools nine regulations and two voluminous codes of practice to respond to in 25 days. The Minister has just told my noble friend Lady Park of Monmouth that the reason for that was to put the regulations in place by 2004. The Minister's code of practice says that the LEAs will be obliged to have co-ordinated schemes for the 2005 intake, so there was no hurry for the consultation to take place. As a result of consultation the time was extended, so they could have had more time and it would have been possible for there to be a better response.
<P>

<a name="30127-09_para3"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, speaks for the Catholic Church, and for Catholic church schools. I implore the noble Lord to talk to some of the heads, particularly of the London schools, which would not entail a long journey. They are outraged because they did not know about this matter. I was one who was told that the code had not been published when it had been. The heads did not know about it and when they looked at the website it was not there. They regard the matter as important for some of the reasons given by my noble friend Lord Pilkington. They are very cross that a response was given by the head of the Catholic Church and the head of the Anglican Church without any consultation with them whatever. I speak for them and I believe that they should be supported. There is no one else to speak up for them. The Government will not, nor will the Liberal Democrats, so I shall; I am not ashamed to do so.
<P>

<a name="30127-09_para4"></a>The Minister made one point that I welcome. He said that the article in the Daily Telegraph was not about making anything compulsory for faith schools. That is not the case. I welcome that. The article was written because John Clare of the Daily Telegraph, myself and the heads of the faith schools believe that from now on they will not be allowed to interview for admissions. That is not in law; it is not in the regulations; it is in the code of practice only and codes of practice are not law. They explain the practice and they refer to statutes but they are not law. Therefore, it will be possible for faith schools, if they wish, to have regard to the code of practice and to take the view that admissions should form part of their process. I welcome what the Minister said, that nothing in that is compulsory and therefore we need not be concerned.
<P>

<a name="30127-09_para5"></a>The Minister did not say what are the limited powers of adjudicators or what powers they had over grammar schools. It would be helpful if he could write to me on that point.
<P>

<a name="30127-09_para6"></a> I suggested a way of keeping down bumf for schools: a letter to all schools and all relevant bodies telling them that there were to be laid before Parliament nine regulations and two codes of practice and that if they were interested they could gain the information from the website&#151;it would be helpful if that were continuously on the website&#151;and if they wished they could have hard copies. The Minister said that the relevant people who had a direct interest were informed, but that is not right. The National Grammar Schools Association was not informed and a large tract of the regulations deals with admissions to grammar schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-10_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman </B>   moved Amendment No. 93A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 18, line 30, after "country" insert "as defined in subsection (9)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-10_para11"></a><P>

<a name="30127-10_para12"></a>The noble Viscount said: The amendments would clarify the exact definition of a "participating country". On page 30, we are told that it means,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a member State on a day appointed for the commencement of that provision",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-10_para13"></a>
and that the Secretary of State may, by order, add other countries. The Bill does not tell us the qualifications for becoming a participating country. Could any country become a participating country? When will the Secretary of State make an order designating a country?
<P>

<a name="30127-10_para14"></a>The British Bankers' Association has raised concerns about the matter, as it feels that Britain should ensure that the information that we will be able to obtain will be not less, nor less timely, than that which the UK will normally provide. We should ensure that there will not be differences due to different laws, bank secrecy rules or banking procedures, which affect access to information, particularly if the retail banking structure is less concentrated than that in the UK. Such differences could reduce the benefits from more ready access to information derived from other states relative to the cost to the UK of providing such information in response to requests for mutual legal assistance.
<P>

<a name="30127-10_para15"></a>We would welcome assurances that other countries would provide the same service as we would, and we are anxious that no other countries should be added to the list without having implemented similar provisions. We should not forget the cost of complying with customer information orders. Surely we do not <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>want to overburden small banks without, at least, ensuring that we can expect a similar service in return. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-10_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I support the amendment very much. The Minister explained that different countries dealt with such matters at different speeds. It would be wrong to have an arrangement with a country that was not reciprocal. I hope that the Minister can give a satisfactory reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-10_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Filkin): </B>  The amendments address the meaning of the term "participating country" in respect of the provisions on banking information. The definition in Clause 52 allows the designation of different countries as "participating" for the purpose of different provisions. It provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A participating country, in relation to any provision of this Part, means a country . . . which is a member State on a day appointed for the commencement of that provision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-10_para16"></a>
That enables us to designate certain states in relation to certain provisions. The provisions in Chapter 4 will apply between countries participating in the protocol, which might include countries other than EU member states.
<P>

<a name="30127-10_para17"></a>It is possible that, in contrast to the provisions implementing the framework decision on orders freezing evidence, the provisions could be extended beyond the EU. For example, we understand that Norway and Iceland, which are members of Schengen, are interested in participating in MLAC and the protocol. Another example is Switzerland, which is negotiating to participate in Schengen. Should that be agreed, Switzerland would have the same opportunity to participate in the protocol as other states that are part of Schengen and not part of the EU. It might therefore be appropriate in the future to designate Norway and Iceland and other countries yet to join Schengen as participating countries for the purpose of Chapter 4.
<P>

<a name="30127-10_para18"></a>As well as seeking to restrict the application of the provisions to European Union member states, the amendments&#151;I recognise that they are probing amendments&#151;would ensure that they applied only between member states that had implemented the protocol, once all 15 had implemented it. Presumably, the concern is that other member states would be able to make such requests from the UK without being able to reciprocate, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, suggested. That fear is unfounded. Member states will have had to ratify the protocol before being able to make such a request and therefore would be in a position to respond to similar UK requests.
<P>

<a name="30127-10_para19"></a>The protocol can enter into force before all 15 member states have implemented it. Article 13 states that it shall,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"enter into force in the eight member states concerned 90 days after the notification [of completion of implementation formalities by] the state . . . which is the eighth to complete that formality".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-10_para20"></a>
So, it is possible that the UK will seek and provide the new types of assistance on a reciprocal basis with the other member states that have implemented the <P>


<a name="column_GC119"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protocol, even if not all are participating, assuming that the UK is not the last member state to complete its implementation procedures. There is no reason why we should not participate at the earliest opportunity. These are valuable provisions that will assist law enforcement here and elsewhere in the EU.
<P>

<a name="30127-10_para21"></a>I hope that that explanation has addressed the concerns raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour. There is nothing of risk or harm in the measures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-11_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour for raising the point. There should be equal treatment as between the different participating members. We will return to that subject. In the mean time, I am grateful to the Minister for that full explanation, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-11_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman </B>   moved Amendment No. 94:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 18, line 34, leave out ", or arrange for a constable to apply,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-11_para1"></a><P>

<a name="30127-11_para2"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving Amendment No. 94, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 96C, 98A and 101A.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para3"></a>This is a probing amendment to see who it is that the Government envisage will apply for a customer information order. I note that the Minister is trying to extend the list of appropriate applicants by adding Customs officers. May we have a clarification of the word "constable"? Could it mean any police officer? Given the nature of the orders, would not it be wiser to allow only senior police officers to apply for such an order? Do the definitions mirror those in other countries with similar legislation?
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para4"></a>Once again, we are conscious of how much the orders would cost to process and of the time involved, on the part not only of the police force involved but of the financial institutions. We fully support having the ability to obtain such information to deal with international crime, but we must also safeguard ourselves&#151;and other countries&#151;from the vexatious use of such orders. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I warmly support my noble friend's amendment. Constables vary so much in their abilities and their sense of responsibility that it would be wrong to put the statutory power into their hands. I hope that the Government will leave that provision out.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para5"></a>I also warmly support Amendment No. 95, which is in the same group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   With the present drafting, the constable can apply for a customer information order or an account monitoring order only on the instruction of a senior officer. He cannot make an application off his own bat. The senior officer will always be accountable for the decision to seek the order but will not have to spend time going off to a court to put in the application in person.
<P>


<a name="column_GC120"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para6"></a>Requiring applications for customer information orders or account monitoring orders always to be made in person by a senior officer would impose a disproportionate burden on the police and would not be a sensible use of senior officers' time. Clause 46 states that a senior police officer must be at least of superintendent rank&#151;in other words, two ranks above constable. I hope that what I have said and what the Bill says will put noble Lords' minds at rest. Constables will not act on their own authority but can do so only under direct instructions.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para7"></a>The Bill follows existing practice, as constables already have similar powers in relation to money laundering investigations under Section 378 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which defines constables as "appropriate officers". As is made clear elsewhere in Chapter 4, CIOs and AMOs sought because of requests under the protocol have been equated with those for money laundering investigations under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para8"></a>In response to the question on what is happening with other member states and participating countries, as the legislation is new, we are not aware of their precise arrangements for implementing the provision.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para9"></a>Furthermore, it is likely that the request for an order will arise from an ongoing investigation, on which it is likely that the constable, not the senior officer, will have in-depth knowledge. If a case arises where it is appropriate for a senior officer to make the application in person, the present drafting allows for that flexibility. Given that we think it right that a constable be able to apply for an order on the authorisation of a senior officer, it follows that constables should also be able to make applications to discharge or to vary an order. An order may be discharged or varied if, for example, the requesting authority no longer requires the information, or can narrow down the banks from which the information was sought, possibly on the basis of additional information obtained from other aspects of its domestic investigation.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para10"></a>The government amendments are included in this group, as they raise a similar issue regarding the seniority of officers who can apply for such orders. They allow Customs officers to exercise the power to apply for account monitoring and customer information orders. That is consistent with the Proceeds of Crime Act 2000, which also permits Customs officers to apply for the equivalent domestic orders to assist their investigation. It would be illogical not to allow them to apply for orders of this type in response to overseas requests falling within the Customs investigative remit. In line with the approach taken to police officers, the amendments would also allow senior Customs officers to instruct other Customs officers to apply for such orders under their supervision. The reasons are identical to those already outlined with regard to police officers.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para11"></a>I hope that Committee Members will agree that, to be fully effective, the Bill should be consistent with existing legislation, and should ensure that law enforcement officers are fully equipped to tackle money laundering and financial crime.

<br>
(a) the authority referred to in subsection (2) has included in its application a full explanation of its reasons behind the application, and
<br>
(b) the Secretary of State is satisfied that those reasons are sufficient to justify the issuing of the customer information order."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30127-11_para17"></a>The noble Viscount said: This point has already been covered in part in other amendments. Again, the British Bankers' Association is particularly concerned with it. Although we agree that there are clear grounds for doing so, the appropriate person applying for a customer information order in connection with a serious offence can be only a positive move in the fight against crime. However, we truly hope that these orders will not become fishing expeditions by police authorities who may suspect some wrongdoing but have no real proof.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para18"></a>This is not just a use of an intrusive order. It may also lead to the over-use of such orders, the danger of which in terms of cost and time I have already outlined to the Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My noble friend Lord Bridgeman is right to suggest that the authority concerned should give a full explanation of its reasons; otherwise, frivolous applications could be made.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para19"></a>I am sure that my noble friend will not mind my suggesting an alternative way of achieving his purpose. A more compact way of making the point might be to include in subsection (2) a provision that the authority should give a full explanation of its reasons. On principle, my noble friend has raised a point that must be met.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I support in principle the amendment. Article 1(4) of the protocol to the MLAC 2001 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The authority making the request shall, in the request:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-11_para20"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;state why it considers that the requested information is likely to be of substantial value for the purpose of the investigation into the offence;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-11_para21"></a><P>


<a name="column_GC122"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;state on what grounds it presumes that banks in the requested Member State hold the account and, to the extent available, which banks may be involved;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-11_para22"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;include any information available which may facilitate the execution of the request".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-11_para23"></a>
At any rate, paragraph (a) of Amendment No. 95A would simply introduce a summary of Article 1(4) of the protocol; therefore there is considerable justification for it. I can see why it would be undesirable for the receiving body to have to investigate whether the facts, as set out in the information, are correct. It would be inappropriate to ask for the facts to be proved, but there is at least a possibility that, in some cases, it will be apparent from the information provided that it is not an appropriate order to seek. In such cases, it would be appropriate to have some way of questioning the matter. On that basis, I am happy to support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   We understand the reasoning behind the questioning on these clauses. But, in practice, for the reasons I shall set out, we do not believe that legislative change is necessary. Clause 32 allows the Secretary of State to respond to requests for customer information orders received from authorities in participating countries. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, the Bill already obliges overseas authorities to show that their request for a customer information order relates to the subject of an investigation into serious criminal conduct. So the authority making the request must state what it is about.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para24"></a>Any such requests would be made under Article 1 of the 2001 protocol to the MLAC. Article 1 states that the authority making the request shall explain why the information is likely to be of substantial value to its investigation; give its reasons for believing that the banks in the requested member states hold relevant accounts; and supply any further relevant information.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para25"></a>Clause 32(3) makes clear that the issue of whether to respond to an overseas request is at the discretion of the Secretary of State. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may direct a senior police officer to apply".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-11_para26"></a>
If the Secretary of State is not satisfied that the request meets the requirements of the protocol, including the provision of the information required by the protocol, he will not take it further.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para27"></a>A further level of discretion is involved in applications for CIOs from overseas. Clause 32 allows the Secretary of State only to direct a police officer to apply for a CIO. The issue of the order depends on Clause 33, which sets out that the making of an order is at the discretion of the judge, who must be satisfied that the conditions of Clause 33(1) are met.
<P>

<a name="30127-11_para28"></a>The protocol that these clauses implement imposes, therefore, a heavier burden of proof on those seeking this type of assistance in recognition that such assistance, while essential and valuable, is potentially more burdensome than a mere traditional mutual legal assistance request. We think that the degree of justification provided by the protocol, combined with <P>


<a name="column_GC123"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the discretion allowed by Clauses 32 and 33, achieves the right balance. Therefore, there is no need for further legislative entrenchment, since the protocol requires detailed justification of requests, and we have maintained the discretion not to comply with them if they do not meet the criteria in the opinion of either the Secretary of State or the court, on making the order. I hope that I have addressed the concerns raised on the amendments.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   That was an interesting reply. As the Minister said, Clause 33 provides that the judge must be satisfied that the order is sought for the purposes of the investigation. If he does not know the precise reason for the request for the order, how can he know that it is sought for the purposes of the investigation? I appreciate that we are balancing protecting those who bank with banks and so on with our determination to catch the criminals, and that it is a difficult balance to strike. However, can the judge know that the order is sought for the purposes of the investigation if he does not know the precise reason for the request?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I would not want to second-guess judicial discretion, but, essentially, the judge will look at the information and evidence that he has before him when he has to discharge his duty under the Act. If he is not satisfied with that information, he will say no to the request. It will then be up to the requesting authority to provide further and better particulars. One hopes that it does not reach that stage because it would be a waste of the court's time. One therefore hopes that the prior discretion which the Secretary of State can exercise will have been exercised vigorously to ensure that such requests do not reach court unless the Secretary of State feels that the duty under the Act had been adequately answered by the information provided by the requesting state.
<P>

<a name="30127-12_para0"></a>In practice, that will not blind the relevant officials administering the arrangements. If they are in doubt, they will ask for further information, until they feel that it is reasonable for the Secretary of State to exercise his discretion to allow a request to go before the court. So it should not be a passive process. If there is any doubt at an earlier stage, the Secretary of State or, more likely, his officials will have challenged the adequacy of the order by the means I have outlined.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   That is what my noble friend Lord Bridgeman is saying in Amendment No. 95A. The Minister seems to be saying that what my noble friend wants will happen anyway if the Secretary of State and his officials do their job. Is that right?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Yes; I was really giving a further gloss on how, in the situation which the noble Baroness instanced&#151;of a judge being in some hesitation&#151;one would hope that, if the Home Office officials had done their work vigorously, they would already have challenged a draft order which seemed to them to <P>


<a name="column_GC124"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-12_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   I am grateful for that explanation. Returning to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, we are always modest in our requests. I feel that the provisions of the protocol should be incorporated in the legislation.

<A NAME="30127-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Yes; I am grateful to the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="30127-12_para4"></a>Customer information orders under Clause 32, account monitoring orders under Clause 35 and the equivalent Scottish orders under Clauses 37 and 40 intrude into the right of privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They will contravene Article 8 unless they are justifiable as being prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society and so on.
<P>

<a name="30127-12_para5"></a>The Bill would normally be interpreted so as not to conflict with convention rights. However, I have some concern with the wording of Clause 32(7), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A customer information order has effect in spite of any restriction on the disclosure of information (however imposed)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-12_para6"></a>
Similar provisions appear in Clauses 35(6), 37(7) and 40(6). Article 8 could be read as a restriction on the disclosure of information which is excluded by Clause 32(7) and the other subsections to which I referred. I hope that the noble Lord will be able to confirm that it is not in fact the intention of the Bill to exclude the convention rights imposed by the Human Rights Act in considering whether a customer information order or an accounts monitoring order can be made. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The amendments would insert explicit references to the safeguards provided by the Human Rights Act in the four clauses covering provision of customer information and account information. For reasons which I shall seek to explain, we consider this to be unnecessary and even potentially confusing. The Joint Committee on Human Rights raised this issue. Having considered it again, I am satisfied that the response that I gave to the Committee was appropriate. I shall try to explain why.

<a name="30127-12_para7"></a>Customer information orders and account monitoring orders potentially engage Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, but the respect for private and family life enshrined in Article 8(1) is qualified by Article 8(2). Any proportionate infringement of Article 8(1) must be justified if it is in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society in the interests of the prevention of disorder or crime or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. For that reason, the Government consider that the making of customer information and account monitoring orders in the circumstances set out in the identified clauses is justified within Article 8(2).
<P>

<a name="30127-12_para8"></a>As the Committee well knows, these provisions support the fight against international crime. They will enable the UK to respond to requests from EU partners for banking information that would help progress an international investigation. They will implement the reciprocal obligation created by the protocol, which will, once in force, enable our investigators to seek valuable information relating to overseas bank accounts of suspects whose criminal activities are being investigated here.
<P>

<a name="30127-12_para9"></a>The Human Rights Act applies to all legislation. It would therefore be confusing and superfluous to include additional references to ECHR rights, which would then imply that the provisions do not apply to a particular Bill, or that the ECHR rights always need repetition in Bills in order to take effect.
<P>

<a name="30127-12_para10"></a>It may assist if I go a little further. I hope that it is not too technical, but I should like to address the issue of why there is no reference to the ECHR in relation to incoming requests under the protocol whereas there is such reference for overseas freezing orders, to which I have referred.
<P>

<a name="30127-12_para11"></a>Clause 21(7) refers to the ECHR for overseas freezing orders. That is to cover situations in which it would be manifestly clear to the UK court that has to give effect to an overseas order that there has been a flagrant breach by the overseas court of the ECHR. In this situation, the UK must not automatically give effect to the overseas freezing order without considering ECHR issues as that could place the UK court itself in breach of its own ECHR obligations.
<P>

<a name="30127-12_para12"></a>The framework decision on freezing orders is a mutual recognition measure and provides for only very limited grounds for non-recognition of orders. The protocol, by contrast, is a mutual legal assistance measure. The key difference is that, under the framework decision, refusal by the court is possible in explicit circumstances as set out in Clause 21(6) and (7) of the Bill&#151;namely, incompatibility with the ECHR where the principle of Ne bis in idem (that is, not being prosecuted where there is a previous acquittal or conviction on the same facts) is infringed. Those two grounds are therefore specified in the legislation.
<P>

<a name="30127-12_para13"></a>The whole point of mutual recognition is that, apart from these limited circumstances, the overseas freezing order should be recognised. Mutual legal assistance involves a greater level of judicial discretion. The judicial decision is reached here, and so will be subject to the Human Rights Act, rather than in the requesting executing state.

<A NAME="30127-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I think it is, but I should like clarification. Obviously, it is possible that someone who is affected by the making of a customer information order or an account monitoring order might challenge the order because, on the facts of that particular case, it is not proportional and is therefore caught by Article 8. Whether or not such a claim succeeds, in that case, would the Government accept that they could not simply say to the court, "You cannot hear this argument; all you can do is decide whether there is an incompatibility"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-12_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before the Minister replies, perhaps I may say that we must be very careful. If we are not we shall find that provisions of the Bill will be incompatible with other provisions and with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights as implemented by the Human Rights Act. At some point we have to make sure that the customer information given in Clause 32(8) does not lead people into a breach of Clause 21(7) or indeed with the Human Rights Act.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Renton: it is crucial that we ensure that the legislation is compatible. The Government believe that to be the case. The courts will always have to consider ECHR, whether or not it is on the face of the Bill. Clause 32(7) mirrors exactly the wording in the Proceeds of Crime Act.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para0"></a>As to the specific question of whether a person against whom a customer information order was potentially being levied could mount a challenge that it was disproportionate, the answer must in practice be no, because he or she would not be aware that one was being pursued, for the fairly apparent reason that these are essentially covert, rather than publicised, tracking of information measures.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para1"></a>Nevertheless, that does not raise an iota of concern that ECHR will not apply. It will apply, and the courts have to ensure that they are acting within it. I was trying to make a comparison as to why we felt in one case that it was right and proper to put the matter on the face of the Bill, but did not feel that it was necessary here.

<P>

<A NAME="30127-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord. I shall read with some care what he has said, but I think that he will satisfy me on the point. If so, I do not intend to bring the matter back at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30127-13_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30127-13_para7"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving Amendment No. 96B, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 103A, which stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Anelay.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para8"></a>The amendment reflects the concern of the British Bankers' Association, which although strongly supportive of many parts of the Bill, is very concerned that an undue and excessive burden should not be placed on the financial community.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para9"></a>I seek clarification as to what Clause 33(2)(a) means. Do the Government envisage every financial institution in a certain country, or indeed in this country, responding to a customer information order? Would that not be too burdensome in practice? I shall put the matter in context: the BBA has more than 300 member banks in various countries and this is but one institution. In what situations will such an undertaking be necessary? How often would the paragraph be used? Would it allow fishing expeditions by police authorities with no real direction, at huge financial cost to the banks, bearing in mind that the smaller the bank, the greater the proportionate burden on it? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Again one understands these probing amendments. We are not blind to the fact that customer information orders, whilst we think they are a crucial measure in the fight against crime and international crime, impose more burdens than, for example, account monitoring orders would. The amendments would remove the possibility of a customer information order in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland specifying all financial institutions. We think that that is unacceptable for two reasons: first, we have opted for consistency with the Proceeds of Crime Act, so that customer information orders made under the protocol follow the procedures of Sections 363 and 397 of that Act as far as possible.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para10"></a>Secondly, and more importantly, we need the ability to specify all accounts. We envisage that it is a power that will be used rarely, because in the vast majority of cases the foreign investigator is likely to have other intelligence pointing to the existence of an account, which will narrow down the scope. Once we have received the request, domestic intelligence checks through NCIS will be likely to point to the existence of accounts at certain banks, enabling the order to be focussed at particular institutions.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para11"></a>However, we believe that there may be exceptional circumstances when that may not apply. For example, in a terrorism case where there is no evidence pointing to an account at a particular bank, but nevertheless the scale of concern about the potential terrorist offence is such that it would justify a wider search to all financial institutions.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para12"></a>"Financial institutions" is defined in the Bill&#151;if I recollect correctly&#151;as those financial institutions that are subject to regulation, which I interpret as meaning those which are subject to the Financial Services Authority. Where that occurs, they would be defined as financial institutions for those purposes. I should emphasise that that is very rare.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para13"></a>I address the understandable concern of fishing expeditions. The Bill gives the Secretary of State discretion as to whether he executes a request for assistance, as we signalled during the discussion on an earlier amendment, and it gives the court a discretion whether to make the order.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para14"></a>One of the matters that the Secretary of State will take into account will be whether the request contains the information specified in Article 1 of the protocol, in particular the conditions in Article 1(4). That includes, for example, the requirement that the requesting authority state why it is considered that the requested information is likely to be of substantial value to the investigation. If that information is not given, refusal may follow. The test is the same as one of the tests under domestic law in PACE. We are confident, therefore, that we will not be allowing fishing expeditions. It will not be a general trawl as to whether one might know of someone who might have done something wrong; it has to relate to a specific investigation. We expect that in most cases there will be evidence why it was thought that there was a UK-relevance to the investigation.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para15"></a>We have not listed these requirements on the face of the Bill but consider that the general discretion conferred on both the Secretary of State and the court as to whether to execute the request and make the order are adequate and powerful. They will prevent fishing expeditions whilst enabling necessary investigations to be undertaken. I hope that I have addressed the questions raised on this probing amendment.

<P>

<A NAME="30127-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am trying to think of what happens between England, Wales and Scotland in these matters. Supposing there is a request for information from institutions north of the Border as well as south of the Border, when the judge or the sheriff makes a decision, will they consult one another? Might it be that the order was agreed south of the Border, not north of it? Have the Government thought of that matter, or am I asking an irrelevant question? The request could concern banks in both jurisdictions, could it not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The answer to the noble Baroness's first question is no, and to the second it is yes.

<a name="30127-13_para24"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment stands also in the name of my noble friend Lady Anelay. It is a probing amendment to ascertain what time frame, if any, will be imposed on such orders and investigations.
<P>

<a name="30127-13_para25"></a>Clause 37 states that a financial institution must provide information,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such manner, and at or by such time, as the applicant requires".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-13_para26"></a>
How variable is that time frame? What will happen if a bank simply does not respond to a customer information order? What are the penalties for not complying on time? What does the Minister see as a reasonable period in which an institution must comply? Will the same period of time apply to all institutions, or will there be differences for multinationals, which will have more staff to cope with such requests; or will they be treated in the same way as smaller, specialist banks, which may find it harder to comply quickly? Again, I make the point that this provision would bear more forcefully on the smaller banks. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-13_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Although my noble friend has described this as a probing amendment, as a matter of practical application a time limit needs to be imposed. It would be unreasonable, and it would affect a great many people in an unsatisfactory way, if this matter were allowed to spread over a long period. There are several ways of dealing with it, but that suggested by my noble friend is as good as any. I hope that the Government will regard the amendment sympathetically.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The amendment would make it an offence for a financial institution to fail to comply with a requirement imposed by a customer information order "within the specified period".
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para0"></a>We consider the amendment to be unnecessary. The process in the Bill is exactly the same as that used under the Proceeds of Crime Act. If a time limit is one of the requirements imposed by the customer information order, the current drafting provides that a financial institution will be guilty of an offence if it fails to comply, without reasonable excuse, within that time limit.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para1"></a>Clause 32(5) makes it explicit that an order may include a time limit, and investigators would be expected to impose reasonable deadlines. If they do so, then the financial institution,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"must provide the information . . . to the applicant for the order in such manner, and at or by such time, as the applicant requires".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-14_para2"></a>
To go further than that would seem to present difficulties. There are two variables: one is the degree of urgency and the other is the degree of difficulty in locating the account. Therefore, it is not reasonable to think that one can impose a standard time period: circumstances will arise where the urgency of the need for the information&#151;I shall not talk at length again about terrorism&#151;may clearly suggest that one wants a very rapid response from the responding financial authorities. In other circumstances there may be no particular urgency other than that one wants to speed the process, and a week or two weeks may be perfectly adequate.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para3"></a>I not sure whether there is an enormous differentiation in the ability of banks of different sizes&#151;international, multinational or smaller financial institutions&#151;to respond. I should have thought that all would have a similar challenge in terms of inspecting their accounts electronically to see whether an account was held by the person who was the subject of inquiry by the authority making the original request.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para4"></a>Investigations currently involve financial institutions, often with orders under PACE. There is always an element of discretion in relation to the operation of such orders. The circumstances of orders are so varied&#151;from major multinationals to small organisations&#151;that standard time limits would be unworkable, whereas there may well be cases where time limits are specified.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para5"></a>Current production orders under PACE do not operate within rigid and fixed time scales, whereas under the Bill is it possible to specify time limits that ought to be reasonable and within which the responding financial institution could be expected to respond unless it could demonstrate a good reason for <P>

<P>
<A NAME="30127-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Why does not this provision refer to the earlier one in order to make the situation clear? At present, it is not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The Minister has referred to the fact that financial institutions may vary greatly in size, importance and character. Therefore, instead of "the specified period"&#151;the words in the amendment&#151;the reference could be to "a specified period". That would need to be in accordance with the circumstances, but at least "a specified period" would be written on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para6"></a>To allow this heavy obligation to drag on indefinitely would be quite wrong. An attempt must be made to bring the matter to a head. That can be done only if the Bill contains a provision along the lines of "a specified period".

<P>
<A NAME="30127-14_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Not for the first time I find myself in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Monson, for the reasons that he gave. We consider that while these amendments are essentially drafting points, the provisions as currently drafted have more clarity and less ambiguity. Furthermore, the current drafting is consistent with the Proceeds of Crime Act, which makes it an offence for a financial institution to make a statement it knows to be false or misleading. The offences attract exactly the same penalties as those under that Act.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para10"></a>The drafting in the amendment is such that it could mean that a financial institution in order to be guilty of the offence must knowingly make a statement, rather than make a statement that it knows to be false or misleading. Therefore, we need to maintain current drafting for those reasons. The need for such a provision is self-evident: I do not think that I need to go into detail on that.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para11"></a>There are two offences under this part of the Bill. The penalty for the first&#151;failure to comply&#151;is a fine not exceeding level 5, which is currently £5,000. The penalty for the second&#151;for knowingly or recklessly making a false or misleading statement in relation to a customer information order&#151;is a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum. That is currently unlimited. For those reasons, I hope that I have addressed the probing amendment raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-14_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   This is one of the most important clauses in the Bill because unless there is a clear provision in the Bill to enable its provisions to be enforced, we shall be enacting a nullity. It is very important to have the offences set out. We have already discussed several of the points that concern Clause 34. But, between now and Report stage, I implore the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, to consider generally whether, in the light of everything that he wants to have enforced in previous provisions of the Bill, Clause 34 describes adequately the offences and ensures that they will be adequate in enforcing the legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-14_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I am very happy to give that undertaking to the Committee and to the noble Lord, Lord Renton. He is right. It is crucial that this Bill works. Adequate offences, which provide an adequate stimulus for compliance, are an essential part of so doing. I, with my officials, shall give further reflection to that. If the noble Lord, with his usual acuity, spots any further areas where there is any doubt, I should be most grateful if he would let me know of them and we shall test those further.

<a name="30127-14_para15"></a>Clause 35 [Account information]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-14_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 98:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 20, line 10, after "into" insert "serious"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-14_para16"></a><P>

<a name="30127-14_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 98, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 101, 105, 107 and 111. I believe that I have the numbers correct this time. The amendments arise from the distinction between a customer information order under Clause 32 and an account monitoring order under Clause 35. A customer information order is triggered only where the customer concerning whom the information is sought is subject to an investigation into serious criminal conduct. An account monitoring order is triggered by an investigation into criminal conduct, whether the crime is serious or not.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para18"></a>Amendments Nos. 98, 101, 105 and 107 seek to limit account monitoring orders to investigation into serious crime. The purpose of Amendment No. 111 is to impose the same limit on the outward request. Amendment No. 112A, which stands in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, picks up a reference that I had not spotted, although it is to the same effect.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para19"></a>Why is there such a difference? A customer information order is wider than an account monitoring order. A customer information order requires more information to be disclosed. Both orders are highly intrusive and, on the face of it, should be subject to a requirement that the investigation be into serious criminal conduct. I assume that these amendments are intended to mirror the apparent differences between Articles 1 and 2 of the 2001 protocol; namely, that the customer information order mirrors Article 1 and the account monitoring order mirrors Article 3.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para20"></a>Article 1 specifically states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The obligation set out in this Article shall apply only if the investigation concerns:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-14_para21"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>an offence punishable by a penalty involving deprivation of liberty or a detention order of a maximum period of at least four years in the requesting State and at least two years in the requested State".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-14_para22"></a><P>

<a name="30127-14_para23"></a>There is a further reference to an offence in Article 2 of the Europol convention. Those definitions are incorporated into the definition in this Bill of a "serious criminal offence".
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para24"></a>There are two questions that arise. First, what is the justification for the variance if they are differently treated under the protocol, because while there is a difference it does not appear to be substantial enough to justify the variance between serious and non-serious criminal conduct? Indeed, I think that it opens up the wider question as to whether there is a difference in the protocol.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para25"></a>Article 3 concerns:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Requests for the monitoring of banking transactions".
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para26"></a>
Article 3(1) states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Each Member State shall undertake to ensure that, at the request of another Member State, it is able to monitor, during a specified period, the banking operations that are being carried out through one or more accounts specified in the request and communicate the results thereof to the requesting Member State".

<a name="column_GC134"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
At that stage there is no reference to a serious criminal offence or criminal conduct of any type.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para28"></a>Paragraph (2) states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The requesting Member State shall in its request indicate why it considers a request in information relevant for the purpose of the investigation into the offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-14_para29"></a>
There is no indication as to what the words "the offence" refer. It seems to be at least a credible interpretation that they are a reference to the same kind of an offence as would trigger a request for information under Article 1. I would like some explanation of why that is not the case.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para30"></a>Finally, if Article 3 does not require the test of serious criminal conduct, that might bind the United Kingdom and render us unable to insist on there being serious criminal conduct for an incoming request. However, there is no reason why the United Kingdom courts should not apply a higher standard&#151;the test of serious criminal conduct&#151;for outgoing requests made under Clauses 43 and 44.
<P>

<a name="30127-14_para31"></a>I am sorry for raising these complex questions of interpretation, but I shall be interested to hear what the noble Lord has to say about them. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30127-14_spnew14"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 101, 107, 111 and 112A. We are coming by a slightly different route to the question raised in considerable detail by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. My simple question is: does this mean that the Government want to extend the use of monitoring of banking transactions and other provisions to all criminal conduct, or is this merely an oversight and should "serious criminal conduct" be universal throughout this chapter? If the Government envisage all criminal conduct for some of these provisions, what is the justification?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030127/text/30127-15.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The Government already use the words "serious criminal conduct" in Clause 37(1) and Clause 38(1) in this part of the Bill. I do not think there is any definition in the Bill of the difference between criminal conduct and serious criminal conduct.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para0"></a>I confess that in my ancient experience of criminal work, now going back many years, I was never a specialist, but I did a lot. I did my first criminal case back in 1934 and my last in 1976. I do not remember any distinction being made then between criminal conduct and serious criminal conduct. It may be that owing to my ignorance, as I have not appeared in a criminal court for many years, I am misguided in thinking that there is no statutory definition of the difference between the two. Within the same part of the same Bill, we must not have some provisions referring to criminal conduct and other provisions referring to serious criminal conduct without there being a definition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   The noble Lord did not mention Clause 32, which also refers to serious criminal conduct. I confess that I am baffled by the word "serious". The consequences of any criminal <P>


<a name="column_GC135"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conduct can be serious for the person concerned. For that reason, I ask my noble friend to think again about the terms that have been used.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made the important point that requests that come in two directions should not be in relation to very different levels of offence. I think he suggested that it might be a serious offence coming one way and not so serious the other. Will the Minister reassure us on that point?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I confess to an oversight. I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for pointing it out to me. Clause 46 is headed "Interpretation of Chapter 4". Serious criminal conduct is defined in subsection (3) as conduct that constitutes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an offence to which paragraph 3 of Article 1 . . . of the 2001 Protocol applies",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-15_para1"></a>
or,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an offence specified in an order made by the Secretary of State or, in relation to Scotland, the Scottish Ministers for the purpose of giving effect to any decision of the Council of the European Union under paragraph 6 of that Article".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-15_para2"></a><P>

<a name="30127-15_para3"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for pointing that out and I apologise for not having noticed it sooner. All the same, we must be very careful, bearing in mind that the Bill has used the expression "criminal conduct" frequently so far throughout Parts 1 and 2. The definition of serious criminal conduct is much narrower. If "serious" is to be inserted in a number of new places, we must bear in mind the limitation that it imposes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Renton, is right. It is always a sign of a Committee working well when its members answer each other's questions and reduce my burdens. I shall speak to the essence of this important issue of why we use the word "serious" in some cases and not in others.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para4"></a>The amendments would limit the assistance that the UK could provide in response to requests for account monitoring to cases of serious criminal conduct rather than criminal conduct generally. Requests for customer information orders under the protocol are limited to investigations into serious criminal conduct, as set out in Clauses 32, 33, 37 and 38. This is in accordance with the terms of the protocol, which only requires member states to assist in limited circumstances on customer information orders, in recognition of the potentially higher volume of work flowing from such requests.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para5"></a>Account monitoring orders are focused on one specific named account and are therefore much less resource-intensive for a financial institution to respond to. Furthermore, they are based on concrete evidence of the existence of an account. They are also arguably less intrusive, as they seek information about an account that has already been identified, whereas customer information orders are designed to identify any account that an individual might hold.
<P>


<a name="column_GC136"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para6"></a>That is why the differentiation was made in the negotiations on the protocol. We recognised that customer information orders are necessary and will play an important part, but, as they are likely to impose a greater burden on financial institutions than will an account monitoring order, it seemed reasonable to the negotiators&#151;of which we were one&#151;to limit them to the serious cases, as defined in the Bill and the protocol.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para7"></a>The Committee may also be aware that it is already possible under existing mutual legal assistance arrangements for constables to apply for historic account information to be produced to a court in relation to any criminal investigation without any dual criminality. That is done under Section 4 of the 1990 Act&#151;Clause 15 of the Bill&#151;whereby a bank employee may be summoned to produce this information before a court. This new provision is different only in that it relates to future transactions rather than to historic ones. It is likely that a single request would ask for historic information and for the account to be monitored. It would be cumbersome and impractical to be able to accede to the first half of the request and not to the second solely on the ground that the crime was not serious. The purpose is to help to identify and trace criminality. That is why member states thought this was desirable. We therefore need to do all we can to help our partners tackle international crime. Perhaps more selfishly, it is crucial that they co-operate with us in our pursuit of it.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para8"></a>The wider availability of account monitoring orders reflects the conditions for providing this type of assistance, set out in Article 3 of the protocol to the mutual legal assistance convention. This does not limit account monitoring information to cases relating only to serious criminal conduct.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para9"></a>Finally, I remind the Committee that this is a mutual legal assistance measure, not mutual recognition. The decision to grant a request for an account monitoring order is subject to judicial discretion. Clause 36(1) provides that a judge may make an order. The judge must be satisfied that there is a criminal investigation and that the order is sought for the purposes of that.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para10"></a>If I understood the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, correctly, I cannot easily think why we might want a higher test for outgoing requests than that in the protocol. Such a self-denying ordinance would mean denying ourselves the potential to use the protocol to identify potential criminality. That would be against our interests.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para11"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, is right that this applies either way. It is a reciprocal arrangement. I hope the Committee agrees that I have addressed most of the points. I hope I have done so to the Committee's satisfaction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for that reply. I shall consider what he has said and decide whether the matter needs further consideration. It is at least possible that we shall wish to pursue it at the next stage of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30127-15_para17"></a>The noble Viscount said: The amendment would leave out the subsection that allows an account monitoring order to have effect in spite of any restrictions placed on the disclosure of such information, however imposed. That seems to be a very wide power. Our legal system has safeguards that do not allow disclosure in certain circumstances, such as if the information would tend to incriminate the person concerned or the documents are protected on the ground of public policy. While I am not advocating that these should be implemented here, would not the clause have implications with regard to the Human Rights Act? Should there not be some safeguards against disclosure? I look forward to clarification from the noble Lord on that. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-15_para18"></a>
That provision is replicated in Clause 40 for account monitoring orders in Scotland, and in Clauses 32 and 37 for customer information orders. The provision directly replicates Sections 368, 374, 402 and 407 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which makes identical provision in relation to customer information orders and account monitoring orders made under it.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para19"></a>The purpose of the provision is to require a financial institution to provide the information specified in the order. The requirements for information made under the powers of investigation take precedence in spite of any restriction on the disclosure of information. Banks are therefore able&#151;indeed, required&#151;to breach customer confidentiality and provide the requested information to the court in response to a lawfully made order.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para20"></a>The provision is necessary because otherwise financial institutions could use customer confidentiality as a reason not to accede to a customer information or account monitoring order, which would make them very weak investigatory tools and therefore largely frustrate the purpose of the protocol and the agreement.
<P>

<a name="30127-15_para21"></a>As I have said in previous discussions, the ECHR is fully in operation. Banks or financial institutions have to respond to any lawfully made order. That comes back to the point that we touched on previously. In <P>

<a name="30127-15_para22"></a>For those reasons, the limits on disclosure cannot be made a judgment by the financial institution, but they are part of the consideration that the court has to exercise when deciding whether it would be lawful to make an order under the Act.

My summary notes describe these three measures as "technical Scottification"&#151;a term that I have never heard before. I am not sure it will catch on.
<P>

<a name="30127-16_para15"></a>The first two amendments remove references to a senior police officer from Clauses 38 and 41, which deal with the making, variation and discharge of customer information orders and account monitoring orders in Scotland. This will ensure that Scottish procedure is accurately reflected. In contrast to the rest of the United Kingdom, as provided for in Clauses 32 and 35, under the Scottish provisions in Clauses 37 and 40 police officers do not apply for customer information and account monitoring orders. In Scotland, the procurator fiscal has responsibility for the application to the sheriff for the customer information order and the account monitoring order, so it is appropriate that only the procurator fiscal may <P>


<a name="column_GC139"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>apply for a discharge or a variation under Clauses 38 and 41. For this reason, it is inappropriate to refer to a senior police officer in these clauses.
<P>

<a name="30127-16_para16"></a>The purpose of the third amendment is to clarify in relation to Scotland that the reference in subsection (7) to a power of attorney includes a "factory and commission". Factory and commission is a deed empowering another act for the grantor, such as buying and selling shares, similar to the English power of attorney. This is a technical amendment to reflect the position of the Scots law, where an agency arrangement may be established in writing as either a power of attorney or factory and commission. This agency could be used to operate an account on behalf of another. The amendment clarifies the intention that in whatever form the arrangement is established the agent is a person who holds an account for the purposes of Clause 43. I hope that is an adequate explanation for these three government amendments. I beg to move.

Clause 43(1) authorises a judicial authority in the United Kingdom, on an application made by a prosecuting authority, to request assistance to obtain from another country the equivalent of a customer information account. Clause <P>


<a name="column_GC140"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>44 again provides for a judicial authority, on an application made by a prosecuting authority, to make a request to an overseas authority in a participating state for assistance that is equivalent to an account monitoring order.
<P>

<a name="30127-16_para34"></a>Subsection (3) and (4) of both clauses authorise a prosecuting authority that is designated by an order made by the Secretary of State in England or by the Lord Advocate or a procurator fiscal in Scotland to bypass the need for judicial authority and to make a request directly to the overseas authority. Given that it is broadly accepted that the orders are seriously intrusive, there should be a judicial filter between a prosecuting authority that wishes to have the information and the foreign authority or bank in a foreign country that will be bound to provide it. For those reasons, we believe that subsections (3) and (4) of both clauses should be removed. Only a judicial authority should be able to authorise the application for the order directed to a bank in a foreign country. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, rightly says, these clauses deal with outgoing requests under Article 1 of the protocol to obtain customer information orders. The amendments would prevent designated prosecuting authorities from applying to countries abroad for information relating to banking transactions that would be relevant to an investigation into criminal conduct in the UK. The first amendment relates to the ability of prosecuting authorities to request information concerning any overseas bank accounts that the subject of an investigation may hold. The second relates to the ability to request information about ongoing transactions in respect of a specified overseas bank account&#151;what we have referred to as account monitoring orders in domestic terms.
<P>

<a name="30127-16_para35"></a>The Government believe it is right to give designated prosecuting authorities these powers. In practice, it is not the courts, but the designated prosecuting authorities&#151;the Serious Fraud Office, the Crown Prosecution Service and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise&#151;that are responsible for the vast majority of outgoing requests for all forms of mutual legal assistance. Their role in making such requests is well established on a domestic and international basis, as is the equivalent role of the Lord Advocate and the procurator fiscal in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30127-16_para36"></a>If the designated prosecuting authorities were unable to apply for this type of request&#151;as they currently do&#151;which will be the equivalent of seeking a customer information order or account monitoring order in the domestic context, they would be required to go to a court to make applications on their behalf. This would impose an unwarranted extra burden on the courts and require them to do work that could be adequately handled by a designated prosecuting authority. I find it hard to see why we would not give such prosecuting authorities power to request such information internationally when they are able to do so in a domestic context.

<P>

<a name="30127-16_para37"></a>It may be useful if I specify the designated prosecuting authorities identified by statutory instrument under the 1990 Act so that that is on the record. They are: the Attorney-General for England and Wales, the Director of Public Prosecutions and any crown prosecutor, the director of the Serious Fraud Office, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the commissioners of Customs and Excise, the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland and the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. The Bill gives power to the Lord Advocate and the procurator fiscal for Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30127-16_para38"></a>These authorities are very experienced in mutual legal assistance. We do not consider that the courts could add anything to a process that is just another form of mutual legal assistance. It is far more effective if those who have knowledge of the cases are able to make requests concerning them. I therefore urge the noble Lord to consider withdrawing the amendments for the reasons I have given.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-16_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Am I right in being surprised that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is not included in the list for Scotland? Might he want to do it? I think his writ runs in Scotland. Or am I wrong?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The noble Baroness is right to note that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is included, but I do not think that she is right to be surprised. The Secretary of State already has prosecuting powers under domestic legislation, but it is not included for Scotland. The procurator fiscal does it all in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his reply. I shall consider further what he has said and decide in the light of that consideration whether to take these amendments further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 45, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-17_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ANNUAL REPORT ON EFFECTS OF REQUESTS FOR BANKING INFORMATION
<br>
(1) The Secretary of State shall publish each year a report on the effects of requests for banking information introduced under this Act.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_GC142"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(2) In each report under subsection (1) the Secretary of State shall include&#151;
<br>
(a) a cost assessment of complying with a request for information,
<br>
(b) the frequency of requests from participating countries, and
<br>
(c) the time taken to comply with requests."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30127-17_para8"></a>The noble Viscount said: The amendment could be described as a good housekeeping amendment, inspired by the British Bankers' Association. It would require an annual report, which would evaluate how much the banking provisions of the Bill are used. In particular, it would be useful to review the unit costs of handling individual cases or the number of inquiries received by the UK under the protocol, if it proves to be significantly greater than estimated.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para9"></a>Consideration should be given to simplifying the procedures for responding to such inquiries so as to reduce the average time that must be spent on handling an inquiry. That might be particularly important for small banks with more limited resources&#151;a point that I have sought to make before. I must also add that the BBA and its member banks hope that they will be invited to participate in any future discussion of the procedures for handling requests, once an order has been made. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Whether or not one agrees with the detail&#151;and I do&#151;this is an important amendment. The Bill breaks new ground internationally and will affect people's rights all over the world&#151;potentially, at any rate. We should know, from time to time, what progress has been made in implementing it.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para10"></a>The new clause merely asks for details of the effects of requests for banking information. That is not a big demand, but it is important, and I would have hoped that the Government would be sympathetic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   On this occasion, I am happy to agree with the noble Viscount. As the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said, we are in uncharted waters. Parliamentarians and the public have a right to know the cost to the taxpayer of complying with the requests and to know how often such requests are made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Clearly, something has gone wrong with our procedures. Normally, when we discuss annual reports, it is my noble friend Lord Bassam of Brighton who responds. That apart, I shall address the meat of the issue.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para11"></a>The Opposition proposed a similar arrangement, with the addition of having an independent person to make the report, in respect of the new arrangements for orders freezing evidence. We understand the reasons behind the proposal; the arrangements for providing and receiving banking information to and from our EU partners are new, and it is right that Parliament should have a continuing interest in their use and operational experience, as several noble Lords have said.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para12"></a>As with the proposal relating to freezing orders, we do not see a need for a statutory requirement for a report. It will be open to Members of the House of <P>


<a name="column_GC143"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lords and MPs to obtain information on the working of the new arrangements by tabling Parliamentary Questions. That will be a proper and existing method of scrutiny for the working of the provisions. In other words, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Renton, that it is right that we should know, from time to time, how the measures are progressing. Parliamentary Questions provide a good means of doing that. However, imposing for time ever onwards a requirement for an annual report would be disproportionate and a potential waste of resources.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para13"></a>Noble Lords have referred to the cost of complying with the requests. It might help if I gave some further information about our estimate of that. As part of the process of planning implementation of the protocol, the Home Office published a regulatory impact assessment that considered the likely cost of complying with the requests. It estimated that the cost of complying could be between £1.26 million and £3.77 million a year for the banking industry, depending on the number of requests received.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para14"></a>Our estimate of the number of requests that we might receive was based on the estimates made for the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and on the volume of mutual legal assistance requests that we already receive. We considered that, under the protocol, we could expect to receive between 250 and 350 requests a year from our EU partners in respect of customer information orders and account monitoring orders. A high proportion of those requests will relate to money laundering, the costs of which are already included in the regulatory impact assessment for the Proceeds of Crime Act. The extra cost referred to above related to the estimated number of requests that would relate to other forms of crime.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para15"></a>For customer information orders, it was estimated that we might receive between 50 and 100 additional serious crime requests. For account monitoring orders, we estimated between 50 and 75 additional requests. In both cases, they are annual figures. All that is set out in detail in the regulatory impact assessment, available on the Home Office's website.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para16"></a>I shall say a little about how the process will be administered in practice. I shall respond to the noble Viscount, who asked whether the British Bankers' Association would be invited to participate in handling arrangements. We will, of course, consult the association and other relevant bodies about the handling of such matters.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para17"></a>All requests will be received centrally by the UK Central Authority, which will establish whether the request meets the necessary criteria set out in the Bill and the protocol. If it does, the authority will forward the request to the National Criminal Intelligence Service. NCIS will undertake certain intelligence checks to see whether accounts exist and will then apply to a court for an order. A customer information order will be directed at a number of institutions. It might involve one or two institutions, to obtain details of accounts identified by the initial checks, or a larger number, if that is appropriate to the case. In the case <P>


<a name="column_GC144"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of account monitoring orders, the account will already have been identified, so the order will be directed at only one institution.
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para18"></a>As noble Lords will, no doubt, point out, regulatory impact assessments are an honest endeavour to make the best assessment that one can of volume, scope and burden. I have no doubt that practice will show some variation from those figures, upwards or downwards. So, it is right and proper for Members of the House to be able to make inquiries after a year or two about how the process is working. Parliamentary Questions are an adequate means of doing so and, if necessary, ensuring that the Government are brought to account for the operation of the measures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-17_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   We are, of course, mindful that unnecessary expense must not be incurred in an exercise such as that outlined in the amendment. Nevertheless, I shall study carefully the Minister's reply. Transparency and reporting to the public are desirable, and we may revisit the issue on Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="30127-17_para25"></a>This is a probing amendment. "Serious criminal conduct" is defined as an offence under the 2001 protocol or as an offence specified in an order made by the Secretary of State. The matter was the subject of a previous amendment. Which other countries follow the guidelines? Have the guidelines ever been or could they be amended? Would it not be better to list them in the Bill, for the sake of clarity?
<P>

<a name="30127-17_para26"></a>With regard to the other two amendments, it should be well known that we oppose the idea that the Secretary of State should have more power. These standard amendments would ensure that new offences added to the list were properly debated by Parliament and would make similar provision for Scotland. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Although I am reluctant to support Amendment No. 113A, I think that there is much to be said for making either Amendment No. 113B or 113C. Given the intrusive nature of the customer information orders, it is important that we make sure that their use is limited to genuinely serious offences. <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I also support the idea that my noble friend should look carefully before he limits the ability of Parliament to scrutinise legislation. For all I know, my noble friend may have a serious point to make by way of rejoinder, but the burden of proof falls fairly and squarely on him. If I had been in the noble Viscount's position, I would have moved the amendment without any hesitation. That does not mean that there is no answer to the amendment, but the burden of showing that there is falls on my noble friend. I hope that he will be able to discharge that duty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I will make a wide, fundamental case for Amendment No. 113A. First, I must confess that, in an earlier discussion, I overlooked the definition of "serious criminal conduct" in the clause. The more I think about it, the more I think that confusion will be caused by having two types of criminal offence&#151;a "criminal offence" and a "serious criminal offence", however defined. There is plenty of time between now and Report for the Government to consider whether the definition will enable justice to be done or even allow the law to be properly complied with.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para0"></a>As we are breaking new ground in international law, as well as domestic law, we must be careful about making that somewhat artificial distinction. If we are to make it, I prefer the definition put forward by my noble friend in Amendment No. 113A to that in the Bill. The definition in the Bill is artificial and vague. It would be better and would improve the effect of the Bill if we were to abolish the distinction between "serious criminal conduct" and "criminal conduct".
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para1"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, Amendments Nos. 113B and 113C are of a familiar kind. They would only improve the Bill, and I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Regardless of the major point made by my noble friend Lord Renton, I point out to my noble friend Lord Bridgeman that Amendments Nos. 113B and 113C will not do. If they were agreed to, orders defining offences would have to be made by the Scottish Parliament, because it makes secondary legislation. It is important that the same level of offence apply in both parts of the United Kingdom. So there are complications in catering for two jurisdictions. I see what my noble friend Lord Bridgeman has said, but the amendment would need more attention, should the Government be interested in it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I shall try to rise to the challenge set by my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis to discharge my responsibility to convince the Committee that affirmative resolution is not necessary.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para2"></a>Clause 46 defines "serious criminal conduct" as constituting the offences listed in Article 1(3) of the protocol. It provides that requests for customer <P>


<a name="column_GC146"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information may be sought only for crimes with a penalty of at least four years. Amendment No. 113A would enable us to introduce our own threshold for crimes, for which CIOs could be sought, of a maximum sentence of 10 years.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para3"></a>A crime with a maximum sentence of 10 years is undoubtedly serious. But other serious offences would not meet the test, where we might wish to offer, or seek, this type of assistance. Customer information orders will be helpful in tracing and locating criminals and terrorist groups. For example, under the Child Abduction Act 1984, child abduction&#151;taking a child out of the United Kingdom without consent&#151;attracts a maximum sentence of seven years. The Committee will know the distress that that can cause to families. We would not wish to deny ourselves, even if the protocol did not so oblige us, the ability to use customer information orders in such circumstances. Banking information might be a considerable assistance in locating a suspected child abductor.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para4"></a>Some terrorist offences have a sentence of less than 10 years. For instance, possession of a dangerous article on an aircraft, including bombs, grenades or firearms, is classified as a terrorist offence and has a maximum sentence of five years, which may surprise the Committee. Under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, unauthorised modification and unauthorised access with intent both attract maximum sentences of five years. These offences are examples of crime without borders, and they could be the subject of an international investigation, given the considerable damage they can cause.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para5"></a>The amendment would also rule out seeking or providing assistance in investigations into benefit from crime in cases where the maximum sentence is less than 10 years. There are many offences in those categories that might give rise to such an investigation.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para6"></a>Furthermore, imposing a 10-year threshold would place us in breach of the terms of the protocol, meaning that the UK would be considered not to have fully implemented the protocol. We could not, therefore, expect other countries to comply with our requests for assistance of that type.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Renton, asked whether we should abandon the distinction between crime and "serious" crime. As I have said on several occasions, it is a fundamental element of the protocol. It is there for good reason: to recognise that customer information orders, which are a considerable new measure, as has been rightly said, are potentially enormously valuable in assisting to trace criminal offences, but nevertheless impose burdens on the financial institutions. For that exact reason, the term "serious" has been inserted and defined as set out in the protocol. It strikes the balance between necessity and burden on the financial institutions. We think that that balance is right. It would be wrong not to limit customer information orders to the most serious offences as the protocol and the Bill do. As the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, who was teasing me, knows, these are not guidelines; they are articles in the protocol to a convention that we are under obligation to comply with.
<P>


<a name="column_GC147"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 113B and 113C would mean that any order made by the Secretary of State or Scottish Ministers to designate further offences for which customer information orders may be sought would be subject to affirmative, rather than negative, resolution. Customer information orders provided for in Clauses 32 and 33&#151;Clauses 37 and 38 for Scotland&#151;allow the United Kingdom to make, and assist with, requests to trace banking information in order to assist with investigations into serious criminal conduct. Clause 46 defines "serious criminal conduct" and provides an order-making power for the Secretary of State to specify further offences for which this information can be provided in the future.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para9"></a>I have noted with interest the point by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, about the Scottish Parliament. I suspect that she is right, as she has been on many occasions, about the requirement on the Scottish Parliament were such an amendment passed. If she is wrong, with temerity, I shall write to point that out.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para10"></a>Clause 46(3)(b) provides that the order-making power be used,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the purpose of giving effect to any decision of the Council of the European Union under paragraph 6 of that Article".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-18_para11"></a>
That means that, should the EU member states decide that the scope of Article 1 should be broadened to cover more crimes, as provided for in Article 1(6), the UK would be in a position to broaden the assistance it can provide without passing new primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para12"></a>This provision was included in the protocol to avoid the need for an amending convention. But any decision to broaden the scope of Article 1 would be taken only in the light of experience of operating the provision, and with the agreement of all member states. The decision would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the usual processes. CIOs will be useful not only in tackling financial crime but in tracing and locating criminals and terrorist groups, who might be involved in committing a range of crimes. Therefore, it is necessary that the Secretary of State retain the power to widen the circumstance in which they will be sought in future.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para13"></a>The report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee concluded that the level of scrutiny of the majority of the order-making powers in the Bill was appropriate, including the power in Clause 46. I am satisfied, therefore, that the power is subject to appropriate levels of scrutiny. I urge Committee Members to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Having listened to the Minister with interest and care, I feel bound to point out that we are getting into a very confused state. Failure to comply with a request for information on bank accounts is not the most serious criminal offence. Although we should deal with it, there are many more serious offences.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para14"></a>Although, as MP for Huntingdon and a member of the English Bar, I never boasted about it, I am more than half-Scottish and have always been proud to be so. I rejoice that in this Bill we are making special <P>


<a name="column_GC148"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions for the application of the Scottish legal system. A conflict in practice could arise between Clause 46(3)(a) and the provision in paragraph (b). It is interesting that, although in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, quite serious offences may apply in the context of the Bill, anything specified by an order in Scotland is to be a serious offence. The others will not be so described.
<P>

<a name="30127-18_para15"></a>I am sorry to have to say so, but we are getting into a nonsensical situation. The Government must reconsider the concept of defining criminal offences as "serious". It will only lead to confusion, and I am trying to help.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-18_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   I apologise for giving an incomplete explanation of Amendment No. 113A. We had intended to say that it was not intended only to cover crimes with a maximum penalty of 10 years.

<A NAME="30127-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My understanding is that it would be an order made under the negative procedure, allowing any Member to pray against it, therefore enabling debate on the order to take place as is the House's custom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-19_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   I thank the Minister. I gather that it is open to the House to question the political aspects of what the Delegated Powers Committee has pronounced. We feel strongly about the affirmative procedure in this context. I shall read carefully the Minister's reply, but we may have to reiterate the point on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I have made an incorrect statement to the Committee. If the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, was enquiring about scrutiny of an amendment to the protocol, as opposed to the discretionary order-making powers provided by the current Bill and protocol, I was referring to the latter. If he was referring to the European Union changing the protocol within the terms I described, the exact same form of scrutiny would apply as when a new European Union agreement is made&#151;currently under the third pillar. In other words, the document is deposited and is open for inspection by either scrutiny committee of this House and another place, or both. That would enable scrutiny to be discharged through a debate in this House. Members of another place could request a debate on the matter should they so wish. I hope that my answer is sufficient. If I can add anything, I shall be pleased to write to the noble Viscount on reflection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-19_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for his explanation. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-19_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 113E:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 26, line 35, leave out "competent" and insert "relevant judicial"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-19_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30127-19_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I should like to thank the Law Society for its briefing on this matter.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para7"></a>We now turn away from banking provisions and towards the transfer of United Kingdom prisoners in order that they can help in investigations overseas in participating countries. The Explanatory Notes tell us that this new power is unlikely to be used frequently, but that it could be used, and useful, where a prisoner who is helping a UK investigation might be able to identify a site or take part in an identification parade.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para8"></a>Clause 47 tells us that if the Secretary of State has an agreement with the competent authority in a participating country, then he can issue a warrant which will make it possible to transfer a prisoner to that participating country. I have tabled the amendment to ask two main questions. First, what is a "competent authority"? That is not specifically stated in the definitions clause, Clause 52.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para9"></a>Secondly, why does this provision bypass the judicial authorities? Earlier, in a different context, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, raised the point about the desirability of bypassing judicial authorities. Why do the Government think it appropriate that there should be no judicial oversight of the issuing of such warrants? Surely one could argue that the advantage of judicial oversight would be that it would help ensure a level of independent scrutiny to prevent any unnecessary or inappropriate requests being made. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her interpretation of her amendment. I think that I can satisfy her on those points.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para10"></a>The amendment is not acceptable to us because in transfer cases the "competent" authority might not in fact be a judicial authority in either one or both of the countries involved. If a prisoner is transferred from the United Kingdom, the request will be made by a prosecuting authority such as Customs and Excise or the CPS, and perhaps usually at the request of the <P>


<a name="column_GC150"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>police. Those are not judicial authorities but are what are commonly described in these circumstances as "competent" authorities. If a prisoner is transferred to the UK, the request and practical arrangements will be handled by the UK Central Authority and, typically, by the Prison Service, which liaises with the prison, so that there is no involvement of a judicial authority.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para11"></a>So while the authority at the requesting end of the process may be a "judicial authority", it may well be a different, non-judicial authority at the executing end. For that reason, it would not be appropriate to refer only to judicial authorities. We would not expect a judicial authority to make the arrangements for the transfer of prisoners in the UK. In our view, that is quite properly the responsibility of the police and Prison Service, who have the relevant experience and necessary expertise to ensure that all arrangements for the secure transfer of the prisoner run smoothly. So in our view there is no need for the independent judicial authority to be involved.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para12"></a>For those reasons, and because of the way in which we see the provision working&#151;probably much as it does now&#151;we believe that the amendment is inappropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-19_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. In obtaining clarity on this Bill, I sometimes seem to take one step forward but two steps back. There was certainly considerable progress in what the Minister told the Committee, but I am still not completely happy with the picture of what a "competent" authority might be in these new circumstances. I certainly may wish to return to these matters at a later stage. For now, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30127-19_para13"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 114:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 27, line 14, at end insert "and if before making the statement the person making it was offered access to advice on the legal consequences of a transfer for the prisoner and has either received such advice or has refused to request it"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-19_para14"></a><P>

<a name="30127-19_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is based on a proposal by Justice. As usual, I declare an interest in that organisation as one of the vice-chairs of its council.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para16"></a>This power could have significant consequences for a prisoner who agrees to the transfer. Under Clause 47(4), a warrant may be issued to transfer a prisoner abroad only if the prisoner or some appropriate person on behalf of the prisoner has in writing consented to the transfer being made. That is all very well as far as it goes, and of course we welcome the fact that it is a voluntary transfer. Once given, however, that consent is irrevocable. It is an important safeguard to ensure that that consent has been given freely on the basis of adequate information. A transfer of prisoners can have a significant impact on the rights of the persons concerned. Consent to the transfer should be based on full knowledge of the legal implications.
<P>


<a name="column_GC151"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para17"></a>While, obviously, a person cannot be compelled to accept the offer of advice, we believe that it should be a requirement on the face of the Bill that there should at least be an offer of legal advice to the prisoner regarding the possible consequences for him or her of the transfer, so that the consent can be given on the basis of full knowledge of the legal consequences by the person giving the consent. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The Government certainly appreciate the motives behind the amendment. Its primary intention is clearly to protect prisoners, and to add an additional layer of protection for prisoners, by ensuring that they are offered legal advice before they consent to transfer. However, we consider that the clause already contains more than adequate safeguards for the prisoner. We therefore contend that the amendment is unnecessary. It might help if I explained roughly how we expect the arrangements to work.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para18"></a>Clause 47 builds on existing provisions in Section 5 of the 1990 Act, which enables the UK to transfer a prisoner to another country to assist that country's investigations. Clause 47 introduces slightly different arrangements, enabling the UK to request that a prisoner held here be transferred overseas to assist with our own investigations, should such a situation arise. In a way, these new transfers should be much more straightforward for the prisoner. He or she will be transferred at the request of the UK authorities, rather than at the request of a foreign authority whose procedures would not necessarily be familiar to our Prison Service.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para19"></a>The clause does not introduce anything fundamentally new or innovative; it merely extends existing practices. In relation to the existing procedures under the 1990 Act, prisoners are free to seek legal advice in relation to transfers before they consent to them. It is, however, not automatically provided, and to do so would place an unnecessary burden on prisons.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para20"></a>The Government do not see merit in having a special arrangement for these new types of procedure, which differ from those in the 1990 Act. Transfers take place only after extensive contact between all the relevant parties&#151;the competent authorities in both countries, the central authorities and the prisoner&#151;to ensure that all concerned parties are content with the arrangements. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, himself observed that the arrangements are voluntary and have to be conducted with the consent of the prisoner. Those are both important aspects of the issue.
<P>

<a name="30127-19_para21"></a>Prisoner transfers are organised with close co-operation between the United Kingdom Central Authority, the Prison Service, the prison where the prisoner is held, the police and the overseas authorities. That close co-operation should help <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I have one or two questions for the Minister, as these are matters of some concern. Clause 42(7) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This section applies to a person . . . serving a sentence in a prison",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-20_para0"></a>
or,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in custody awaiting trial or sentence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-20_para1"></a>
One would not know whether those awaiting trial are guilty. That is a matter yet to be decided.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para2"></a>Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The circumstances are those in which it appears to the Secretary of State to be inappropriate for the prisoner to act for himself, by reason of his physical or mental condition or his youth".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-20_para3"></a>
How is the Secretary of State going to determine the mental condition of an individual who has not been tried, evidence of which has not been produced in court? Would it not be wise in such cases to ensure that appropriate legal advice is available to the individual, or to a person acting on his behalf, about the consequences of such visits abroad? They may well say things abroad that could be used in evidence against them in the trial which has not yet taken place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   It is worth reminding ourselves that the Secretary of State needs to be very mindful of the health, particularly the mental health, of prisoners before allowing them to stand trial in this country. One would therefore expect that the proper authorities here would ensure that the prisoner is fit. Given that safeguard, I think it extremely unlikely that the authorities would seek or want to see the transfer of a prisoner who was not fit to travel because of mental or physical incapacity. The key issue in relation to physical health is that the prisoner must give his or her consent. I think that that is a very important and powerful connection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) of Clause 47 is equivalent to subsection (3)(a) which deals with Scotland and is so much briefer. Do those three paragraphs mean,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any person detained in custody",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-20_para4"></a>
as the Scottish provision states? In other words, are the provisions for England and Wales the same as those for Scotland? If so, why does it take so many more words to state the position in England than in Scotland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My advice is that it is a drafting point. I do not know whether that helps the noble Baroness. If she has a real concern about the point, we may be able to give further thought to it. However, we are content with the drafting, which we think is fit for the purpose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   It is quite interesting, is it not? Presumably the Scottish provision has come from the Scotland Office, whereas that for England and Wales has come from the Home Office, which has <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>found a different solution. As one is much shorter than the other, I should think that we could use the shorter one for both. I am not making a nationalistic point, of course, but it is quite interesting to see the same thing repeated in quite a different form.

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="30127-20_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 115:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30127-20_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30127-20_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 115, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 116 to 120, which stand in my name. The amendments again raise the issue of consent, but from rather a different angle to that covered in the previous amendment.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para8"></a>I appreciate that the Minister may in response say that all this is covered in an existing law and will quote Sections 5(2) and 6(3) of the 1990 Act. However, I have some questions to ask of him, regardless of what I anticipate may be his response. I appreciate that Clauses 47 and 48 mirror those sections in the Act.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para9"></a>So far we have talked about what happens with the giving of consent from the point of view of what legal advice should be available in order to get the person to the stage where they give that consent. My amendments address the issue of consent after that stage has been reached and consent has been given. The Bill states that once the warrant has been issued, that is it and the prisoner cannot withdraw his consent. That is the position under the 1990 Act.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para10"></a>I am aware that the Law Society, for example, is opposed in principle to a provision that makes the giving of consent an irrevocable act. I can understand that as a matter of principle. I look at the issue more from the point of view perhaps of practice, rather than purely as a matter of principle. Therefore, I have tabled the amendment in order to ask the Government to explain why they believe that it is both essential and right in principle and in practice that someone should continue to be prevented from withdrawing their consent.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para11"></a>We have already mentioned that there is some protection before giving consent for those who may have some mental incapacity by reason of age or who because of their youth may need some assistance in making the decision. What happens if after a person gives consent he develops an incapacity&#151;for example&#151;which would make it difficult for him to travel?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para12"></a>On Amendment No. 114, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, in replying to the questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, said that the Secretary of State would not expect someone to travel if he was ill. The Bill does not give the person any protection. In theory he could be required to travel if he was physically or mentally ill or perhaps mentally incapacitated to such an extent that his assistance might be impaired&#151;for example, in an identification parade. I am trying to get to the heart of what protections there might be, which might not just protect the witness but also the judicial system and its credibility.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para13"></a>I shall briefly state the impact of each amendment, although they are at this stage probing amendments. Amendments Nos. 115 and 118 would provide that a prisoner could withdraw consent after a warrant has been issued.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para14"></a>Amendments Nos. 116 and 119 would confine the ability to withdraw consent to exceptional circumstances, the definition of which would be open for debate.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 117 and 120 complete the picture by specifically confining the exceptional circumstances to medical grounds. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-20_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Baroness is right to accurately describe the effects of Sections 5 and 6 of the 1990 Act and to say that these clauses essentially are like "carry on" provisions. They describe the circumstances where a transfer is made from one country at its own request when its investigations require a prisoner's presence in another country.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para16"></a>As I said when speaking to a previous amendment, the clauses as drafted require the prisoner to provide written consent to any transfer before it takes place. The noble Baroness raised a question of what happens if some illness or incapacity occurs when a prisoner is in transit. We appreciate that the amendment is intended to protect the rights of the prisoner, but we think that the amendments would create potentially serious problems.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para17"></a>For example, the amendments could have the effect that the prisoner could withdraw his consent in the middle of the transfer whilst he was overseas. That would be unacceptable. It would invalidate the warrant, which would mean that the prisoner would not be held in legal custody. If a prisoner was unfit to travel, clearly he would not be obliged or forced to travel, having first given consent. In those circumstances, the prisoner would be seen by a Prison Service medical officer, who would make the final decision. A prisoner who was not fit to travel would not be transferred even if he was still willing to go. I think we can place trust in a proper and full medical assessment. Of course if a person was mentally unfit it is plain that he would not be much use to those conducting the investigation. So, in those circumstances, it is extremely unlikely that any pressure would be put on that person to continue his journey because it would invalidate the conduct of the investigation.
<P>


<a name="column_GC155"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para18"></a>These arrangements are designed to assist countries with their investigations, where those investigations require the attendance of a prisoner in another country to assist in some capacity, perhaps in the identification of sites or for participation in an ID parade. So it is extremely important that a prisoner is transferred only when he is mentally and physically fit to travel and likely to be of assistance in the investigation.
<P>

<a name="30127-20_para19"></a>So steps and measures will be taken to ensure that prisoners are able to travel. If he becomes unfit or unwell during the course of the journey, obviously great care would need to be exercised and some reconsideration of the purpose of that journey being undertaken might be necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-20_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I appreciate what the Minister has said. I am still concerned. In many cases, in particular those attending at magistrates' courts or occasionally attending the court trial and so on, I often find that evidence as to the nature of a person's mental illness will come out during a trial and not beforehand. I do not think that the Home Secretary, a prison officer or a prison doctor is in a position to know about the condition. We seek to establish certain safeguards in relation to vulnerable people who may say things that may be held against these individuals, which is quite contrary to natural justice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I may have misunderstood some of the procedure. Can the Minister say at what stage the consent is given? I had assumed that after consent had been given it was possible for there to be some delay before transit took place. In opening his response, the Minister immediately assumed that the incapacity would only develop in transit. So he seems to be saying that consent is given literally as the journey begins. If that is the case, I accept that my amendment would have serious defects. Can the Minister say whether it is always the case that consent is to be given and then transit takes place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   One envisages a situation where consent is given before we make the necessary administrative and transfer arrangements. So there will inevitably be some period of delay, perhaps a matter of weeks or a month at the most. But there will obviously be a period that would provide more than adequate time to ensure that the prisoner was able, fit and willing to travel. That is the important point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. He has confirmed that I perhaps understood more than I thought I had. My concern is that consent may be given and then there could be some considerable delay. It is absolutely proper that one would not put the administrative arrangements in place until one knew one had the consent, because that could waste time and money.
<P>

<a name="30127-21_para0"></a>That brings me back to my concern that there could be a delay during which incapacity could develop, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, said, it is not always the case that incapacity becomes apparent. I think that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>I need to look more closely at experience relating to the 1990 Act and consider what I need to do on Report.

 "PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30127-21_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: I note that throughout Part 1 of the Bill there is no reference to how these provisions may affect young persons under the age of 18.

How do the Government expect the authorities to act in dealing with them? Naturally, we would not want young people to be excluded from the operation of the Bill. It is quite possible that one could be a criminal under the age of 18. Sadly, crime statistics show how possible that is. The crime could be committed across international borders.
<P>

<a name="30127-21_para10"></a>We need to know whether the Secretary of State proposes that those under 18 should be treated in the same way as adults with regard to the provisions of the Bill? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The Government appreciate that the amendment seeks to protect the interests of those under the age of 18, but in our view it is unnecessary. The reason is that the provisions on transfer of prisoners in the 1990 Act already apply to those under 18, and there are no special arrangements under that Act to regulate their transfer.
<P>

<a name="30127-21_para11"></a>Furthermore, it is not clear precisely what the clause would achieve, nor what the "modifications" referred to would include. Nor is it clear to the Government why modifications would be appropriate.

<a name="30127-21_para12"></a>As established in Clauses 47 and 48, prisoners may be transferred only if they consent to the transfer, and the issuing of a warrant under either clause depends on the Secretary of State reaching agreement with the other participating country.
<P>

<a name="30127-21_para13"></a>There is an absolute discretion on the part of the prisoner and the Secretary of State as to whether he complies with any requests for a transfer. We consider that this discretion, which enables conditions to be attached to transfer and ultimately for a transfer to be refused, makes the additional power unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30127-21_para14"></a>My understanding is that in the region of 30 of these transfers per annum have taken place under the current legislation. We do not anticipate that these provisions will be frequently used. Therefore, the number of people under the age of 18 will be small. I hope that helps the noble Baroness with her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-21_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. He properly directed the Committee to the matter of discretion. We shall look at that matter. There may be issues that we would wish to raise with regard to young persons later in the Bill, but he has satisfied me with regard to this particular measure. We shall not be returning to the point. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30127-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Before Clause 50 is called, perhaps I may offer a word of explanation to the Committee. We had originally expected to reach this point on the Marshalled List close to half past seven. Therefore, we had explained to the Opposition Front Benches that the Government intended to take the unusual step of opposing the Question that Clause 50 shall stand part of the Bill&#151;the reason being that we have been persuaded that the clause is no longer necessary; it is superfluous. Therefore, we had thought to break the proceedings at that point, allowing us to recommence on Wednesday.
<P>

<a name="30127-21_para17"></a>However, this has been a productive afternoon, and a further hour and a half is available to the Committee. So I am in the hands of the Committee. I apologise for now signalling that it is possible, if the Committee is content to do so, to go further today than we had originally expected. I therefore seek to propose that we should use the extra hour and a half for debate.
<P>

<a name="30127-21_para18"></a>I apologise because the Government's intention to oppose the Question that their own Clause 50 shall stand part of the Bill has been tabled but does not appear on the Marshalled List. Therefore, there has not been as much notice as we should normally expect and wish to give. On the other hand, I am aware that we have a good hour and a half available. It would perhaps seem inefficient not to give the Committee the opportunity of using that time if it so wishes. I am not certain whether this requires a formal resolution.

<a name="30127-21_para19"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 50 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-21_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Ampthill): </B>  Members of the Committee are now aware of the Minister's views and are free to say that they would like Clause 50 to stand part, or to make the Minister feel happier and say that they entirely accept his proposal&#151;in which case I shall collect the voices of those present.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-21_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The Deputy Chairman of Committees has created a procedure by which other noble Lords may be able to respond to the Minister. Speaking only on behalf of the Opposition Front Bench at this stage, we are keen to crack on with as much of the Bill as possible and, within reason, I am prepared to do so. I am aware, however, that that may be inconvenient for other Members of the Committee and do not wish to speak on their behalf.
<P>

<a name="30127-21_para20"></a>I simply ask the Minister whether the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, might have been apprised of this. It looks as though, if we proceed, we shall reach his significant amendments on the list. I should be concerned if the noble and learned Lord were not aware of that.
<P>

<a name="30127-21_para21"></a>One of the huge disadvantages of taking Bills in Grand Committee&#151;as Members of the Committee will be aware if they look at the monitor&#151;is that noble Lords outwith this room have no indication as to the stage that has been reached. Therefore, if the Government gave advance indication of their intention to stop at a particular point, I anticipate that the noble and learned would not have received an indication to the contrary. I shall be content to continue, but I appreciate that that may well not be the view of other Members of the Committee or of noble Lords who are not present.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am open-minded on that point, but I have another point to raise. I hope that I am not being too narrow-minded in making this suggestion. We should bear in mind that this is a detailed Bill which is breaking new ground. It is a very important Bill, nationally and internationally. I should have thought that two and a half hours at a time is quite long enough for its consideration and that, in any event, we should not attempt today to go beyond Part 1, which we should reach before very long. I say that hopefully.

<A NAME="30127-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   As always, my noble friend Lady Carnegy has just put me on the right rails. The monitor indicates the number of the amendment being debated. I apologise for getting that wrong.

<A NAME="30127-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I am delighted that my earlier absence led to such fast progress. On future occasions I shall see that as a means of making progress on Bills such as this. I am in the hands of the Committee. We have no difficulty whatever if the Minister wants to proceed. The noble Baroness makes an important point. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has tabled Amendment No. 134A. Perhaps there is a procedure whereby we could adjourn the <P>


<a name="column_GC159"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>debate on that particular matter, or alternatively stop at that point, which does not give us much time for debate anyway.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  That would mean that we could go as far as the end of the amendments to Clause 52.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   We should certainly be pleased to deal with group 18 and speak to Amendments Nos. 122 to 126, 129 and 131.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, raised an important point on whether the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has been notified of the point at which we intend to end the proceedings. I believe that the relevant powers are seeking to check on that now.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para1"></a>This may not be for me to suggest, but perhaps the question about the noble and learned Lord is a more fundamental issue than whether Clause 50 shall stand part. Therefore, if the Committee is content to do so, while we are waiting for that information, we could deal with the Government's peculiar request to oppose part of their own Bill and deal with group 18&#151;by which time we may have a clear answer as to whether the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has been notified that we intend to continue. If he has not, I share the view that it would be quite wrong to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am not against what the Minister suggests, but it strikes me that other noble Lords may want to speak to some of these amendments. We must be careful in dealing with this procedure not to be too cavalier. It may suit Members of the Committee who are present, but any Member of the House might wish to speak to an amendment. That said, do other noble Lords think that we might go as far as Amendment No. 170?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spnew4"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No&#151;to Amendment No. 134.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I was concerned&#151;thinking back to the first day in Committee&#151;when we agreed to an amendment on the Marshalled List that was gobbledegook. I read it out as gobbledegook and it was recorded as such. It was corrected in Hansard. We agreed that that amendment should be included in the Bill. The Minister could not really tell us what it was about. I felt that we went a little beyond where we should have done in this procedure. I hope that the Minister will forgive me for mentioning it, but it is relevant. We have to be careful when using this procedure not to overstep the arrangements. We must not include amendments when we do not know what they signify. I wonder whether we should be discussing amendments that others thought we would not reach today.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para2"></a>I may be wrong in saying that in this respect except in so far as it relates to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. I suppose that other noble Lords do not know where we shall get to. It is difficult to keep the <P>


<a name="column_GC160"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>whole House involved in this form of Committee procedure. It confirms my belief that we should not go too far with the freedom that we have to proceed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I apologise to the Committee for asking one further question. I, too, had misunderstood the Minister's first point. I thought that it was his intention that we should stop before reaching the part of the Bill dealing with road traffic. Is he now saying that the intention is to continue after Part 2? I thought that all we were being asked to do was to finish at the end of Part 2.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   No. I was saying that if we continued&#151;and that would be only if, in all the circumstances, the Committee was comfortable in doing so&#151;we should deal with Part 2 but not begin debating Part 3, dealing with driving disqualifications.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para3"></a>I am sensitive to the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour. This is a good process, but only in so far as people feel comfortable with it and do not feel that we are going further than is right and proper. It may be that I shall receive categorical information about the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. That may or may not make those issues feel comfortable as regards groups 21, 22 and 23. If the Committee is content, however, I do not think that anyone would be unduly upset about the Government opposing the Question that Clause 50 shall stand part of the Bill. My remark seems to elicit a smile but not too much outrage. We might be able to do that and deal also with group 18 while waiting for an answer as regards the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. Those are merely suggestions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  After that interesting interruption, the Question is whether Clause 50 shall stand part of the Bill? As many as are of that opinion shall say "Content"; to the contrary "Not-Content". I think that the Not-Contents have it. I am told that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said "Content", although I did not hear him. Is it a unanimous decision that Clause 50 shall not stand part of the Bill? The remaining Members of the Committee do not want it to stand part. I see that the noble Lord is in agreement.

<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am trying to de-confuse myself. Am I right in saying that in this amendment, as in Amendment No. 122, the Government are implementing what the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee wanted? As a member of that committee, I am particularly interested in this matter. I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   With the leave of the Committee, I shall respond fully to that question. It may provide an opportunity to place on record one or two other issues that have not been addressed given the slight complications in this process.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para13"></a>All the amendments in this group deal with the appropriate scrutiny of order-making powers in Part 1 of the Bill. The amendments to Clause 52 deal with the power to designate further participating countries to which the provisions of Part 1 will apply.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para14"></a>To go into more detail, Amendments Nos. 123 and 125 to Clause 51, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will require all orders made by means of the powers contained in Part 1 to be made by affirmative resolution.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para15"></a>We do not feel inclined to accept these amendments. Making all orders under Part 1 subject to affirmative resolution would be excessively burdensome and would result in the inappropriate use of parliamentary time. We do not believe that such a change would be justified.

<P>

<a name="30127-22_para16"></a>The negative resolution procedure is generally held to offer an appropriate level of scrutiny for this type of legislation. It does not rule out the possibility of a debate should Members feel strongly that this is called for. However, it saves unnecessary debate on matters that simply do not merit it.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para17"></a>The order-making powers in this Bill have been subject to the scrutiny of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. I thank the committee for their helpful report. With two exceptions&#151;one in Clause 52 which I shall deal with next&#151;the committee found that the powers in the Bill were appropriately delegated and subject to an appropriate degree of parliamentary control. Therefore, I am satisfied that Clause 51 should stand as drafted, and am unable to accept the amendments.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para18"></a>I turn to the amendments tabled to Clause 52&#151;namely, Amendments Nos. 123, 130 and 131&#151;and to the government amendments to Clause 51&#151;Amendments Nos. 122, 124 and 126. Both groups have the same purpose and both relate to one of the concerns of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The general thrust of these amendments is to ensure that any order that designated new countries as participating countries for the purposes of Part 1 would be subject to affirmative resolution.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para19"></a>The Opposition amendments to Clause 52&#151;namely, Amendments Nos. 127, 130 and 131&#151;would require any order that designated new countries as participating countries to be made by affirmative resolution. I understand the concerns of the Opposition in relation to this power, which it fears might open up the United Kingdom to unsuitable judicial systems of other countries. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee had similar concerns. Therefore, their report suggested that as the power in Clause 52 to designate countries as "participating countries" could, in theory, be used to designate any country, it should be either restricted in its scope or made subject to affirmative procedure.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para20"></a>In response to the Committee's concerns, the government amendments to Clause 51 would also introduce the affirmative procedure for designated new countries, but with an exception for countries that are already members of the European Union. They provide parallel arrangements for regulations made at Westminster and by the Scottish Parliament. The Government have informed the committee of their intention to table such an amendment, and the committee has indicated that it welcomes that response.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para21"></a>The reason for this exception is that we shall, following their accession to the EU, be designating the 10 new member states due to join in May 2004 to participate in the measures in Part 1. All new member states have gone through an extensive process of assessment before being accepted for membership and must have implemented the EU instruments which this Bill implements.

<P>

<a name="30127-22_para22"></a>As new member states, they have effective judicial systems and are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights. It would not be appropriate or necessary to put up further barriers to the application of these provisions to these countries. I am confident that this exception should be made.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para23"></a>Amendment No. 129 to Clause 52, the final amendment in the group, is a technical amendment to ensure that the order-making power in Clause 52 is fully consistent with the post-devolution situation. It provides that where a participating country is designated by an order, that order-making power is to be exercised as regards Scotland by the Scottish Ministers responsible for matters within devolved competence, and designating participating countries with regard to judicial co-operation is within their devolved competence.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para24"></a>I hope that in the light of the Government's amendment to Clause 51 and the explanation that I have given in response to the explicit question put by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, as well as addressing a number of other amendments, this may be of assistance to the Committee in their reflections.

<P>
<A NAME="30127-22_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister, and particularly to my noble friend Lady Carnegy, for providing the opportunity to ask questions at this point. I would have had to hang my questions on Amendment No. 129, on which I have a separate question. I should like to make it clear that our Amendments Nos. 123, 125 and 131 were tabled to elicit from the Government the response that they have given. We welcome the fact that they have, as we believe, fully met the requirements of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. As the Minister said, our amendments were wider, but our aim was to achieve the result that he has given.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para25"></a>There are other issues which may more properly be debated in court; however, I consider that I should raise them now in order to give notice to the Government. I have some remaining concerns, and for this reason, if the Government decide to list new countries in an order, the House will then face great difficulty because the order cannot be amended.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para26"></a>Perhaps we can imagine a situation in which the Government have listed new countries which are to become "participating countries". There might be just five countries on the list&#151;to pick a number out of the air. Four of those might be wholly unobjectionable. However, some noble Lords might find one of those countries objectionable. As the noble Lord is aware, the rules relating to Standing Orders do not permit us to amend the statutory instrument. The House would then be in the position of having to reject the whole order if it found enough people to do so, instead of being able to amend it. The Government would then be in the position of having to waste more time and money in an attempt to bring back the order.
<P>


<a name="column_GC164"></a>

<B>27 Jan 2003 : Column GC164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para27"></a>My question is: is there any way in which the Government would either be able to bring forward an order for participating countries in respect of just one at a time? What procedure would the Government take to canvass opinion before an order was brought forward which contained more than one country? The reason I raise this issue&#151;it is not something that I have plucked out of the blue&#151;is with regard to a different department. Approximately two or three years ago, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport brought forward a statutory instrument by negative resolution which year by year raises the TV licence fee. Appended to that, the Government saw fit to add in an objectionable matter, but also a wholly admirable one, whereby people over a certain age were able to obtain a free TV licence. Therefore, the House found one part of the order objectionable&#151;an increase in taxation, however indirectly&#151;and the other part absolutely acceptable. I can envisage the same situation occurring here; it might happen.
<P>

<a name="30127-22_para28"></a>My final question is very brief. I have already heard from the noble Lord's advisers that there is an absolute and complete answer, but it is one that should be put on the record. It is with regard to Scotland and Amendment No. 129, which would allow the Scottish Ministers to make an order. My question is: could this mean that different countries were participating countries in Scotland as opposed to the rest of the United Kingdom, or would the orders made by the Scottish Ministers simply mirror those made by the Secretary of State?

<P>
<A NAME="30127-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I support my noble friend Lady Anelay, who has raised important matters. This Bill depends upon international co-operation. I realise that as far as our own statute and our statutory instruments are concerned, we have to act independently. Other countries will also have to act independently, although complying with international agreements. However, on subordinate legislation, Clause 51 enables only negative resolutions to be made, even on matters of great importance, which could have far-reaching effects. I hope that between now and Report, the Government would consider giving a power to Parliament to consider by affirmative resolution, instead of merely negative resolution, any matter of real importance which might affect the international co-operation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   On Amendment No. 129, the noble Lord says that Scottish Ministers would be involved, and my noble friend Lady Anelay asked a rather awkward question. Might Scottish Ministers want different participating states to the Home Secretary? At the moment it is impossible to envisage that, but I am picturing the years ahead when there might be a different party in power in the Scottish Parliament to that south of the Border. If that party in power in Scotland wanted to be really difficult, it could select a tricky country, which the Home Secretary wanted to make a participating state, and refuse to accept it. Perhaps the Minister might think that the <P>

<A NAME="30127-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   These are all good questions and I shall hazard an answer to some of them. On the other hand, the questions merit reflection. That is not to imply that the Government necessarily think that we are minded to change. We do not, but it is right and proper that we give the fullest and clearest response. Therefore&#151;it is hoped not too frequently&#151;it is right that on these occasions, when I have received those questions, I shall reply to Members of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="30127-23_para0"></a>There are one or two general points that I should make that are reasonably clear. As the Committee knows, essentially, if we make an international agreement through the Justice and Home Affairs Council within certain limits of flexibility, effectively that has to be put into legislation or the Government are in breach of their international obligations. The strict constitutional answer, of course, is that the House can do what it wants, but the Government have an obligation to seek to ensure that their legislation is compliant with the agreements that they have reached in Europe.
<P>

<a name="30127-23_para1"></a>Therefore, if a change was made relevant to a member state, there would be no discretion. Alternatively, if it was a non-member state, the affirmative resolution would apply. With regard to Scotland, the general principle is that on Scottish orders they would have to mirror the orders made in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30127-23_para2"></a>However, I should like to set out all of our response to those several points in a letter to all Members present, so that they have the benefit of our reflection. They are important constitutional points and therefore, with the leave of the Committee, that is what I shall do.

<UL>Whether they would support peace-keeping operations in the Ivory Coast under the control of the United Nations; and what is their policy towards the Ivory Coast, in the light of the New Partnership for Africa's Development and the G8 Action Plan agreed in 2002.[HL1086]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  We remain concerned at the crisis in Cote d'Ivoire and its implications for the wider region. We are working closely with the French and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for a peaceful resolution. We urge the Ivorian parties now meeting in Paris to engage seriously in the search for an inclusive political solution.
<P>

<a name="30127w01_para0"></a>Both NEPAD and the G8 Africa Action Plan emphasise the wish of Africa's leaders to address the long-term development needs of the continent. Peace and security are key elements of this. We are supporting the ECOWAS peace-monitoring force, which has already begun to deploy in Cote d'Ivoire. The UK is providing &#163;2 million to assist the Ghanaian contingent. We welcome the political support which the UN Security Council has provided for the peace process. Its continued engagement will be important if this is to succeed.

<P>
<A NAME="30127w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Irvine of Lairg): </B>  Consumers benefit directly from the internationally recognised quality mark represented by Queen's Counsel status. It can guide uninformed consumers when choosing an advocate and help more experienced consumers switch to new advocates, thus facilitating competition. There are no costs to consumers resulting from the current system of appointment of Queen's Counsel because, as I stated in the House on 12 December 2002, the fee paid by applicants for appointment as Queen's Counsel represents full cost recovery.

Candidates at parliamentary elections are entitled to receive a copy of the relevant electoral register for this and other electoral purposes. The term "candidate" is defined in Section 118A of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which states that a person becomes a candidate on the date of dissolution or on the occurrence of a vacancy if on or before that date he is declared by himself or by others to be a candidate at the election.

In addition, the Electoral Commission prepared an explanatory leaflet for electors, free of charge and available in several languages, about these changes, including the new edited register and the right for electors to choose not to be on it.

<a name="30127w01_para1"></a>(b) Precise information on the number of electors who choose to opt out from the edited register in the 2002 canvass is not available.

Each dose of the standard DTwP vaccine contains 50 micrograms of thimerosal (containing 25 micrograms of ethylmercury). Therefore, by 16 weeks the total thimerosal exposure would be no more than 150 micrograms (75 micrograms ethylmercury).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  The Department of Health collects information on the number of patients removed from the lists of general practitioners or personal medical services pilot providers and on whether there has been an act or threat of violence but does not collect information on the characteristics of the patients concerned. There is therefore no information on the numbers of such people who are elderly or disabled.

<A NAME="30127w02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  There is no right of appeal for any patient in such circumstances.

<P>
<UL>How they plan to improve teaching standards in specialist schools, which are reported to be similar to the national profile, despite the extra funding such schools receive.[HL1106]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127w03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  Ofsted's 2001 report on specialist schools said that the overall profile of teaching was broadly in line with the national picture. This was based on visits to 46 specialist schools. However, the latest Ofsted evidence submitted to the Education and Skills Select Committee looked at the evidence of all secondary schools inspected during school year 2001&#150;02. For the 74 specialist schools inspected, the proportion of teaching judged to be very good or better was 26 per cent compared with 8 per cent for non-specialist schools. The proportion of teaching judged to be good or better was 81 per cent in specialist schools compared with 74 per cent of non-specialist schools.
<P>

<a name="30127w03_para1"></a>The latest Ofsted figures suggest that significant progress is being made in specialist schools. This gives confidence that the key disciplines of the specialist schools programme (audit, objectives, target-setting and monitoring) will continue to help drive up standards, and the department will continue to monitor their progress.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127w03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  Specialist sports colleges are not required to own their own playing fields and equipment. However, they must have access to such facilities and equipment. In order to be designated as a specialist sports college, a school will need, through its application, to convince our independent assessors that it has use of the sports facilities necessary, including recreational areas, to support and deliver its sports college school and community development plans.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30127w03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  The Government have proposed that teachers should have guaranteed time for planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) equivalent to at least 10 per cent of their timetabled teaching time. Schools will manage this contractual change, which takes effect from September 2005, in a variety of ways. These are likely to include the transfer of managerial and administrative and non-teaching contact tasks to support staff, releasing teachers for PPA; protecting existing non-contact time from cover through the use of ICT learn centres and cover supervisors; and adjusting timetables and redeploying existing staff. Guidance will be made available to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>schools on ways of releasing time for guaranteed PPA. The cost of creating guaranteed PPA time will depend on how each school provides it. But it will be well within the estimated total cost of workforce reform in 2005&#150;06 of &#163;1 billion.

<P>
<A NAME="30127w03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone:  </B>  From 1 April 2003, the regional development agencies (RDAs) will play a stronger role in the strategic leadership of tourism and will receive at least &#163;3.6 million from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport for each of the next three years. They will consider tourism in the context of their corporate plans, regional economic strategies and the targets by which they are monitored. We see the regional tourist boards (RTBs) as their natural delivery partners. RDAs will distribute DCMS tourism funds to the RTBs for activities in line with regional sustainable tourism strategies and the national policy framework. For a transitional period <P>

<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Privy Seal on 12 December (WA 48) about security vetting, how many posts in the Northern Ireland Civil Service are classified as sensitive posts or higher; how many of those post holders possess valid security clearance; whether any civil servants whose security clearances have expired were still in post on 12 December 2002; and, if so, why.[HL751]<P></UL>

<A NAME="30127w03_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced on 12 December 2002 a review of arrangements for security vetting in Northern Ireland. This will include consideration of the need to designate particular posts as sensitive and the criteria that should be applied. At present all administrative posts in the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) are subject to a counter-terrorist check which is carried out on recruitment to the NICS. Under current national security vetting policy only individuals whose duties require long-term, frequent and uncontrolled access to Secret or Top Secret information or assets are regarded as requiring a security check or developed vetting. Very few posts within the NICS would involve such access. The extent and the appropriate levels and frequency of security vetting both at entry and beyond in the NICS will be examined afresh as part of the current review.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
