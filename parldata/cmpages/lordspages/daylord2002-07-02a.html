<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In so doing I should declare a modest interest as past president of two of the "other bodies" alluded to; that is, the British Academy and the Institute of Linguists.
<P>

<a name="20702-01_para0"></a>The Question was as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="20702-01_para1"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are reconsidering their language teaching proposals (Government consultation document 14&#150;19: extending opportunities, raising standards) in the light of the representations made by the Nuffield Steering Group and other bodies.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="20702-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, the consultation on the Green Paper, 14&#150;19: extending opportunities, raising standards, only closed on 31st May 2002. We are reflecting carefully on all the views expressed during the consultation before reaching any decisions. We have indicated in the Green Paper that curriculum changes would be subject to further consultation before their introduction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that encouraging reply. I wonder if it is not time for us to reconsider our position with respect to foreign languages and to think of them less as academic subjects than as practical skills. Is there not an attractive analogy in learning a musical instrument? The Associated Board tests performance at various grades, each of which is admirable in its own right; the pupil may at his own pace take up more than one instrument; and the QCA provides guidelines whereby the music grades are related to GCSE and A-level scores.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I could not agree more with the noble Lord, Lord Quirk. Indeed, noble Lords will have heard me discuss in debate the issues of the national languages strategy, which I was responsible ministerially for pulling together. We have been looking at the possibility of a system similar to a music grade, equating across, as the noble Lord says, but enabling people of all ages&#151;including Members of your Lordships' House&#151;to learn a foreign language and to have a similar accreditation system based on the practical application of language.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, has the noble Baroness discovered who was responsible for relaxing the national curriculum for teaching languages in secondary schools as referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, at the last stage of our debate on the Education Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, indeed, and I have written to the noble Baroness in that regard. I assume that the letter has not yet arrived. I hope it will arrive this afternoon. It explains that the references to disapplication were about ensuring that disapplication was simpler in the sense of the bureaucratic machine, but not about relaxing the ability of schools to teach languages before this consultation is finished and before we have made any decisions. So the disapplication procedure has always been under review. It is not the intention of this Government to allow any schools to change what they do until we have made any decisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as president of the Franco-British Society. Can my noble friend say whether, in view of the shortage of language teachers, the Government can persuade retired qualified teachers, some of whom may have retired early, to take up teaching again perhaps on a part-time basis?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, we are looking at all opportunities to encourage teachers back into the profession and, particularly in the case of language teachers we are discussing with our counterparts, the French and German ambassadors, ways in which we can work more closely. We want especially to revive the Assistant programme, which noble Lords may remember&#151;I certainly do&#151;as a way of enhancing our ability to teach languages in schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Watson of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, I recognise that on this matter, as in many others, the Minister's heart is in the right place. Perhaps we can strengthen another part of her anatomy, namely, her elbow. Would it strengthen her elbow if Her Majesty's Government recognised that one of the results of removing modern languages from the core curriculum at 14 must be to widen inequality and privilege in the educational system? All the facts show clearly that while modern language learning has been falling in the state system, it has been rising in public schools and private education. Surely that cannot be the intention of the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Watson, for his concerns about my anatomy. I hope that my elbows are fairly strong in this regard. The consultation has just finished and we are considering its content carefully. However, I have always worried about a system that relies heavily on the compulsion of a group <P>


<a name="column_119"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of teenagers to learn a language as being the mechanism by which we provide languages to the population. So, while taking nothing away from what the noble Lord said, I am interested in ensuring that we have a national languages strategy which is as applicable to a five year-old as it is to a 55 year-old in terms of providing the opportunity to learn one of many languages that students might wish to learn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, given that the Government's language learning strategy visualises that only by 2012&#151;10 years from now&#151;will every primary age school child have the opportunity of learning a foreign language, is it not essential, following upon the point already made, that, while developing their long-term strategy, the Government have an emergency plan to recruit and retain the necessary foreign language teachers? Can the Minister assure the House that the Government are taking action along those lines?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, in reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, first there is always a difficulty when putting an end date on a policy or strategy. Of course, it is the only date of reference and, therefore, it is endlessly referred to. But I would say that it is an end date and not a beginning date. That is important.
<P>

<a name="20702-01_para2"></a>We have a language strategy group in which the Nuffield Foundation and others are deeply involved. I am extraordinarily grateful for its contribution. Our plan is to produce the strategy document by the late autumn&#151;by the end of October or the beginning of November. It will lay out the details of how we wish to take forward languages in education right across from higher education down to primary schools. I hope that within that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, will see a strategy that looks at recruiting, retaining and developing the ability that we have to teach languages across a wide spectrum.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lord, I want to ask the Minister a very simple question after all the complications. Why is it that throughout the European Union they manage to teach languages from the age of eight or nine and in the United Kingdom we cannot? Can the Minister tell us why we cannot do it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the reason that we cannot do it is because we have never had a national language strategy. That is why it is so important that we begin to develop one now. That fits very well with the work we are doing with our European Union partners in thinking about the issues which are also pertinent in other parts of the European Union, such as teacher retention.

<A NAME="20702-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<UL>Whether they plan to repeal the Act of Settlement 1701.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Irvine of Lairg): </B>  My Lords, we have no plans to legislate in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor for that reply. Is he aware that in an interview with the Glasgow-based Herald newspaper shortly before the election in June last year the Prime Minister described the Act as "plainly discriminatory" and said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Obviously, in principle, it can't be right that Catholics are unable to succeed"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-01_para3"></a>Those views are widely shared by leaders of both the Anglican and the Roman Catholic Churches and by a number of members of the Cabinet. While I understand the pressures on parliamentary time, would it not be sensible, once the new Archbishop of Canterbury has been appointed, for the consultations with the leaders of the Commonwealth countries, which will be necessary before progress is made in this area, to be undertaken so that possibly we can have legislation in the next Parliament?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-01_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I am aware of the Prime Minister's comments. The Act could be said to be discriminatory in nature, but it is not discriminatory in impact. Where legislation could have far-reaching effects on our historical constitutional arrangements, both in the United Kingdom and in the Commonwealth, it is a good principle&#151;I would recommend to your Lordships&#151;to consider legislative change only where it can be maintained that there is a clear and pressing need for change.
<P>

<a name="20702-01_para4"></a>There are 20 members of the Royal Family in the line of succession after the Prince of Wales, all of whom are eligible to succeed and have been unaffected by the Act of Settlement. The Act of Settlement therefore has no present discriminatory impact. As for consultations with our Commonwealth partners, since we have no plans to legislate, such consultation would be premature.

<a name="column_121"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Would the noble and learned Lord agree that he has already made certain parts of the constitution threadbare by his and the Government's incoherent meddling with the constitution?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I certainly would not agree with that. The constitutional reform programme of the last Parliament extended to human rights, it extended to devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, it extended to freedom of information and it extended to reform of your Lordships' House. In all those areas there was a clear and pressing need for change. In this area there is not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of St Albans: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware that relationships between Christian denominations in this country, including those between Anglicans and Roman Catholics, are generally extremely good? Is he aware, however, that there are some significant differences between our Churches which impinge, for example, on how Anglican orders are viewed; how children in marriages between Roman Catholics and other Christians are to be brought up; and that perceptions of discrimination exist on different sides within the Church and not just one? Does he accept that the interests of those who pursue this matter may not be religious at all, but might be based upon an understanding of discrimination which in this case could be described as over simple?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I am not sure that that is an over-simple question, if I may say so. What I would say is that I am aware of these matters but I do not think that there is at present any general public interest in the repeal of the Act of Settlement. To the extent that there is ongoing debate, the Government will monitor it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord accept that, short of total repeal, those parts of the Act of Settlement that are discriminatory&#151;whether in a practical sense or by perception&#151;could be dealt with in a rather more piecemeal way? Does he further accept that the issue does not trouble people from a Catholic tradition, or indeed from most religious traditions? Most people in this country who have religious belief are full of joy that we have so little discrimination and that there is such a pluralistic and tolerant society in which people can enjoy their religious practice according to their conscience.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I agree, of course, with the second part of that question. As to the Act of Settlement, in whole or in part, I repeat that I believe that there is no clear and pressing need for repeal or reform.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord is correct to say that, at present, none of the top 20 in succession to the throne happens to be a Roman Catholic. Is there any way in which he can know that none of them will be converted in the near future?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-02_para1"></a>Did he by any chance read an article in The Times by Mary Ann Sieghart about three months ago? It stated that during the past 20 years there has been a quite remarkable change in the direction of civil and religious equality for Roman Catholics in this country. Does he agree that that change cannot be complete until the offending passage in the Act of Settlement is removed? Will he therefore initiate international consultations accordingly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, first, of course I recognise that people can be converted. I am not sure that the noble Earl is ripe for conversion in any particular direction. As for the article by Mary Ann Sieghart, yes, I read it. But I repeat that, whereas it can be said that the Act of Settlement is discriminatory in nature, it has no discriminatory impact today. If it were ever likely to have, the matter would have to be addressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord will be aware that Prince James Francis Edward Stuart should have become King in 1701 on the death of his father. Does he agree that the Act of Settlement was this Parliament's response to the Act of Security passed by the Parliament of Scotland, reserving to Scotland the right to choose their own King? Does he further agree that James Francis Edward poses no threat today and, accordingly, that the Act of Settlement&#151;that piece of eighteenth-century Whig paranoia, which led to parliamentary Union&#151;can be safely laid to rest?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spmin4"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, all that I should like to say about that is that noble Lords will appreciate, as does the noble Earl, that the Act of Settlement was legislation passed by a previous Administration.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Barker </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<UL>What difficulties have arisen owing to the distinction between nursing care and personal care for the purpose of funding arrangements.
<P></UL>
<P>

<a name="20702-02_para2"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): My Lords, National Health Service nurses have applied the registered nursing care contribution tool to assess the needs of nursing home residents. A full evaluation of the implementation of the policy has been commissioned and is due to report this autumn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, in this week when, as a result of devolution, which has just been mentioned, personal care in Scotland became free for older people, will the Minister comment on the report issued this March by nursing home co-ordinators and health authorities that found that six out of 10 nursing homes were passing on costs in increased fees to older people? <P>


<a name="column_123"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>At a time when older people in Scotland are receiving free personal care, what is his department doing to stop older people in England paying for what is supposed to be free nursing care by the back door?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, it is the glory of devolution that Scotland can choose which way it wishes to go and that we in England can choose a different course. We chose a different course because we believed that if we instituted free personal care, we should not produce a single extra service as a result but would benefit many better-off people. We considered that the £1 billion cost of free personal care in England would be better spent on providing services such as intermediate care for all older people to enjoy and to help them rehabilitate, rather than having to enter institutionalised care.
<P>

<a name="20702-02_para3"></a>Of course, I have read comments concerning where the money being provided for free nursing care has gone. I understand that the majority of individuals are already benefiting financially from the introduction of NHS-funded nursing care, but, in March, my honourable friend Jacqui Smith announced a package of measures designed to ensure much greater transparency, so that self-funded residents in such homes know exactly what money is being spent where.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that sickness and disability lead to a wide variety of needs&#151;for surgery, for medical drugs, for physiotherapy and for wheelchairs&#151;that are properly met by the National Health Service free of charge? By charging for the other important need arising from sickness and disability&#151;personal care&#151;the Government are being both illogical and unfair. The sooner that that policy is reversed, the better for disabled people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend speaks forcefully on the matter, as he has done for many years. But the treatment of personal care and NHS services has been consistently applied for many years. When we are faced with the prospect of £1 billion extra having to be spent on free personal care in England, if we adopt the Scottish model, searching questions must be asked about whether that money would be wisely spent. As I said, the Government decided that it would be much better spent on intermediate care, which is designed to rehabilitate older people, in particular, and return them wherever possible to their own home. Surely, that is where the incentive should lie, not in institutionalised care.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that if personal care is neglected, that will frequently lead to expensive nursing and medical care and, in the long run, cost the country a great deal more?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Yes, my Lords. That is why we announced that under the next spending <P>


<a name="column_124"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>review, personal social services will, over a three-year period, receive an increase of about 6 per cent in real terms. That recognises the noble Lord's point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Lipsey: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that any transitional problems that we may be experiencing in moving from nursing homes pale into insignificance when compared to the dog's breakfast of a policy of free personal care favoured, alas, by the Scots and by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker? Beside being unaffordable and doing nothing to improve care standards, it represents a massive transfer of money from poorer to richer people.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend speaks with authority as a member of the royal commission. What he says is surely to the point. Some propose that we spend £1 billion extra on free personal care. Many of those people are better off. Is that really where the priority should lie? The Government say no, it should lie in rehabilitation, trying to ensure that as many people as possible are kept from entering homes in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, did the Minister read in today's paper a report of an old lady of 108 who committed suicide by hunger strike because she was turned out of the care home in which she had lived because she could no longer afford it? Will he consider that there may be more concerns in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in his philosophy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, it is always dangerous to rely too much on newspaper reports. I am sure that we shall want to study the results of any review led by the local authority. My understanding of the case is that the council worked closely with the family to find new accommodation for that person. Of course, one's sympathy goes out to Mrs Knight's relatives. However, I understand that the owner was retiring.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para0"></a>The allegation is that the regulations set by the National Care Standards Commission were at too high a level. I must make the point that the National Care Standards Commission has allowed for flexibility and has allowed more time for new standards to come into operation. It was the care homes themselves who wished to see a national system of regulation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, if somebody living in a care home needs physiotherapy, occupational therapy or speech therapy, would that come under personal care or nursing care?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, it depends on the individual. Many people in nursing homes receive continuing care, which is provided entirely by the National Health Service. The Government's commitment is to free nursing care. The assessment is concerned with care that is either provided or supervised by a registered nurse.

<P>
<UL>Whether they recognise the need for the introduction of an identity card incorporating biometric details to assist in the prevention of acts of terrorism and the fight against other crime.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  My Lords, in the period after 11th September, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary made it clear that any debate around entitlement cards should not rest solely on issues of national security. The Government do not consider that an identity card incorporating biometric details would have a significant effect in preventing acts of terrorism.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para1"></a>One of the potential uses of a card scheme on which we will be consulting in the near future would be to help reduce the level of identity fraud. That is a growing area of crime and is estimated to cost the economy at least £1.3 billion per annum. It will be for the British people to indicate their support or otherwise for a more comprehensive system of personal identification, including for the task of eliminating illegal working and facilitating more convenient and effective access to services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for that Answer. Does he recognise that the people of this country expect the Government to fight with vigour and effectiveness at least four battles: against terrorism, against crime, against social security fraud and against the abuse of our immigration rules? Does he also recognise that, so long as it is not possible to identify individuals who might be involved in such activities, the Government are fighting those battles with one hand tied behind their back?
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para2"></a>Does the Minister remember that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who knows a thing or two about such matters, has advocated identity cards with full, state-of-the-art biometric details? The Minister talked about the British people, but is he aware that, in a MORI poll conducted in September, 85 per cent of the British people said that they would like a national identity card, and 72 per cent said that such a card would not infringe personal freedom? Will the Minister please take more comprehensive action?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord referred to four fights. We must, of course, engage in those fights. Would identity cards help? There must be full, detailed consultation about every aspect. As my right honourable friend said in another place, we will shortly produce a consultation document that will permit that debate to take place.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para3"></a>The noble Lord also referred to the views of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner's on identity cards. Those views will play a part in the debate. All the issues raised require a full debate. The noble Lord <P>

<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, how does the Minister define the phrase "biometric details"? I asked the Library what biometry is and I was told that it is a calculation of the average duration and expectation of life. Can the Minister assure me that no identity card that covers the expectation of life will be used for insurance or other purposes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I did not understand the phrase to refer to expectation of life until the noble Baroness pointed that out. I understood it to refer to a means of measuring a part of one's body or anatomy that is unique to oneself and could provide a unique identifier. I do not think that life expectancy falls within that description.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord accept that far and away the best method of achieving the prevention mentioned in the Question is having good intelligence? Money should be spent on that, rather than on harassing law-abiding citizens with further regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure whether the noble Lord was referring to intelligence on unique identifiers. Intelligence is vitally important to the fight against crime, illegal immigration and benefit fraud. The question is whether other things should be available to help in that fight. That is what we must debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Sharples: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that each government department has a different card? Last week, I met a lady who had six different cards&#151;all with different photographs. She had to go through a security system before she got the cards. Would not the most sensible approach be to have one card?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I see the force of that argument, although that does not mean that I am expressing a view on identity cards or entitlement cards. Access to services that the Government provide through one source of identification would be of great convenience to receivers of those services. That is an important argument, and it should be considered in the debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew13"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister think that the problem is in detecting and arresting criminals committing violent crimes or burglaries or in identifying them after they have been caught?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether that is a question about the criminal justice system or about identity cards. The role of identity cards or entitlement cards with regard to crime&#151;organised crime, terrorist crime or any other sort of crime&#151;must be fully examined. We must <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The National Insurance Contributions Bill will put in place the main source of funding for the Government's planned increase in investment in the National Health Service. In his Budget of 17th April, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the results of the Wanless review of funding for health services and set out plans for the biggest ever increase in National Health Service investment. He repeated the Government's commitment to a world-class health service for the British people that was free at the point of use and funded by general taxation.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para4"></a>Derek Wanless's report came at the end of a period of debate on alternative methods of funding health services. It examined in detail the alternatives of private insurance and continental-style social insurance schemes. It confirmed the Government's belief that general taxation, including national insurance contributions, remains the fairest and most efficient method of providing the resources necessary for the health service. Private health insurance would fail to help those most in need, would provide coverage that was often inadequate and would be more bureaucratic and expensive. Social insurance schemes such as those used in France, Germany and the Netherlands tend to be regionally based, do not provide full cover for everyone and often place a disproportionate burden on employers. We have rejected those alternatives.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para5"></a>The National Health Service has been partly funded from national insurance contributions since it was established in the 1940s. That is consistent with the principle underlying the Beveridge reforms, which was that people should contribute, when they are working, to the cost of benefits and services that they may need when they cannot work. National Insurance contributions are paid by those who work and by their employers. It is right that employers should contribute, since absence due to sickness is a major cost, amounting to around £12 billion a year according to a CBI survey in 2001. Everyone who has a stake in the National Health Service will contribute while they are in work, when they can best afford to. But there will be no additional burden on pensioners, who do not pay national insurance.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para6"></a>The Bill increases the contributions paid by employees, employers and the self-employed by 1 per cent. It also ensures that the additional contribution is paid on all earnings above the national insurance threshold, including earnings above the upper earnings limit and upper profits limit.
<P>


<a name="column_128"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para7"></a>Clause 1 increases the primary Class 1 contribution paid by employees from 10 per cent to 11 per cent on earnings between the primary threshold and the upper earnings limit, as from April 2003. It also introduces a contribution of 1 per cent on earnings above the upper earnings limit. Only the rate payable on earnings below the upper earnings limit can be amended in future by secondary legislation. Because there is separate national insurance legislation for Northern Ireland, the Bill also makes equivalent changes to the Northern Ireland legislation throughout.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para8"></a>Clause 2 applies a similar 1 per cent increase to secondary Class 1 contributions paid by employers so that the rate will be 12.8 per cent next year, compared with 11.8 per cent this year. Because there is no upper earnings limit for employers' contributions, the 12.8 per cent rate will apply to all earnings above the secondary threshold. The rates paid by employers on benefits in kind and PAYE settlement agreements&#151;Class 1A and Class 1B&#151;will also be 12.8 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para9"></a>Clause 3 increases the Class 4 contribution paid by the self-employed on their profits and gains, from 7 per cent this year to 8 per cent next year. As for employees, they will also pay a contribution of 1 per cent on profits and gains above the upper profits limit.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para10"></a>Clauses 4 and 5 ensure that the additional revenue raised from the increases will be channelled to the National Health Service rather than to the National Insurance Fund, which finances contributory benefits. The proceeds of the increased contributions are added to the existing allocation to the NHS. So, for example, this year an amount equivalent to 1.05 per cent out of the 10 per cent contribution by an employee will be allocated to the NHS. Next year, that increases to 2.05 per cent, plus the whole of any contribution payable on earnings above the upper earnings limit. Equivalent changes are made to the NHS allocation from employers' and self-employed contributions.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para11"></a>The schedules to the Bill contain consequential amendments and repeals. These include amendments to ensure that the changes to contributions do not affect anyone's entitlement to contributory national insurance benefits or any arrangements for contracting out of the state second pension. Contributory benefits will continue to be backed by the National Insurance Fund, which is not affected by this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para12"></a>The changes in the Bill, together with the freezing of the income tax and national insurance thresholds in 2003-04 announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget, will raise £8.6 billion next year. This makes possible an increase in spending on the NHS from £65 billion this year to £106 billion in 2007-08&#151;an average growth of 7.4 per cent a year, in real terms, for the next five years. It will increase as a share of national income from 6.7 per cent in 1997, and 7.7 per cent this year, to 9.4 per cent in 2007-08.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para13"></a>That will mean 35,000 more nurses, midwives and health visitors, 15,000 more doctors and consultants, and 42 major hospital schemes to be opened by 2008. New targets have been agreed to reduce the maximum wait for an outpatient appointment to three months, <P>


<a name="column_129"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the maximum wait for inpatient treatment to six months by the end of 2005. By 2004, the maximum wait for emergency treatment from arrival in accident and emergency to admission, transfer or discharge will be four hours.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para14"></a>The new resources for investment are being matched by reform, to provide: more devolution of power to front-line organisations and new financial incentives to improve performance; increased choice for patients; improved standards of social services are for the elderly; and new independent regulators, with powers enshrined in legislation to audit and inspect local health services and scrutinise patients' complaints.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para15"></a>The Bill is short and simple. It delivers additional funding for the National Health Service which will allow it to deliver the standard of healthcare this country demands. It does so in a way which spreads the burden as widely and fairly as possible, using the mechanism of national insurance just as the first National Insurance Act did in 1946. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew16"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Derby: </B>   My Lords, I fully appreciate the reasoning behind the 1 per cent increase in the employer's national insurance contribution: it is designed to provide revenue for a most worthy cause; namely, the National Health Service. But I cannot help feeling that the Government may have seen it as an easy way of raising revenue. It is easily collected and businesses can set it off against corporation tax. Have Ministers really considered its implications for the voluntary sector&#151;for charities in general and for the Churches in particular?
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para17"></a>Here, I speak as chairman of the Churches Main Committee, representing the Jewish community and some 40 Christian denominations in their dealings with the Government. Churches and the voluntary sector are being left to bear the increase without any relief. In the case of the Church of England alone, we estimate that it will cost around £2 million a year.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para18"></a>In the past, governments have recognised the unfairness of imposing taxes on charities' payrolls. So charities were exempted from the selective employment tax in 1968 and the national insurance surcharge in 1977&#151;on the same grounds as make them exempt from other forms of direct taxation. In its effect, the national insurance contribution increase is just like that surcharge. Given these precedents, why impose the increase on Churches and others in the voluntary sector? I have written to the Chancellor about this but have not yet received an answer. I await with interest what the noble Lord has to say.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_time3"></a><H5>3.17 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches support the Bill for two principal reasons. First, we agree that the NHS needs a substantial and sustained increase in funding from general taxation. Secondly, <P>


<a name="column_130"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we support the principle of hypothecating tax increases to specific areas of expenditure. I shall return to both those points.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para19"></a>However, we have several reservations about the situation in which we now find ourselves in terms of taxation and spending and the way in which the money is being raised. The Chancellor is truly the son of the manse. He was clearly influenced in his youth by biblical descriptions of years of famine followed by years of feast. On newly entering his post, he perpetuated and intensified the famine in public expenditure which the previous government had imposed, and we saw continuing under-funding of the NHS during the majority of the previous Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para20"></a>The Chancellor then had something of a change of mind&#151;a contagion which spread to the Prime Minister, who in a panic attack on a TV programme, said that we were going to bring health expenditure up to European levels. We then had a reverse panic about how on earth this was to be funded&#151;and in the run-up to the election, and indeed in the Labour Party manifesto, it was made clear that income tax would not rise during the course of this Parliament. The implication was that taxes were unlikely to have to rise during the course of this Parliament. But, of course, this was always a mistaken perception. It is an indictment of the Chancellor and of the Government more generally that they allowed the perception to remain, during and immediately beyond the election, that it was possible to have something for nothing in the shape of substantially increased public expenditure but without substantially increased levels of taxation to go along with it. In our view it would have been much more honest to say during the election that, in order to reach the targets set by the Government for health expenditure, general taxation would have to rise. There was nothing to be ashamed of in doing that, and they should have done it.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para21"></a>Having had the election and, unsurprisingly, deciding that tax rises are necessary, the Chancellor is now being forced by his manifesto commitment not to increase income tax and is looking elsewhere to fund the additional health expenditure. He has chosen national insurance contributions.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para22"></a>National insurance contributions in their current form are a somewhat curious relic of the Beveridge report. The contribution rules are complex and opaque. Funds reach the National Insurance Fund for pensions, incapacity and other benefits&#151;the benefits that people assume the fund is for&#151;only after more than 10 per cent of all national insurance contributions have been siphoned off for the NHS. The Bill will move NICs further from their original purpose and will mean that a much smaller proportion of national insurance contributions find their way into the National Insurance Fund.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para23"></a>We also believe that it is unsatisfactory to choose NICs rather than income tax. The NIC system is much more aggressive than income tax. It does not cover unearned income or that of pensions. A pensioner with an income of £50,000 will pay no more as a result of the Bill, whereas a part-time worker earning £5,000 will do so.
<P>


<a name="column_131"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para24"></a>At this stage in the economic cycle, it is also disappointing that the Chancellor has chosen to place an additional burden on employers. The NIC increases will be particularly unwelcome in the manufacturing sector which has lost an incredible 500,000 employees in the past four years, and which, as we saw from Massey Ferguson's decision last week, continues to suffer because of the Government's inability to take the lead on British membership of the euro. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby made clear, other employers, including local authorities and NGOs, will be hit by this tax increase. NIC increases may be a stealth tax to individuals, but they will certainly have severe economic consequences for many employers.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para25"></a>I said that we supported the Bill for two reasons. The first is the need for additional resources for health. We unreservedly support that purpose, but it is equally important that those additional resources are spent as effectively as possible. At present, the NHS is a monolithic organisation. To be more effective, there needs to be more scope for local discretion. As no hospital or primary care group operates in isolation from other parts of the health service in the region where it is based, much more strategic discretion should be exercised at regional level. The White Paper on regional government is a major missed opportunity in that respect.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para26"></a>The detailed health targets set in Whitehall are inappropriate for many communities. If the NHS is to be more responsive and efficient, the vice-like grip of Whitehall needs to be relaxed.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para27"></a>I said that we also supported the Bill because we support the principle of hypothecation of tax increases. We do so because it is more transparent and one can see where the money is going. Secondly&#151;this is an argument that I suspect would not have been used 20 years ago&#151;people do not trust politicians to spend money in the way that they want. Those of us who believe that additional expenditure is necessary for the health service are more likely to win the popular argument by seeking hypothecation so that people will know of the specific benefit that they will get from a tax increase. Indeed, we believe that there is now a strong argument for hypothecating a whole income stream from taxation for the NHS to give long-term certainty and transparency. I suspect that we shall return to that issue another day.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para28"></a>If we are to have greater hypothecation, we need to counter some of the criticisms of the concept. It is argued, for example, that people object to paying a particular tax if they do not like where it is going. People object to paying taxes for all kinds of reasons, whether or not they know where they are going. It is argued that it would be impractical to hypothecate everything; we could not have a tax for police, for defence or for every slice of Government expenditure. That is probably true, but no one is arguing that every on-going government commitment should have an earmarked tax either now or in the future.
<P>


<a name="column_132"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para29"></a>It is also argued that hypothecation is just a form of tokenism. It makes no difference whether one says that a certain pot of money is for a certain purpose; in reality, people would not understand how money was being spent, even if it were hypothecated. Some people may not, but hypothecation would make it much easier to explain. Within the National Insurance Fund, one can see the strengths of hypothecation. The NIF in many people's minds is still the fund into which they pay for specific purposes and out of which they draw benefits at a time of need. The on-going popularity of the national insurance principle is a strong argument for the hypothecation principle.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para30"></a>Possibly the most substantive argument is that hypothecation makes expenditure vulnerable to the vagaries of the business cycle. That is true to a certain extent, but no more so than for government expenditure as a whole. All taxes are linked to economic activity. Many are much more volatile than NICs and income tax. The Government smooth their expenditure by planning for the long term. In good years they build up a surplus and in bad years there is a deficit. The same could apply to hypothecated tax.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para31"></a>It is interesting and instructive to note that the National Insurance Fund has built up a surplus of almost £30 billion in this financial year. We should compare that with a surplus of less than £10 billion only a decade ago in order to deal with expected future drawings on the fund. The argument that one cannot make a hypothecated fund recession proof is no stronger than arguing that we cannot make government expenditure as a whole recession proof.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para32"></a>We support the intention behind the Bill, which is to strengthen the NHS. We support the principle of hypothecation and it is now up to the Government to show that they can spend their additional resources as effectively as they raise them.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, as this is the first Money Bill to come before your Lordships' House since the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House introduced his report of the working practices group, I shall take this opportunity to thank the Leader of the House, my noble friend Lord Strathclyde, and the other members of the group for their bold new approach to Finance Bills.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para33"></a>Noble Lords from all sides of the House have said that there is an expertise in this House on financial matters that can help to hold the Government to account on finance and to produce better legislation as a result. The Leader of the House deserves our praise for taking this historic step in that direction.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para34"></a>Like the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby, I am not completely sure whether the Bill has come to the House in error. It appears to have been sent to the wrong place. Would it not have been more appropriately received perhaps by a seminar of public relations consultants&#151;perhaps in one of its sessions, entitled, "How to bury bad news"?
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para35"></a>I shall take your Lordships back to the Chancellor's Budget speech, or even the Minister's speech a moment ago. They both described the proposed <P>


<a name="column_133"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>national insurance increases in the Bill as being intended to fund "the biggest ever increase in health spending"&#151;I think that is what the Minister said. The Chancellor said much the same. As I hope to show, the Bill has little to do with insurance and nothing whatever to do with health.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para36"></a>We were all touched by the thought of higher health spending and considered it a fine and worthy use of our money. As the Minister said, the Bill aims to provide world-class care in the National Health Service, and who can possibly deny the need for that? Let us put aside all carping about the loss of income to various groups; let us not worry about the nurses, or the policemen, or anyone on average earnings who will be worse off; and let us not distress ourselves about the irony that the increase in employer's national insurance contributions, provided for in the Bill, will hit the public services hardest of all&#151;an extra £1.2 billion cost to our public services. Let us put aside all doubts about whether more tax will give people the standard of healthcare that they deserve; let us forget that in the past five years in Scotland health spending has risen by 28 per cent in real terms, while waiting times have risen by the same amount; and let us not dwell too long on the way in which voters were misled about the Government's intention in relation to the Bill, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. We shall also repress the memory of the Prime Minister saying during the election campaign:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have not the slightest intention of hammering people in the higher income brackets",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para37"></a>or the Chancellor describing suggestions that he would raise the national insurance ceiling as a smear&#151;he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I utterly repudiate"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para38"></a>or the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry insisting,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We've got no plans to raise the ceiling on national insurance contributions",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para39"></a>and adding for effect:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not going to happen".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para40"></a>We could forgive all that if the money were put to a good cause. But that is not the case at all.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para41"></a>I want to draw your Lordships' attention to table A1 in the Red Book on page 154. It is a helpful table which shows the impact of the Budget changes. In lines 1 and 3 one duly finds the increases brought about as a result of the Bill. Personal tax is up by £4.6 billion, which is fine, and we are ready to forgive, to forget and to pay the £4.6 billion for a good cause. However, where will that money go according to table A1? It will not go to the NHS. Instead in lines 18 and 19 and in note K we find that personal tax is down by £4.6 billion. As the Minister knows, that is the effect of the changes to the Government's tax credits regime. So all the money raised by this Bill will pay for tax credits and will not go to the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para42"></a>Perhaps we can relax. If the money is not spent on health, perhaps it will be spent on insurance. Like the noble Lord, Lord Newby, I shall reflect on the contributory principle of social insurance that underlies the National Insurance Fund. As the <P>


<a name="column_134"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister has said, the essential element of the contributory principle is eligibility for certain benefits&#151;mainly retirement and widows' pensions&#151;based on compulsory contributions from employees, employers and the self-employed.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para43"></a>Looking at the latest report of the Government Actuary on the National Insurance Fund, published last May, we find a familiar figure of £58 million of receipts from national insurance contributions and £55 billion paid out in age-related benefits of one kind or another. It seems that the National Insurance Fund does not operate as insurance in the normal sense of that word; it operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, so that today's contributions by today's workers cover and finance the current outgoings paid to today's benefit recipients.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para44"></a>The problem is that there is little direct financial relationship between what an individual pays in over a lifetime and what an individual may or may not take out by way of benefit. That point was exposed in the fifth report of the Select Committee on Social Security in June 2000. The committee was worried about the contributory principle and what it would mean for the public in accounting terms. It was pointed out that we now have a mish-mash in respect of what is paid into the fund and what is received from it. It was said that they were not transparent transactions.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para45"></a>If asked about the Bill and about the contributory principle, how many voters would understand that the bulk of national insurance does not go to the National Health Service? The noble Lord, Lord Newby, raised the same point. Research undertaken by Dr Stafford in 1998 for the then Department of Social Security concluded:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the respondents believed that through their contributions they had secured a contract with the state that gave them a 'right' to contributory benefits. In some instances, respondents thought, incorrectly, that their contributions were paid into a 'personal kitty', which was available when needed".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para46"></a><P>

<a name="20702-03_para47"></a>The TUC giving evidence to the Social Security Committee also complained about the lack of transparency in the national insurance contribution system. It was surprised by the public's complete lack of understanding about the working of the contributory system, which I believe the noble Lord, Lord Newby, called complex and opaque. The TUC's evidence spoke of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the complexity of national insurance and the widespread ignorance of its main features".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para48"></a><P>

<a name="20702-03_para49"></a>The Government know the situation well and plan to take full advantage of it. As the right reverend Prelate said, the Bill is merely a device for raising money painlessly because people dislike the idea of paying income tax. Although the idea of contributory benefits as a right may be popular with some members of the public, I hope that I have shown that it does not have any basis in economic or accounting reality. Therefore, we should give up the myth that the national insurance regime is insurance and admit that it is a straightforward tax.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>take in the money and pay it out as we wish. What is in a name?" Perhaps there is not much in a name, but as the accountants at WorldCom discovered, calling an item by a different name can change the way in which that item is viewed, which means that one can change the way in which it is treated in the accounts. By changing the name one can achieve a different result, as the Government know well. They are experts at it. That is why they classify "spending" as "investment"; "means testing" as "targeting"; "benefit" as "credit"; and that is why they stop us using the phrase "tax burden" and require us to use the phrase "tax and social security contributions as a percentage of gross domestic product" instead. By calling "costs" "capital" one increases the profit; by calling "tax" "insurance" one reduces the pain, as the right reverend Prelate said.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para51"></a>The very existence of the Bill conforms to Professor Liekerman's views about the way in which public accounts are dealt with. He says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is an enormous need for much greater clarity of presentation",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para52"></a>and continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Reader understanding (of financial reports in the public sector) is sometimes felt by those who compile them to be a disadvantage".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para53"></a>He also said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Such reports should . . . not be unduly distorted"&#151;
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para54"></a>I draw your Lordships' attention to the phrase&#151;

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para55"></a>The entire Bill is the creation of public relations considerations.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para56"></a>The Institute for Fiscal Studies is in no doubt about what we are talking about in the Bill. It says that it is a back-door increase in income tax, as the right reverend Prelate said, rather than any form of contribution. It says that the increase in national insurance is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for somebody whose sole source of income is from paid employment exactly like increasing the starting, basic and higher rates of income tax by 1 percentage point".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para57"></a>The Treasury Select Committee went on to suggest:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We note this departure from previous practice which could be viewed as a move of the national insurance contribution system towards that of general taxation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-03_para58"></a><P>

<a name="20702-03_para59"></a>We are moving towards a national insurance system in which there is no relationship between what individuals pay in and what it pays out. In my opinion, the Bill deliberately further blurs the distinction between general taxation and national insurance contributions.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para60"></a>In Committee in another place, the Financial Secretary said that the Government have given us a tax system that is like a television set&#151;so complicated that no one understands it but that did not matter because people only had to turn the switch. That is utter nonsense. What switch has to be turned to discover that not one penny of the extra £4.6 billion of national insurance contributions will go on health?

<P>
<A NAME="20702-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for some of the contributions to this short debate. A Bill that does nothing but raise revenue from the public is not going to be the most popular Bill in the parliamentary year. The paradox is that the Chancellor's Budget has been popular because people recognise that our arguments about National Health Service funding are right. The Budget has been popular because the public recognise that if one wants a world-class NHS, one must pay for it. There are no cheap and easy ways out. As Derek Wanless has pointed out, there are no solutions in individual or social insurance alternatives.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para61"></a>I knew that our policy would have the support of the Liberal Democrats but I am fascinated by the silence from members of the Conservative Front Bench. I understand that the Conservative Party has been searching Europe, and perhaps the world, for alternatives to funding the NHS from general taxation. Perhaps the silence from the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, is an indication that is about to change. I hope so. That would be most welcome.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para62"></a>The right reverend Prelate speaks with authority from his position in the Church of England and as a representative of Churches and faiths more generally. I acknowledge the force of his complaint that the voluntary sector, charities and Churches will be treated in the same way as businesses and individuals&#151;which we have never sought to conceal. I am sorry that the right reverend Prelate has not received a reply after writing to the Chancellor two or three weeks ago. I shall make sure that a response is expedited. Such delay is not satisfactory in respect of anyone who writes to the Chancellor&#151;still less someone who writes in such an important representative capacity.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para63"></a>The voluntary sector, charities and Churches are affected by the Bill as employers&#151;just as all other employers are&#151;by the problem of ill health among people of working age. We rely on the CBI estimate, not our own, of the cost of ill health to employers&#151;including charities, the voluntary sector, charities and Churches&#151;totalling £12 billion a year. An improved health service will bring benefits to employers, regardless of who they are.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para64"></a>There is general agreement that the health service is defective in many ways. The voluntary sector, charities and Churches need the service to be improved and will benefit when it is&#151;so they will get something back for the money they pay.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para65"></a>The public services as a whole ought not to be treated differently from the private sector in respect of taxes from employees and employers, as that would give rise to an anomaly that would present difficulties to begin with and make things impossible as time went on. How could one distinguish between public and private services? Would private companies that supply only the public services also be exempt? No one can justify discrimination in employment taxation as between the public and private sectors. Instead, we have to ensure that the money going to public services <P>


<a name="column_137"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and to the voluntary sector, Churches and charities is sufficient to allow them to bear the burden, which they must, together with other employers.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para66"></a>We need to examine the cost of public services in the wider context of increased spending on pubic services in 2003-2004, when the measure will come into force, of £19.5 billion and of £6.7 billion on the National Health Service. Under those circumstances, the relative importance of the figures takes on a different aspect.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para67"></a>Parts of the voluntary sector and charities do contribute to publicly funded public services. I assure the right reverend Prelate that as part of the current spending review, which will be reported later this month, there will be a cross-cutting review of the role of the voluntary sector in delivering and assisting the delivery of public services. That review will take account of the issues that the right reverend Prelate raised.
<P>

<a name="20702-03_para68"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, made an interesting speech about hypothecation&#151;which appeared to be based in part on the thinking that the measure is hypothecation. It is no such thing. Our objection to hypothecation is as strong as ever and it stems not just from the answers that the noble Lord gave to his own questions about extending the principle to prisons, the Armed Forces or other less popular areas of public expenditure. Our objection is also that ways of raising money for public services are subject to variation, whereas the needs of the public services are not. We would not subject the National Health Service to a hypothecation that would put at risk its long-term financial planning, which must be based on a commitment to expenditure from all sources of revenue.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, if the definition of hypothecation is not that one raises or earmarks a tax for a specific purpose, what is the definition?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I shall explain that in the context of the Bill. In contrast to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, the Bill makes it explicit that all the money it raises will go to the NHS. Clauses 4 and 5 cannot be read any other way. That is not to say it is the only money going to the NHS or that there is a fixed relationship between NHS expenditure and the Bill's provisions or any other individual form of taxation. Our commitment is for a 7.4 per cent increase in NHS expenditure in real terms over the next five years&#151;equivalent to an increase in the service's budget from just over £60 billion to just over £100 billion between now and 2007. Over five years, that is a lot more money than will come from the Bill. Other sources of taxation are used for the NHS and the service will not be at risk if there were a reduction in employment, for example, and therefore a fall in revenue from the Bill. That is why the measure is the right approach, but it is not hypothecation.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Saatchi, began with a comment on the treatment in this House of the Finance Bill. He will be aware that the Bill is a money Bill, and a Bill of aids and supply. In other words, the <P>


<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Commons relies on privilege dating back not only to the Parliament Act 1911 but to resolutions of 1678&#151;and I forget the other year. It is a well-established historical principle that it should be in that form.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para1"></a>I did not think that the noble Lord's use of the rhetorical device served him well. He said, "Let us not take account of this and this". I could have challenged many or all of those points. However, I do not need to do so because he said, "Let us not do so", so I shall not. However, I shall answer his claim that all the money raised by the Bill will go on tax credits and the National Insurance Fund and not a penny of it&#151;I do not exaggerate what he said; he was extreme in his words&#151;will go to the National Health Service. I make clear that if he reads Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill he will see that there is no possibility of money being raised by the Bill and not going to the National Health Service. It is not all that will go to the National Health Service. In the early part of the next five year period it is probably true that money raised by the Bill and going to the National Health Service relieves pressure on other sources of taxation for the first year. But over the whole period I can assure the noble Lord without equivocation that that is what the Bill is for.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para2"></a>The noble Lord used the word "painless". None of this is painless. There is no way of raising taxes which is painless. But I believe that the people of this country want a world class health service. They want a health service which sets itself demanding but achievable targets and they are prepared to pay for it. The Bill is a contribution to that. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para4"></a>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this important Bill to the House. I shall start by putting the Bill into the context of the Government's overall strategy.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para5"></a>In our first term of government our economic priority was to establish economic stability&#151;the essential precondition for wider prosperity and business success. In this second term, our economic priority is to build on the foundation of economic stability by promoting higher productivity and greater enterprise. To achieve this we will now match independence for our monetary authorities with independence for our competition authorities, and alongside tough rules for public finances we will put strong rules for competitive behaviour and consumer protection.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para6"></a>The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the foundations of an enterprise economy&#151;by promoting competition, protecting consumers and establishing an insolvency regime that fully supports enterprise. <P>


<a name="column_139"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>These foundations need strengthening as soon as possible if the UK is to be equipped to meet the economic challenges of the 21st century.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para7"></a>The Bill has been widely welcomed. For example, recently Sheila McKechnie, of the Consumers' Association said that the measures will,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"put an end to the billions lost to consumers each year from rogue traders".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para8"></a>And Digby Jones of the CBI said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We support [the Bill] in the round and we value a very tough competitive regime because it will enhance productivity".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para9"></a>The Federation of Small Businesses said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We do not see anything controversial in these proposals and would urge all party support and speedy implementation through Parliament".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para10"></a><P>

<a name="20702-04_para11"></a>There has also been support from competition, consumer and insolvency experts and other interested parties. The extent of support for the Bill reflects the fact that at every stage we have listened to the views of stakeholders. In 1999, we consulted on the measures in the consumer White Paper. In 2000, we consulted on personal bankruptcy and reform of the merger regime and last year on competition and insolvency. The responses to our consultations, along with our ongoing discussions with a range of interested parties, have been invaluable in taking forward our original proposals.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para12"></a>The Bill has also been improved as a result of the constructive debate that took place in another place, and I am sure it will be here as well. Honourable Members there asked about how much of a difference the proposals will make to people's lives in practice. They sought reassurance that the Bill will not create new burdens on business. They asked whether sufficient resources will be available to back up new powers given in this Bill. I believe that we were able to give convincing answers to all their questions and to persuade them of the importance of the measures in this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para13"></a>I shall start with the measures in the Enterprise Bill&#151;in Parts 2 to 7&#151;to promote competition. As a Government, we are unashamedly pro-competition. Effective competition provides opportunities for new firms to enter markets and grow. Strong, fair competition contributes to innovation and productivity growth and the diffusion of economic power. It maximises opportunities for all.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para14"></a>We are still behind France, Germany and the US in our productivity. Our productivity performance must improve to ensure the higher living standards that all of as want. The number one target in the DTI's Public Service Agreement is to close the productivity gap. We need a step change in domestic competitive pressures to help us both raise our productivity and compete effectively in international markets.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para15"></a>I believe that as our competition framework becomes more effective, markets will work more efficiently and fairly, and the less regulatory intervention will be needed in the long run.
<P>


<a name="column_140"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para16"></a>The Competition Act 1998 started the process. It introduced into domestic law a regime which prohibited anti-competitive behaviour and which was closely modelled on the EC counterparts in Articles 81 and 82 of the EC treaty. But other areas of competition need to be addressed; for example, to modernise the mergers and markets regimes and to do more to deter cartels.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para17"></a>Our reforms are based on a number of key principles set out in the competition White Paper. The first principle is that we need strong, proactive and independent competition authorities that are able to deal with anti-competitive behaviour. So we are removing Ministers from the vast majority of decisions on mergers and market investigations, thereby removing a layer of regulation and streamlining the regime. We are ensuring that decisions are taken by competition experts, free from short-term political pressures. And by ensuring that those decisions are taken on the basis of a competition test, rather than a public interest test, we are improving the clarity of the framework for decisions, and the predictability of decisions made under it. This is good news for business.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para18"></a>The Bill also makes important procedural improvements to the regulatory framework for mergers and market investigations, ensuring greater transparency, and it makes changes to improve the accountability of the authorities. We will ensure that the competition authorities have the extra resources needed to carry out their functions effectively. The effect of the reforms will be a regime that operates predictably, consistently and proportionately. In short, better regulation.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para19"></a>The second principle of our reforms is to establish a strong deterrent effect for anti-competitive behaviour. The Competition Act introduced fines for firms which engage in anti-competitive behaviour&#151;but did not provide a deterrent for those individuals who dishonestly engage in hard-core cartels. Hard-core cartels do serious harm to consumers, businesses and to the economy by forcing up prices or keeping them artificially high, and preventing new entrants gaining access to markets. US competition authorities believe that cartels raise prices by 10 per cent on average.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para20"></a>Examples of recent cartels include the global vitamins cartel that fixed prices for eight years and is estimated to have doubled the prices to consumers&#151;resulting in a record European Commission fine&#151;the carbonless paper cartel led by a UK company, and the Sotheby's/Christies cartel. As Andreas Whittam Smith wrote in Monday's Independent:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The crime for which the former chairman of Sotheby's was sent to jail recently in the United States may have seemed like a breach of arcane rules about collusion in auction markets. But it was stealing . . . in the same way as having one's wallet removed by surreptitious fingers while pushing through a crowded street is stealing".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para21"></a><P>

<a name="20702-04_para22"></a>The Director-General of Fair Trading's cartels investigation branch is uncovering evidence of cartel activity in the UK. There are currently around 40 significant cases under investigation. The possibility of fines on companies under the Competition Act does not create a real deterrent for individuals.
<P>


<a name="column_141"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para23"></a>Therefore, we propose to introduce a new criminal offence of dishonestly entering into cartels, backed by sanctions including the possibility of up to five years' imprisonment. The offence is tightly drawn but will create a real deterrent effect. Not only is that measure vigorously supported by consumers, it has business support too from, for example, the British Chambers of Commerce.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para24"></a>Our third principle is that those who have lost out through anti-competitive behaviour&#151;whether businesses or consumers&#151;should have a genuine opportunity to obtain redress. Where a company has been found by the Office of Fair Trading to have breached competition law, the Bill will enable harmed parties to bring claims for damages before a specialist competition body&#151;the competition appeal tribunal. They can already go to the courts in those circumstances but the change brought about by the Bill will establish a cheaper, more streamlined route to obtain redress from companies that have broken the law.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para25"></a>Representative bodies will be able to bring claims for damages in front of the tribunal on behalf of named and identifiable consumers. That will help consumers bring claims where a large number of parties have suffered a relatively small level of harm. These are specific claims for damages against a company that has already been found to have breached competition law, not the much broader US-style class action. As the Consumers' Association said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"consumer organisations are hardly likely to engage in frivolous action that will cost them time, money and reputation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para26"></a><P>

<a name="20702-04_para27"></a>I turn now to the measures in the Bill specifically designed to protect consumers&#151;in Parts 1 and 8. Because strong competition is the best form of consumer protection, all our competition reforms are good news for consumers. The stop now orders, introduced last year, were widely welcomed by consumer organisations. They significantly improved the powers available to enforcement authorities to stop breaches of the legislation implementing 10 consumer protection directives. The Bill will extend this regime to other areas&#151;particularly in the service sector&#151;where consumer interests are harmed by traders not meeting their legal obligations. It will allow effective public law enforcement action to be taken against traders who provide inadequate services&#151;for example, cowboy builders, incompetent plumbers, and poor car servicing. By replacing Part III of the Fair Trading Act and the stop now orders regulations with a single coherent enforcement structure, the system will be clearer for businesses to understand.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para28"></a>We recognise the new demands that the stop now regime is placing on trading standards departments. My department has already provided additional funding for local authorities of £5 million over two years for implementing the existing stop now orders regime. We anticipate that a further transfer in the region of £10 million would be appropriate once the Bill is implemented and stop now orders are extended.
<P>


<a name="column_142"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para29"></a>The Bill also includes measures to enable the OFT to give formal approval to voluntary industry codes of practice. They will help consumers identify reputable traders and benefit businesses by increasing consumer confidence in their products and services.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para30"></a>In another place there were some calls for the Bill to include a general duty not to trade unfairly. Cases of sharp practice were cited, which were argued to be unfair but not currently unlawful. I am sure we all agree that businesses should trade fairly. However, we are not convinced that enshrining a general principle of that kind in legislation is necessarily the best way forward. We must ensure that any new policies for new laws are founded on a robust evidence base, to ensure that they address the real issues of concern and are effective. We also need to bear in mind the importance of not imposing unnecessary burdens on business.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para31"></a>For that reason, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Competition, Consumers, and Markets is inviting key stakeholders to a seminar with her to explore the case details that they hold in more detail, and to help us assess properly to what extent the practices involved are not covered by existing law. We shall then consider what further action would be appropriate. Where necessary, that will need to take account of what is happening in the European Union in respect of plans to reform the consumer protection regime.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para32"></a>The Bill that I present today also modernises our insolvency regime&#151;in Part 10. If we are to build a truly enterprising economy, we must ensure that our insolvency regime is one that supports, rather than stifles, the development and growth of new businesses, and helps reduce the stigma of failure. The measures contained within the Bill aim to do that, while at the same time striking a balance between the interests of debtors, creditors, companies and the public.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para33"></a>Our current individual insolvency regime treats all bankrupts the same, regardless of the bankrupt's conduct. Their assets are dealt with in the same way and in most cases they are discharged after the same period of time. The result of this one-size- fits-all approach is that the stigma associated with bankruptcy is applied equally to the unfortunate, the irresponsible, the reckless and the dishonest.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para34"></a>We want to introduce a fairer system that takes into account individual circumstances. Therefore, we are providing early discharge for those who have failed through no fault of their own and, by way of a counterbalance, introducing a stringent regime of bankruptcy restriction orders to take action against those whose behaviour poses a threat to the public and commercial interest.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para35"></a>The Bill does not promote bankruptcy as an easy option; indeed, we firmly believe that bankruptcy should be seen as a last resort. That is why trustees in bankruptcy will continue to be able to realise the same assets as now. Indeed, we are making it easier for them to do so by introducing income payment agreements and amending the procedure for applying for suspension of discharge. We believe that those measures will help provide a fresh start to those who <P>


<a name="column_143"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do not pose a threat to the public and commercial communities, take better account of the conduct of the bankrupt and reduce the stigma of failure.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para36"></a>In addition to those "fresh start" proposals, we want to help ensure companies facing financial difficulties do not go to the wall unnecessarily. In order to do so, we are restricting the use of administrative receivership where effective control lies in the hands of a single secured creditor, and creating a new streamlined administration procedure.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para37"></a>Although recognised as an effective rescue vehicle, administration has been criticised as too inflexible, too slow and too expensive. The Bill addresses that by streamlining the procedure and providing a clearer focus on company rescue and, where that is clearly not a viable option, a better return for the company's creditors as a whole. The Bill also provides clearer timescales to ensure that cases are not drawn out at the expense of the company and its creditors, and ensures that the administrator takes into account the interests of all creditors in his dealings with the company.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para38"></a>Following detailed discussions with a range of interested parties, we have agreed that the provisions of the Bill should not extend to registered social landlords. Therefore, we shall be tabling amendments that will provide exemption for all registered social landlords, whether they are companies or industrial and provident societies. Legislation relating to registered social landlords in Scotland is devolved and therefore we shall be consulting with the Scottish Executive with regard to any implications for Scotland.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para39"></a>We believe that those changes to the corporate insolvency regime will encourage wider use of the procedure as a rescue vehicle, and encourage smaller companies to make use of administration&#151;not simply as a last resort, but before the situation becomes terminal.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para40"></a>Other insolvency reforms include abolishing the Crown's preferential right to recover unpaid taxes ahead of other creditors, reforming the Insolvency Service's financial regime to bring increased transparency and simplicity, and ensuring that the maximum possible investment return goes to insolvent estates. Together, those measures will make up to £115 million a year available for distribution to all creditors.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para41"></a>The measures contained in the Bill are radical and bold, but based on careful consultation. We have developed them to strike the right balance and to reform the existing framework of regulation for the better without creating additional regulations for business. We shall provide the necessary resources to ensure the measures are effective. Some of the measures involve complex areas of law and I am sure that noble Lords will want to scrutinise them carefully in Committee. But the objective of the measures is very clear&#151;to make the UK a better place to do business and a better place to be a consumer.

<a name="20702-04_para42"></a>The Bill has attracted widespread support&#151;support that I hope will be reflected in your Lordships' discussions today and during the Bill's passage. Much expertise on these matters resides in this House. I look forward to hearing noble Lords' thoughts and comments on the Bill today and in Committee. Together, the package of reforms will make a real difference to this nation's prosperity. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his clear introduction to this long and complex Bill. I also thank those sometimes forgotten people in the departmental back room, the authors of the excellent Explanatory Notes, which will be helpful to all those who participate in the later stages of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para44"></a>Before dealing with the substance of the Bill, I have two preliminary remarks. First, this is a long and technically complex Bill, covering competition, insolvency and consumer affairs, which could have been the subjects of three separate substantial Bills. They were the subjects of three separate White Papers. It is a matter of regret that, despite the fact that the main principles of the Bill are uncontroversial and are generally welcomed by commercial interests, the consultation period has been short. Even the CBI, which supports the Bill, has complained about,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the inadequacy of the consultation period, given the complexity and novelty of many of the proposals".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para45"></a><P>

<a name="20702-04_para46"></a>The consultation period allowed by the Government was a derisory nine weeks, including four during the August holiday season. It is also a matter of regret that the Bill should have reached your Lordships' House so late in the Session and with so little time allocated to it compared with the 18 sittings that it had in Committee in the other place. It is symptomatic of the contempt that the Government sometimes show for Parliament in general and for your Lordships' House in particular that, while as ever paying lip service to this House's unequalled reputation as a revising Chamber, they are clearly attempting to restrict the time for debate on any issues that may arise, because it is already so late in the Session.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para47"></a>Those of your Lordships who have not been following proceedings in the other place should know that a major section of the Bill dealing with cartels and market investigations was not debated on Report because of the operation of the guillotine. Those provisions have yet to come to the Floor of either House of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para48"></a>Your Lordships will have noticed that the Bill is now 194 pages longer than as originally presented in the other place. As we have seen on other major Bills, this is an example of the Government legislating on the hoof.
<P>


<a name="column_145"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para49"></a>The second minor preliminary matter that I have to mention is to declare a previous interest. I was formerly a member of what was then called the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, now the Competition Commission, from which I had to retire immediately on being elevated to your Lordships' House because of an obvious potential conflict of interest.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para50"></a>This is a complex Bill. I am glad to tell your Lordships that we shall be receiving the invaluable and expert assistance of my noble friends Lord Kingsland, who will deal with the competition aspects, and Lord Hunt of Wirral, who will deal with the insolvency provisions.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para51"></a>As my honourable friend the Member for Eastbourne wrote in the Conservative press release on the publication of the Bill:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is much to be welcomed in this Bill. Many of the proposed reforms to consumer protection and the competition regime are particularly welcome".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para52"></a>However, like my honourable friend, I have to ask why the Government found it necessary to introduce the Bill so soon after the passage of the Competition Act 1998. Perhaps I should ask the question the other way round. Why did the Government take up valuable parliamentary time with the 1998 Act when the present Bill was clearly in the pipeline? The Government have already found it necessary to include amendments to that Act in this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para53"></a>I remind your Lordships of the claim made by the former Minister of State on Third Reading of the 1998 Bill in the other place. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Reform of the current regime is long overdue. The Bill will give us a really modern and effective competition regime at last".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 8/7/98; col. 1209.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para54"></a>The 1998 Act, which came into effect only on 1st March 2000, introduced one of the toughest competition regimes in the developed world. In reforming their recent reforms, as my honourable friend the Member for Maldon and Chelmsford East pointed out in the other place, the Government must feel that their modern regime has not proved as effective as they had hoped. The ethos in the department seems to have been to use time somehow to legislate about something, irrespective of whether there was something to legislate about or whether that legislation was fully thought-through.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para55"></a>It would be useful for your Lordships to note what the Government have previously said about the Bill. On the competition aspects, they promised a much reduced role for Ministers in decisions on mergers and competition policy. We can all welcome that without qualification, especially when we bear in mind recent events, such as the ministerial approval of the takeover of the Daily Express. Strengthened competition authorities operating at arm's length from government departments are to be provided with more resources and expertise, as the Minister mentioned, and are to make decisions on the competition-based test. Where is that expertise to come from? Will it be entirely from within the occasionally changing membership of the Competition Commission, or is the commission able <P>


<a name="column_146"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to continue to call for outside expert evidence whenever it feels that that is required? Will it be able to co-opt members for a particular inquiry?
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para56"></a>Will the Minister define the competition-based test that the Government speak about? How does it differ from the current test, which is based on the public interest? In other words, is the public interest no longer to play any part in a decision about the acceptability of a proposed merger, or is it to be overridden by the competition-based test that the Government are creating? I have not been able to find anything in the Bill that explains the new competition test, which could mean anything. Any help that the Minister can give me on that would be appreciated.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para57"></a>The Government's description of the aims of the Bill included references to criminal sanctions. The Downing Street website said that they would include,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment to deter individuals who dishonestly operate hardcore cartels, including agreements to fix prices, share markets and rig bids".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para58"></a>The same website claimed that the measures would extend to individuals the provisions in the Competition Act 1998 that related to companies. That is an example of the half-thought-out nature of some of the measures in the 1998 Act, which the Government are having to tinker with only four years on. It seems that individuals or companies who fix prices, share markets and rig bids from outside the United Kingdom or outside the EC are to be subject to extra-territorial jurisdiction, which the Bill will create.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para59"></a>However, despite the reference to fixing share markets in the Government's website, that does not appear to be covered in Part 6, especially in Clause 183, which creates the so-called cartel offence. Have the Government dropped those proposals or have I missed them?
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para60"></a>Finally on the competition aspect, the Government have promised greater rights for individuals to bring damages claims for losses suffered due to anti-competitive practices. That is clear enough, but, again quoting the No. 10 website, the Government are also proposing that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Consumer bodies can make claims for named individuals".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para61"></a>At the request of the CBI, we shall seek to look into the OFT's roaming brief to investigate markets to ensure that it does not cause firms or even whole industries unnecessary costs. It will be interesting to see how that discussion progresses.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para62"></a>We are also concerned about the power to be given to the OFT to disclose to overseas authorities information that it receives in confidence. Clause 208 will give the Secretary of State powers to designate the great and the good among consumer associations who, in addition to the OFT and the usual local authorities, will be given the right to enforce the consumer protection legislation. How will bodies qualify to be, in the worrying phrase of Clause 208, "a designated enforcer"? Apart from the obvious examples of the National Consumer Council or the Consumers' Association, could that include trade associations such as ABTA or manufacturers' associations such as the Engineering Employers' Federation? Could trade <P>


<a name="column_147"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unions be included? The Government probably already have something in mind. Without committing the Government to a list of names, perhaps the Minister will tell us in general terms the sort of organisation that will be granted special powers to police the Act.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para63"></a>We should bear in mind that some consumer protection bodies are self-appointed and are not necessarily governed by elected members. I do not say that in any way to denigrate any of them, because they do an excellent job in creating public awareness and are not merely special interest pressure groups. My honourable friend in the other place expressed concern at the possibility of a wholly innocent company facing the expense and disruption of a series of complaints launched one after the other as each one fails. He referred to the problems of the record industry, which spent an estimated £17 million to £20 million because of the 1993 Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, yet despite that had to face a further five inquiries, none of which overturned the 1993 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report. I know how detailed the inquiry was because I was involved in it as a member of the MMC. I left before the final report was issued, as I explained earlier.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para64"></a>I trust that in licensing organisations under Clause 208 the Secretary of State will undertake to oversee them and to revoke their licenses if they are found to be harassing legitimate businesses or acting unreasonably. Perhaps Clause 208 could be altered to cover that point.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para65"></a>Another major segment of the Bill contains what the Downing Street website calls "insolvency measures". We welcome the long-overdue reform of the bankruptcy laws to distinguish between cases of genuine misfortune and culpable activity such as fraudulent trading in so-called phoenix companies. We also welcome the restrictions on administrative receivership where one creditor seizes all the assets and does what he wills with them, possibly to the detriment not only of the debtor but especially of the other creditors.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para66"></a>The receiver's activities are often far from commercially sound if the objective is to salvage the company as a going concern. Perhaps a measure along the lines of the American Chapter 11, which has given many ailing companies a breathing space to recover from a temporary setback, is needed. But the current ethos of some lenders is that they are not interested in preserving the assets or saving the company. It seems to be a smash-and-grab raid; they go in and get what they can and that is the end of the poor company.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para67"></a>But the solution must be approached with caution because there is a danger that banks, for example, will be reluctant to lend on the security of debentures and will insist on charges over fixed assets to the detriment of borrowers whose assets are mostly intangible, or will increase interest charges to cover potential losses, which will be to the detriment of small businesses in particular.
<P>


<a name="column_148"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para68"></a>It is right that the Government should give up their iniquitous first preferential claim to taxes. The justice of that is self-explanatory. A creditor, possibly a small trader, who has supplied goods to a debtor, should not be made to watch while those goods are sold, not to pay a dividend to him along with other creditors but to be swallowed by the rapacious maw of the Treasury, which will not have contributed a penny for the benefit of that company.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para69"></a>We welcome the Government's intention to help those who set up in business and run into difficulties. But there is a difference between them and those who incur debt, either by reckless trading or by profligate spending. I am amazed by the adverts that appear daily on the television offering to help people to convert all their multiple debts into what they claim will be one single manageable monthly payment. As a selling point they point out that the debtor will then be able to afford a new car, a holiday, and so on, rather than learn a lesson from the feckless spending that got them into that state in the first place.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para70"></a>As my honourable friend John Whittingdale pointed out to the other place, it is not only the banks that suffer when a debtor goes bankrupt, but also family and friends and other small traders who may be forced into insolvency through a bad debt. The Bill does not distinguish between risk-taking entrepreneurs&#151;albeit that the risks they take are often with other people's money&#151;and reckless debtors. That is a point we may wish to look at later when considering Schedule 20, without detracting from the Government's good intentions. Schedule 20 seems to lack detail and emphasis between misfortune and profligacy.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para71"></a>Perhaps the experience in the United States of America is relevant. Relaxed bankruptcy laws encouraged a record 1.5 million personal bankruptcies in 2001, 97 per cent of which were consumer rather than business. That is due to the expanding use of credit cards, a trend which is also taking place in the United Kingdom. The losses incurred do not fall only on the banks, card issuers, and stores. It is the customers who pay their own accounts who ultimately pay for the defaulters in what in some cases is nothing more than a different form of shoplifting.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para72"></a>I am also concerned about the effect of the relaxation of the bankruptcy laws on the student loans scheme. Many graduates now leave university with a great burden of debt. Bankruptcy will be an easy way out if no stigma attaches and there are limited disabilities regarding the obtaining of credit in their future careers.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para73"></a>Downing Street's trailer of the Bill refers to "consumer measures". They include the extension of "stop now" orders, a welcome provision so that dishonest traders cannot continue with their activities while laborious legal processes are undergone. However, we will want to examine that aspect in detail to ensure that those necessary powers cannot be exercised arbitrarily on the basis of less than adequate evidence.
<P>


<a name="column_149"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para74"></a>The OFT will be required to respond within 90 days to "super complaints" from designated consumer bodies, which would be good if it works in practice. We would want an assurance that the OFT will not accept and act on complaints only from those designated bodies, and refuse to countenance complaints from the public, even single members when appropriate. I do not suggest it should be bound to investigate every complaint, however trivial, from every disgruntled customer, or even from crackpots, because any business dealing with the public is bound to get a number of those sooner or later. But it must not create an exclusive regime where action is taken only on the complaint of selected bodies, even though they would doubtless carry out the useful task of screening out unsuitable complaints.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para75"></a>The OFT is to be given the task of approving business codes of practice. The DTI has under its wing an organisation called the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, which already performs that useful function. It would be interesting to know whether that organisation is to be transferred to the OFT, or whether there will be unnecessary duplication. If the Minister cannot tell us today perhaps he could write to me.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para76"></a>In general terms we welcome the Bill, even though it represents a second bite of the cherry after the Competition Act 1998. However, that welcome is not without reservations shared by the CBI and experienced lawyers practising in the field. I draw your Lordships' attention to some of the comments made by these non-political sources, which have not been addressed during the Bill's progress through the other place.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para77"></a>Mr Digby Jones, director general of the CBI, warned, as I have done, against compelling and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"forcing good firms to defend themselves unnecessarily when their European rivals shelter under less rigorous regimes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para78"></a>The leading firm of solicitors experienced in consumer affairs warned against,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"adding to industry's costs making the then whole process more judicial, which will also add to the expense. By following the US approach Britain would be drifting away from the EU approach to competition".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para79"></a>In fairness, the reaction of commerce and industry has generally been welcoming, as is ours, as I have made clear. That is despite the high-flown and entirely debatable hypothetical claims by the Secretary of State on the day the Bill was published, when she said that
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Monopolistic behaviour costs the UK . . . around £4.5 billion-£9 billion per annum".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para80"></a>That is a wide range of figures and I am not sure how she came to them. She also quoted a claim by the OFT that losses from,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"defective goods, inadequate redress or poor information",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para81"></a>cost £8.3 billion per year.
That figure may have been plucked out of the air. I am sure that one statistician would say that it was extensive, while another would say it was inadequate. That is the problem with coming out with figures.
<P>


<a name="column_150"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para82"></a>There is no need for the Government to gild the lily by using theoretical figures to support a Bill that is generally acceptable in principle on all sides. Equally, it was not necessary for the Secretary of State to indulge in pejorative language when she said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Those operating cartels are guilty of theft".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para83"></a>That is a hard word. It is not theft in any sense of the word from a legal point of view. However, it is clearly wrong, especially in the context of price fixing and market sharing, and is clearly against the public interest and must be stopped, which we hope it will be by the deterrent criminal penalties that the Bill will introduce in addition to the civil remedies available under the Competition Act 1998, although I have not seen instances of that remedy being enforced.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para84"></a>In her introduction of the Bill at Second Reading in the other place, the Secretary of State referred to the objectives of promoting higher productivity and greater enterprise, generation of wealth, job creation and other laudable and uncontroversial objectives. I will not take up your Lordships' time by quoting any more, nor will I repeat the quotations from the British Chambers of Commerce, the CBI or the Consumers' Association. We all share those sentiments and ambitions.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para85"></a>The only word of warning I want to introduce into this non-contentious subject comes from the Secretary of State's own speech, when she said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The United Kingdom . . . needs a modern, world-class competition regime and a regulatory framework that is designed to promote competition rather than perpetuate regulation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para86"></a>I look forward to seeing the Government converting that fine sentiment from words to deeds in framing the secondary legislation, because their record over the past five years has been to pile on one regulation after another. I fear that that might happen; we shall see.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para87"></a>Incidentally, I noticed that the Secretary of State claimed in her speech that the Competition Act introduced,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a modern, more streamlined regime that addressed . . . abuses of dominant position".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 10/4/02; cols. 44-45.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para88"></a>Rather than claim the credit for that, perhaps the right honourable Lady should recall that that subject was comprehensively dealt with in the Treaty of Rome, to which the United Kingdom acceded when the Conservative Party took us into what was then known as the Common Market; it was a market, not "a more perfect union". We had some part in that effort.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para89"></a>One phrase in the Secretary of State's speech gives rise to a serious query, with which I hope the Minister will deal when he responds. In dealing with the changes to insolvency law and the priority of claims, she said, at col. 50, that they,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will ensure that . . . there is more money available to the creditors, who may well include employees . . . because national insurance contributions have not been paid on their behalf".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para90"></a>I stress the phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the creditors, who may well include employees",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-04_para91"></a>and the fact that that is because of unpaid national insurance contributions.
<P>


<a name="column_151"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para92"></a>Will the Minister assure the House that the Government will, as hitherto, continue to bear the loss incurred when an employer fails to pay over his and the employee's national insurance contributions and any PAYE that has been deducted, and that they will not ask the employee to pay again, even in return for the welcome concession that the Government will forgo their preferential claim for unpaid taxes? At present, an employee is not a creditor&#151;not even an ordinary or deferred creditor&#151;for unpaid national insurance or PAYE because the Government credit employees' accounts as if the payments had been duly made.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para93"></a>Will the Minister assure noble Lords in unequivocal terms that the Government and not the employee will continue to bear the loss caused by a defaulting employer? That assurance is essential in view of the somewhat ambiguous but, in my view, slightly ominous and significant phrase that I quoted from the Secretary of State's speech. If the Minister cannot put that assurance on the record today&#151;I do not see why he cannot; my honourable friend in the other place, the honourable Member for Eastbourne, made a similar point, which was not answered then&#151;perhaps he will write to me.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para94"></a>I apologise for the length of this speech. As I said, this 523-page Bill is really at least three Bills in one. Going into its complex details has not been helped by the fact that there have already been substantial additions since it was first introduced in the other place. Not having the benefit of officials to help us, I hope that the Minister will understand that we have to examine it thoroughly. As I said, we will support many of its measures but we will certainly need to examine others.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_time2"></a><H5>4.33 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, I join the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in thanking the Minister for the clear way in which he introduced a complex piece of legislation. I share her concerns about why the Bill has been introduced at this particular juncture and after a relatively short consultation period.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para95"></a>Those of us who have been involved with the Minister and trade and industry matters over the past year or two recognise that, among all of the Bills with which we have been involved, this Bill has probably received the largest amount of briefing from third parties. I shall name a few of the interested parties: the British Bankers Association, the CBI, the Consumer Credit Association, the Finance and Leasing Association, credit card issuers&#151;not to be advertised&#151;the National Consumer Council, the National Housing Federation and the Association of Business Recovery Professionals, let alone all of the law societies. It is of great concern that all of those bodies lobbied us strongly but often with conflicting recommendations. Dare I say, with some scepticism, that perhaps I detect the hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer behind the Bill rather than the Department of Trade and Industry? I do not expect the Minister to rise to that point.
<P>


<a name="column_152"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para96"></a>However, the Bill is now before us and it will not surprise the Minister that we on these Benches accept and welcome many of its provisions. However, it is extremely complex, as have been other Bills in relation to which I have enjoyed jousting across your Lordships' House with the Minister. We have the expertise of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to improve the Bill; she has experience from the competition area. I hope that she will not regard her conflict of interests as preventing her from giving us her wisdom. We also have the saturnine presence behind the Minister of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. On most topics in the Bill, nobody knows more than he. Dare I suggest, however&#151;more in expectation than in hope on this occasion&#151;that interventions from the experts on the subject will not take quite as long as they did on the Employment Bill?
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para97"></a>The Bill is extremely technical and one of the longest pieces of legislation that the Minister has presented&#151;indeed, it had to be published in two volumes. On Second Reading, I can touch on only one or two areas on which we shall probe the Government and, I hope, improve the Bill. We do so against the background that we generally welcome its provisions. I make these points with a wish to improve the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para98"></a>The first area relates to parliamentary accountability. We have long supported the argument&#151;we also supported the Government when they eventually came to this conclusion&#151;that it is a good idea to remove the political direction from competition policy. As a party, we were the first to advocate the independence of the Bank of England from political direction. We support the Government in that regard. However, we feel that, having taken that step, significant issues of parliamentary accountability ensue. For example, we argue&#151;we shall do so in Committee&#151;that there should be a DTI Select Committee to veto nominees to senior positions in the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission. We will also argue that there should be specific reporting on each major decision by the OFT to Parliament so that it can publish the rationales behind decisions, which can be used for performance measurement.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para99"></a>There are many ways in which parliamentary accountability can be achieved. A Joint Select Committee of the Commons and Lords might consider those issues. There are many ways in which that can be done. The Bill needs to be improved in order to give greater parliamentary accountability for the important decisions that will be made by the OFT and the Competition Commission.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para100"></a>The second area in relation to which we shall probe the Government relates to the general matter of competition policy reform. Our concern, which I am sure will be shared on all sides of the House, is that the introduction of the criminal offence for cartels is in danger of crossing one line&#151;or of not crossing the correct line&#151;with European Union competition policy. If we are not careful, we could find ourselves in a situation in which cartels that are illegal and a criminal offence under the Bill, which we welcome, and which are domestic only are punished, whereas <P>


<a name="column_153"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>transactions that are caught under the European Union merger legislation carry only a civil offence, not a criminal offence. Bigger cartelisation would therefore not be punished with the criminal penalties that smaller cartelisation will be. We regard that as a significant issue that needs to be explored with the Government.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para101"></a>We will want to explore one or two other details relating to the mechanics of competition policy reform. For example, we believe that the investigation of offences should be assigned to the Serious Fraud Office rather than to the Office of Fair Trading. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, may disagree. I look forward to hearing his views on that issue. We suspect that the SFO is better equipped for that sort of work than the OFT. We wish to explore that with the Government in Committee. We have reservations about surveillance powers which, in a clicheÿ, can be described as a snoopers' charter. We wish to explore concerns on that matter.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para102"></a>We would welcome comments from the Minister when he winds up about the Government's proposals as regards what the noble Baroness described as the "Desmond issue". I understand that in the papers which are the subject for consultation on the communications Bill, the Government have indicated that they propose to put something into the Enterprise Bill to deal with the public interest element on newspaper mergers. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that. It is particularly unfortunate that this particular clause will always be named after Mr Desmond. There have been other occasions when newspaper mergers have had a public interest element, but I suspect that we shall spend the next month referring to it as the "Desmond Clause" and when the Minister explains how he proposes to deal with this issue.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para103"></a>Another area of concern is the proposed reform as regards corporate insolvencies. This Bill reflects a very considerable degree of amendment to the corporate insolvency provisions of our existing legislation. Concern has been expressed in a great deal of the lobbying and briefing which noble Lords will have received. There is a major concern that the Bill, as drafted, is designed to protect the company rather than the business. As the Bill goes through your Lordships' House we will argue that the Bill needs refinement to emphasise much more protection of the business rather than the company.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para104"></a>One example given to us in many of the briefs that noble Lords will have received is that it is not difficult to conceive of situations in which the preservation of the company itself could be achieved by a substantial debt write-off, which is prejudicial to the interests of creditors who might recover a better return from the sale of the business. In Committee we need to consider why it would be better to keep the company intact at the expense of the business and pay the creditors 20 pence in the pound whereas sale of the business would preserve jobs and the creditors could receive 60 pence in the pound. Second Reading debates are not the place to go into that degree of detail, but it is an important point which we would wish to pursue.

<P>

<a name="20702-04_para105"></a>We also regard the time-scale on administration of three months as entirely unrealistic. The Government seem to have accepted evidence that most administrations are dealt with in three months. That may be the case as regards small administrations, but we are all well aware that On-Digital is unlikely to be free of administration in the next three months. Another example concerns a subject closer to my heart. Loftus Road Plc only came out of administration when the Football League said that Queen's Park Rangers would not be allowed to play in the Second Division next year unless it came out of administration, which was well after a year. The time limit is too short.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para106"></a>As regards the personal bankruptcy area, we have a concern which the noble Baroness touched on, namely, that the proposed regime is too lax. A great deal of lobbying has been directed at the Government during the consultation process regarding personal bankruptcy. We believe that very few of the points have been taken on board by the Government. We are concerned that the personal bankruptcy amendments, as drafted, will reward the feckless at the expense of the prudent and encourage the conman and the fraudster. We are not against the general principle contained in the Bill, but we shall want to look at the detail to ensure that, as far as possible, that does not happen.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para107"></a>Finally and, in a sense, most importantly, we want to consider consumer protection. It is no surprise that the CBI is unhappy with large elements of the consumer protection provisions in the Bill. We would expect it to say that, would we not? We do not agree. We believe that in some ways the Bill does not go far enough in enshrining in our law more detailed protection for the consumer. In his opening speech the Minister indicated that the Government are not persuaded of the necessity to enshrine in our law a general provision to trade fairly. He said that he is not persuaded. This is a safety net approach which has been adopted in the legislation of most industrialised countries including most EU member states, certainly New Zealand, Australia and the United States of America. In the course of debate we shall endeavour to persuade Her Majesty's Government that they are wrong on this issue and that they should have enshrined in our law a duty to trade fairly.

<A NAME="20702-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Best: </B>   My Lords, I wanted to raise a problem which this otherwise excellent Bill has, I believe, unwittingly created for housing associations. It relates to Part 10 which is concerned with insolvency, and to the treatment of housing associations&#151;so-called "Registered Social Landlords"&#151;that get into financial difficulties. I was delighted to hear the Minister announce in his opening remarks that he understands the problem and intends to exclude housing associations from these measures.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para108"></a>To explain the importance of the Minister's commitment to amend the Bill as it stands, a few brief remarks may be in order. The current position on insolvency for housing associations is one with which everybody concerned is entirely comfortable, <P>


<a name="column_155"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>including the Regulator, the Housing Corporation, the National Housing Federation and the housing associations themselves, the individual lenders and the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para109"></a>The Bill, as currently drafted, would include changes to permit arrangements for administration to be extended to the majority of housing associations that are industrial and provident societies. The lenders&#151;banks, building societies and others&#151;see this as a threat to their security. If the Bill is not amended some lenders would not want to lend to registered social landlords at all; others would charge higher interest rates to cover the additional risks that they perceive. Much administrative complexity would be added to the transactions and there is even a problem that existing loans would have to be re-negotiated on less favourable terms.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para110"></a>I declare my interests as the chief executive of a housing association although, thankfully, one with very high levels of security for its borrowing, not least because the Joseph Rowntree Foundation stands behind it. I was also a founder director of the Housing Finance Corporation which, on a not-for-profit basis, organises loans for housing associations and would be adversely affected by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para111"></a>The difference between housing associations and other not-for-profit bodies lies in the existing legislative powers given to the Housing Corporation&#151;the regulator&#151;by the Housing Act 1996. The corporation is able to exercise tight financial scrutiny and intervene as necessary. Indeed, one of the main aims of the Enterprise Bill&#151;provision of a 28-day moratorium&#151;is already met by the housing associations by specific provision of the 1996 Act.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para112"></a>The proof of the effectiveness of the current system is seen in the results: £25 billion has been raised from private sector lenders and the Government are expecting many billions more to be raised in the future; yet no housing association has ever been closed down by the action of any lender. So the current system works well. It is excellent therefore that the Minister announced that he will exclude housing associations that are industrial and provident societies from the new power to extend administration to such societies.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para113"></a>I should add that in the case of housing associations which are companies&#151;an important minority which includes a number of those taking over council housing as part of transfer arrangements&#151;it is sensible to preserve administrative receivership as is already provided, for example, in the case of public-private partnerships
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para114"></a>At a time when the sector is trying hard to attract more lenders into the market, I know that the Government do not want to jeopardise this source of funds or the very competitive terms on which they are currently available. Indeed, if lenders were to pull back or raise their interest rates, fewer homes would be produced, tenants would pay more and important social objectives would be thwarted. I congratulate the noble Lord therefore on his announcement that housing associations will be excluded from the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, it was just 25 years between the first post-war competition legislation in this country and the Fair Trading Act 1973. By a curious symmetry it was another exact quarter century from the Fair Trading Act to the Competition Act 1998, which was another radical, substantial measure. Therefore it may seem a little surprising to have this substantial, certainly heavy and lengthy Bill, coming so soon after 1998.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para115"></a>To my mind it is not as far-reaching or as radical as the earlier pieces of legislation; rather, it is a follow-on of the Competition Act 1998, particularly in covering the important matter of mergers which was left unaltered in 1998. It was a clear gap that needed to be filled. Further, the Bill strengthens the law on hard-core cartels and modernises the way in which markets are investigated by the competition authorities, doing away with the old-fashioned technical distinction which few people really understood between scale monopolies and complex monopolies.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para116"></a>In consumer protection we will have the benefit of the voice of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, in due course. No doubt she will express some welcome for broadening the scope of the stop now orders, which have proved useful weapons against traders who regularly abuse consumer rights but which have so far been confined to laws deriving from the European Community and have not covered laws that are entirely domestic. In my view&#151;and I hope that of many of your Lordships&#151;all those changes are welcome improvements. I cannot say they are fundamental, but, sadly, it seems to need a lot of clauses and schedules to bring them about.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para117"></a>The changes being made in the rules on mergers, removing the role of Ministers in most cases&#151;no doubt in Committee we shall examine the exceptions&#151;and replacing the broad public interest test by a test based on whether or not the merger will substantially lessen competition, have been widely welcomed. It will now be for the Office of Fair Trading to decide, not the Minister on advice from the Office of Fair Trading, whether or not a merger should be referred to the Competition Commission. In practice, compared with recent years, that will not make a great deal of difference because Ministers have normally followed the advice of the Office of Fair Trading. But it will clearly reflect reality and leave no businessman in any doubt that lobbying Ministers&#151;which has often taken place in the past&#151;for or against a reference to the Competition Commission, or for or against the judgment of the commission, will be a waste of time.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para118"></a>At this point I should declare an interest, though it has been hinted at by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. It is an interest which expired 10 years ago of being Director General of Fair Trading for many years. It will be seen why I mention that at this point.
<P>


<a name="column_157"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para119"></a>In the field of mergers more than in any other aspect of competition policy, swift, firm decision-making is particularly important for all concerned. It is in that context therefore that I am concerned at the changes made right at the beginning of the Bill to replace&#151;in fact to abolish&#151;the Director General of Fair Trading by a board of which he will be the chairman. If decisions to refer or not to refer mergers to the Competition Commission have to go routinely to the board, consisting in the main of part-timers and drawing on the advertisement in the Sunday Times two days ago&#151;people normally putting in two-and-a-half days a month&#151;I can foresee the risk of serious delays and a reduction in efficient decision-making.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para120"></a>I should like Ministers to reassure the House that the board of the Office of Fair Trading will not be involved in case-by-case, day-to-day decision- making with regard to mergers, cartels or market investigations, but only with strategy and broad principles. The advertisement to which I referred leaves that nicely ambiguous for the present moment.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para121"></a>The Competition Act, Chapter I, prohibition of cartels has been operative for just over two years. But within that relatively short period it seems to have worked well. One of the key features of it working well has been the so-called "leniency" programme whereby a whistle-blower from within the cartel may bring to light the existence of the price- fixing or market-sharing agreement, of which the Office of Fair Trading would otherwise know nothing, and the whistle-blower is able to escape the fines which would be imposed upon the other parties to the cartel.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para122"></a>The possibility of fines up to 10 per cent of turnover may sound like a powerful deterrent, and so perhaps it seemed to most of us at the time of the Competition Act 1998. But the key point I want to make is an obvious one. Fines only impact upon companies, not on the individual and to my mind there is a strong case, which the Government are beginning to make out in this Bill, for the criminal penalty possibly of gaol in the case of hard-core cartels to impact on those individuals who have been responsible or connived at the cartel.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para123"></a>Such a personal penalty, as all noble Lords will be aware, is possible in the United States. Most noble Lords again may recall the interesting sentence of a year and a day imposed not long ago on Mr Alfred Taubman, chairman of Sotheby's, in respect of a cartel agreement between what was supposedly and ostensibly rival auctioneers, Christies and Sotheby's. The prospect of such a gaol sentence must be such a strong deterrent that the actual imposition of a gaol sentence will in practice rarely be called for.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para124"></a>I notice that a representative of the United States' Attorney-General's office came to a conference last month. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I have had numerous lawyers pleading with me to avoid a gaol term for their client and offering to pay any sum imaginable. I have never had anyone offering to spend another week in gaol in return for a lower fine".

<a name="20702-04_para125"></a><P>


<a name="column_158"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>My only question to the Government is, should we not have a definition of the word "dishonestly" in the description of the new cartel offence in Clause 183? After all, this is a criminal offence. People must be entitled to know the exact ingredients of the offence.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para126"></a>In response to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, I do not at present&#151;and it will be an interesting discussion for us&#151;have any settled view whether it would be better for the Serious Fraud Office rather than the Office of Fair Trading to have responsibility for the pursuit of a criminal investigation.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para127"></a>In the other place not long ago during the course of the debate in Committee on the Bill, a CBI-inspired Conservative amendment was tabled to alter the basis of a market investigation reference from the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission from "reasonable suspicion" to "reasonable belief". Those of us who recall the passage of the Competition Bill four years ago may&#151;as I did&#151;have a sense of deÿjaÿ vu on reading that. I recall the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;he will be in his place in due course on the Bill&#151;arguing likewise in relation to monopoly references.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para128"></a>To my mind, the Office of Fair Trading needs to be bold and proactive in competition matters. But, after all, it is only supposed to conduct preliminary investigations. To require it to demonstrate more than "reasonable suspicion" before it refers the question to the Competition Commission would be unduly inhibiting. It would be a "Catch 22" situation to require it to know the answer before it puts the question.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para129"></a>I am tempted to make Committee points. Instead I shall make what I might call a "Brightman" point. I refer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, with, of course, proper respect. The Bill is substantial, heavy and detailed. Little of it can be understood except by reference to numerous earlier Acts, including the Fair Trading Act, the Competition Act and the Insolvency Act. Can the Government give an indication that we might look forward from this "legislation by reference"&#151;as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, has said on many occasions of other legislation&#151;to a comprehensive consolidation Act in this field to ease the task of businessmen, consumers and their advisers in working out their rights and duties?
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para130"></a>Finally, I make a point which I flag up for Ministers in particular. A concern has been expressed to me by the regulator Ofgem. It deals, as your Lordships will know, with gas and electricity regulation. It believes that we should take the opportunity under Part 10 of the Bill, which deals with insolvency, to make provision for a special administrator in the event of the insolvency of a gas or an electricity network. Public safety is at risk if arrangements are not made to ensure that, in the circumstances of insolvency, the network is kept operational. In recent years the Government have made such provision in legislation for the railways and for the water industry.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para131"></a>Unfortunately, the amendment, which has been shown in draft to myself and to my noble friend Lord Peston&#151;who is unfortunately unable to be in his place today&#151;requires seven new clauses and two new schedules. In my judgment, it is much more suitable that a government should introduce those with the aid of parliamentary draftsmen rather than for two Back-Benchers to do so. If the Government will consider that, we should of course be very happy to meet with Ministers before the Committee stage and the need to table amendments.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to follow the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. His declaration of an interest in matters which are deeply concerned with the Bill can be distinguished from mine. I declare an interest, having been the chairman of a bank, but that was a long time ago. I express no special interest in the detail with which the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, was so familiar.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para132"></a>I support the Bill. Its objectives are right and ones with which most noble Lords are in agreement. There will be matters of amendment which we shall want to raise in Committee. But I hope that much of the motive for the Bill can reach the statute book with the minimum of alteration.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para133"></a>It is a vast Bill&#151;three Bills. As my noble friend said, it should have been three separate Bills and it should have been considered much more carefully. It would have been appropriate for draft Bills to have been published and considered in detail by the experts before being placed before this House. The present Bill was partly considered in another place. A large part of it was put on one side by a guillotine Motion.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para134"></a>I wish to comment on the name of the Bill. This morning I looked up the word "enterprise" in the dictionary. It means boldness, courage and with imagination. I do not find that a good description of the Bill's objectives&#151;insolvency, competition, consumer protection and so on. At any rate, I do not think that the restrictions that the Bill imposes on business&#151;and there are many restrictions&#151;make natural bedfellows with the word "enterprise".
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para135"></a>I also refer to the costs that the Bill will incur. I know that they are relatively small against the total budget, at about £150 million, which the Government will say is nothing at all. But I wonder to what extent that question has been put into the scale. The Government have said that the costs which will fall on business are insignificant. But I believe that bureaucracy will come in as a result of the Bill. There will be people needed to look at the regulations. That will be a significant item.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para136"></a>Against that the Government say that the Bill will produce hundreds of millions of pounds. We shall see. But I believe that they are being unduly optimistic to think that the consequences of the Bill will produce hundreds of millions of pounds.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para137"></a>As I have said, the purpose of the Bill is good. It seems to be fair and reasonable. I am sure that improvements can be made in Committee. But the Bill, <P>


<a name="column_160"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>despite what I have said about it being fair and reasonable, will add to the regulation, bureaucracy and to the costs of business, which is already overburdened by regulation and bureaucracy. I regret adding to the load which business has to suffer.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para138"></a>The Bill may deal with internal matters, but a large part of turnover in business is foreign. We must look at where foreign competition comes in. In Europe we tend to be going a different way and with different penalties. For example, much of Europe has prison sentences available for certain offences which come under the present Bill. But I understand that prison sentences are not generally applied in Europe for those offences. I have some regrets about that. The Competition Act 1998 has been in effect for only about a year. It should have had a further run to see whether we could avoid prison sentences for breaches under that Act and the Bill. It would have been wiser to have waited, instead of effecting laws that will produce new criminals. Such penalties as heavy fines and disqualification as a director would have been adequate deterrents.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para139"></a>The Bill also removes Ministers' powers over competition and mergers policy. In some ways, I welcome that. We have not been happy with many decisions made by Ministers. On the other hand, we shall suffer from not being able to ask questions about decisions or being able to summon those who make decisions before Select Committees. What we gain from not having Ministers involved we lose by not being able to challenge decisions.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para140"></a>On the question of price fixing, I understand the benefits to consumers. But many new businesses have gained ground from being able to have a stable price as a platform from which to build. Of course, the most effective means to tackle price-fixing is competition. But to enforce competition without some form of stability, some price from which one can start, is a penalty that is difficult to invoke.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para141"></a>I have in mind the case of two window cleaners who operated in a village. Between them, they found that the business of the village was just about right for two and they agreed to fix a price. No doubt, that would be illegal under the Bill. A smart entrepreneur realised what was happening and decided to come to the village to undercut both, which he did successfully. That is what I call being an entrepreneur and showing enterprise. I am not sure whether two window cleaners would fall under price-fixing provisions, but the principle is the same.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para142"></a>Turning to the matter of insolvency, I welcome the reduction of some of the penalties for unlucky but honest bankrupts. But there is a danger of making bankruptcy an easy option. The Minister said that it would not be an easy option, but there is a danger that it will become so. It has in the United States, which has considerably relaxed its bankruptcy laws. The number of bankruptcies there has risen massively. There is an awful temptation to obtain credit with little prospect of repayment unless some speculation or gamble comes off.
<P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para143"></a>My noble friend Lady Miller referred to credit cards. These days, they are enabling young people to accumulate massive debts in the hope that something will turn up to enable them to pay them off. I am aware of one young man who managed to run up debts of £250,000. Surely it is impossible for any credit company&#151;or series of credit companies; I think that about 20 credit card companies were involved&#151;to allow a debt of £250,000 to be run up in that way. There is great danger unless we seriously consider that matter. Borrowing has become a habit, and the use of easy access to credit is creating a penalty that many of the young will have to face in years to come.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para144"></a>As I said, the United States' experience of the relaxation of bankruptcy laws is worrying. There has been a vast increase in personal bankruptcies as a result. A fear has been expressed that the Bill will lead to a 20 per cent increase in bankruptcy. That is worrying.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para145"></a>I welcome the release within a year from the penalties of bankruptcy for those who have not behaved badly, but I ask: what about the creditors? Awful anger is felt by a creditor who has lost his business, family fortune or whatever towards someone who has "done" him and is then declared bankrupt. It is most irritating for the poor chap whose family savings have had been lost and who has ended up in hardship to see that man, within a year of being declared bankrupt, start up business again with much prosperity, as so often happens.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para146"></a>We should reconsider the provision for release within one year. It would be much better to leave the period at three years, with the right to apply for it to be reduced. Let people apply for a reduction from the three years to one year, so that the honest, well-meaning chap who unluckily goes bankrupt has a better chance to escape.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para147"></a>Overall, the provisions are reasonable. It is a fair Bill and I hope that it will secure the hoped-for improvements for business, so that business will be able to reap the benefit intended as a result.

<A NAME="20702-04_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, as a consumer I welcome the purpose of the Bill; as a Liberal Democrat, I obviously support of much of what my noble friend Lord Russell said; but as someone who speaks from these Benches on housing, I do not support the corporate insolvency proposals in the Bill. As drafted, they would severely affect the ability of registered social landlords&#151;mainly housing associations&#151;to continue to provide affordable social housing. That is key if we are to have a flexible economy. The lack of affordable housing in the South East and London is a severe problem, as is recognised by government and others.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para148"></a>So, like the noble Lord, Lord Best, I especially welcomed the Minister's statement today. I am grateful to the National Housing Federation, of which I am vice-president, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the chief executive of Western Challenge Housing Association, of which I was once a board member, for <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bringing the matter to my attention. The noble Lord, Lord Best, explained in detail how the matter rests, and I shall not repeat that, but I want to emphasise that until today, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the National Housing Federation, the Housing Corporation and the Housing Finance Corporation had all been in touch with the Department of Trade and Industry but had not secured assurances that the Government intended to deal with the problems created by the Bill for the social housing sector.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para149"></a>All that they and I had heard was that the Government had undertaken to conduct consultation on whether to deal with the matter in secondary legislation. That would have been far too late. Lenders would have been able to impose floating charges the minute the Bill was enacted. By the end of the consultation period, the damage could already have been done.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para150"></a>To my knowledge, this is the third time that the issue has been raised in legislation. The first time that I was involved, we were considering the 1996 Housing Bill. I served on the Standing Committee in another place. That Bill contained a similar proposal; namely, that a housing corporation manager should have administration-like powers to deal with any registered social landlord in financial difficulty. I criticised that severely at the time&#151;there was extensive lobbying, as there was today&#151;as did Nick Raynsford, now a Minister in another place, then the Opposition spokesman on housing. I am pleased to say that that provision is not in the Housing Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para151"></a>Nevertheless, in 1998, the Treasury and friendly societies issued a consultation paper that asked whether it would be appropriate to extend company insolvency procedures to registered social landlords and to industrial and provident societies. The answer from the National Housing Federation, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, a number of registered social landlords and a number of law firms was a resounding "No", and the suggestion was withdrawn. So, like the organisations referred to, I was at a loss as to why the Government had put the proposal forward yet again.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para152"></a>It is particularly important that we recognise the problems with house building in this country. The new Housing Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has described chronically low house-building rates as a national disgrace. We know that new statistics on replacement levels for housing in Britain show that houses standing today would have to last for 1,500 years. Last year, we built 162,000 homes; the year before, we built 169,000. This year's figure represents the lowest number of houses completed in this country for 77 years. It is also the lowest in the European Union. That is why the situation is so serious. If the relevant parts of the Bill were enacted, it would be even more serious, as the damage would be concentrated in the affordable housing sector.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para153"></a>I welcome the Minister's opening comments. I shall examine carefully the amendments proposed in Committee. However, I must say to the Government that I do not want to stand here again in two years' time raising the same issue.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, this is a large, complex Bill with mammoth schedules, but I hope to be brief in my remarks and concentrate on one area&#151;competition policy and, in particular, the effect of the Bill on the workings of the Office of Fair Trading. I have been involved with the broadcasting industry and, in particular, digital television. One of the main reasons that digital television has so far failed is the failure of the regulators, in particular the OFT, the Independent Television Commission, the Radiocommunications Agency and the board of governors at the BBC. However, I shall concentrate on the OFT and leave the others for another day.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para154"></a>In the case of the OFT, it was the length of time that the regulator took to make a decision that was so damaging. That does not help either side. The OFT has a duty to protect business from unfair competition, as, ultimately, it is the consumer who will suffer. Unnecessary delay is damaging for industry and damaging for the consumer. Fair competition is about benefiting the consumer. Delays are enormously disruptive to business and undermine the ability of business to operate. In the media in particular, the value of many companies' assets has exploded in recent years, only to implode later. Some companies&#151;and, indeed, government&#151;became obsessed with technical achievement without understanding whether it had a sound commercial application and whether there was consumer need and demand.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para155"></a>I believe in competition law, but it must work not only effectively but quickly. In broadcasting, the OFT has been reviewing the situation of BskyB for two and a half years. The original complaint by ITV Digital and others was that Sky was charging too high a wholesale price for its premium sports and movie channels to television and other distributors. I shall not go into the merits or otherwise of the case or comment on what the outcome should be. However, I want the Minister to consider the length of time that the OFT took to consider the issues. That was not fair to either side. It is not just one case. In September 2000, Sky and NTL reached an agreement on distribution by cable. That required OFT approval, but it took over a year for the OFT to make the courageous decision not to make a decision. One wonders how long it would have taken them to make a decision.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para156"></a>I have general and specific questions for the Minister. In paragraph (7) of Schedules 5 and 6 to the Competition Act 1998, there are powers for companies to seek direction from the courts to ensure that the director general of the Office of Fair Trading reaches decisions without undue delay. Yet those provisions have not been brought into force. Can the Minister explain why not? I should be grateful if he would write if he cannot answer me today. Can the Minister say whether the Government think that the provisions are still needed? Will they be made redundant by clauses in this Bill? Does the Minister understand the concern about the delays? Will he explain how the powers in this Bill and the proposed changes to the OFT will help to speed up the process?
<P>


<a name="column_164"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para157"></a>The Bill will give new powers to the OFT to investigate markets and identify anti-competitive practices. We know that that can be a huge task, which often involves great expense to those in business&#151;guilty or innocent&#151;who get swept up in the net. What safeguards will there be to prevent the new powers from being used to drag out investigations for years? How will the OFT operate alongside the proposed new regulator, Ofcom? The Government made it clear that the best placed regulator would investigate alleged abuses and said that, in most cases, that would mean Ofcom.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para158"></a>The Competition Act 1998 makes it clear that only one body can use competition powers to investigate alleged abuses, so as to avoid double jeopardy. However, there is still a risk that Ofcom might use its regulatory powers to investigate supposed anti-competitive behaviour, with the OFT following up using its competition powers. How will the Government stop that double jeopardy? Do the Government consider that it will not be a problem? Concurrency between the two will not apply to mergers. The OFT will be solely responsible. Like other noble Lords, I welcome the decision by the Government to remove Ministers from the decision-making process concerned with the clearance of mergers. However, the Government should have waited before revisiting many aspects of the Competition Act 1998. After all, it has been in force for only a couple of years.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para159"></a>Like the curate's egg, the Bill is good in parts. However, it will place costs and burdens on business. There must be some limit on how the new powers will be exercised and how costs will be dealt with. We are all against cartels, but we must support enterprise. Can the Minister confirm that the OFT will be under a duty to act in a proportionate, transparent, accountable and timely manner? After all, those are the principles of the Government's Better Regulation Task Force. Should not those principles be set out clearly in Clause 1?
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for explaining the Bill. We will all benefit from a more competitive economy, which will put downward pressure on prices. I welcome the intention to encourage a more enterprising economy.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para160"></a>I also congratulate my noble friend on the timing of the introduction of the Bill into your Lordships' House. Recent events have made our Second Reading extremely topical. The recent financial scandals in the United States have shaken people's confidence in the business world. Such fraud and dishonesty undermines our confidence and trust in business. As the Minister explained, the Bill is designed to deter and punish dishonesty. In those circumstances, the Bill is especially welcome.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para161"></a>The blow to our confidence in business not only raises concerns about pension schemes, savings and investments but questions the productivity gains achieved in the United States by the so-called new <P>


<a name="column_165"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>economy. The Bill borrows heavily from the experience of regulation in the United States to raise productivity. I am reliably informed that, fortunately, much of the US productivity data comes from surveys and not from company accounts. I hope that we can be reassured by that.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para162"></a>The troubles in the United States are all to do with share price&#151;share price as a symbol of shareholder value. This concern has been raised several times in this House. During a debate on corporate regulation&#151;on a Motion moved by my noble friend Lord Brennan in March&#151;we discussed how regulation alone would not be sufficient to discourage corporate excess, and how business leadership must also provide lasting moral values. It is difficult to legislate in this area. However, we must continue to bear it in mind during our debates on the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para163"></a>Nevertheless, we have to keep the faith and retain our confidence in the market system. It is the pressure of competition and the greater uncertainties of the global economy that contribute to such failures. Because the Bill is about making markets work better, it is to be welcomed at this difficult time. The invisible hand of the markets is preferable to the long arm of government and regulation.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para164"></a>Setting these concerns aside for a moment, the Bill must be judged in the way in which we have judged business legislation since Labour came to power in 1997. Does the Bill deliver fairness with enterprise? Will the legislation stifle creativity and will it be unfair to the consumer? That is the basis on which we should judge it.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para165"></a>It is a big Bill. It touches many key areas of business life. It encourages competition, provides stiff personal penalties for operating cartels. It provides the rights for injured consumers to claim heavy damages. It addresses failure by categorising responsible and irresponsible bankrupts.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para166"></a>I do not share the conclusions of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, and others. It is possible to personalise business too much. Good businesses work well because they are successful organisations, made up of customers, suppliers and employees. No one controls all the areas. It is wrong to hold good people responsible for failures and mistakes by others outside their control. Of course we need to look carefully at how the authorities will differentiate between worthy and unworthy bankrupts, but the fast-track bankruptcy approach is a move in the right direction.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para167"></a>The Bill also takes the politics out of competition and merger decisions and bases such decisions on economics. A public interest consideration can be slipped in&#151;a matter that needs examination. I look forward to my noble friend's reply to the questions put by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. Based on the experience of taking the politics out of interest rates, this approach is greatly to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para168"></a>All this means that the Bill places more work and responsibility on the shoulders of the Office of Fair Trading. It goes into considerable detail about the work of the OFT. So it must be asked whether the OFT will be able to do the job. It is, after all, responsible for <P>


<a name="column_166"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the application of the Competition Act 1998, and only now are the provisions of that Act beginning to bed down. The Minister told us that the Office of Fair Trading was investigating 40 cartels, and the Financial Times recently reported that it was uncovering one new cartel a month. Investigating a cartel is much more complicated and difficult than simply looking at an agreement. As I understand it, the Government have increased the budget of the OFT, but it is the quality of the people there that really matters. Recruiting better people is the key. The presence of more competent people is the real deterrent. In reality, we cannot expect the OFT to uncover every cartel. Its purpose is also to deter. Therefore, pay and career prospects at the OFT are crucial.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para169"></a>We must ask whether the Bill will make companies unduly cautious. After all, many mergers are initially based on an arrangement for sharing out customers. But this never lasts for long unless it is artificially maintained, and that is what the OFT must concentrate on deterring. This must be taken into consideration together with the other steps in the Bill to encourage enterprise. Abolishing the Crown's preference rights and the lenient attitude towards the not dishonest bankrupt will, I believe, encourage enterprise, and I welcome these provisions. On balance, I do not think that the Bill will lead to excessive caution. It may well just mean bigger fees for lawyers.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para170"></a>As well as encouraging enterprise, does the Bill encourage fairness towards the consumer? I believe it does. As Adam Smith pointed out, competition forces manufacturers to respond to the consumer's preferences, and in a competitive economy the benefits of great efficiency go to the consumer. The Bill allows the OFT to use fines to compensate consumers and ensures that fewer companies will fail unnecessarily. Indeed, the consumer will now have representation on the board of the OFT. Professional services will be included in the Bill. More competition in professional services is bound to help the consumer. Looking after the consumer contributes to a fairer society and I welcome that aspect of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para171"></a>Shall we have to pay for these benefits with more tiresome red tape? The noble Lord, Lord Boardman, believes that we shall. Of course, one person's regulatory red tape is another person's protection. The Office of Fair Trading can approve voluntary, independent codes of practice by various industries or groups of companies, and in this way it should be able to avoid some red tape. The invisible hand of the market requires less red tape than the long arm of government. The OFT will have to produce an annual regulatory impact assessment so that each year the red tape will be under review. On balance, that will help to keep red tape to a minimum.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para172"></a>I return to the fraud and dishonesty to which I referred at the beginning of my remarks. It seems to me that recent events have shaken our confidence in accountants, analysts, businessmen and bankers&#151;in the very people needed to carry out the spirit of the Bill. That means that there are now others to whom we must look in the commercial front line and on whom <P>


<a name="column_167"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we shall have to rely more. Trading standards officers immediately come to mind. I agree with my noble friend the Minister; they are going to have to be more alert than ever. Although they are employees of local authorities, I hope that my noble friend will encourage local authorities to raise their number and standard of training, as well as increasing their budget.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para173"></a>Whistle-blowers, too, become more important&#151;a point referred to by my noble friend Lord Borrie. In 1998, he steered through the Public Interest Disclosure Act to protect whistle-blowers. With our confidence in their bosses somewhat shaken, perhaps we should be encouraging whistle-blowers to be rewarded with promotion rather than with the sack. The Enron and Worldcom frauds were exposed by whistle-blowers&#151;incidentally, both of them women. So obviously whistle-blowers can be an effective way of detecting illegal commercial arrangements and apparently dubious accounting. Perhaps in the Bill the Minister should be paying more attention to encouraging and legitimising them.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para174"></a>Another ally in maintaining high standards is corporate governance. I know that my noble friend's department is looking at this matter, but surely recent events in the United States push this further up the agenda. I realise the difficulties of policing ethics, but higher standards of corporate governance go together with deterring fraud and dishonesty. I wonder whether in some way this could become part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para175"></a>In conclusion, like many other noble Lords, I welcome the Bill. I believe that together with an encouraging nod towards trading standards officers, whistle-blowers and higher standards of corporate governance, it will contribute towards a more enterprising economy and a fairer and better society.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I, too, welcome the Bill, but with less acclamation than other noble Lords. In view of the somewhat critical nature of my remarks, I should perhaps explain that I am not some blue-sky idealist about business. I have been in it all my life, having started my own business 32 years ago, which employs 100 people and goes along merrily. I sit on a number of boards as a non-executive director, which is a dangerous thing to do these days, but I thought that I should clear the decks.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para176"></a>It is interesting and worth mentioning en passant that only one right reverend Prelate is in his place for this debate, which says something about the way in which business has somehow retreated into a little world of its own. That strange isolation of business from life at large, or the apartheid between Monday to Friday and Saturday and Sunday is accepted by the Church itself. A great deal of social and cultural disadvantage flows from that separation.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para177"></a>It is ironic that the Bill is a good deal longer than the New Testament&#151;I do not think that it is quite as good a read, or as wise. It is also worth noting the paucity of Peers sitting on the Government Benches. I wonder whether that has something to do with the fact that 20 <P>


<a name="column_168"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>years ago such a Bill would have been viewed as an impossibly Thatcherite imposition at a time when those now in government were worshipping nationalisation and Clause 4 as much as they apparently now worship untrammelled free-market forces. It is all very confusing to a simple country boy.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para178"></a>The timing of the Bill is unlucky, as immediately preceding it we have had Enron, Arthur Andersen, Tyco, Worldcom, Merrill Lynch and now looming in the United States a series of earth-shattering litigation around laddering or initial public offerings. The first of these lawsuits, eToy v Goldman Sachs, is expected to reveal an appalling state of conspiracy by those introducing initial offerings, whereby for certainty and by contract, they cream off huge capital gains at the start of those offerings at the expense of the market and the public at large.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para179"></a>My first, and perhaps most important point, is to ask whether it is safe to examine the Bill on the basis of its own separate ideology. In my marriage service, I was subject to the Book of Common Prayer, which talked about marriage being "enterprised" There is not much sense of enterprise these days beyond the narrow confines of business. The Enterprise Bill refers to the Office of Fair Trading, and I wonder how rich and diverse a meaning the Bill will allow to the word "fair"&#151;very little, I suspect. I strongly oppose eliminating the role of Ministers from the various parts of the Bill from which they have been extracted&#151;the issue of mergers is one example.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para180"></a>As has already been said, the Bill is a charter for lawyers and accountants. They have largely driven it and will be the main and only certain beneficiaries of it. Indeed, big business will be a beneficiary as only big business can afford the lawyers and accountants to cope with it. That is not a trite point. The ever-increasing regulation of business represents an anti-competitive element in business life. Small and medium-sized businesses cannot get near the sort of advice necessary to understand the Aladdin's cave of complexity.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para181"></a>The Bill flies in the face of experience. I should have thought that we were past believing that the ills in the world of free-market capitalism can be contended with solely and simply by the passage of more and more complex laws. I am sure that I need not remind the House that two of the most crucial provisions in the whole of the already massive and ramshackle array of protections for citizens against fraudulent and dishonest trading are honoured in the breach. When did we last hear of a prosecution for insider trading, which is rampant? How often have there been prosecutions for trading while insolvent? That, too, is rampant.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para182"></a>Limited liability has become a scandal. We may not be touched by it, but ordinary people suffer from the regular and shameful ignoring of the provisions of limited liability in small companies. Tens of thousands of small companies go bust every month of every year. How many directors are ever called to account in the civil let alone criminal courts? I am completely unimpressed by the panoply of new powers. I should <P>


<a name="column_169"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be much more inclined to listen to the Government if the very basic protections in business were upheld. I repeat that they are not. Perhaps the Minister will tell us when he winds up how many prosecutions have been brought for insider trading or under limited liability provisions. I am sure that we would be shocked by the figures.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para183"></a>Any reference to the construct of limited liability is absent from the Bill. It is a man-made privilege par excellence. The assumption is that it is an irremovable, untouchable part of the edifice of success and affluence in commerce today. If we were doing our job properly, we would undertake a major investigation into the way in which limited liability works&#151;for ill as well as good. We all know about its beneficial effects, but a consequence has been the growth in giant companies. Without limited liability there would not be massive, multinational companies. I believe that many of the failings with which we are all contending have to do with scale. There is a breakdown of internal cohesion or culture and a lack of individual philosophy or morals in containing or constraining the activities of such corporations, of which there are many current examples.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para184"></a>I shall say a word about the role of non-economic considerations in some of the matters with which we are dealing. The attempt to separate economic and political issues is a farce&#151;as much of a farce as the Government repeatedly saying that entry to the euro is a purely economic issue. They say that there are five economic tests, as if there were no non-economic considerations or consequences of entry. That separation is just as futile in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para185"></a>I have no confidence in the ability of a few accountants, however well read or well bred to deal with the non-economic consequences of the matters covered by the Bill. What do I mean by non-economic consequences? We all know that free-market economics is rather like the Ritz. The equality of choice and purchasing power in the marketplace, which are upheld as two of the great aims of the Bill, are as long or as strong as the size of the purse of the person concerned. If one has no money, one has no protection. When the Bill is passed, market regulators need have no regard to issues of social divisiveness and basic social need. That makes the removal of the public interest element more than dangerous. It makes it foolhardy.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para186"></a>What about the role of village shops in our society? Everyone agrees that they are far more than merely economic entities. What about cultural goods? Shortly we shall consider the communications Bill. What about pornography? There is Mr Desmond's recent take-over and the fact that the Government said that they could not intervene, even under the present law. I believe that those are all examples of the need for the public interest, broadly defined, to have a role in considering, for example, mergers and take-overs.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para187"></a>I shall touch briefly on one or two further points. The provision of information arrangements under Clause 6 could so easily be propagandist. They speak only of informing the public about the benefits of <P>


<a name="column_170"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>competition. I believe that an excess of competition is antisocial. One cannot unleash uncontrolled aggression, uncontrolled greed, uncontrolled insatiability as a stimulant to market and competitive effectiveness and not expect it to infect the rest of our body politic and our body social. It is one of those strange misunderstandings that bedevils us. Therefore, I hope that provision of information to the public, as it is called, will be balanced by information on social responsibility, on the ethics of business and on others matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   My Lords, there is much to welcome in the Bill. Many of the proposed reforms to consumer protection and to the competition regime are particularly welcome. Although, as has been expressed already, to seek legislation so soon after the 1998 Competition Act shows a depressing lack of foresight. However, we are where we are. I declare an interest as president of the National Consumer Federation and president of the Trading Standards Institute.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para188"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is right to say that generally I welcome the broadening of the scope of the stop now orders. I am heartened to hear of the associated funding of which the Minister spoke and I support the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, regarding the new burdens on the service.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para189"></a>I am sorry that I cannot agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that a strategy board to support the Director General of Fair Trading is a bad idea. In my view, if it sticks to its intended brief, it should be an asset.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para190"></a>I support many of the provisions that set out to deal with a number of very significant matters in the pursuit of maintaining a fair trading environment and the promotion of a competitive market economy. Powers to outlaw rogue trading practices are vital to honest traders and to maintain consumer confidence. The ability to deal with such matters will be a key test of the Bill's effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para191"></a>Of particular interest, therefore, is the Bill's stated objective of amending the law relating to the protection of the collective interests of consumers&#151;a praiseworthy objective. So it is disappointing to note that the Bill does not seek to address a significant anomaly in the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, which has been the cause of consumer detriment since that Act came into force.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para192"></a>The matter to which I refer concerns the requirement to prove mens rea&#151;guilty knowledge&#151;in order to establish an offence in relation to mis-described services. As the Minister knows well, that Act forms the backbone of consumer protection legislation in the United Kingdom and establishes the most fundamental principles for the development of legitimate and fair practice in business dealings between traders and the public. Perhaps the most significant sections of the Act are Sections 1 and 14. Section 1 prohibits false trade descriptions in relation to goods and Section 14 deals with false statements <P>


<a name="column_171"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made in connection with services. Section 1 does not require proof of guilty knowledge, whereas Section 14 does. The two sections of the Act are clearly inconsistent. Gathering evidence to prove mens rea is fraught with difficulty and causes significant problems for those who are tasked with enforcement.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para193"></a>The consumer does not readily distinguish between statements made in relation to goods and statements made in relation to the provision of services. It is as easy to be misled by one as by the other. Indeed, in an economy such as ours, which relies more and more heavily on service industries, it becomes increasingly important that appropriate sanctions are in place to deal with occasions when consumers are taken in by false statements relating to the services that they buy. Furthermore, services and goods are increasingly available for purchase remotely and electronically, so the importance of accurate descriptions is paramount. Members of the public are frequently at a loss to comprehend the reasons why the protection offered in law differs depending upon whether they are purchasing goods or services.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para194"></a>The 1976 review of the Trade Descriptions Act, conducted by the then Director General of Fair Trading&#151;it could not possibly have been the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, in those far off days&#151;reported on those deficiencies in the Act and recommended that changes were introduced to align the two sections. More recently, the DTI consumer White Paper, Modern Market: Confident Consumers, gave an indication that that was the way the Government were going. But is it?
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para195"></a>The Enterprise Bill presents Her Majesty's Government with an ideal opportunity to address this important and relevant issue. I shall listen careful to the Minister when he responds to my concern in this area. I believe that the Government's intentions are good, but I hope that the raft of new ideas will not distract them from putting right the underlying law which remains unsatisfactory.

<a name="20702-04_para196"></a>First, I strongly welcome the role that the Bill gives not only to the interests of consumers, but also to organisations that exist to protect those interests. The idea of super-complaints&#151;an inelegant word&#151;is welcome. They can be brought by such organisations in the interests of consumers.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para197"></a>It will be extremely important that the designation of organisations that can so protect consumers, and the regulations and systems through which they can seek to protect the consumers are kept simple and as far as possible within the means of what are likely to be non-profit-making organisations.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para198"></a>I particularly welcome the 90-day response by the Office of Fair Trading. As I read the Bill, that department must respond with a decision to act, or not <P>


<a name="column_172"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to act, with reasons, within 90 days, with no back-sliding. The Bill is mandatory. That should produce an ethos of consumer protection different from that which we have experienced in the past. In addition to those enforcement measures, for consumers there is the important function of the OFT in promoting good consumer practice and the investigation and, where necessary, advice to be given on codes of good practice. Those are welcome changes.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para199"></a>I move to the second of my two points of welcome, which is to note the powers and the structure of the competition appeal tribunal. I hope that many disputes will be resolved without the need for reference to that tribunal. However, it is essential that the tribunal is not constituted with the same degree of formality, delay and control by lawyers that is the usual litigious process in this country. The tribunal should work as well informally as formally, seeking to mediate between competing interests to achieve quick and effective results&#151;especially when it has to deal with consumer protection.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para200"></a>It is of concern that the disclosure provisions of a Bill that promotes enterprise and seeks to make it a major part of corporate and market activity are so restrictive. The Secretary of State can exclude from published documentation that which he or she considers to be inappropriate, which is a loose control. If transparency is to be encouraged, the public will want to know why action has or has not been taken. When we examine Clause 240 in Committee, it will be extremely interesting to know why material can be kept confidential from the public where the authority thinks that publication "might"&#151;not will or be likely to&#151;adversely affect a commercial interest. That is overprotecting the corporate system. If competition is to be promoted and rules enforced where they are abused, the public will expect to know the whole truth.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para201"></a>I find to my dismay as a professional man that Parliament is about to consider again legislation in which the phrase "a business" includes a professional practice. I have no hesitation pursuing my practice in a businesslike fashion but I hesitate to describe my profession as a business. My clients would feel concern if they thought that my primary motivation in giving advice and representation was making profit rather than serving them and the community.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para202"></a>How do my noble friends on the Front Bench envisage that part of the Bill being used towards professions? Any decent profession requires its members to be properly educated, observe decent ethics and serve the public well. That costs money. People have to contribute to their profession and must charge fees that embrace those costs. Are we to place a premium on mediocrity and conclude that people who are less educated and less ethical but cheaper should be favoured in competition practice? I think not. I hope that the definition of market concerns in Clause 126 will not subjugate professional standards to the level of mere profiteering.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para203"></a>This is the first legislation of its kind that can be said to be a pure competition Act. Public interest does not figure in clear terms as it has in the past, although <P>


<a name="column_173"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under various chapters the Secretary of State will have special powers to refer where certain public interest matters may be affected. I ask rhetorically, if this needs further thought by my Front Bench colleagues, what role will public interest play in the enforcement of competition under Clause 126? Will pure market-force economics or some extraneous factors play their part in determining enforcement of competition laws that in fact go against the public interest? One can well imagine circumstances in which they might. A small sector of society providing a significant public service that does not have a substantial asset base but exists on its income may charge for its goods or services at a rate that preserves its existence, yet serves the public interest. I would be adverse to such a case resulting in the institution concerned, be it private or professional, finding that its standards and services were to be reduced at the altar of competition.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para204"></a>The word "competition" simply embraces an economic concept. It has no greater theological significance&#151;as one sometimes imagines, talking to proponents of competition in Brussels. I am sure that our Ministry has its feet on the ground. This is a competition Bill named the Enterprise Bill. I hope that its content will not become a vehicle for frustrating competition, nor for damaging matters that are properly pursued in the public interest.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para205"></a>I hope for reassurance that the Office of Fair Trading, with so many vitally important public objectives to achieve, will be fully financed in its ability to achieve them and will not fall down&#151;especially when protecting consumers&#151;because of inadequate resources. Subject to all those matters, I welcome the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_time12"></a><H5>6.7 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   My Lords, it is not so much the weight and length of the Bill that concerns me&#151;though it is long and weighty enough&#151;but its unintelligibility as a stand-alone document. It is all very well for parliamentary draftsmen to flick between different Acts of Parliament but when the Bill is enacted it will have practical implications for large and small businesses. We owe it to our fellow citizens to make legislation as comprehensible and intelligible as possible. I hope that the Government will find time for some consolidation, so that business people throughout the country who have to live with the Bill's consequences will be able to learn all its implications in one place.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para206"></a>There are clearly some welcome aspects, such as the plan to insulate the competition authority from political interference. It is not just that the judgments of politicians about business matters can be fallible. More important, different Secretaries of State can reach different conclusions about the same subject. Business needs above all a stable framework. Given that the average term of office of a Secretary of State is less than a couple of years, stability has been lacking in the present arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para207"></a>I wonder if Members of another place have realised some of the proposal's implications. Presumably a delegation to a Minister to lobby against a takeover <P>


<a name="column_174"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will become a thing of the past. If it does not, a critical element of the proposals will have been undermined. I hope that we are given the chance to explore in Committee how the authority's independence will be buttressed against everyday political pressures. The structure, make-up and terms of the new authority will be critical&#151;as will Government thinking on the nature of the competition test lying behind Clause 21 and on the special public interest test in Clause 51.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para208"></a>One of the most useful aspects of the present regime is the ability of a firm seeking to engage in a takeover to approach the OFT for confidential guidance as to the acceptability of the course on which it is about to embark. It can prevent a huge diversion and waste of resources for both the bidding and the target companies. I hope that the Minister will be able to say something of the Government's thinking on this matter.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para209"></a>Secondly, on the review of personal bankruptcy, as the White Paper points out, bankruptcy is for most people an appalling personal tragedy, not just in financial terms although that is bad enough but, more importantly, in the loss of self confidence and self esteem. As a country we need to encourage risk takers, people who will put their financial assets including their house on the line and go through the sweaty days and nights of building up a business.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para210"></a>Therefore, I understand and welcome the attempts to distinguish between "good" and "bad" bankrupts. But as many noble Lords have pointed out, it is distinguishing one from the other that is so difficult. I am not sure that the provisions in the Bill do that well enough. It may be unpleasant to say this but we need to remember always that every bankruptcy&#151;good, bad or indifferent&#151;represents a loss to the creditors who very often are themselves small and vulnerable businesses. The relevant clauses will need careful consideration in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para211"></a>Reference is made in the White Paper to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 as providing a mechanism or procedure for distinguishing "good" from "bad" bankrupts. From my experience&#151;I hasten to add that it is not direct experience&#151;the legislation has not been satisfactory except in the most obvious cases. Often it is operated by people with no real experience of business and appearing to have quotas to fill in each financial year. I do not believe that that is a happy example. I hope that the Minister is aware of the concerns among insolvency practitioners about weaknesses in structure and technical detail in this section of the Bill. No doubt we can revert to that in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para212"></a>On the abolition of Crown preference, while that obviously increases the fairness and equality among creditors and must be welcomed, I fear that it may have the opposite result from that which so many have anticipated. Crown preference really only impacts once the firm or individual has gone into receivership or bankruptcy. It impacts at the expense of the other creditors. But it is what happens before receivership that is equally important. The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise are notoriously hard-nosed and <P>


<a name="column_175"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unsympathetic to a struggling business. But from time to time they can be persuaded to help by delaying a demand for payment in the way that other trade creditors are prepared or forced to do.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para213"></a>I suspect that they do so safe in the knowledge that the existing Crown preference will safeguard them. If it is withdrawn, they may have no reason not to enforce their position to the day, the letter and the penny. Therefore, to make the change of real impact the Government need to find a way to encourage a fresh attitude by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise to struggling businesses which are taking risks. I wish the Minister well in that task.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para214"></a>Perhaps I may raise a number of issues on the philosophy underlying the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, said, this is a misnamed Bill. It is not an enterprise Bill. It is a regulation of competition Bill. It is a consumer Bill. It is an insolvency Bill. One of the three White Papers is entitled, Productivity and Enterprise: A World Class Competition Regime. This Bill will probably not harm productivity although it will represent another series of bricks in the regulatory burden borne by firms. But it will not do much to enhance it either. This country has a lamentable productivity record. The supply side reforms introduced by my noble friend Lady Thatcher may have had a beneficial impact, but we are now back on the familiar path. In the 12 months ending in the fourth quarter of 2001 output per job went up 0.8 per cent; unit wage costs went up 3.3 per cent. Why is that? We do not invest enough. We do not manage our enterprises well enough. We have a hideously complex tax system, as my noble friend Lord Saatchi said earlier; and we have a burden of regulation originating here but also consisting of Brussels' regulations which have been gold-plated in Whitehall. Despite the Bill's alluring title, nothing will tackle these fundamental underlying problems in any way.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para215"></a>Secondly, it is not clear to me how the Government will reconcile their wish to see the emergence of world class and world-leading companies based in the UK with their desire to preserve and enhance competition. The UK is a small market. To build a company within the UK strong enough to take on European and world competitors will almost certainly require a degree of dominance of the UK market at odds with the provisions of Clause 126. Let us take as an example an emerging industry, the biotechnology industry, which will be almost certainly at the leading edge of innovation and productivity over the next 25 years and which offers a richness of opportunity to mankind. Currently only 10 per cent of UK biotechnology companies have more than 50 employees. To undertake the necessary research and development these companies will need scale and in a market the size of the UK that means market dominance. What will the OFT say about that?
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para216"></a>When the Minister replies, it is no good his praying in aid the US example as his colleagues the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry are inclined to do. It is a false comparison. The US is a market of 220 million with a <P>


<a name="column_176"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>GNP 10 times the size of ours. Their market can accommodate a range of specialist companies. I am not clear that ours can do so. The implications of Clause 21(2)(b) will need careful probing in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para217"></a>Finally, on this section there is the issue of whether the Bill brings us closer to or further away from practices on the continent of Europe. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, raised the point in his opening remarks. There seems to be a dispute as to whether criminalisation of cartels is in line with continental Europe. What seems clear is that this will give us a competition regime which is as far-reaching on each count as every European country and, taken overall, is more stringent than any. That in turn raises issues about level playing fields in the UK's competitive position. We struggle with the implications of the prospectus directive&#151; drawn up with the requirements of the weaker financially regulated EU member states&#151;which, with its one size fits all, will greatly impede the access to public capital for smaller companies in the UK. Think, my Lords, about the productivity implications of that.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para218"></a>Meanwhile the German Government have been able successfully to stall the Takeover Directive so that the German industry continues with its old practices of poison pills, unequal voting rights and other devices which afford artificial protection to German management and deprive German shareholders of what is rightfully theirs. That is clearly an anti-competitive position.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para219"></a>Finally, there is the issue of resources. The Minister was keen to trumpet the advantages of criminalisation. But I am sure he will remember&#151;I am no lawyer&#151;that this will change the burden of proof from the balance of probabilities to beyond reasonable doubt. Reaching this standard of proof will be far from easy. The difficulties of getting convictions under the insider dealing rules, when those were criminal, come to mind. So does the poor conviction record obtained by the Serious Fraud Office.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para220"></a>The Government may find that they have aroused public expectations which they cannot subsequently fulfil. Most importantly, if attempts are made to obtain convictions and they fail, there is a danger that the legislation will fall into disrepute. The Government will need, therefore, to ensure the adequacy of legal resources and support to make that happen.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para221"></a>I make one point about consumers. I support the Government's attempt to afford greater protection and redress against rogue traders. But I am disappointed that there appears to be no effort in the Bill to deal with consumer fraud and malpractice arising from bases overseas. It is an increasingly important and difficult matter. I give a simple example. Noble Lords will have received through the post letters from the Netherlands. They look very official. They are content-security sealed, with tamper-proof alert. When opened, they contain a facsimile cheque informing you that you have won the princely sum of £361,681. The catch is that in order to get it you have to send £26 transfer fee. That is fantasy.
<P>


<a name="column_177"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para222"></a>However, people are not mailing these just for their health. They are mailing them because they are getting £26 over and over again. It is the most gullible and vulnerable members of society that respond to those sort of entreaties. As a matter of urgency, if the Government are serious about protecting consumers they need to find a way to tackle this.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para223"></a>To conclude, I find parts of the Bill which are worth while, parts which are inoffensive but unnecessary, and parts which are seriously flawed. There is much work to do in Committee and I hope that the Government will approach that stage with an open mind.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_time13"></a><H5>6.21 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-04_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   My Lords, it falls to me to wind up this debate from these Benches. I can do no better than to begin by echoing the remarks of my noble friend Lord Razzall about the clarity of the Minister's introduction to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para224"></a>As many Members of your Lordships' House have said, it is a long and complex Bill. Generally, on these Benches, we welcome it. The objectives are highly laudable. Who could question the need for higher productivity? Who would question a desire for a better enterprise culture? However, it is a compendium Bill&#151;others have referred to its title. It is a mixture of measures. I do not believe that what we call the Bill matters, although others may. What is in it and whether it will achieve those laudable objectives is the key issue.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para225"></a>The Minister mentioned in his introduction that the Bill has widespread support. That is true. As my noble friend Lord Razzall mentioned, we have had briefings on this from many and varied organisations. They use phrases like "support in the round" or "generally support". I hope that the Minister has not taken too much comfort from those words in the sense that there is much that we shall need to deal with in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para226"></a>I should also make it clear that we welcome the removal of political direction from the Office of Fair Trading. We supported it in another place and we support it here. However, that does not mean that we shall modify in any way our concern about what we perceive to be the lack of parliamentary accountability of the hugely powerful new quango that is being created by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para227"></a>In Committee we want to explore whether we can find a way of exercising appropriate parliamentary scrutiny&#151;whether that is through a joint Lords and Commons Select Committee; whether it is through the DTI Select Committee approving membership of the boards; whether it is through reports to Parliament to justify specific decisions; or whether it would be better to impose a public interest mandate, in addition to the body's other responsibilities, to which other Members of your Lordships' House have already referred.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para228"></a>In general, we welcome the provisions for competition policy reform, which represent a valuable and useful step forward. My noble friend Lord Razzall referred to a number of our concerns in this area. In terms of the review of decisions, we shall want to <P>


<a name="column_178"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>explore whether it is sensible to have an extension where any aggrieved party can apply for what is essentially a judicial review. I am concerned that the provisions leave far too open the decisions on mergers. Other noble Lords have referred to the need for certainty in business. It seems to go through a whole investigation, to come to a conclusion and then to say that another three months must pass before anyone, on any grounds, can ask for a review. That will create too much uncertainty.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para229"></a>Many noble Lords have commented on the issue of cartel offences. I share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, about the definition of dishonesty. I believe that a definition appears in the Bill for the first time&#151;to do something dishonestly. It worries me and we shall need to define it carefully. I worry also that the criminalisation of cartel offences in this country will catch only the small fry. I want to be assured that we shall also catch some much bigger fish. It would be a terrible shame if we ended up with the window cleaners of the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, inside, and the big fish operating under only civil penalties in Europe. We should look at that carefully.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para230"></a>My noble friend Lord Razzall raised the issue of whether the investigation of offences should be the remit of the Serious Fraud Office or, as is contemplated by the Bill, the Office of Fair Trading. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said that he had an open mind, based on his vast experience in the field. From my perspective, we are dealing with an investigation which it is hoped will lead to a criminal conviction. That requires forensic skills. Those seem to be more readily present in the SFO than in the OFT&#151;unless the OFT is going to be equipped with new skills. We would do well to examine that in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para231"></a>On competition reform, we should look at the use of surveillance powers in some depth. I am not yet in a position to agree that powers introduced originally to combat serious crime and terrorism are appropriate for a competition authority. That should be looked at very carefully.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para232"></a>Finally, a small point. The issue of disqualification on the grounds of competition offences is very widely drawn in the Bill. If we are about encouraging enterprise and bringing back entrepreneurs into an entrepreneurial stage, we would do well to look there again. It seems that an offence of any nature in competition could lead to disqualification. We should look at that carefully.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para233"></a>As regards the issue of insolvency reform, it is notable that in that part of the Bill we have had more briefing from more and varied organisations than on any other issue. At the core of our concerns here is the differentiation between preserving business or dealing more fairly with business bankruptcy, and preserving the company in the case of corporate, or distinguishing between consumer&#151;if I can use that phrase&#151;bankruptcies, in the case of the individual.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para234"></a>I feel strongly that preserving the business in the case of a corporate insolvency is more important than preserving the company. I shall not repeat the remarks of my noble friend Lord Razzall in the example of how <P>


<a name="column_179"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one can structure the preservation of a company at the expense of business and employment. However, at the core that is the key, and it is an important issue.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para235"></a>I echo the words of a number of noble Lords that the timescales&#151;certainly on the corporate insolvencies&#151;are not realistic. We need to look at those again and think about extending them. It is hoped that many will be completed sooner than the limit, but a limit that is sensible and viable is needed.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para236"></a>I mentioned the issues on personal bankruptcy and the distinction between personal and business bankruptcy. I believe that saving the business and helping that person back into business is more important than helping people who might want to manage their debt in a different way. That leads to the issue of the unfortunate versus the reckless bankrupt, which was mentioned by several noble Lords. The Bill does not distinguish sufficiently between the two.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para237"></a>I add my congratulations to the noble Lord on doing something about industrial and provident societies. That was clearly a concern. As my noble friend Lady Maddock said, I hope that we have now put this one to bed and will not come back to it.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para238"></a>Finally, we welcome most if not all of the procedures on consumer protection. In his introduction, the Minister explained why the Government had not seen fit to introduce a requirement not to trade unfairly. I wonder whether they have been courageous enough. I would encourage them to think again and to be courageous by considering an amendment to introduce that provision, which is sorely needed in this country.
<P>

<a name="20702-04_para239"></a>We have had a good debate. Questions have raged long and hard and for once the accountants came in for only a mild drubbing rather than a thorough one.

<A NAME="20702-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </B>   My Lords, we have heard some valuable contributions in the 14 speeches so far. Substantial points have been raised that I trust the Minister will answer. I see that he is slowly going through the well written briefs that he has been given. I echo the tributes paid to his advisers. It is 23 years since I spoke from the Opposition Front Bench, but I had 16 years speaking from the Government Front Bench and I recall the outstandingly good briefs that I was given by the independent and impartial civil service of which we have every right to be proud. I am sure that some of the questions put by my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon will be covered in the file that the Minister is going through carefully, but I anticipate that some of them will not be covered. I invite the Minister to break with tradition and give an off the cuff response to those penetrating questions.
<P>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para0"></a>Since I entered this House I have never ceased to be impressed by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and his mastery of so many varied briefs. He is a man of many public parts and roles, which he plays with great expertise. I pay tribute to him for that.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para1"></a>We have had an interesting debate about the title of the Bill. I applaud my noble friend Lord Boardman, who has consulted the Oxford English Dictionary, but I doubt that his suggestion will be taken up. He found a definition of enterprise as courage. During my period as a Minister, if any of my advisers said that a policy would be courageous or labelled any initiative as having considerable courage, it was often an argument for not going down that road.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para2"></a>Here we have a Bill covering now two volumes containing 277 clauses and 26 schedules. As my noble friend Lady Miller said, it is in effect three Bills. That was echoed by a number of speakers in the debate. I hope that Ministers recognise the call for the Bill to have undergone pre-legislative scrutiny. It was ideally suited for that process very well.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para3"></a>A number of points have been made about the timing of the Bill. Only the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, congratulated the Minister on the timing. He said that it was well timed because of all the financial scandals. I am not sure whether he attributes any credit to the Government for that timing, but I hope that he recognises that he was the only one who thought that July was the right moment to introduce the Bill in this House, leaving very little time for proper scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para4"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, that there has been inadequate consultation. The Bill has been rushed. I hope that we shall have time to scrutinise its provisions properly. As the CBI said, it is a curate's egg. The CBI has been quoted in support of the Bill, but it also said that it failed to see how the Bill could boost enterprise.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para5"></a>The Minister said that the Bill was radical, that there had been proper consultation and that the provisions were bold. I echo some of the comments of noble Lords who have called that into question. First, I commend again my noble friend Lord Boardman for his criticism of the prison sentences that have suddenly leapt to prominence for those guilty of anti-competitive behaviour. The recent Competition Act&#151;some parts of which have not yet been brought into effect&#151;did not suggest that penalty and the rest of Europe is moving in the opposite direction. Ministers need to explain why they are introducing these provisions.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para6"></a>My noble friend Lord Astor made a number of key points about the need to speed up procedures. In many ways, our system works well. My noble friend made some valuable points on that. He also asked, given that some of the provisions of the Competition Act have not yet come into effect, why the Government are proceeding in this direction. He carefully laid down a good argument for not doing so.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para7"></a>We have all without exception welcomed the fact that Ministers are moving to put distance between the Secretary of State and decisions on mergers. My noble friend Lord Tebbit produced guidelines heading in <P>


<a name="column_181"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 181</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that direction, so it is hardly surprising that we welcome this further step in relieving Ministers of the tendency to "block it, Beckett", or whoever the Minister might be pursuing a particular political course. It is very welcome that that will no longer be possible.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para8"></a>One could have expected the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, to object to the abolition of the post that he held with such distinction for many years, reappointed constantly by Conservative governments. That may send a message to him&#151;it certainly does to me.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para9"></a>My noble friend Lady Wilcox, however, supported the concept of the board. In Committee we must examine how it would work. The noble Lord was right to draw our attention to the advertisement that has just appeared. I have not yet scrutinised it, but I look forward to doing so. He said it spoke of two days a month, which hardly suggests the board will move at the speed with which the noble Lord used to move in his previous capacity.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para10"></a>I also support what the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said about the Desmond clause and the question of public interest in mergers of newspapers. My noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon has already referred to this key issue.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para11"></a>Looking generally at the consumer side, the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, asked whether there should be a duty to trade fairly. I have heard from Deirdre Hutton of the National Consumer Council that we should consider whether there should be a duty not to trade unfairly. We share some of the Government's misgivings in trying to put that statement into legislation. It would be extremely difficult and would fall foul of some of the tests that my honourable friends have been imposing on the Bill to relieve regulation.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para12"></a>The speech of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, bears considerable scrutiny. He has a lifetime of public service and is a lawyer well known for his initiatives on pro bono work. I recall that he was a legal eagle for some time. He pointed out some deficiencies of the existing free enterprise system which we should do well to consider carefully. Although I did not agree with much of what he said, we must ensure that we consider the issues with great care.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para13"></a>My noble friend Lady Wilcox talked about the difference between misdescribed services and misdescribed goods. I am not sure I agree with her, but it is necessary to scrutinise the guilty knowledge element in these matters. I would not want consumers to find that it is impossible for them to pursue redress. Equally, it is important to pay attention to the good faith of those selling services.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, referred to a number of key points, particularly on Clause 240, to which I had not paid much attention until he pointed out its deficiencies. I found persuasive some of the principles that he enunciated, but I will need to see how he translates his suggestions into specific amendments before deciding whether we agree with him.
<P>


<a name="column_182"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, and the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, shared with us their experience of social housing, although the Minister pointed out at the start of the debate that the Government will be tabling clauses to exclude housing associations.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para16"></a>I was amazed to hear the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, refer to the Bill as not being very fundamental, although wordy. I regard some of the measures as very fundamental and on this side of the House we will question their detail. He added that he would table a couple of proposed schedules and a series of clauses. We can only be taken aback by his courage and we look forward to scrutinising that additional proposed legislation.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para17"></a>On the provisions relating to insolvency, my noble friend Lord Hodgson rightly said that we must encourage risk takers. It will be important for us to try to find a way of differentiating between business debt and personal debt. My noble friend Lord Boardman was right to point out that borrowing has become a habit. It is a worrying development. We would not want any provisions in this legislation that suddenly released many people who often take credit beyond their means from the significance of facing up to that borrowing at some stage. We are often dealing with debts owed to small businesses in that respect.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para18"></a>I am not sure that we have paid enough attention to student debt. I was assured by a Minister that there was no need to worry about students seeking the new procedure to relieve themselves of student loans because the student loans legislation had already excluded such opportunities. I now discover that a further measure has put students back into potential bankruptcy proceedings. We need to think about that carefully. There have been a number of important press articles on the subject.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para19"></a>The Association of Business Recovery Professionals, which was referred to earlier, has highlighted the difference mentioned by several noble Lords between preserving the corporate vehicle as opposed to the economic entity. Schedule 16 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The administrator of a company must perform his functions&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-05_para20"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) with the objective of rescuing the company".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-05_para21"></a>I cannot understand why it does not say "rescuing the whole or part of the business", which is the existing practice. I hope that the Minister will explain why the Government have decided to refer to the company, and whether they are moving away from the definition of whole or part of the business.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para22"></a>As R3 points out, speed is virtually always critical to the rescue of a business, but so is flexibility. The unrealistic and arbitrary timescales imposed by the Bill to which the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, referred, will complicate the process and add to expense. With the changed definition of company rather than business the objectives may be defeated. We need to spend time on these points.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para23"></a>It has been an interesting debate. The House will have to spend a substantial amount of time in Committee. Clauses 205 to 228 were not considered by the other place in Committee. On Report, there was no <P>


<a name="column_183"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>debate whatever on the provisions dealing with market investigations and cartels and only a short interrupted debate on mergers. It therefore falls to this House to spend considerable time on this important but complex Bill that will certainly need extensive scrutiny. As the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, said, the Government should not be misled by the general welcome in principle, because key areas of detail remain to be scrutinised. We await the Minister's response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether I am more warned by the comment that the Government should not be misled by the general welcome or by the number of noble Lords who have said how much they look forward to Committee. Those seem to be threats rather than promises.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para24"></a>I begin with a certain amount of housekeeping, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. She complained about some of the procedures, particularly the lack of consultation and the short time period for the final consultation. I hope that she will recognise that all the Bill's elements were subject to extensive consultation before the final consultation. In 1999 there was consultation in the consumer White Paper and on merger reform; in 2000 we consulted on personal bankruptcy; and last year we consulted on competition and insolvency. It has been a three-year process and there has been plenty of opportunity for people to comment, which has certainly been taken up.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para25"></a>In response to the comments on lack of scrutiny in the Commons, it is true that there has always been a limitation on the time allowed for scrutiny there. Whenever Bills have been guillotined in the past it has had the same effect as programming, but the division of time within the time allowed is a matter for the Opposition. If they choose not to debate certain matters, that is their responsibility, not the Government's.
<P>

<a name="20702-05_para26"></a>If we agree to go into Committee, my understanding is that four days in Committee have been agreed. They may be long days; let us see. My experience has been&#151;

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may make one more point on housekeeping. The four days were agreed on provisionally; not finally. I believe that that could be confirmed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that is news to me. But we shall have to work hard, bearing in mind the complexity of the issues before us.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para0"></a>I shall deal separately with competition, consumer affairs and insolvency. I want to introduce my remarks on competition with a little of my own experience. In the early 1960s I was market research manager for one of the largest lamp and lighting companies in the country. We belonged to an organisation called the Electric Lamp Industry Council. It had magnificent premises in Bedford Square with an Angelica <P>


<a name="column_184"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kauffmann ceiling above the magnificent staircase and a splendid boardroom where the committees met. On the mantelpiece was a motto from John Ruskin:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is hardly anything in the world that some men cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper, and the people who consider price only are this man's lawful prey".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-06_para1"></a><P>

<a name="20702-06_para2"></a>That was the most blatant excuse for price fixing and cartelisation that I have ever known. In the electric lamp business in the 1960s the price of every single lamp was determined by agreement by all the manufacturers. There was a red book which set out the discounts which might be allowed to super wholesalers, wholesalers and small wholesalers. That went on, rampant and unchecked, and nobody did anything about it until Mr Heath did something with resale price maintenance. I am sure a lot of that still goes on and I am sure that we shall be learning more about it as the cartel provisions come into effect.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para3"></a>In the competition section I shall start by talking about the competition test because the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, questioned whether the competition test was the right alternative to the public interest test. I think that a competition test is more practical. I believe that the phrase, "public interest test", sounds good, and it works in some areas&#151;for example, the Crown Prosecution Service&#151;but in this case surely it is more realistic to be talking about competition as a principal factor in UK merger policy that should now be a legislative requirement. It is time to bring the legislation into line with practice. That is what the competition test in effect does. The test will be whether the merger is expected to result in "a substantial lessening of competition". That is the nearest to the competition analysis which is applied at present and that will be the concept which will guide the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission and they will have to explain that in guidance.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para4"></a>Perhaps this is housekeeping, but we were criticised for not allowing the Competition Act enough time to bed in. The point here is that the Competition Act 1998 did not address merger and monopoly powers and many of those were seriously dated. My noble friend Lord Borrie gave evidence on that point. When he said that this legislation follows on naturally from the 1998 Act I think that is the correct way to look at it.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para5"></a>A number of comments were made about the Office of Fair Trading itself, a general welcome for it being established as it is rather than as a creature of the Director General of Fair Trading. I was asked for some assurances about that. In particular my noble friend Lord Borrie asked me to ensure that we would not have the part-time members of the Office of Fair Trading board undertaking individual investigations. I can certainly give him that assurance. The conditions for the board are very clear, although they are to be found in the "consumer" section of my briefing notes. They are that the board should focus on the OFT's strategic vision and direction, prioritisation and monitoring progress against targets. We expect the board to delegate most operational decisions to the Chairman and OFT officials. I hope that that will give my noble friend the assurance that he needs.
<P>


<a name="column_185"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para6"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, expressed great concern about the existing delays in the Office of Fair Trading and I hope that he will be reassured by the need for the new OFT to approve a service delivery agreement, objectives and targets on which it will have to report on a regular basis to Parliament, because of course the OFT will be a body responsible to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para7"></a>I may be skipping around a bit but the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, asked whether companies would be able to continue to approach the OFT for confidential advice about mergers. The answer is that they certainly will.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para8"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, was concerned particularly about delays in broadcasting decisions, and I sympathise with him about that. He asked particularly about double jeopardy for sectoral regulators. The answer is that we are extending the concurrency working party agreements which have worked well under the existing Competition Act regime. The principle is that the best body to act should do so and if there is no agreement it goes to the working group to decide who should take it forward. There ought not, under those circumstances, to be a problem of double jeopardy.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para9"></a>There was a general welcome, although muted in the sense that it was hardly mentioned now I think about it, for the competition appeals tribunal. The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, made the valuable point that it needs to be as informal as possible. Of course, it has to be an independent tribunal and for that reason the chairman and the president will be appointed by the Lord Chancellor and appointments will be for a single longer term so that there are no issues raised by re-appointment. I agree with him that the proceedings have to be informal and that is the basis on which ordinary members of the tribunal will be able to hear appeals.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para10"></a>Inevitably there were questions about the cost of the market provisions increasing cost to business, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, and my noble friend, Lord Borrie. It is not necessarily the case that more markets will be referred to the Competition Commission than at present. The reference criteria are no more permissive than under the current monopolies regime. The Office of Fair Trading only refers when it thinks that there is a real likelihood of a serious competition problem and this is demonstrated by the fact that the Competition Commission has recommended remedies in all but one of the last 12 monopoly cases which have been sent to it.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para11"></a>Everybody except the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, welcomed the diminution of ministerial involvement in decisions about market investigations. We shall no doubt hear from the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on that subject in Committee and I look forward to that. He made the only really radical speech in the whole debate, if he does not mind my saying so.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para12"></a>I have dealt with the issue of the competition test. There was considerable discussion on the criminal offence and the issue of dishonesty. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, welcomed it. The noble Baroness, Lady <P>


<a name="column_186"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Miller, was concerned that it should not be thought of as being the same thing as theft and she objected to the use of theft. I am not sure that I agree with her. The dishonesty element will ensure that only people who are entering into agreements which they know to be wrong may be charged with a criminal offence and dishonesty will be tested against standards already established in case law. Juries will ask themselves whether what was done was dishonest by the standards of reasonable people and whether the defendant understood that that was the case.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para13"></a>It has not been defined in existing legislation but the relevant legislation is of course the Theft Act 1968. I think there is a reasonable balance between the civil offences and the criminal offences just as I believe there is the same reasonable balance in the Financial Services and Markets Act. The working together of the OFT and the Serious Fraud Office means that the OFT will be collecting evidence to different standards for civil and criminal cases. For criminal cases it will need to follow the Police and Criminal Evidence Act criteria and procedures because it will have to hand that over to the Serious Fraud Office. Incidentally, I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that the SFO conviction rates, which admittedly were lower in earlier years, have risen to 87 per cent in 1997-2002. My judgment is that my noble friend Lord Borrie was right in approving the decision to have those matters dealt with by the Serious Fraud Office.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para14"></a>Finally on the issues involving competition, there was concern about disclosure and information. I heard what my noble friend Lord Brennan said about overprotecting the corporate system. I was interested in the fact that implicitly the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, made similar points. If that issue is raised in amendments, I shall consider them with interest.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para15"></a>I turn to consumer issues. I am glad to say that to some extent I have already pre-empted myself by discussing the accountability of the OFT. It will be accountable to the Secretary of State, Parliament and the public. The chairman could be summoned by Select Committees. It will have to follow the general principles of good governance for all bodies corporate. It will have to publish an annual plan and an annual report, which will inevitably cover some of the elements of a regulatory impact assessment. It may or may not decide to publish minutes. The appointments will be in accordance with Nolan principles. I must resist the idea that comes up from time to time that there should be prior approval of appointments by a Commons committee. If that is to be done, we should do so knowing what we are doing rather than introduce the practice piecemeal. However, I have said that before and I guess that it becomes less convincing each time that I say it. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, was concerned that the OFT should act in accordance with the principles of good governance. We believe that it will do so.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para16"></a>I have answered the issues raised by my noble friend Lord Borrie and, to some extent, by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, about the role of the board. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked for the assurance <P>


<a name="column_187"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the OFT would still have to give proper consideration to complaints from members of the public, not just super-complaints. The OFT will have to consider any complaint that it receives that raises issues that are relevant to its functions. The special procedure for super-complaints does not affect that. She also asked for further information about what sort of bodies could be designated enforcers in relation to Part 8 for consumer protection purposes. The private bodies will be designated by the Secretary of State in a statutory instrument. They must have as one of their aims the protection of the collective interests of consumers and they must fulfil criteria that are set out by the Secretary of State, which will be designed to ensure that they act impartially, independently and with integrity and that they have the ability to take action under Part 8. The criteria will be based on the criteria for designation that are set out in the stop now orders, on which we will consult fully. If those bodies behave in a way that does not meet the criteria, we could take away the designation.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para17"></a>I did not hear many complaints about the super-complaints procedure, although there were concerns about the time of response. My noble friend Lord Brennan welcomed the 90-day period. I believe that the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, thought that it would be difficult to keep to 90 days in view of the bad experiences that he related.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para18"></a>On the stop now orders, the main issue is the general duty to trade fairly. The consensus, I gather, is that we should not go towards a general duty to trade fairly. The European Commission is looking into those issues. Of course we believe that businesses should trade fairly but we are targeting our new laws on the areas of real concern, which are those that should be concentrated on at the moment.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para19"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, asked about Section 14 of the Trade Descriptions Act and the issue of mens rea; the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, raised the same point. Misdescriptions by traders in relation to goods and services will usually constitute a misleading advertisement under the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations. Mens rea is not a consideration under those regulations and the provisions can already be enforced by stop now orders and will be covered by Part 8. I heard the doubts of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on that matter and was to some extent encouraged by his comments. I also heard what the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said about postal scams from abroad. That is covered by the same misleading advertisements regulations. The cases that he gave would be more a matter for the Financial Services Authority than for this legislation.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para20"></a>There has been a considerable degree of misunderstanding about the insolvency provisions. The impression has got about that somehow bankruptcy is becoming an easy option. Our policy is and remains that if bankrupts can pay, they should pay. On entering bankruptcy, a debtor's assets are liable for sale for the benefit of creditors, just as is the case at present. Bankruptcy has a wide-ranging impact on the lives of those who enter it. They risk losing their <P>


<a name="column_188"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>homes and possessions and they face severe restrictions on their finances, such as availability of bank accounts and their ability to obtain future credit, including mortgages. If a bankrupt has earnings, he is likely to be subject to an income payment order or an income payment agreement. They will apply to all bankrupts, regardless of their culpability. They will not be affected by early discharge, and they will continue to run after discharge for the full three-year period.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Boardman, raised the concern that the one-year period was not long enough. I hope that he will be reassured if I repeat the fact that income payments orders will extend beyond discharge and will run for three years. That, from the creditor's point if view, is the important point.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para22"></a>We are introducing a new and tougher regime of bankruptcy restriction orders for those bankrupts who represent a risk to the public or commercial community. That involves those who fail to account for losses and incur a debt where there was no reasonable expectation of being able to repay it, fraud and failing to co-operate with the Official Receiver. Those orders can apply for between two and 15 years. Any previous bankruptcies will be taken into account when considering bankruptcy restriction orders. The present regime allows for criminal action against bankrupts only where there is misconduct. We believe that that regime will allow the Insolvency Service more flexibility with regard to the way in which it deals with those who represent a risk to the public, which is what really matters. That applies in relation to what a number of noble Lords, notably the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said about rogue bankrupts. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, who was concerned about this, was right to suggest that the loss to creditors is the important consideration. That is still the case under the regime that we are pursuing.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para23"></a>There was concern about the proposed timescales in the streamlined administration procedures. One of the key points that is coming out of consultation is that administration takes too long. It does not provide any certainty for creditors about when they might get paid. We need to address that issue in order to reassure the lending community. With the changes that will be introduced elsewhere in the Bill, administration will become more accessible and attractive, particularly to smaller firms. The costs of running a lengthy administration can be a barrier to entering the existing administration procedure. Let us have more debate on timescales in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para24"></a>I was interested by the comments of the noble Lords, Lord Razzall and Lord Hunt, who is expert in this area, on "business against company" rescue. We would not want the administrator to rescue companies that are empty shells at the expense of rescuing viable businesses, especially when that would mean that the creditors would suffer. We want to put company rescue at the heart of insolvency procedures because we want to save companies which have a decent chance of survival so that they are not driven to the wall unnecessarily. I do not make a distinction there between business and company. If they carry on it is <P>


<a name="column_189"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the business which does so by means of the company surviving. But I am sure that we can return again to this matter in Committee.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para25"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, made a point about employees' claims. Under the Employment Rights Act the Government meet, and will continue to meet, the redundancy payments of employees where the employer has become insolvent. That does not mean that the employee cannot make additional claims. It is a statutory provision and the Bill enhances the position of employees. Where the Secretary of State and the employee both have a preferential claim in insolvency proceedings, it removes the Secretary of State's priority over that employee.
<P>

<a name="20702-06_para26"></a>I believe that noble Lords could have been a little more welcoming about the abolition of Crown preference, which is a rather important matter which has bugged many of us over a number of years. I did not hear much of the welcome which I believe we were entitled to.

The noble Lord, Lord Carter, will still have 10 minutes to open and the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, 12 minutes to wind up. May I remind noble Lords that as soon as the clock indicates six minutes they are over their allocated six minutes to speak.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carter </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what effect the American Farm Bill will have on proposals for the reform of trade in agricultural products.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Whips certainly do not change, do they?
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para5"></a>I have tabled this Question on the 2002 American Farm Bill because it seems to mark a fundamental change in apparent American attitudes towards farm support and thereby their international trade obligations. But before I turn to the Bill, as a former business manager may I say how impressed I am by a parliamentary system whereby the House discussed a Bill on 2nd May, the Senate on 8th May and the Bill became law on l3th May.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para6"></a>I say that there has been an apparent change because some would argue that this merely continues a policy that started in 1998, when the provisions of the 1996 Farm Bill were overturned within two years of its passing.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para7"></a>We all know that there is a political factor in the timing of this Bill, namely, the approaching mid- term elections. This was summed up very well by a Nebraskan farmer, who said, "About the time we think we are insignificant out here, something happens to make us think we're not". That reminded me of a remark that a farmer in the Mid-West made to me some years ago when I asked him about his cropping plans for the year. He said, "It's election year, so it is soya beans wall to wall". The political point was made even more graphically by Congressman Larry Combest, Chairman of the House Agricultural Committee, who said, "This Bill is for rural America. It is not for rural Canada. It is not for rural Europe. It is for rural America".
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para8"></a>However, it would be unfair to belabour the USA for taking electoral considerations into account when formulating policy. Such attitudes are not unknown in other countries under all electoral systems. The 1996 Farm Bill was supposed to mark a change away from <P>


<a name="column_191"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 191</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>production support and direct payments to farmers. It was part of the reaction to "big government" and increased federal spending that was associated with Newt Gingrich. In fact, the severe economic plight of American farmers in the late 1990s led to substantial emergency payments totalling some 30 billion dollars in four years. That was spending over and above the 1996 authorisation.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para9"></a>The Agricultural Secretary, Ann Veneman, produced a remarkable justification for the proposed increased spending in the 2002 Farm Bill. She said that statements that farm programme support had ballooned by 70 per cent were not "the whole truth". Consideration of support levels for the farm sector should add in the emergency supplemental support provided in the past four years&#151;an additional 7.5 billion dollars each year. The new Farm Bill provides for roughly 7.4 billion dollars each year in new farm spending. Therefore, the new level of support merely adds to and codifies the amount of extra support already provided. That is moving the subsidy and the goalposts in some style.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para10"></a>There has been much comment on the likely effects of the Farm Bill on farm prices and on world trade in agricultural products. United States exports some 25 per cent of its agricultural products, worth about 53 billion dollars a year. It has been calculated that one-third of American planted acres are effectively for export.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para11"></a>It would be disingenuous to say the least that the system of support in the Farm Bill will not have an effect on prices. Crop support in the Bill takes three forms: fixed decoupled payments by which the farmer gets a set payment each year; loan deficiency payments, which are counter-cyclical since more is paid when prices are low and vice versa; new counter-cyclical payments, which make up the difference when the overall income of the farmer (for instance, the return from the market, plus the fixed, decoupled payment, plus the loan deficiency payment) falls below the target price.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para12"></a>The whole system bears a marked resemblance to the deficiency payment system which we abandoned in the 1970s. There are also complicated support systems for livestock products and for fruit and vegetables. Counter-cyclical payments effectively cancel market signals and they are a direct incentive to over-produce in terms of surplus and low prices. It was said&#151;and it was correct&#151;that one of the weaknesses of the system of deficiency payments which we had was that farmers were thereby detached from the market.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para13"></a>So farm support of this type in an economy where 25 per cent of the produce is exported effectively subsidies exports; it makes the US home market unattractive to potential importers and it ensures cheap raw materials for livestock feeders and food processors, and increase their competitive power.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para14"></a>But before we become over-critical of the American approach, it is only fair to point out the arguments which they produce in rebuttal, particularly as regards EU support policy. Their arguments come under the <P>


<a name="column_192"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>general heading of the mote in the US eye and the beam in the EU eye. They claim that their agricultural markets are relatively open with a 12 per cent average tariff on food and agricultural products. That compares with 59 per cent in Japan, 30 per cent in the Cairns Group, 30 per cent in Europe&#151;and 62 per cent as a global average.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para15"></a>There are many comparisons of the level of agricultural support in America and Europe and the protagonists tend to choose the measure which suits their argument best. The US and the EU farm-gate value of agricultural production is very similar: 197 billion dollars in the EU in 2000 and 190 billion dollars in the US.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para16"></a>The total support estimate in 2000 was 103.5 billion dollars in the EU and 92.3 billion dollars in the US&#151;again fairly similar figures. The total support estimate as a percentage of GDP was 1.32 per in the EU and 0.92 per cent in the US&#151;about 50 per cent less than in Europe. The greater number of full-time farmers in the EU means that producer support averaged 14,000 dollars per farmer in the EU and 20,000 dollars per farmer in the US.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para17"></a>I apologise for burdening your Lordships with those figures, but they illustrate the difficulty in making comparisons, and perhaps we in the EU should go a little steadily before we are too critical of the US. As my good friend Anthony Rose pointed out, the higher dependence of EU farmers on support is shown by the fact that producer support has ranged between 32 and 35 per cent of gross farm receipts in the EU compared with a range of 11 to 25 per cent in the US. Even with the extra emergency payments to US farmers, in the four years from 1998 to 2002 the level of support as a percentage of gross farm receipts was only two-thirds of EU levels.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para18"></a>Clearly those figures show that both the US and the EU provide substantial levels of support to their farmers. What has perhaps taken everyone aback is the brutally clear way that the Texan President Bush is prepared to look after the American farming interest when times are bad&#151;indeed, reversing the Bush administration criticism of the Farm Bill only last autumn. The American separation of powers is always described in terms of the judiciary, the legislature and the executive. I wonder if there is not in fact a fourth power&#151;the President himself and the state which is his political base.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para19"></a>As we all know, there is a good deal of concern as to whether the Farm Bill proposals will allow the US to keep within its WTO ceiling of 19.1 billion dollars per annum&#151;the specified support. The US claims that it can and it will. But it is not clear how the US can negotiate for a reduction in the WTO ceiling and at the same time keep its word to its farmers. I should perhaps point out that the 19.1 billion dollar ceiling of WTO specified support compares with 62 billion dollars for the EU, even though the total value of agricultural production is approximately the same in America and in Europe. However, it would be unwise to jump to too many conclusions too quickly. I am told that increases in the wheat price in Chicago in two days last week potentially saved 1 billion dollars in support.

<a name="20702-07_para20"></a>The authorisation to spend the money has to be cleared through the appropriation process each year. As we know, the Americans work on autumn to autumn, which is tied to the rural economy&#151;harvest to harvest&#151;for their appropriation process. It is probable that the money for 2002-03 is safe. But the money for 2003-04 and beyond will have to be approved each year. It will be interesting to see what happens when discussions on the budget take place in 2003&#151;it is not an election year&#151;and the US budget deficit could be 6 per cent of GDP (with EU figures of around 3 per cent).

<A NAME="20702-07_spnew6"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   My Lords, it is a great pleasure for me to be able to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Carter, on having won the time for this debate, and particularly that he is the one who is leading your Lordships to address this timely and knotty question.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para24"></a>First, I declare my interest as somebody who is in agricultural production, and the trade in agricultural commodities affects my business.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para25"></a>Most of us had come to the perhaps erroneous conclusion that the US was driving the trade liberalisation agenda in the world, and the question which the US Farm Bill raises for us now is: why has the leopard changed its spots?
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para26"></a>It is certainly no news to your Lordships that agriculture and the supply of food has been a story of swings and roundabouts, between plenty and hunger, between poverty and wealth. America has followed that pattern as much as any country. But in 1980 a different farm crisis hit them.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para27"></a>There had been a period through the 1970s of strong commodity prices and export opportunities, coupled with high inflation and low interest rates. That encouraged farmers to over-invest, so that between 1970 and 1984 farm business debt nearly quadrupled. The economic conditions reversed in the early 1980s, with contracting export markets and input prices and interest rates which rose. Suddenly farm land values dropped by 27 per cent and it was not just the farmers who were going bankrupt but the rural banks, the savings and loan companies and anybody who had put money into that industry and lent against that security.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para28"></a>That shook the whole US property market and must be a pretty telling memory to anybody who is in government there. There has not been a comparable crash in any recent period in this country, unless the present combination of diseases and unfavourable exchange rates happens to trigger one.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para29"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, drew our attention to how the American farming industry has received increased supplementary payments in each of the past three years. I do not have any figures on where the present level of farm borrowing stands. Even so, the American Bankers Association survey found that the number of farm borrowers filing for bankruptcy doubled in 1998 and 1999 to 2 per cent of borrowers. It seems to me that that provides some background to the American perspective on farm aid before even considering the pressures of an autumn mid-term election.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para30"></a>At the same time, it is a timely reminder of the tangled web of farm support that exists across the world and the problems of disentangling it. No doubt the greatest worry is the subject of our debate today, the reform of trade. That is particularly so when one sees the emphasis being put on assistance to exports being provided at a higher level than existed under the previous omnibus FAIR Farming Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para31"></a>The pure market approach which the Americans often liked to promote was that, if we can produce things cheaper, we should be allowed to sell them in other people's markets. But the World Trade Organisation at its last meeting asked people to undertake to reduce export subsidies and reduce export quantities. I wonder whether the Minister in answering can give us any idea if much was achieved in that regard, before we even get into the question of what the United States will do with its present policy.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para32"></a>As various economists try to gain some understanding of what the likely outcome of these proposals is, there is already concern as to what any changes will mean to the rice farmers of Vietnam and Thailand. Perhaps even more vulnerable are the farmers in Japan, who are already heavily subsidised, probably up to their WTO ceiling, which is way above what anybody else receives. But I have heard that their real worry is that if their market were to be flooded with cheap rice, it would no longer be economic to maintain their traditional rice terraces and they would be faced with enormous erosion problems. So right away one is into a wholly different area than simply WTO negotiations.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para33"></a>It may be that we have to go an awful lot further down the road of environmental support and measures which do not lead to trade distortions before measures for freeing up trade can be truly effective.

I rarely intervene in debates these days as there are so many able and younger people than myself. But I could not resist the temptation when I saw the Unstarred Question and realised who the questioner was. He has asked a most important <P>


<a name="column_195"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>question. The Government's reply will arouse great interest, not only in this country and in Europe but generally in the world. I remind your Lordships of the question: what effect the American Farm Bill will have on proposals for the reform of trade in agricultural products.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para34"></a>In many quarters in the United States the American Farm Bill is regarded as yet another manifestation of an increasingly unilateral approach by the United States of America. I think that there is a broader context to the Bill. Incidentally, the term "unilateral approach" was first used to me in reference to the American attitude by American friends of mine, not by British or European friends. They were concerned at the increasing manifestation in their own country that the United States should look at its own interests and no one else's.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para35"></a>The Bill's purpose is to subsidise exports from the United States. It goes a long way to making sure that the export is of such a nature that the American farmers&#151;and no doubt the supporters of President Bush&#151;will benefit greatly from it. If the United States does not pay regard to the effect of the Bill, it has the potential to undermine eventually the solidity of the Atlantic Alliance or the Western Alliance. It tends to undermine the progress that we have made&#151;carefully and sometimes unsuccessfully&#151;over the past half-century and more in the direction of a multilateral and a global approach to many of these problems.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para36"></a>As a hugely dominant military power it is understandable, even if regrettable, that the United States takes an increasingly unilateral approach in military matters, believing that it leads to incisive action. One can understand that approach, although one may have grave doubts about it.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para37"></a>As the events of the last few months, which have been underlined in the past fortnight, have shown, the USA's economic dominance is not so great. It has a vulnerable economy too. The farm Bill can lead in the States to an accentuation of trade wars. So far as concerns grain, America is in a dominant position, which is rivalled only by countries such as Canada and so on. But we need an approach to this problem that is shared at the very least between Western Europe, the United States and Canada.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para38"></a>One hopes that the Prime Minister, when he meets President Bush, will seek to ensure that there are talks on the matter and on the broader implications of this move. The great danger with the Prime Minister is that he sometimes regards himself as an emissary for the United States. I believe that he should think much more deeply about the matter and about the implications for the global economy as well as for this country.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para39"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, was absolutely right to say that we in the European Union have had our own form of protectionism. Indeed, I was one of the upholders of the common agricultural policy. Years ago it seemed to me that were it not for the common agricultural policy there would have been a great exodus from the countryside into the towns and cities, <P>


<a name="column_196"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>especially in Italy, France, Germany and so on. It probably made a major contribution in ensuring that the Communist Parties, which were so strong in those countries, did not obtain a dominant position.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para40"></a>The reply today will be an indication of how the Government are looking at the matter. Are they looking at it as merely a matter of American interest and they have nothing to say about it, or do they appreciate that the Bill in the United States has enormous implications for the global economy and for Europe?

<P>
<A NAME="20702-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williamson of Horton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for raising the issue of the new US Farm Bill today. It is a significant change in United States' agricultural policy and hence, because of the possible domino effect on international trade negotiations on US trade policy generally, I am critical of the Bill which the Washington Post described in a headline on 2nd May as, "This Terrible Farm Bill". However, I recognise some US impatience with the slow pace of change in our own agricultural policy. I shall make a brief comment on that first in order to set in perspective the battle of the giants or, worse still, the stalemate of the giants.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para41"></a>We do not yet know what will be the outcome of the consideration by European Union Ministers of the mid-term review of the agricultural policy which the Commission is putting forward. But what we do know is that although the pace of the reform already implemented or agreed is too slow, the direction of the reform is generally good. First, we have, to a large degree, changed the mechanism of internal market support&#151;where it exists at all&#151;into a safety net system rather than a rigid public intervention system, and thus the infamous butter mountains and other phenomena have long since vanished.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para42"></a>Secondly, we have acted directly on reducing support prices or taking decisions to reduce them in the future. Consumers have been the beneficiaries of these changes; taxpayers less so because direct grants have played a bigger role. We have moved a long way from a managed market towards a normal market system, at least within the European Union itself, although we still have substantial external protection.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para43"></a>Thirdly, European Union export subsidies are becoming less and less important, falling from 25 per cent of the value of farm exports in 1992 to 5 per cent today.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para44"></a>Fourthly, we have made an important start on conservation, environmental and rural development programmes.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para45"></a>I now look at the American Farm Bill. First, it is a change of direction. It reverses the market-driven reforms initiated in the 1996 Farm Bill. It is true that Congress has added extra spending to that Bill in the intervening years. But the new Bill goes a long way from the earlier objective of market-driven and declining support.
<P>


<a name="column_197"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para46"></a>Secondly, there is the massive scale of US agricultural support. Total direct spending in the new Bill is 273.9 billion dollars over the six years&#151;2002-07. Of this total, 51.7 billion dollars is new spending above the March 2002 deadline. I recognise that included here is important expenditure on food and nutrition programmes which may not always be considered as agricultural support. But, none the less, direct support to US farmers is large.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para47"></a>The farm gate value, as we know, produced by agriculture in the US and the European Union is about the same, although the European Union has over 7 million farms and the US has about 2 million. What is the best measure of total support in the US and the EU? For myself, I find the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development total support estimate for the year 2000 interesting, because it was published before the present US Bill. It shows some difference favourable to the United States, but the cost per head for the citizen was 338 dollars a year in the United States of America and 276 dollars in the European Union&#151;both are too high, of course.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para48"></a>Thirdly, the new US subsidies are closely related to products and are likely to encourage production. Crops are now supported by three types of subsidy: the fixed subsidy each year for each crop, which is higher than existing payments and is not decreasing; loan deficiency payments, which are in effect the difference between a fixed price&#151;the loan rate&#151;and the local market price; and a new subsidy that will top that up where necessary to a target price. That is broadly the system that was eliminated in the 1996 Bill. Now it returns.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para49"></a>Thus, for wheat, there is a fixed subsidy of 19 dollars 11 cents a tonne; a loan rate of 102 dollars 88 cents; and a target price of 141 dollars 83 cents. There are big bucks here. There will also be a new subsidy for dairy farmers dependent on price and a continuation of intervention buying for skimmed milk powder or cheese. For sugar, there is high protection against imports and a public purchasing programme will continue.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para50"></a>Fourthly, there is an increase in direct support for export measures. The market access promotion programme rises progressively from 90 million to 200 million dollars a year.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para51"></a>Fifthly, and finally, I comment on the effect on developing countries. The European Union is the world's biggest market for imports of agricultural goods from developing countries&#151;about 75 per cent higher than developing country exports to the US. However, the US exports far more to developing countries, and will probably export even more given the impact of its export measures. President Bush described those measures as generous. Looked at from within the USA, they probably were; looked at from here, they present an unhappy picture for British farmers and international trade.

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>shall not spend valuable time criticising the political process that led to the enactment of the Farm Bill. I want instead to discuss its impact on poor countries. Suffice it for me to cite with approbation the opening paragraph of an editorial in the Washington Post of 14th May:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Yesterday Mr Bush signed a farm bill that represents a low point in his presidency&#151;a wasteful corporate welfare measure that penalizes taxpayers and the world's poorest in order to bribe a few voters".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-07_para52"></a><P>

<a name="20702-07_para53"></a>I acknowledge that some Senators and Congressmen&#151;even some Republicans from the Midwest&#151;said that the price tag was too high at a time of returning budget deficits and the war on terrorism, and that it was tailored more to parochial election-year interests than to the farm economy's long-range needs. Well, good for them. But as we all know, the Bill's impact ranges far beyond the interests of the American farm economy.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para54"></a>At Doha, poor countries agreed to negotiate in part because of promises by the Bush Administration that a top priority for the talks would be the phasing out of subsidies and other moves to increase access for poor country agricultural products in rich country markets. But this Farm Bill makes it much tougher to overcome the resistance of farmers in countries such as France to giving up their subsidies. The immediate reaction of Canada's agriculture Minister was to say that his Government was considering increasing aid to Canadian farmers to counter the new American subsidies.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para55"></a>US policymakers counter that, if and when they emerge from the World Trade Organisation Round in 2004 with a satisfactory agreement, American farmers will be happy to exchange their new subsidies for market-opening concessions by other countries. To that, I can say only, "Oh, really?" It is more likely that this six-year Farm Bill will be renewed in one form or another whatever happens in the Doha Round. Once extended, government benefits are hard to withdraw. In 1986 President Reagan tried to trim subsidies and the Republicans lost control of the Senate.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para56"></a>The immediate losers, of course, are the developing countries. Agricultural subsidies in developed countries are now at a worldwide level of about 350 billion dollars per year. The EU has also rightly been in the dock over that issue. As the president of the World Bank recently noted, that is seven times what countries spend on development assistance and is roughly equivalent to the entire gross domestic product of Sub-Saharan Africa. Those trade-distorting subsidies are crippling Africa's chance to export its way out of poverty.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para57"></a>Of course, African countries need to follow through on the New Partnership for Africa's Development agenda. In particular, internal barriers to trade and investment that limit the ability of African farmers to market their goods must be removed. But without a level international playing field, they are simply doomed.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para58"></a>It is not just a matter of reducing and eventually removing those subsidies. The US collects in tariffs about half a billion dollars a year from poor country <P>


<a name="column_199"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exporters, roughly 11 per cent of the value of those exports. Escalating tariffs that peak with processed agricultural goods are huge barriers to the exporting of Africa's processed products. The US has the highest tariff peaks of any major market. They are 76 times as high as the average tariff.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para59"></a>In Sub-Saharan Africa, the figure is only five times as high as the average. World Bank research&#151;I am grateful to the bank for supplying me with it&#151;shows that if the US were to eliminate tariff peaks on the exports of the 49 poorest countries, their exports would rise by about 1.1 billion dollars per annum.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para60"></a>The value of the EU's "Everything But Arms" proposal is, of course, diminished by delayed implementation for bananas, rice and sugar, but it is certainly a step in the right direction that goes farther than has any other rich market.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para61"></a>I conclude by returning to the Farm Bill and taking a typically pernicious example of its impact. Cotton production in the CFA franc zone countries of West and Central Africa has increased fourfold in the last two decades, making the region the world's second largest cotton exporter with a 13 per cent share of world exports. Cotton is the main cash crop and the largest source of export receipts and government revenues in several countries of the region. Its cultivation employs more than 2 million rural households and is hence a key factor in poverty reduction.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para62"></a>Removal of US subsidies on that one crop alone would increase revenues from cotton in the region by about 250 million dollars a year. But, of course, the Farm Bill increases subsidies to American cotton producers in the Republican Party's southern base. If world cotton prices were not further depressed, as they must surely be by those subsidies, the number of people living in poverty in Burkina Faso, according to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, could be cut in half within six years. Subsidies account for about one-third of the 35,000 dollar average annual income of US cotton farmers. The per capita income in Burkina Faso is less than a dollar a day.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para63"></a>That is a fair measure of the perniciousness of the Bill. The irony is that America's future farmers will suffer as subsidies push up land values and rentals, meaning higher costs for new farmers, while overproduction depresses prices. It is a short-sighted, selfish Bill that sends entirely the wrong messages and does the United States Administration and Congress no credit.

<A NAME="20702-07_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Carter, has done the House a service by asking this Question, which is timely. We have moved an awfully long way from the euphoria of last November's Doha meeting, which inaugurated a new world trade liberalisation round&#151;proclaimed as it was as the economic response to the atrocity of the attacks <P>


<a name="column_200"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 200</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on New York and Washington. Nothing has moved us further away from that euphoria than this US Farm Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para64"></a>First, there were the protectionist measures on steel. Now we have this extension of subsidies on a wide range of agricultural products&#151;an extension, moreover, linked to production levels, not decoupled from them, which would have been much less damaging. The rhetoric of trade liberalisation remains, as the Administration struggles to obtain fast-track negotiating authority, but of its practice and substance little is left. That is a bad prospect for all those who believe that freer trade should be the motor of the world economy.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para65"></a>Of course there is a quick and facile response from the other side of the Atlantic: "Who are you in Europe, with your common agricultural policy, to be pointing a finger at us?". I call that point facile not because there is no truth in it&#151;the CAP is indeed protectionist&#151;but because it in no way excuses a major move by the United States in the wrong direction and, further, because the Americans are pulling the rug from under the feet of those in Europe who want fundamental reform of the CAP.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para66"></a>Of the many tears being shed in Europe about the Farm Bill, we can be sure that plenty will be of the crocodile variety, shed by those who will soon be arguing in Brussels that the EU cannot possibly be expected to make a contribution to the new trade round when the Americans are behaving as they are. That is an additional cross that those who want to see the CAP reformed must now bear.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para67"></a>Does it all matter very much? It matters quite a lot. If this trade round is to succeed&#151;if it is to reach an agreed conclusion at all&#151;it must offer more and deliver more to developing countries than earlier rounds have done. How are we to do that, if we do not give them better access for their agricultural goods to our markets and if we do not cut back on the subsidisation of our agricultural exports, which are undermining their farmers' production? If we add to that the disillusionment of key trading partners such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina and Brazil, which depend crucially on highly competitive agricultural exports, we will find that we have a witches' brew that could all too easily poison the Doha negotiations as a whole, and thus deeply and negatively affect the economic prospects of the whole world.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para68"></a>What is to be done? One answer&#151;far and away the preferable one&#151;is for the European Union to do what I would call taking a leaf out of its Kyoto book. By that I mean that we should not be deterred by this setback, but should work up a genuinely liberalising agricultural trade package, based on serious reform of the CAP. That should be put on the table at Geneva as our contribution, albeit a conditional one requiring reciprocity. In that way, the European Union would, for the first time, give a lead in agricultural trade instead of playing its usual role of reluctant and grudging participant, producing concessions only under extreme pressure.

<a name="20702-07_para69"></a>Once such an offer is on the World Trade Organisation negotiating table, we will soon see pressure being put on the United States both by the developing countries and by major developed country agricultural exporters to remedy the damage that has been done by the Farm Bill. I hope that the Minister will say that that is our objective and our intention.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-07_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Brittan of Spennithorne: </B>   My Lords, the effect of the American Farm Bill on the proposals for reform of trade in agriculture has, simply, been devastatingly damaging. Indeed, it risks being a body blow to the whole Doha development round. I take no pleasure in saying that. I say it with great sadness, because further liberalisation of trade generally&#151;not just in agriculture&#151;is in the interests of the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United States. Properly handled, it is also in the interests of the developing world.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para70"></a>To achieve that liberalisation, the closest co-operation between the European Union and the United States is essential. I was fortunate enough to achieve that with Mickey Kantor to conclude the Uruguay round. My successor, Pascal Lamy, was able to achieve it to launch the Doha development round. Long before I took over the negotiations in the Uruguay round on behalf of the EU at the beginning of 1993, the US and the Cairns Group had orchestrated a loud chorus demanding the elimination of trade-distorting subsidies. In spite of huge resistance in certain quarters of the EU, we were, in the end, able to achieve consensus on taking a major first step in that direction.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para71"></a>In 1996, the EU unfurled the banner of trade liberalisation afresh and called for a comprehensive new trade round. Once again, the US focused almost exclusively on agriculture. We argued for something much broader. Two years later, at Doha, the round was finally launched, but it was a fragile launch, much assisted by the universal desire, after 11th September, to do something positive for the world economy. The developing world reluctantly set aside its doubts, as much as anything because of a belief that the barriers that its main exports&#151;agricultural products&#151;faced would fall significantly at last. This year, we have all been dealt not one body blow but two. First, there was steel, and then there was the Farm Bill. Both have caused deep resentment in the developed and developing worlds alike. It is not the comparative magnitude of support that matters but the direction in which the major trading blocs are going.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para72"></a>For crops alone, the Bill means an increase of 15 billion to 20 billion dollars a year. That is an increase of 70 to 80 per cent. Over 10 years, it will amount to 180 billion dollars. It will aid farmers in a highly production-distorting way. The loan deficiency payments change the price of exports, which will be subsidised on the world market. Changing prices at home will make things more difficult for exporters to the United States and destroy the competitive advantage of developing countries.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para73"></a>The Bill is also likely to break WTO rules. Fixed payments, loan programme payments and countercyclical payments are crop-specific payments and are limited by the WTO commitment. The US is likely to exceed the 19.1 billion dollars per annum to which it is limited for such payments. In addition, the dairy levy on imported milk is likely to score as a tariff and would be permissible only if the United States were to give other countries equivalent concessions. There is scant sign of that.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para74"></a>Under the Bill, the Agriculture Secretary has the power to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"make adjustments to the maximum extent practicable"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-07_para75"></a>
to prevent a breach of WTO commitments. That is the fig-leaf behind which he hides. It is not, however, a credible position. How will he forecast an overshoot? Will he seriously get farmers to repay money paid to them in order to bring the US into compliance with the WTO requirements?
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para76"></a>The sadness in all this is the irony that the Bill should have been announced just a few weeks before the EU Commission was due to come up with an unexpectedly dramatic, radical and welcome proposal for reform of CAP. There would be a massive elimination of trade-distorting subsidies. That coincidence in time is not just irony, it is a tragedy. It is a double whammy. The Farm Bill will have a devastating effect on the developing world's support for the Doha round. With the steel measures, it completely destroys the US's credibility as a joint leader in trade liberalisation and a partner whom we in the EU badly need.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para77"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, rightly said, the Bill also makes it infinitely more difficult for Franz Fischler to get the Commission's reform proposals through. French opposition is already virulent, even before the proposals have been formally announced. Now, such opponents have a wonderful pretext for saying, "No. Why should we go through the pain of reform when the US is going in exactly the opposite direction?". We must, none the less, insist that it be done, for the reasons that the noble Lord gave.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para78"></a>With the Farm Bill, the US is in the process of destroying what it has striven for a generation to achieve, just when success was in sight, because the EU was going in the direction that the US had previously pointed. I hope that, ultimately, it will not be too late for wiser counsels in Washington to prevail.

<A NAME="20702-07_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Haskins: </B>   My Lords, I have spent the past several months wandering around Europe and North America&#151;both in Canada and the United States&#151;discussing the issues. I share all the concerns expressed by noble Lords about the alarming implications for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para79"></a>I agree particularly with the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, that the issue goes wider than agriculture. It is a wider issue than steel. It concerns a sudden unilateral decision to make a pre-emptive strike, undermining the approach to defence and NATO that we have taken for 60 years. It relates to unilateral decisions <P>


<a name="column_203"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about recognising the democratically elected leader of the Palestinian state. It relates to the unilateral refusal to sign the Kyoto treaty and the refusal to co-operate on the International Criminal Court. It is a sort of John Wayne or Wild West approach to policy making, and it will not do.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para80"></a>Such moves put serious pressure on America's relations with its allies and friends, never mind its adversaries. Frighteningly, such unilateralism can lead to a form of isolationism. That would be as much a disaster for the United States as it would be for the rest of the world. We must remember that only 50 per cent of Congressmen hold a passport&#151;so their perspectives are not exactly international when it comes to these issues. But those attending the summit in Canada last week were especially horrified by this development and by the possibility of what it may do to the NAFTA agreement. The Canadian Minister of Agriculture told me that some compensation for farmers has been announced which, it is claimed, is consistent with what Mr Fischler is attempting to do in Europe.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para81"></a>Turning to Mr Fischler, it is tragic that this should happen when, for the first time in 40 years, we appear to be about to make a radical breakthrough in terms of the Commission's proposals on agricultural reform. I believe that Mr Fischler is moving in the right direction and the proposals must get the support of everyone in Europe. There are too many reservations, even in Britain. I recommend that when Mr Fischler's proposals are published next week the Government should give them huge and constant support. We should make sure that we do not get bogged down in the nitty-gritty. It is a vital presumption ahead of the enlargement of Europe. There are agreements in principle, and all the participant members have signed up to 25 of the 30 chapters that are outstanding on enlargement. The only chapter to which none has signed up is the one on agriculture and food. We must have the Fischler agreement in place to enable us to talk to our friends in the enlargement countries by October. Time is against us.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para82"></a>It follows that time is against us on Doha. We have to come to terms with an agreement in Doha next March. I plead strongly with the Government to support the Fischler recommendations when they are published. They are an essential basis for both of those great historic proposals to go forward.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para83"></a>We must be patient with the United States and not resort to tit-for-tat action. We do not have time for it, and it would be improper. We must hope that common sense will prevail in the United States. I have met many people in the United States who are quite ashamed of what is going on at the present time and who are looking for opportunities to change it. Oddly enough, I see the best hope in a bizarre alliance of the NGOs, who are obviously concerned about how world trade is going to develop. They are misled in some ways, but their interests are the interests of the developing world. The NGOs are coming together with the constitutionalists who believe that 1775 did matter. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Sometimes I look at the Attorney-General in the United States and wonder whether he has read the Constitution and whether he adheres to it.

<a name="20702-07_para84"></a>Finally, there is big business itself. Someone in a large multinational told me the other day that he trades in 121 countries. It is not in the interests of American big business to allow this isolationism to develop. I am pretty confident that American business will see the foolishness of the Administration's ways and begin to apply pressure on it.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para85"></a>Finally, I hope that the President himself will listen rather more to his father and to the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and reject the populist and self-destructive jingoism of his Vice-President, his Defence Secretary and the Attorney-General in particular.

<A NAME="20702-07_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Palmer: </B>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for initiating this important debate and must declare an interest as someone who tries to farm in the Scottish Borders. I am also a residual beneficiary of a banana plantation in the West Indies. After so many distinguished contributions, not surprisingly I have crossed out almost all of what I had intended to say&#151;much, I am sure, to your Lordships' relief.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para86"></a>The US Government's support for this Bill is a significant change in direction, both from their policy position outlined last year and from the previous Farm Bill. It will have serious implications for farming around the world. Among others&#151;as indeed was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Carter&#151;the Cairns Group has condemned it, suggesting that the size of the subsidies will have a damaging impact world-wide on agriculture. Sadly, I fear that it will provide comfort for those WTO members which are determined to resist meaningful reform of the agricultural sector.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para87"></a>The Bill incorporates large increases in expenditure, with spending on commodity support up by around 70 per cent. Total funding available for farm spending was set at approximately 170 billion dollars for the next decade. However, it must not be forgotten that the original cost was calculated on the basis of over-optimistic estimates of commodity prices.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para88"></a>It is important to bear in mind that, by comparison, direct payment rates for wheat in the United Kingdom were worth around £35 a tonne last year. Intervention prices are currently around £70 a tonne. As such, the sum of intervention and direct payments is broadly similar to the total level of support available in the United States. However, the European Union intervention system is subject to quality requirements, so the effective level of support available for EU grain is lower than that indicated by the intervention price. In contrast, all US grain qualifies for the target price level of support, regardless of quality.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para89"></a>Notwithstanding the dramatic increases in the level of support brought about by the Farm Bill, the US continues, ironically, to champion free trade. It continues also to point at others, notably the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>European Union, arguing that complaints about the US Farm Bill are simply an effort to deflect attention from their own policies, or lack of.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para90"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, mentioned this and it is worth repeating. In regard to this Bill, the chairman of the House Agricultural Committee emphasised:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-07_para91"></a>As a direct descendant of an American President, albeit an assassinated one, I find these words somewhat chilling.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para92"></a>I am always criticising my children when they use the expression "unfair", but it really is extraordinary the difference between the US and the EU attitudes towards agriculture. Perhaps I may ask the Minister exactly what representations have been made to the US Government in respect of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para93"></a>Here in the United Kingdom, our agriculture industry is in real crisis and all of us involved in it look to the Minister to give us a guiding hand. He will not be surprised that once again, I believe for the 16th time on the Floor of the House, I am asking him to look at the role that biofuels can play in helping to restore farming margins and in helping to meet Her Majesty's Government's commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. It must make sense and I beg of him to seize this opportunity now before it is too late.

<A NAME="20702-07_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Carter, on introducing the debate. I shall not mince my words. I believe that the American negotiators have played a lot of kidology over the years in relation to this issue. It is my belief that this Bill bucks the bronco of the markets in world trade in farmed commodities. The noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, once said, "You can't buck the market". But that is precisely what the Bill will do. It is the Republicans who are doing it for short-term gain in the autumn elections, particularly in the Mid-West. It bucks the US budget. It bucks the EU CAP and Agenda 2000. It bucks the Cairns Group in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and other countries; and it certainly bucks the third world.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para94"></a>The Bill ignores the crucial principles of supply and demand economics. Higher prices equal more production, which equals a surplus over demand. Through deficiency payments and target prices, without a cap on quantity and without set-aside, it will encourage larger USA farmers to produce more, with support for exports as well. It will result in the over-production in the US of farm commodities. Secondly, it will lower farm commodity prices on world markets. Thirdly, it will undermine farm incomes in the rest of the developed world and many will have to give up farming as a result. Finally, it will decimate third world farmers and increase poverty. There will be an exodus from the land and all the consequences that that will bring.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para95"></a>The alternative arguments in the United States supporting the Bill are just plain baloney&#151;to use a good American word. The Washington Post said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The most likely scenario is that in two years we will be overwhelmed by surplus agricultural production, low commodity prices and excessive government payments. We will have lost cases before the World Trade Organization, and government outlays will exceed budget limits. We will be forced to cut benefits or rewrite this legislation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-07_para96"></a>That is an American comment on its own Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para97"></a>We have heard the figures and I do not want to go over too many, but the 180 billion US dollars is equal to one third of the whole UK budget for one year. We should recognise the enormity of that. The increases in state payments by 70 per cent will inevitably lead to the breaking of the WTO rules, despite many US contrary claims.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para98"></a>Doha reform proposals will be undermined and the US is speaking with forked tongue on many of these issues. The contributions of the noble Lords, Lord Brittan, Lord Haskins and Lord Hoosan, show that this is a serious matter for the world at present. It undermines confidence in world trade. Of course the conservation budget will go up by 80 per cent. I could quote from the pages that I have with me, but I do not have time to do so. It will be devastating for smaller family farms in the United States.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para99"></a>By contrast, the Freedom to Farm Bill 1996 tried to wean farms with reduced support. As we know, prices collapsed and farmers had to be bailed out to the tune of 30 billion dollars. The basis of EU policy is much more enlightened. The reductions in production support focused on food safety and quality, rural development and environmental services. I believe that Mr Fischler has many problems and he needs maximum support at present. The question is whether this policy will be sustainable in the EU when confronted by the US Farm Bill. If world prices for basic commodities collapse and they cannot be sustained, production in the EU will be under threat. There is no doubt about that. The CAP reforms may not be carried through successfully and when that is addressed in relation to the enlargement of the EU, it looks like a doomwatch scenario. The impact on farming in the UK, with higher prices in the US, will cause immense problems for UK farmers whose incomes are already really low.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para100"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hoosan, said, we need to take a wider view. When we consider the current unilateral behaviour of the Americans, such as their spurning of the International Court, their threat to withdraw troops from Bosnia, the accountancy frauds, and now the impact of this Farm Bill coming over the horizon, it is vital that the Government represent our feelings to the United States and that wiser counsel prevails.

<A NAME="20702-07_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for giving us the opportunity to debate this important issue tonight. I am sure that he has been well rewarded by the quality and depth of the <P>


<a name="column_207"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>speeches made by all noble Lords. Before I continue, I remind noble Lords of my own family's farming interests.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para101"></a>This American Farm Bill is the wrong Bill at the wrong time and it sends out the wrong messages. It is deeply unfortunate as it comes at such a crucial time in the negotiating cycle that is taking place in the EU and globally.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para102"></a>I looked at the conservation measures that are contained in the American Farm Bill, which envisages spending 26 billion dollars over the next six years for stewardship and 254 million dollars over the next six years for grasslands. Those are both new provisions. At the same time, funding for the environmental quality incentive programme will rise from 200 million dollars to 1.35 billion dollars. Further rises are promised for the conservation reserve, the wetlands reserve and for farmland protection. I think that some of us share those objectives.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para103"></a>However, by far the greatest expenditure is the rise foreshadowed in the Bill&#151;an extra 37.6 billion dollars over six years for commodity support, to which all noble Lords have referred.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para104"></a>Even so, we should acknowledge that despite these new financial commitments, the United States spends less in support of its farmers than we do in the EU. I mention that only because the Americans will remind us of that when we come to negotiations. Having acknowledged that fact, we are now in the position that Europe is moving away from commodity support at the very time that the US is moving back in that direction. It seems likely that in future WTO discussions the expression "creative accounting" will come to the fore. It is not welcome, and it will acquire a whole new meaning. As other noble Lords have said, stalemate must not be allowed to prevent more liberalisation of trade. Nor must we let the Americans become isolated. We all need each other and we all need to move the reform programme forward.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para105"></a>United States farm prices are low. Farm prices are low world-wide, including in this country. Low farm prices usually reflect low demand, so an oversupply situation arises. United States aid, tied to US supply, will be used to deliver the surplus crops to those countries whose people are hungry. Unfortunately, it has been shown that the effect of dumping low priced goods in a developing country is to price the local producer out of the market. He then stops producing altogether and the aid, which is made with the best intentions, makes the position worse.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para106"></a>No debate about farming would be complete without some reference to the agricultural catastrophe that is happening in Africa, where, according to the World Food Programme, more than 5 million people are starving or are about to starve in Zimbabwe alone and where 13 million people in the whole of southern Africa could need feeding. Drought is often blamed but sadly in Zimbabwe, the difficulties are man-made. It is a country that has hitherto fed itself and its African neighbours. Even if the G8 countries fulfil their Doha commitment to help African agriculture <P>


<a name="column_208"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>through improved market access and the reduction of export subsidies, the effort will be wasted unless action is taken to rebuild the essential infrastructure of good government and effective farming.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para107"></a>In a world where some countries such as ours are blessed with food in plenty, while in others millions die from starvation, a solution must be found urgently. Is it right that we continue to give surplus food, in what some regard as "philanthropic dumping", if there are opportunities for some of those countries to be helped to produce more food themselves? Surely that is more important than giving them our excess food.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para108"></a>Farming in the UK is at a crossroads, and we have had many debates in the House about where we see the future in farming. For many the outlook is bleak. Profit&#151;a word that we have not used tonight&#151;is something that all want to achieve. These coming months are crucial to us all, including the United Kingdom Government, the European Parliament and the WTO. The inclusion and encouragement of developing countries must be allowed to proceed.

<a name="20702-07_para109"></a>We must not duck the basic challenge to find solutions to these world-wide problems which have been clearly identified in the debate. Much courage, persuasion and encouragement will be needed. I hope that the Government put their full weight behind the negotiations that will continue to take place at the European level and into the WTO talks that are to be held shortly. I also hope that they put the future of our own people and, more importantly, those in developing countries at the top of those talks.

<A NAME="20702-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Carter for initiating this debate. It marks a change in our relationship. For five years, as Chief Whip, he told me what to do and now he asks me what the Government are to do. He has also managed to achieve a debate with a high degree of consensus in the House. Although that is general on trade issues, it is regrettably rare on agricultural issues. The Government concur with much of what has been said.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para110"></a>The situation is sad. As the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, and the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, pointed out, for many years the United States has been the advocate and the driver of liberalisation in trade, including agricultural trade. In the Uruguay round, the United States pressed the hardest for agricultural policies to be liberalised world-wide. Within the European Union, the United Kingdom has been its best supporter and began to bring the European Union along that road. No other sector of world trade is more distorted than agriculture, and therefore in greater need of liberalisation. It is clear, to answer the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, that we do not regard this as an internal US matter. It is of supreme global importance.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para111"></a>The Uruguay round was progress. We have made some advance. In answer to the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, the US has stopped its use of direct <P>


<a name="column_209"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>export subsidies, although it still uses export credits and food aid in the same direction. The EU has reduced export subsidies by a quarter, which is a start, but we need to build on that. In 1995, at the end of the Uruguay round, we committed ourselves to a continuing programme of reductions in agricultural support, which distorted trade. No country fought harder for that than the United States.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para112"></a>Therefore, it was with some dismay that the Government greeted the news of the Farm Bill. Yes, we know that that is probably not the American Administration's starting position, and that much internal American politics has been involved in it. Yes, we accept that the American Administration remains committed to liberalisation through the Doha round. I also accept the various points that have been made that the Americans will face budgetary problems, as my noble friend Lord Carter has said, but there is much opinion in the American media, as the noble Lords, Lord Haskins and Lord Hooson, have said. Both the noble Lords, Lord Livsey and Lord Grenfell, quoted the Washington Post.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para113"></a>There is much American opposition to this approach. For the moment it is damaging. It represents a reversion to old forms of production and to linked subsidies of the kind that we thought that the United States had abandoned after 1995. It will mean direct commodity support of over 50 billion dollars. It will also be counter-productive. Although as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, indicated, there had been previous reversals of the 1995-96 position by emergency aid, that was post facto. In this case, American farmers are virtually guaranteed the money and, therefore, will make their production decisions on that basis. Precisely because American farmers are being given this form of security, as my noble friend Lord Carter said, the Bill is likely to create the very downward pressure on prices that in internal American terms it allegedly seeks to offset.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para114"></a>Subsidies of this kind are frankly circular and futile. The more they try to protect American farmers from falling markets, the more they contribute to further holes in those same markets. That eventually will be devastating to American farmers and, in the process, very devastating to farmers in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para115"></a>However, there are some positive aspects. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, referred to the measures on conservation. There are also measures on nutrition and on R&D that we would support and which we would wish to see reflected in European approaches. The main core of the Farm Bill is backward looking. If the United States goes down that road, it will appear to have learned nothing from the progress made since the Uruguay round. As the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, implied, there are specific positions in the Bill, such as the dairy levy, which may be directly incompatible with WTO obligations. My information is that the economists are calculating that there is a 30 per cent chance that expenditure under the Farm Bill will exceed the WTO ceilings in total. That presents us with a very real problem in relation to the United States' commitment.
<P>


<a name="column_210"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para116"></a>More importantly, the United States does all this in a patently beggar-my-neighbour fashion. The neighbours most beggared by this are those countries of the developing world. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, spelt out the dire consequences and repercussions of that, as did my noble friend Lord Grenfell.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para117"></a>Together with other noble Lords I do not much like the Farm Bill. It has set us back a long way. However, there are some qualifications. The American subsidies, as noble Lords have said, are still lower than those in the European Union. Under the Farm Bill, as my noble friend Lord Carter has said, the PSE&#151;the producer subsidy equivalent&#151;which is the best measure of equivalent subsidy for the US, is forecast to rise to 60.5 billion euros in 2005. That is about two-thirds of the European level at the beginning of this period of the common agricultural policy.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para118"></a>It is true that in certain sectors, as the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, indicated, there is a closer equivalent and the balance possibly goes the other way, but the overall calculation is still that Europe has a bigger absolute form of subsidy for farming than does the United States. Therefore, we must hesitate before casting too many stones. Nevertheless, Europe is moving in the right direction and America is moving in the wrong direction.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para119"></a>All that, and the size of those subsidies as compared with the support that farming receives in developing countries and elsewhere, indicates the need for Europe and the United States to reduce production support. The European Union, and the United Kingdom in particular, has no intention of going down that road. The European Union has already committed itself to cuts in export subsidies, to tariffs and to cuts in domestic agricultural support. The mid-term review proposals on the reform of the CAP, to which I shall turn in a moment, also move us in that direction. Therefore, to answer the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, it is the intention of Europe as a whole, as well as the United Kingdom, to respond to the Farm Bill by taking a strong liberalising offensive in the WTO talks in Geneva.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para120"></a>Internally within Europe, next week Commissioner Fischler will unveil his proposals for CAP reform in the mid-term review. Although no one has seen the final paper, there have been a number of leaks, but I believe that the commissioner intends to be forward looking. I have been greatly heartened to hear the commissioner say in terms that the failings of the US Farm Bill are not an excuse for Europe to drag its heels on its own agricultural reform.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para121"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, had the right view, that whatever the details of that proposal, the strategy implied will certainly be in the right direction. Those who cling to the old CAP will try to seize on the Farm Bill to argue that the time is not right for Europe to be changing its own policies. Indeed, outside Europe others are already arguing that line, that we should go slow on the WTO negotiations that were launched so successfully in Doha. Developing countries throughout the world have also expressed <P>


<a name="column_211"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their repugnance at the signal that the Farm Bill sends to them and are taking what I hope are wrong messages that the Americans have abandoned the liberalising agenda. In our own contacts with the US Government we have been firm and deplored the way in which the Farm Bill gives comfort to those who oppose reform, as was evident in the Bali discussions and the approach to the World Summit on Sustainable Development. We have also emphasised the impact on developing countries. It is true that the world is entitled to expect better from America. Nevertheless, some of the feedback from our American contacts indicates a willingness to recognise a commitment to a long-term strategy of liberalisation and to the Doha process in particular.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para122"></a>At Doha last year, all members of the World Trade Organisation pledged to reach a new draft agreement by March next year. That deadline remains in place and we all are actively negotiating towards it. Therefore, there is no deadlock in Geneva. That process is continuing and that target remains for America as for us.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para123"></a>As for Europe, the case for reaching agreement is clear. We must move away from the traditional forms of CAP and encourage others to do so. Support based on high import barriers, expensive intervention schemes and subsidised exports does not serve European consumers, farmers and the environment well. We want land management support based on developing environmental outcomes, perhaps including the aspects to which the noble Lord, Lord <P>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column 212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Palmer, referred for support for bio-fuels. We do not want a policy that continues to be based on market-distorting interventions.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para124"></a>The European Commission has taken a strong approach to WTO negotiations. It has tabled strong and credible proposals and is pursuing them effectively. If that is not done, we risk starting a new cycle of trade wars. We should not underestimate that danger. Nevertheless, I believe that the WTO process will succeed and that the American Administration wishes to engage once more in the liberalising process. I had discussions with J.B. Penn, the deputy agriculture secretary, only last week.
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para125"></a>We have been firm in our contacts with the Americans. We have said that we deplore the Farm Bill and have told them that we want a change of approach by the Americans. I do not go as far as my noble friend Lord Haskins, who suggested that the Americans are moving towards a policy of total isolation, but the situation is very dangerous. We should not engage in tit for tat but must say to our American friends at all levels, "Practice what you preach. If you revert to the liberalising agenda, we will be the first in Europe to support you. If you continue down the present road, you risk not only your own liberalising agenda and principles but inflicting great harm on countries and populations that can least afford to be affected in that way".
<P>

<a name="20702-07_para126"></a>My thanks again to my noble friend Lord Carter for initiating the debate and to all noble Lords who contributed.

<a name="20702-08_para0"></a>Clause 13 [Information concerning adoption]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood </B>   moved Amendment No. 46:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 32, at end insert "and his department or any other government agency designated by him shall produce an annual report to Parliament detailing such statistics as are deemed relevant and reviewing progress made on the previous annual report"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-08_para1"></a><P>

<a name="20702-08_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: I rise to move Amendment No. 46 in the name of my noble friend Lady Barker and myself. The amendment is to subsection (5) of Clause 13, which is concerned with ensuring that statistical and other information can be obtained by the Minister from the adoption agencies themselves and the Magistrates', County and High Court officials. Subsection (5) says that the Minister may publish abstracts of this information. Our amendment adds a requirement for the department or some other agency to produce an annual report to Parliament containing relevant statistics and reviewing progress since the previous year, which, quite plainly, enlarges upon the original requirement.
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para3"></a>We have put down this simple amendment for four reasons. First, the Government are committed to achieve a considerable increase in the numbers adopted in any year. Parliament and the public are entitled to know how much progress is being made. Secondly, there needs to be a greater understanding of the new processes of adoption and how they are bedding down. Thirdly, there is the general principle that transparency, openness and all these wonderful things aid enormously in a practical way in that they tend to prevent people making the same mistake twice. Finally, we want to ensure that this reporting back actually occurs, and we believe that this is best achieved by putting the Government's duty in respect of the matter of reporting to Parliament on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   The Government have much sympathy with the intention behind the amendment. We are all for openness, we are all for statistics being available so that progress can be monitored, and we are all for government being accountable. Under Clause 13 we already have the requirement for adoption agencies and courts to give the Minister statistical and other general information relating to adoption. The appropriate Minister can use that <P>


<a name="column_GC120"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information for statistical and other general purposes, such as for performance management. Subsection (5) enables the appropriate Minister to publish abstracts of that information.
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para4"></a>The intention of the amendment is, quite understandably, to enlarge the clause, as the noble Baroness said, to ensure that there is transparency and accountability, that performance management structures work and that the intention of the Bill comes to fruition.
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para5"></a>I would like to refer to what we have in terms of the four points that she made. In the Children Act report itself, which is an annual report, we have a section on adoption which brings together key analysis and information. It has a section relating to adoption statistics. The report for 2000 is currently available. The report for 2001 is just about to come out and includes, for example, information about the numbers and ages of children adopted from care, the time scales and the length of time taken to find adoptive placements. It also includes key judgments and messages from the inspections of councils' adoption services. So we have an annual report to Parliament which can also be used by practitioners and by people involved across the field in monitoring progress of that kind.
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para6"></a>It is our intention to continue to provide that information and, to pick up on what the noble Baroness said, certainly to make sure that the next annual report&#151;the one after the Bill becomes an Act in 2004&#151;will reflect the changes and the improvements that will have been made as a result of the Act. We are absolutely committed to that.
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para7"></a>One of the reasons for saying that the Children Act is a good vehicle is because it enables us to put adoption into the context of children's services as a whole and, alongside the protection of children&#151;children in care&#151;we can see what is being achieved through adoption. I commend that to the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para8"></a>In addition, there is a range of dynamic statistics available&#151;which, if the noble Baroness so requires, I will certainly write to her about&#151;which describe these issues. They are available to Parliament, on line, in the form of different reports and inspection agreements. In the light of the debate today I can assure the noble Baroness that the next Children Act report will take into account the points that she raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   On behalf of my noble friend, I thank the Minister for her answer. The reason for asking for this report in the amendment is that it has become clear throughout our debates so far that we are hampered by a lack of information about the current system of adoption. Furthermore, government policy making has been hampered to a large extent by a lack of information. For example, we talked the other day about the lack of a tracking system. As we have already noted in our debates, many of the children that we are talking about end up being a part of the statistics of a plethora of different services.
<P>


<a name="column_GC121"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para9"></a>The intention behind the amendment is to ensure that adoption in its widest sense had a locus for one coherent analysis. My fear is that given the diffusion of services at local level&#151;not only social services but also health and education services&#151;somewhere along the line what is happening in the adoption processes will be lost. Were we at a different stage of the Bill we might pursue this issue. But we are not and we will of course withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para10"></a>However, I urge the noble Baroness to think again about the need to look at adoption in its fullest sense and in a coherent fashion&#151;not in a way which is distinct and apart from other services, but with a very specific analysis. As we have noted time and time again in our debates, many things happen to children which, although not unique to adopted children, happen more to adopted children than to others. We are in danger of losing that somewhere along the line.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I will be very brief. I am not quite sure about this amendment because the issue seems to be whether there should be a mandatory obligation on the Minister to produce an annual report to Parliament. There is no issue about anything that any noble Lord has said so far. I agree with it all. However, I cannot for the life of me see why, looking at subsections (4) and (5), it is necessary to put a mandatory obligation on the Minister to produce a report to Parliament. He can do it within his own remit and no doubt will do what he wishes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   Perhaps I may ask a question which I put down as a Question for a Written Answer. I do not know whether it would come into a report of this kind. How many adopters have been rejected in each of the past five years? I hope to receive an answer from the official quarters quite soon, but I wondered whether it was the kind of thing that would be reported, or whether it was reported in the Children Act report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-08_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I am grateful for the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and the point is well taken. In relation to the question about information relating to adopters who are rejected, we do not have that information at present and, without taking further advice, I am unable to answer it. I see that there would be difficulties under any circumstances and systems of collecting that kind of information. Perhaps the noble Baroness will allow us to come back to her on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-08_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   Perhaps I may refer to an earlier discussion. The clause states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Each adoption agency must give to the appropriate Minister any statistical or other general information he requires about&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-08_para13"></a>Presumably, therefore, if the Minister requests information about the number of people who are rejected, the adoption agencies will be obliged to and will be able to provide that information.

<a name="20702-08_para14"></a>We have had an interesting discussion. I will read again what the Minister said in response to my original proposal and meanwhile I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20702-08_para17"></a>Clause 14 [Default power of appropriate Minister]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-08_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 47:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 34, leave out subsection (1) and insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-08_para18"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(1) If as a result of an independent review any local authority is found to have failed, without reasonable cause, to comply with any of the duties imposed on them by virtue of this Act or of section 1 or 2(4) of the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999 (c. 18), the appropriate Minister may make an order declaring that authority to be in default in respect of that duty."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20702-08_para19"></a>The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 47 modifies subsection (1) of Clause 14. Under the existing Clause 14, when a Minister determines that a local authority has failed to comply with its duties, either under the Bill or under the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999, he can make an order declaring the authority to be in default. That process seems to exist quite separately from the very significant independent review of determination provisions in Clause 12.
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para20"></a>The Bill is silent as to how the Minister might form the view that there is no requirement for him to consider the outcome of the independent review panels that he will set up. If there is to be an independent review process&#151;and we believe, as was debated the other day, that this should be stronger and more extensive than provided for in Clause 12&#151;it seems only logical that the review process is the best way to determine whether an authority is in default. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve.
<P>

<a name="20702-08_para21"></a>If the Minister is not minded to look with favour on the amendment, I hope that she will say how the Government expect the process of adoption to have failed before a default declaration is made. What other considerations will lead the Minister to such a decision? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I rise to support the amendment. It identifies a gap in the process and, in my opinion, fills it satisfactorily. But there is no doubt that there is such a gap.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   Clause 14 provides default powers for the appropriate Minister which are exercisable where a local authority has failed, without reasonable excuse, to comply with any of its duties imposed by the Bill or Sections 1 or 2(4) of the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para0"></a>It introduces a specific default power for adoption, modelled on Section 84 of the Children Act 1989, and brings it into this new adoption legislation. It replaces, in relation to adoption, the general default power currently provided by Section 7D of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. This is an aspect of the role of consolidation the Bill plays in relation to adoption as a whole.
<P>


<a name="column_GC123"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para1"></a>The appropriate Minister may make an order containing directions to ensure that the local authority complies with the duty within the period specified in the order.
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para2"></a>The noble Earl has addressed Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 to the absence of a link between the provisions in Clause 12 for the independent review mechanism and this clause. It appears that the intention is to ensure that where a failure comes to light as the result of an independent review, the appropriate Minister may make a default order.
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para3"></a>However, I suggest that the effect of the amendment is to narrow the scope of Clause 14. Perhaps I may explain why. Under Clause 14 the appropriate Minister may make a default order using any information that is available to him about a local authority's failure to comply with its duties. That information can come in a variety of ways. It could come through social services inspections reports, through the courts and, after April 2003, from the National Care Standards Commission which will be inspecting adoption authorities.
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para4"></a>We would also expect the independent review panel, which is set up under Clause 12, to inform the Minister when it becomes apparent that there is a serious failure on the part of a council. While one would not want to generalise, but one could imagine a range of serious failures in relation to the process of making adoption orders that could be based on previous bad practice. It is our expectation that the review will be looking out for such matters. The appropriate Minister could use that information when making a decision about whether to make a default order.
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para5"></a>These amendments would therefore restrict the appropriate Minister's flexibility to draw on all forms of information. They would permit him to exercise his default powers only where, as the result of an independent review, the local authority was found to have failed, without reasonable excuse, to discharge one of its duties. Such a restriction could not be justified. It is essential for the appropriate Minister to be able to exercise his default powers where he is aware of such a failure, regardless of the way the information reaches him.
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para6"></a>I also suggest that the amendments might make it more difficult for the Minister to intervene. The default power is intended to be used where there have been a number of failures on the part of the local authority. Not all cases of failure would, however, result in an application being made to the independent review panel. Not everyone, for example, would want an independent review. That would mean that the Minister would be presented with other forms of evidence that would not have been reflected in a review panel determination. I do not believe that that was the intention of the amendments, but this is the effect that they would have.
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para7"></a>I hope that I have been able to reassure Members of the Committee that the powers in Clause 14 are broad enough in scope for the Minister to make a default order using information about a local authority's <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   Our Amendment No. 48 is similar to Amendment No.47. I believe there are only a couple of words that are different. I suspect that part of the motivation behind the measure is inherent in the word "independent", as opposed to something which is just done by the Minister himself. It may be that the Minister's reply, if looked at in its entirety on a sheet of paper, will satisfy us that we have the independence that we require without necessarily going ahead with the amendment. We will have another look at it before a later stage of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-09_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   That was a very helpful reply from the Minister. The amendment was really designed to tease out how this process would work, and what the link would be between the independent review process and the Minister's own powers. I quite see that the amendment, albeit unintentionally, restricts the scope for action, and that is not, of course, what we would seek to place on the face of the Bill. I also recognise what the Minister said initially, that this is designed to reflect the model first used in the Children Act 1989, and of course there is an advantage in having that consistency.
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para8"></a>As the Minister will be aware, we feel that the independent review process needs to be broader in its own scope, but I take her point that whether or not that happens, the Minister's own ability to act should not be fettered, and what she has said will make the whole process much clearer. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20702-09_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to Chapter 3 of the Bill, which is a very important and quite lengthy chapter, dealing with placement for adoption and adoption orders. I would call Amendment No. 51 a probing amendment except that, of course, in Grand Committee all amendments really by definition are probing.
<P>

<a name="20702-09_para21"></a>The essence of this particular amendment is to discover precisely what the duties of an adoption agency are under Clause 17. What are the qualifications for the use of their powers under subsection (1)(a), or (b), when they are making a decision about placing a child for adoption, or the use of the power to place a child for adoption with prospective adopters, or the decision to leave a child with those with whom a child has been placed as prospective adopters?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   We fully appreciate the intention behind the amendment. We have moved on to Chapter 3 and this clause whets our appetite. We are getting to the heart of the process, which is where we want to see the changes which will benefit children.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para0"></a>The clause does not deal with the process of decision-making leading up to placement. It is a framework clause essentially. Its purpose is to make it clear that adoption agencies may only place a child for adoption if they have the consent of the parents or, otherwise, under a placement order. I am sympathetic to what the noble Lord said. I want to reassure him that the intention is that an adoption agency should place a child for adoption only where it is satisfied that the child ought to be placed for adoption. In coming to this decision, the full range of powers and requirements under Clause 1 will bind the agency in that respect.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para1"></a>The Bill follows the existing practice of the Adoption Act 1976. That Act did not set out on the face of the Bill any reflection on process or concepts of what ought to be considered. The process for decision-making by adoption agencies will be set out in regulations, as it is indeed in the current regulations under the 1976 Act. We have reproduced the process which has been in place for 25 years.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para2"></a>As noble Lords know, the process at the moment is that where, as a result of a case review, a local authority is considering adoption for a child it is looking after, or a voluntary adoption agency is considering placing a child for adoption, the first step is to refer the case to the adoption panel, an independent panel made up of specialist and lay people. The panel makes a recommendation to the authority or to the voluntary agency as to whether adoption is indeed in the best interests of the child. It is then up to the authority to decide whether to accept that recommendation. If it does, at that point the authority is satisfied that a child ought to be placed for adoption.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para3"></a>The new regulations will set out a similar process. In the context of the Bill, the decision that the agency is satisfied that the child ought to be placed for adoption should be made before a child may be placed with the consent of the birth parents. Again, that is what the regulations will provide. They will also provide requirements to consult the child directly throughout the decision-making process, to record his or her views, and to ensure that they are taken into account, for example, in panel decisions.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para4"></a>Under the provisions of the Bill in Clause 1, the child's welfare is, as we have said many times already, the paramount consideration. The duty is to bear in mind the harmful effects of delay in decision-making. The welfare checklist set out in that clause will apply throughout the decision-making process.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para5"></a>Where a local authority is satisfied that, as a result of this process, a child ought to be placed for adoption but the parents do not consent, the agency should <P>


<a name="column_GC127"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consider also the significant harm that might occur and that the threshold is met. Under Clause 21(1), it will be obliged to apply for a placement order. Therefore, I want to reassure Members of the Committee that our intention has been that there should be a proper decision-making process&#151;there is no question about that&#151;in the adoption agency that determines and to the agency's satisfaction. It is in the best interests of the child to be placed before any placement happens.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para6"></a>That said, however, I can see that there is some advantage in what the noble Lord has said as regards absolute clarity. One of the things we are trying to do in this process in the new Bill is to make absolute clarity as regards process and choice for parents and children. Therefore, the Government are certainly willing to consider the points raised by the amendment. We shall look at the proposed wording in detail and any wider implications of making a change along the lines proposed with a view perhaps to returning to this issue on Report.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   Perhaps I may widen the question and ask whether we shall have an opportunity to see the guidance before the Bill is passed, because I suspect that there are a number of points of detail that some of us may wish to look at and think about.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para7"></a>I wish to raise one issue on this amendment, although it is not appropriate to it. I confess that I thought of setting down an amendment about it but could not see how to do so. There is, rightly, a great deal of emphasis on the welfare of the child. My wife sat for many years in the juvenile courts and she made the point to me that when you take a woman's child away you destroy that woman. Therefore, we ought to build somewhere into the machinery support, counselling and consideration for that woman's position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   The commitment of the noble Lord to the welfare of children is well known in this House, and I take entirely the points he has made. We have had discussions on the regulation-making process and I wish to assure him that there will be a full consultation process. We have two years to ensure that before the Act comes into effect the regulations are as sound and as inclusive as possible. So in that process, the concerns that he has raised will be addressed.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para8"></a>As regards the seriousness of the choice which is being made by the woman or, indeed, the family giving up a child for adoption, we are very seized on that. When we come to discuss in the next clauses the placement with consent, we shall be saying how seriously we are addressing the whole question of the negotiation which goes on with parents to ensure that they know full well what they have agreed to do and the counselling that can be provided in that process. I hope that that will satisfy the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I call that a splendid debut for the noble Baroness on the Bill. I know that Ministers <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>do not lightly bandy around words like "sympathetic", and I was waiting for the point where I was going to be let down. However, having taken us through a very considered view of the process which is again to be enshrined in regulations, to find that the noble Baroness still believes that there is room for improvement on the current wording is extremely heartening. That bodes well for the clarity of this chapter in the Bill, which we shall debate at greater length as regards the content. I am pleased that the Minister accepts the fact that there is room for improvement on the wording, even after 25 years of use of the Adoption Act 1976. I look forward to seeing how the Minister's considerations progress between now and Report and in the meantime I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones </B>   moved Amendment No. 51A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 12, line 17, leave out "section 18 or"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-10_para10"></a><P>

<a name="20702-10_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to the meat of Chapter 3 and on all sides there are a considerable number of concerns about the provisions in the Bill regarding placement orders and placement by consent, particularly in relation to potential conflict with the Children Act and the unnecessary complexity regarding the implications of parents giving consent to placement.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para12"></a>I offer three examples. In circumstances where a parent consents to adoption and subsequently changes she mind, she cannot remove the child even if the child has not been placed for adoption. It may be reasonable for there to be some delay in cases where the child is placed with adopters but it is hard to see the reason for delay where the child has not even been so placed.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para13"></a>In situations where a relinquishing mother consents to the adoption placement and obstructs the local authority from ascertaining the views of the father without parental responsibility and the wider family, the adoption agency faces the dilemma of whether to place with consent or insist that the father and possibly the wider family are consulted.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para14"></a>The third example is where a birth parent can give consent to placement even before the child is six weeks old but could then be committing a criminal offence if she changed her mind and tried to take the child home.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para15"></a>There are huge complications in this section of the Bill. Members of the Committee will remember that a chart was issued with the Explanatory Notes and most will have seen that and will appreciate the sheer complexity. This set of amendments tries to reduce that complexity. The aim of the proposed amendments is that there should be a placement order in every case, including where the placement is by consent. The advantages of this would be that the significance of the decision being made by the parents in consenting to a placement would be underlined to them. That is particularly important in view of the restrictions placed by the Bill on the parents' ability to withdraw their consent and contest the making of the adoption order.
<P>


<a name="column_GC129"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para16"></a>The complicated provisions contained in Clauses 29 to 31 and 33 would not be needed. It would enough to provide that the making of a placement order operated to remove the parents' right to remove the child without the leave of the court. The child and prospective adopters would have greater protection against disruption of the placement. Any outstanding issues or queries about, for instance, the involvement of fathers without parental responsibility or wider family members could be resolved by the court prior to the child's placement. Such a course is advocated by the president of the Family Division In Re H and In Re G. Under the Bill's scheme, there is no recourse open to an agency, other than invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, in addressing the dilemma facing it when a mother refuses to agree to the involvement of a father without parental responsibility in making plans for a child.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para17"></a>Although on the face of it having a placement order in every case may appear to create extra delay and expense, on these Benches we do not believe that this will occur in practice for the following reasons. If the consent is genuine, the court hearing can be brief and fitted in, for example, early in the court day without unnecessary delay. Moreover, if the consent is not genuine or is confined to the mother only, but the father or members of the wider family wish to care for the child, it is appropriate that that is ascertained and adjudicated upon by the court before the placement is made, as envisaged in Clause 1. Otherwise, delays may occur at the adoption hearing, when father or wider family may be making applications for contact or residence orders.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para18"></a>Issues about the extended family or father without parental responsibility being able to care for the child need to be able to be raised in order to ensure compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights. While the agency, if it follows good practice, will consider these issues&#151;or should have done so&#151;a court hearing before authorisation is given to place the child will provide the opportunity for them to be raised in a judicial forum. If they are not raised until the final adoption hearing, not only will this cause delay but it will almost certainly be damaging for the child and distressing for the adopters.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para19"></a>Other amendments relating to Clause 20 are designed to enable the court, in certain circumstances only, to limit the placement order to a power to place with specific adopters named in the order. The situation envisaged is one where the child is already living with the family which it is proposed should adopt him or her.
<P>

<a name="20702-10_para20"></a>Where a child has been placed with foster carers and, after some time, it becomes apparent that they are the most suitable permanent placement for the child, and they and the local authority wish the placement to become an adoptive one, it seems appropriate for them to be identified in the placement order. The court might be willing to endorse a plan for the existing foster carers to adopt while being reluctant to make a generalised placement order. If for some reason the adoption by the foster carers did not take place, it <P>


<a name="column_GC130"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would surely be appropriate for the court to be asked to consider the changed circumstances before making any new placement order. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-11_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I very much support the principle underlying this part of the Bill, which is to ensure that where a child is being considered for adoption as far as possible the question of parental wishes about the child's future is addressed prior to placement for adoption. The main point about tackling matters in that way is that once the issue of parental wishes has been dealt with, the child and the prospective adopters will enjoy reasonable security from that time on until the final adoption order is made.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para0"></a>While that concept may appear to be perfectly suitable in many cases, we have to be extremely careful about it. The consequences of parents giving their formal consent are so serious that I question whether a purely administrative procedure is really sufficient to safeguard the child's welfare and the parents' rights. I say that for one principal reason. Although the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, raised a number of reasons, the principal reason is the finality of the parental consent. If the parent agrees and subsequently changes his or her mind, he or she cannot remove the child even if the child has not yet been placed for adoption. As I understand it, that is a correct reading of Clause 29.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para1"></a>The adoption agency will have assumed parental responsibility for the child and the agency can then restrict the ability of the parents to exercise parental responsibility. Furthermore, where parents have consented only to placement in principle but have never given their consent to the proposed adoption order, they will be unable to oppose the making of the final adoption order unless the court gives them leave to do so because of a change in circumstances, as detailed in Clause 46. In other words, the court may never have to consider whether the parents' consent to the proposed adoption has been given or should be dispensed with.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, helpfully went through various circumstances where the Bill, in his opinion&#151;and, indeed, in mine&#151;falls short in this general area. The amendments that he has tabled are an excellent way of addressing those deficiencies. I myself tabled a broad, probing amendment to leave out Clause 18, which was designed to tease out these precise points. It is better, however, if we roll the whole debate into one.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para3"></a>There is an answer, and that is that, even in cases where placement is by consent, all children relinquished for adoption should be the subject of a placement order. I shall not repeat the reasons but it seems that the rather complicated provisions in the Bill at Clauses 29 to 31 would not be needed if we went down that road. As the noble Lord emphasised, the full import of the decision being made by the parents would be brought home to them in an unequivocal way.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para4"></a>The European Convention on Human Rights requires that family members must be given access to a forum in which they can express their views about the <P>


<a name="column_GC131"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposed severance of the child from his or her birth family. I think that that is yet another reason why these amendments are worthy of serious consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I have put my name to these amendments, and I should like to give strong support to the case made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, which was so ably spoken to by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. We must remember how irrevocable adoption is, and the thought that a perhaps very young person can give consent to adoption and that the placement order can then go through is not good. We have to take every care that, whoever the mother is who might be relinquishing a child, a great deal of thought is given to that decision. The plans made in these amendments are very good, and I hope that the Minister will give them a very sympathetic hearing.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I support the amendments in principle. However, let there be no misunderstanding that placement does not pre-empt the situation of the parent. It does not do so in relation to adoption, as Clause 46(2)(c) makes it perfectly plain that the court must be satisfied that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the parent's or guardian's consent should be dispensed with".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-11_para5"></a>That involves a full hearing, and was the subject matter of the leading authority, In Re W, to which I referred on Second Reading. I shall not refer to it again.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para6"></a>It is a fully protective procedure for parents in the sense that they will be heard and their representations will be entertained. However, that is against the paramount requirement of the interests of the child and not the paramount interests of the blood tie, the parent. Subject to that, which is retained in Clause 46, one cannot say that there is no satisfactory protection at the adoption stage because of the placement. However, I support the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I ask for the Minister's help as I find this a complicated process to think through from the practitioner's point of view. I am sure that other practitioners are probably struggling with this too.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para7"></a>We seem to have two elements twisted together. The first is the issue of whether there should be a placement order in absolutely every situation. Despite my practice and my views about the paramountcy of the child's needs, I am not at all sure that in every single situation we should go through the full paraphernalia of court appearance. Having spent a great deal of time in court, I know that even the most sympathetic courts can be extremely distressing for even the most sophisticated families. These are not usually the most sophisticated families.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para8"></a>Nevertheless, what we are trying to tease out in relation to these amendments are some of the principles throughout Chapter 3. That is why it is quite difficult to grasp one thread without considering some of the others. Although I did not manage to get to my feet to speak earlier, as there did not seem to be an opportunity, I support the previous amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones&#151;to <P>


<a name="column_GC132"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which I think the Minister was sympathetic. I support it not so much because I think that process is always a good thing to include in a Bill, but because that particular amendment spells out the real need to look at the detail of what happens before the child is placed for adoption. That is my difficulty in relation to these amendments.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para9"></a>Adoption is one point in a child's life at which there is complexity. It is part of the total childcare aspect of the child's situation. In dealing with the complexity that continues in terms of placement, we need to ensure that the needs of the child's birth family have been considered. I take the view that there are many families where one cannot continue to keep a child with the family. I have worked with women who would have liked to have kept their child had we been able to provide other services&#151;which I think that we would provide, post-adoption, to a family who adopts a child. There are some real issues that we are not teasing out because we are not addressing them in a more global way.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para10"></a>Another part of the Bill suggests that the family will not then be able to remove the child even if it is not placed for adoption. My concern is that, if we go for a placement order in every case, short of changing provision in the Children Acts, we shall not be providing the opportunity for that family to have another go at looking after their child. This is where the conflict with which I am struggling arises with the Children Acts. I am not a lawyer, and I find this quite difficult to tease out. As a practitioner, however, it is terribly important that we look at the situation of the child, the birth family and the adoptive family, and find a simple route through to the best solution for the child. Like most noble Lords, I find this route extraordinarily convoluted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I am grateful for the thoughtful comments from all sides of the Committees. Noble Lords are quite right: this is a very serious process. Although I would dispute that it is as complex as has been described, it is truly important that we are clearer about what we intend to do. I shall take the time, if I may, to address all the amendments and look in some detail at some of the issues which have been raised. I hope that I am able to answer some of the points and concerns that have been raised in relation to, for example, consultation with the wider family and potential conflict with the ECHR.

<a name="20702-11_para11"></a>I shall try to explain the context of our thinking on placement. The Bill tries to achieve two objectives. The first is to put in place, for the first time in law, the concept of placement itself, which entails a clear process for involving the birth parents, the agency and the adoptive parents, as well as the child, and putting that within a clear legal framework where none has existed before. In so doing, we seek to put in place a new arrangement of rights and responsibilities which come into interaction with each other at different parts of the process, to strengthen both the rights of the birth parents in different ways, the security of the child in different ways, and the rights of the adoptive parents <P>


<a name="column_GC133"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to act as successful adoptive parents. It makes the process clearer, more deliberate, fairer and more secure.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para12"></a>The second objective is to make the process of placement more appropriate and responsive to different situations. These children come from families with different family histories and different circumstances and prospects. They might have been in care, or they might have been fostered or living in situations at risk. They are all individual children with a different set of circumstances to be considered, and with a different set of responses from the family.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para13"></a>We are not trying to create through the placement process a fast track or a casual track just to meet some arbitrary target. We are not seeking to do that at all. We are trying to create two processes which are equally sensitive. One is to do with parents who are consenting to the process, involving the children who are now in voluntary accommodation. For the other set of children, there is no parental consent. Their placement will involve a serious set of negotiations with many people. It is a potentially long process, but it has built-in safeguards for everyone involved.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para14"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree in due course that we struck the right balance. The amendments propose some fundamental changes to that balance. We therefore need to be clear about what we are doing. In summary, they would remove the current provisions for placement with parental consent in Clause 18. They would require that a placement order was made for every placement on adoption no matter what the family circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para15"></a>Before I consider the amendment, I would like to take Members of the Committee back briefly over the history. The Bill has been in development for a decade or more. Many of the arguments have been held by practitioners in relation to successive governments. Much thought has gone into how best to improve the process after all these years. The proposals have evolved through successive consultations&#151;and it has been a genuinely inclusive process&#151;in 1993, 1994 and 1996 and during the passage of the Bill. The main aim is to resolve the substantive issues relating to consent. We believe&#151;and we are informed about this; this is what the practitioner body says&#151;that the current legal process leaves too much of the process of negotiation to the final adoption hearing. The placement system aims to improve on this in three main ways.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para16"></a>First, it aims to give greater certainty and stability to children by dealing as far as possible with the bulk of issues that are really problematic for families around consent to adoption before they have been placed, so that placement occurs not at the end but a good way through the process, rather than at the beginning.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para17"></a>Secondly, we aim to reduce the extent to which birth families are faced with a fait accompli at the final adoption hearing, when all they are faced with is the ability to say, "No, we have changed our minds". By that time a child will have been with adoptive parents for some time. That is a significant additional safeguard for the birth parents in current legal <P>


<a name="column_GC134"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>framework. Under the Bill, parental consent must be sought before the child is placed for adoption. Either they must consent or the courts must decide to dispense with their consent in making a placement order. That arises later in the Bill and there will no doubt be animated discussion on conditions for dispensing with consent. In the context of these clauses, we are dealing with the process at this point. Either way, the issue must be addressed and resolved before the child is placed with prospective adopters.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para18"></a>At present, there is no legal concept of authorisation to place dependent on parental consent. There is no requirement to seek parental consent before an adoptive placement is made. We have a situation, for example, where a child may have been in care under a care order and originally the intention might have been that that child be rehabilitated with his original parents. But circumstances change. Often the plan will move to adoption. The agency, the social workers involved, will discuss the matter with the family and they will decide that the time for rehabilitation is gone and that adoption is the only alternative.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para19"></a>When that happens, however, there is no requirement that the parents have to consent to their child being placed for adoption. The local authority can simply go ahead, saying: "We have changed our minds. Circumstances have changed, therefore this child is going to be placed for adoption". No formal process is necessary.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para20"></a>The result is, therefore that often the first formal opportunity the parents have to contest the issue of adoption is at the final hearing. Then they can say, to the dismay of prospective adopters and to the disruption of the child, "We have changed our minds about this. We know that it is a loving adoptive family. We know the child possibly might be better off. But I'm sorry, we've changed our minds". By that time, the child could have been with adoptive parents for many months.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para21"></a>Courts in that situation can be reluctant, too. The other effect is that when the courts take the side of the adoptive parents, the birth parents feel that they have had no right, nor have they been listened to thoroughly. The danger of fait accompli was a key reason, therefore, why the Adoption Law Review recommended addressing the issue of parental consent before the child was placed. I would argue that in this way there is a significant strengthening of safeguards for birth parents and a fairer deal.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para22"></a>The third aim of the provisions is that they try to reduce the uncertainty for adopters. At Second Reading, we heard very eloquently and movingly of the dilemma faced by adoptive parents who are finding it extremely difficult to conclude the process of adoption. Therefore, we are trying to reduce the uncertainty for adoptive parents who, currently, a year down the line, are suddenly faced exactly as the birth parents are with the prospect of a change.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para23"></a>As a result of shifting much of the substantive question of consent earlier in the process, the process reduces the opportunity to contest. However, I would point out&#151;and I hope this will reassure the noble <P>


<a name="column_GC135"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, Lord Clement-Jones&#151;that the parents may still contest the final hearing if they obtain leave of the court, which may be granted provided that there has been a change in circumstances. We will come on to describe what that might mean.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para24"></a>Therefore, Chapter 3 provides two routes for placement. The first is placement by parental consent under Clause 18, either through a voluntary adoption agency or a local authority, or under a placement order under Clauses 20 and 21. The second route is only available to local authorities, and I shall explain why in a moment. I stress, therefore, that placement by consent is intended to be entirely voluntary. Where the parents withdraw their consent, they can do so at any point before the final order, the final application for the child to be adopted, is made and the child must be returned to them if they make that application. The only change would be if the local authority was under a duty to apply for a placement order. If the child was felt to be at risk of significant harm, or if there was a care order already on the child, that would outweigh the other considerations.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para25"></a>The two placement routes are connected. Where a local authority considers a child it is accommodating ought to be placed for adoption, it must either place him with consent; or, if the parents do not consent and it considers that the child is at risk of significant harm, or the child is under a care order, it must apply for a placement order.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para26"></a>That is in line with the Children Act philosophy of seeking to work with families and to get that balance right between providing for support in consent, but also providing for statutory intervention and protection when that is the right route.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para27"></a>Turning now to the amendments, I shall deal first with Amendments Nos. 51A, 52A, 54 and 54A to 54C. In summary, their effect would be to remove the placement with consent route completely, and to require that there must be a placement order made by a court authorising every adoptive placement, both those where the parents have consented and those where they did not.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para28"></a>Amendment No. 51A amends Clause 17 to remove the reference to Clause 18, so it would now provide that an adoption agency may place a child for adoption only under a placement order&#151;both consequential.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para29"></a>Amendment No. 52A makes a consequential change to Clause 19, so that instead of allowing parents to combine consent to placement with advance consent to adoption, they can now combine consent to a placement order with advance consent to adoption&#151;again, a consequential amendment.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para30"></a>I shall take Amendments Nos. 54, 54A, 54B and 54C in two groups. Amendments Nos. 54 and 54A to C make follow-on changes to the placement order to provide that where the parents consent to a placement order, the court can make one without the Children Act significant harm threshold being met, but where the parents do not consent, the threshold would have <P>


<a name="column_GC136"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be met before an order could be made. That is entirely logical, in the same way as the Bill provides as currently drafted.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para31"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 53A would tie a placement order to an existing placement, a specific placement, where the child was already living with prospective adopters when the placement order was made.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para32"></a>I know that Members of the Committee and some of the stakeholders in the adoption process, the professional agencies, have expressed concern about the current provisions in Clause 18. I want to address those concerns and I hope to be able to do so in what I shall say next. The Government do not share the view that we should dispense with the consent route. The three main arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones&#151;and of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in some respects&#151;were, first, that the significance of the decision taken by the parents requires the court to be involved. It is such a serious step that we need to make provision to ensure that every parent knows what he or she is contracted to do.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para33"></a>Secondly this is a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, particularly&#151;it would provide an opportunity for agencies to seek the court's guidance on tricky questions where they were having difficulty deciding how to consult and involve unmarried fathers without parental responsibility or the wider family members.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para34"></a>Thirdly, the use of a placement order in every case would justify recasting the provisions covering removal from adoptive placements, which are described as complex and which we will discuss later.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para35"></a>I believe that the Bill is right for two main reasons. The first reason is because of the safeguards in the system. Indeed the strongest safeguard is the one that I described in relation to putting the birth parents' consent process early in the whole raft of options.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para36"></a>In relation to the first point about the court hearing, we made it clear in the debate in the other place that it is already a key element of placement and consent provision that the adoption agency is under a duty to spell out in regulations the need to counsel the parents and to explain to them the full implications of what they are agreeing to.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para37"></a>We believe that in situations where it is a consensual decision to let the child go for adoption and the parents are fully in agreement, the fullest opportunities to counsel those parents and to discuss the issue with the child will be provided. In that way, everyone will know what they have signed up to.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para38"></a>A further safeguard is that the Bill provides for parents' consent to a placement to be witnessed by CAFCASS officers, who are wholly independent. Their job will be to ensure that the consent is given properly and transparently, with the full knowledge and understanding of the parents. I stress that we are willing to consult on the detail of the role that the CAFCASS officer should play at this stage. It is an important safeguard. We want to get it right. We want to know that we have the right role for the CAFCASS officer.
<P>


<a name="column_GC137"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para39"></a>Finally, the consent itself is to be given in a prescribed form, which will spell out clearly what is being agreed to. We believe that those safeguards, together with the fact that, as I have said, the consent to placement can be withdrawn by the parents at any point up to the application of the final adoption order, will be in themselves sufficient to ensure that the parents do understand the significance.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para40"></a>On a personal reflection, I believe genuinely that parents who are contemplating this step will really understand what it will mean to lose a child. I imagine that those in your Lordship's House who have experience of the adoption system would support that contention.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para41"></a>The second argument in favour of requiring a placement order is that it will ensure that agencies have properly explored all the options in the wider family. I understand the significance of that. Often these children live in complex family systems; they are often placed with family members; and they have other people in their lives who need to be consulted. The argument is that a placement order in each case would provide a transparent route to seek the guidance of the court in these complex cases when they do not know whether to consult unmarried fathers or wider family members&#151;or, for example, in cases where the mother wanted to give up the child in secret.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para42"></a>It is a developing area. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred to the ECHR and the Human Rights Act. Those Acts are bedding down. We have given a commitment that we will cover the appropriate action for agencies in full in the new adoption agencies regulations and guidance.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para43"></a>It is also important to remember proposed agency decisions and the process that has led up to them and that this is not the start of the process. It is a long way through the process and we would expect the adoption panels, with all their expertise and independence, to have played a leading role in ensuring that the proper work had been done before any decision was taken that adoption was in a child's best interest.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para44"></a>In addition, there is another safeguard. For those who believe that the court has to be involved, there is a route into the court. It will be open for the agencies to seek the views of the court in cases of great doubt or complexity, either by applying for a placement order if it is a local authority and the child is at risk of harm, or by applying for a ruling under the court's inherent jurisdiction, as they can do under the existing legislation. Again, we are very willing to consult on whether specific provision should be made for this alternative in the court rules. So there will be a route into court for difficult cases.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para45"></a>I am grateful for the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth. I do not believe that these few difficult cases justify a requirement to go to court in every case. That brings me to the other reason why we do not believe that a placement order should be applied in every case.
<P>


<a name="column_GC138"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para46"></a>I have discussed the strong safeguards in the Bill to cover the concerns raised, but in addition let us reflect on what the Bill is trying to do. It is trying to create a simpler and speedier process for children to be placed with stable and loving families after what can be a long period in care or in a series of foster homes. We want to move to a position where when we have the consent of the parents we do not want to put increased delays and barriers in the way.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para47"></a>To get an idea of what the amendments would mean, at the moment 16 per cent. of children adopted from local authority care have already been placed voluntarily&#151;in effect, with the consent of their parents. Those are the children we are talking about. They have been placed without a court order or the involvement of the court. They can be there for many different reasons, but 430 children a year are there voluntarily. Not all these cases would be suitable for the Clause 18 route but this gives an idea of the upper limit.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para48"></a>The effect of the amendment could be to require several hundred additional court cases a year; possibly over 400 and potentially 600 if we reach the target we have set of a 40 per cent. increase in the adoption of children from care. Because a child cannot be placed for adoption until the placement order is made, the result would be bound be an increased delay in placing these children while they wait for the court hearing on the placement order.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para49"></a>We know that some of the agencies that are most involved and most conscientious about the future of the child are concerned about delay; they do not believe that this will occur in practice because they have suggested that these cases can be seen at the beginning of the court day when the court is free and can be dealt with relatively speedily. However, it is hard for us to agree with that because our clear advice from colleagues in the Lord Chancellor's Department is that that pre-list time is already fully occupied with other work. For example, into that slot go the urgent injunctive procedures and case-managed family business. Some Members of the Committee will know far better than I the kinds of things which can clog up the early part of the court day. The spare time in which to handle these applications with no risk of delay is not available; it would be bound to compete.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para50"></a>Given that these will ostensibly be non-contested agreements, we do not believe that they would have priority over urgent cases or pressing family proceedings. The inevitable result will be increased risk of delays in adoptive placements with consent, over and above that which already occurs. Is that justified? We believe that it is not.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para51"></a>The 1992 Adoption Law Review suggested that there should be a court order authorising every placement; However, when the 1993 White Paper was published, the previous administration said that many of those consulted feared that the new procedure might prove cumbersome and might in some cases unnecessarily and without clear benefit add to the length and complexity of the process. That argument has been with us for a decade and has evolved in a <P>


<a name="column_GC139"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>positive sense as far as the Government are concerned. The White Paper also committed the Government to further consultation and in 1994, when we put forward the concept of placement by consent without a court order, it was strongly supported in those consultations. Those arguments hold true today.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para52"></a>Amendment No. 53A will require the placement order to be made when the child is already living with the prospective adopters. We move from a placement order that can be made without any family being identified, to one that is very specific. What will happen in the regrettable, but not unpredictable, event that a placement broke down? Even in the best regulated foster-parent homes, placements break down for different reasons. The local authority would then no longer have the legal authority to place a child for adoption. If it still thought that the child ought to be placed for adoption, it would have to return to the court to obtain another placement order and this would, again, add to delay.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para53"></a>Again, I shall pray in aid the consultation process. The issue of whether placement orders should be general or specific was one of the key questions posed in the public consultation in 1994. Responses were strongly in favour of general placement orders, on the grounds that they are both simpler and more flexible. I reiterate that the purpose of placement orders is for the court to decide that placement for adoption is in the best interests of the child.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para54"></a>Obviously, the identity of the prospective adopter is critical. The whole process is designed to ensure that the prospective adopter is the best possible quality commitment for the child. The court is essentially being asked whether in principle the child ought to be placed for adoption. It is not being asked to select and match the child with prospective adopters. That is the task that the adoption agencies which are properly skilled and equipped to do it.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para55"></a>Where a placement under a placement order has broken down, the local authority will need to review the case and consider what is the best form of action. It may be that it is no longer adoption. Other factors may have come into play. It may be time to consider possible rehabilitation with the family itself. However, the Government believe that the authority should not have to return to the court, with the inevitable associated delay, before it proceeds to place the child, whatever the decision may be. If adoption were no longer in the best interest, we would expect the authority to make use of its power under Clause 23 to discharge the placement order and make whatever other arrangements were necessary and appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para56"></a>The Government believe that local authority social services departments, in their role as adoption agencies, are the bodies with the appropriate expertise to make these judgments, and that it is not the role of the courts at this level. I hope that if I have been able to convince Members of the Committee that there is an undesirable inflexibility in the amendments, they will understand why we do not think that they should be included.
<P>


<a name="column_GC140"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para57"></a>In conclusion, the Government's aim is to reduce delay, but not to fast track at the expense of the care for the child, the quality of the placement and the prospects for the child. We are building in safeguards, not removing them. The proposal to remove the current placement with consent route and to require that there must in every case be a court order authorising placement risks doing the reverse. That is why, on balance, the Government believe that the placement-with-consent route under Clause 18 should remain.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para58"></a>We recognise that a range of genuine concerns have been expressed today. I hope that I have set out the safeguards, but while I do not believe that it would be right rigidly to require that there should be a placement order in every case, we can see that there might potentially be some advantages in terms of extra flexibility in some of what the amendments propose; for example, enabling an agency to apply for a placement order in consent cases, and in these cases, allowing for the order to be made with consent without the significant harm threshold having to be met. We believe that those would be exceptional cases. Although we would consider that local authorities had a right to have that recourse, in no way would we want that to diminish the principle that voluntary placement by consent should be the route chosen for the vast majority of consensual cases. We are willing to look at this issue in consultation with stakeholders, with a view to returning to it on Report.
<P>

<a name="20702-11_para59"></a>I am sorry that my explanation has been so long. However, given the nature of the amendment and the fact that your Lordships have approached it in such detail, I think that it is important to spell out the Government's case in detail. I hope that, on those grounds, your Lordships will feel able to withdraw or not to press the amendments.

<A NAME="20702-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   I should like to ask the Minister a question, if I may. She mentioned "both birth parents" several times. Would she agree with me that it is difficult sometimes to find both birth parents? The mother might be a street worker and might not know who the father was, or she might be somebody who had been on holiday abroad and had several relationships. In both cases it could be difficult to trace the father. Could the Minister talk a little more about how she sees tracing the fathers in these difficult cases? I know that some of these cases are difficult, and one does not want to delay a child being adopted if that is the best thing for that child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews:  </B>  Tracing unmarried fathers is a big issue. Under the present arrangements, at the early stages of the decision on whether the child ought to be placed for adoption, the adoption agencies would make every effort to do that. The Bill's provisions do not disturb that effort. Every effort will be made as part of the placement process to establish whether the unmarried father had a right to be consulted. Of course, it certainly reflects the nature of the relationship if the unmarried father has a continuing <P>


<a name="column_GC141"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>relationship with the mother, as that puts it in a different category. By marrying the mother, he can acquire a parental responsibility and so on. Throughout the consultation on regulations, we would certainly want to ensure that those provisions are strong and that they are fair to both parents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I thank all those who took part in this debate&#151;which is clearly, as the Minister recognises, fundamental to the operation of the Bill. I am grateful to her for taking the trouble to go through it in such detail and to address all aspects of the amendment. She need make no apology about the length of the reply; it is extremely important that we get this right.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para0"></a>The two words that I picked up on from other noble Lords during the course of the debate were "finality" and "irrevocability", posited against the Minister's "undesirable inflexibility" and the cumbersome aspects of having to go for an order every time. Of course, there are important considerations when one balances the two aspects. Those such as myself who take a view about the balance are very much influenced by the fact that Clause 51(4) contains wording that means that any withdrawal of consent prior to the adoption order being applied for is a nullity.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para1"></a>Clause 51(4) states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The withdrawal of any consent to the placement of a child for adoption, or of any consent given under section 19, is ineffective if it is given after an application for an adoption order is made".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-12_para2"></a>
That is fairly heady in the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para3"></a>I have to hand the chart which makes it clear that, at an adoption order hearing where there has been a placement with consent, the birth parent may oppose the adoption order only with the court's leave. Thus, there are fetters in those circumstances, all of which tends towards finality if placement by consent has taken place; hence the argument that this should be done by court order.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para4"></a>I understand what the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said about this as a practitioner. However, there are many other practitioners among those whom the Minister has rather helpfully described as "stakeholders" in this process who feel very strongly that this is a necessary protection and that it is important to go through a very straightforward court order route for placement in order to ensure that we do not have problems at, in a sense, the back end of the process when the adoption order is made.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para5"></a>I do not believe that this particular set of proposals introduces greater uncertainty; indeed, it is designed to reduce the level of uncertainty. As we may hear in debating whether the clause should stand part&#151;it is all part of the same argument&#151;by deleting Clauses 30, 31 and 33 and Clause 18, we would in fact simplify the procedures in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para6"></a>We probably have something of a philosophical difference in all of this. I shall very carefully read what the noble Baroness has said. Although I understand the resource issues involved, we have a very important decision to make in relation to the Bill. Regardless of <P>

<a name="20702-12_para7"></a>I shall leave it there. The problem is that the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, makes the case that there is no fait accompli. However, many of us believe that there is too much of a fait accompli&#151;if it is possible to use the term relatively rather than absolutely. It is tilted too far the wrong way. Nevertheless, I am sure that we shall all go away and read the noble Baroness's words with considerable care, including her point on enabling an agency to apply for a placement order even where consent is given in certain circumstances. We shall definitely look at that to see if it is a possible way of perhaps compromising or at least curing some of the defects in the proposals currently before us. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Barker </B>   moved Amendment No. 52:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 12, line 40, after "of" insert ", or other persons holding parental responsibility for,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-12_para11"></a><P>

<a name="20702-12_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment I shall pick up the point raised in a previous debate by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. The issue of deciding who holds parental responsibility seems less straightforward than those who come to these matters cold might think. The issue that we are trying to get at here is about parents who hold parental responsibility, such as grandparents, and about those who are not resident but still retain parental responsibility.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para13"></a>One criticism of current practice, to which the Minister alluded in speaking to the previous group of amendments, is that it is possible for parents who are not present or living with the children to be ignored in the process. These days, and for many of these children, family structures are extremely complex and somebody who in effect has parental responsibility may not be the person who in law has parental responsibility.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para14"></a>In tabling the amendment, we want to ensure that thorough consideration will be taken of the wide kinship structures in which many of the children find themselves. I ask the Minister what exactly is meant, and who is meant, by the people who are named already in the clause, and whether that is wide enough. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, whether the amendment would include parents in prison. There is an extra difficulty because the children stay so long with the parent, and then they are taken away and put into care. The parent might want them adopted or they might <P>


<a name="column_GC143"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not. The situation is so different if they are in prison, and the father might be in prison too. Would her amendment cover people in prison?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   That is a fine question. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, may get more clarification from the Minister than she would from me, so I will redirect the question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-12_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   The answer to the point raised by noble Baroness, Lady Marsham, is "Yes".
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para15"></a>Perhaps I may reply now to Amendment No. 52, I know that the noble Baroness has great concern for the rights of grandparents in particular, in relation to her professional work outside this House.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para16"></a>The provisions for consent to placement, like much of the Bill, follow the model of consent to adoption provision in the 1976 Act, but the people who must consent to the child being adopted are the child's parents or guardians. We have to make a distinction between parental consent, and the legal responsibility to act as a parent, and a parental responsibility. The people who must consent to the child being adopted are the child's parents or guardian. "Parents" in this case means the parent who has parental responsibility.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para17"></a>In addition, one of the great virtues of the Bill, is that we have created a new role; "a special guardian". Clause 139 provides that "guardian" in this instance includes a special guardian. The intention of the special guardianship order is that the special guardian is the child's primary carer and takes the day-to-day decisions concerning the child's upbringing. It is right that he or she, alongside the child's parents, should have to consent to the child being adopted or being placed for adoption. The special guardianship fits within that rubric.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para18"></a>However, the effect of the amendment would be that others with parental responsibility would also need to consent to placement for adoption. That would mark a very significant departure from the position under current legislation. The largest group of people involved would be those holding residence orders, and they can be a great range of people. They can be other members of the family; they can be grandparents, but they can be people outside the family as well. They can be long-standing friends of the family who are trusted to take care of the child in certain circumstances, and who have applied for and been granted a residence order.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para19"></a>Giving the holders of residence orders as the ability to consent to placement for adoption would therefore be giving them a huge additional responsibility. It would be a responsibility about that key decision in the child's long-term future which might not be appropriate in all residence order cases because they are made for such different reasons.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para20"></a>In practical terms, an adoption agency would not seek to place a child for adoption via the consent route at all when the child was subject to a residence order in favour of someone other than a parent with parental responsibility. The reasons for that are quite practical. If a residence order is successful, the child is living happily with that person but the residence order <P>


<a name="column_GC144"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>determines where the child is to live and, therefore, it is quite difficult for the agency to gain access to that child. How would it be able to see and talk to the child and to decide that adoption was in his or her best interests? Therefore, how could they take some of the other decisions about whether adoption was the right route or about placement?
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para21"></a>In a situation where there was a dispute between the parents and the holder of the residence order as to the future of a child, the parent would have to seek initially to discharge the residence order. If the local authority were concerned about the future of the child in such a situation and it wanted to quash the effect of a residence order, it would have to seek a care order. If the parents tried to take away the residence order in the course of a dispute, the local authority would have to think of the future of the child as regards the potential harm, and would have to seek a care order in those circumstances. If it was satisfied at that point that the child ought to be placed for adoption, it would also have to seek a placement order. If either a care order or a placement order were made, the residence order would be discharged.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para22"></a>As regards the other people who may hold parental responsibility, such as step parents, if we look back at the provisions of Clause 1(4)(f) there is the safeguard that the court would need to consider their views about the adoption if they were people who had a significant relationship with the child. That notion of significant relationship is not confined to family members. So the provisions are wide enough to ensure that account is taken of the views of relatives and others who have a significant relationship with the child.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para23"></a>Given the framework set out in the current legislation, we believe it is right that it continues to be the case that the people whose consent is required as to what happens to the child as regards a placement or adoption order, and the people on whom the court must rely and seek consent from must be the parents and the guardians of the child.
<P>

<a name="20702-12_para24"></a>I hope that that will reassure the noble Baroness that the relatives and the people of whom she has the care will be involved in the proper consultation processes and their views will be taken into consideration, and that under the circumstances that will be sufficient to meet her objections through the amendment.

<A NAME="20702-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I wholly accept, and I shall be brief, what has just been said by the noble Baroness. I have been thinking about it for some time before she said it. It must be the parent or the guardian; for various reasons you cannot go outside that. Furthermore, how on earth are you going to define the proposal? Who is "another person holding responsibility"? How will that be defined? Will it be by statute or by common sense? If it is common sense, what does it mean, how wide is it? If it is by some statute, it is a statute that was not designed for this purpose.

<P>

<P>

<a name="20702-13_para0"></a>I take the point made by the Minister. I listened with great interest to what she said about the limitations of residence orders and I will bear those in mind when we discuss Clause 44 in greater depth.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para1"></a>I take the Minister's point about the need to ensure that a limited number of family members can agree to adoption, but in withdrawing the amendment I reiterate that the reality of family life and family structures is a good deal more complex now than it was in 1976. I will go away and study her words with care, but I am not absolutely and wholly convinced that she has got it wholly right. I accept that there may be limitations to the amendment, but I still believe that there is an issue there to which I may wish to return at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-13_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ADOPTION AT BIRTH OR WITHIN THREE MONTHS THEREAFTER
<br>
(1) Where an adoption agency is satisfied that each parent or guardian of a child has consented to the child being placed for adoption at birth, the adoption agency must place that child as soon as is practicable with the prospective adopters, with due regard to the birth-parents' rights to alter arrangements within time limits which shall be specified by regulations.
<br>
(2) Subject to subsection (3), where a local authority is satisfied that the consent of the parent or guardian's consent should be dispensed with, it may place the child with the prospective adopters without first obtaining a placement order, but it shall have a duty to apply for a placement order as soon as is practicable thereafter.
<br>
(3) Subsection (2) shall apply only to children under the age of three months."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20702-13_para8"></a>The noble Earl said: This new clause is designed to create a fast-track procedure for the placement and adoption of very young children. It has been remarked that the Bill is very valuable in helping to tackle the real problems of large numbers of older, looked-after children who need to be given better chances of adoption, and I am sure we all say amen to that. However, we need to remember baby adoption as well. Baby adoption has become a much smaller part of the adoption scene over the years and the traditional mother-and-baby homes, which did such a sterling job in supporting mothers whether they wished to keep their babies or to place them for adoption, are now an endangered species. There are none left in the south east of England.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para9"></a>Is the Minister satisfied with the ability of local authorities and other agencies to support mothers who choose to have their children adopted after birth? The effectiveness of those services will determine how <P>


<a name="column_GC146"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>quickly a baby can be placed after birth. There is no dispute that the sooner a baby is placed with prospective adoptive parents, the better that will be for the child. The problem of children moving between foster homes applies equally to babies. One study found that some infants under 12 months had four or more moves which were not at the request of the fosterers. The long-term effects of that are incalculable. It must be right to place a baby with adoptive parents as soon as possible. That is what the first subsection of the new clause seeks to do.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para10"></a>The second subsection relates perhaps to a minority of cases, but it allows the local authority to dispense with the consent of the parents or guardian and place a child under three months old without having first to obtain a placement order. Clearly, that would occur only in extreme circumstances, and a placement should be obtained as soon as practicable. That will facilitate the immediate placement of the baby.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para11"></a>The new clause amends the Bill in what I believe is a relatively modest way but the idea behind it is important. It would ensure that the needs of very young children are paramount. The child will be placed as rapidly as possible so that the child's life is not disfigured by one or more moves before a permanent home is found.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para12"></a>I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the intent behind the amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20702-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I rise briefly to support the noble Earl.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para13"></a>He referred to the importance of the first year or two of a child's life. I am sure that the Minister and the Committee are aware that new research over the past decade or two based on much more powerful scanners than were ever available before has enabled neurologists to look at the development of the child's brain. To give just two statistics, at birth the child already has approximately 50 trillion synapses in the brain already developed. During the first two years of life, that increases 20 times to 1,000 trillion synapses. During that period, if the child is exposed to, for example, violence, neglect or even to seeing the violence of its parents, which cause its defence mechanisms to develop, gradually those become hard-wired into the child and leave him or her with a tendency to violence, disruption, anger and an inability to control their anger. There are other things that can arise from the parenting environment in which the child lives during the first two years. I therefore enormously support the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in asking if we can devise, with due consideration of course to the rights of the parents, a way to get those baby children adopted as quickly as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   I rise briefly to support the amendment because I am concerned about the movement of very small children. It has a seriously detrimental effect on them. However, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said that this should only happen in extreme circumstances and I understand that, but will <P>


<a name="column_GC147"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>he define what he perceives as extreme circumstances under which the consent of the parent or guardian could be dispensed with?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-13_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   We, too, are very aware of the damaging effect on even very small babies of being moved from person to person and in particular the effect it has on their capacity later in life to make relationships. I am concerned about subsection (2) of the amendment. The idea of taking a child away from its parents without consent at birth resonates in people's experience in a heartrending way. There have been many people in the past whose children for one reason or another were taken from them at birth, certainly not for any reasons that, I hope, any social worker today would remove a child. The mothers of illegitimate children, for example, had their children removed from them, in some cases even before they had been allowed to see the child. There are therefore some very sensitive issues here and I hope that the noble Earl will expand a little more on them in support of what the noble Baroness has just said. Perhaps the Minister will also be able to respond to these difficult issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I rise briefly to support this measure. It is essential and it is part of the process which is not part of the Bill. As regards subsection (2), the steps of the Temple Church have for hundreds of years been a repository for unwanted babies. We have taken them in and fed them and had them nursed. There was a special nurse who used to look after them. Then I do not quite know what happened to them, but I presume that some of them were adopted. This sort of provision would enable that to be done. We still actually get one or two babies&#151;if the Committee is interested&#151;on the steps of the Temple Church. No way will you find the parent. There it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-13_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Before the Minister replies to my amendment, perhaps I could add a few more remarks to those I made earlier in response to questions that have been raised.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para14"></a>I have been asked about the circumstances in which subsection (2) would be triggered. One of the sets of circumstances would be those to which my noble friend Lord Campbell has helpfully alluded, where one has a very young child who has been abandoned and nobody can trace the parents. It seems to me that that kind of case is one where a placement should be made, albeit unofficially, as soon as possible for the child's own benefit.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para15"></a>I readily concede, however, that the subsection should be expanded and enlarged. As it stands, it raises the spectre of local authorities taking babies away willy-nilly without due cause. There is no test that is specified or anything like that.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para16"></a>I hope that the Minister will regard the amendment very much in the nature of a probe. Clearly, the kinds of case that I had in mind were where the child was at risk of significant harm. There is nothing final about what the subsection suggests. There is no question of <P>


<a name="column_GC148"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an adoption order being made without parental consent, or anything like that. It is simply for the benefit of the child to be put out of harm's way.
<P>

<a name="20702-13_para17"></a>If, as I concede, the Minister feels that the subsection is not adequate as it stands, nevertheless, work can be done on it. I hope that it will provide a useful hook for debate&#151;it already has&#151;and that the Minister will see the merit of the intent, if not the letter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-14_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   It is such a relief to have someone else being quizzed on their amendment. Speaking on behalf of my noble friend Lady Gould, I thank the noble Earl very much for that description of how the subsection might be improved. I am hesitant to abandon my speaking notes because they go further than the proposed new clause.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para0"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that he mentioned an interesting matter. We know more about the brain now. We have learned more about the brain in the past five years than in the past 50 years. There is some extremely interesting research on childhood development which emphasises the importance of getting these processes absolutely right with due regard both to the welfare of the mother, but particularly to the welfare of the child.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para1"></a>It has been a thoughtful and moving debate. I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for giving us the opportunity to have such a debate. I am sorry to hear that children are still being abandoned on the steps of the Temple Church. That is a matter for grave reflection.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para2"></a>I turn to the impact of the amendment. Let me stress that absolutely nothing divides Members on any side of the Committee as regards the motivation to make the safe care, placement and adoption of very small babies as speedy and as secure as possible. That is definitely the intent of the Bill. It is an exceptionally important issue, despite the fact that the Bill has been devised to modify adoption requirements. That need has arisen due to the difficulty of placing older children who are in care, and due to changes in society which have resulted in there being fewer younger children available for adoption. However, that does not mean that they are any less important, far from it.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para3"></a>The proposed new clause addresses that issue. Indeed, in the other place, the Government also tabled amendments to make provision for the cases we are discussing. If I may, I will explain how we have already strengthened the Bill in that respect in relation to some of the noble Earl's concerns.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para4"></a>I want to demonstrate that the Bill's provisions allow, in a genuinely appropriate manner, bearing in mind the range of interventions that are possible, for the placement of a child after adoption. We do not know how many small children are voluntarily relinquished at birth for adoption. However, we do know that there is a change in attitude towards single motherhood and that numbers are fewer.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para5"></a>Clause 51(3) provides:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any consent given by the mother to the making of an adoption order is ineffective if it is given less than six weeks after the child's birth".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-14_para6"></a><P>


<a name="column_GC149"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
That is intended to ensure that, in the crucial period after giving birth, for the next six weeks the mother is not harassed in any way to give consent for the adoption. The mother needs time to think and to talk to supportive people around her, whether they are from family or the appropriate agencies. Medical and social work advice must be given continuously for that minimum period before the mother gives formal legal consent. We have built in that protection for the young mother.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para7"></a>However, like the noble Earl, we believe that it is very important to enable babies to be placed for adoption when very young, as securely as possible, when it is in the best interests of the child. We are already taking action under current legislation to try to ensure that that happens. The National Adoption Standards set a clear timetable for finding a new family for a child under six months where a parent has requested that he or she be placed for adoption. That is a significant advance.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para8"></a>We have also stated that a match with suitable prospective adopters should be identified and approved by the adoption panel within three months of the agency agreeing that adoption is in the child's best interests. It is a short timetable but, given the number of families that are looking to adopt small babies, a realistic one. The Government have made it clear to local authorities that we expect those timetables to be met by 1st April next year.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para9"></a>We expect the majority of children to be matched more quickly than that. It inevitably takes longer to find an appropriate match for a child with specialist needs or a mental or physical disability. However, for other children, we expect a great deal of work to be done with the birth parent before the birth of the child. That is how it should be and that is what we expect. The draft practice guidance to support the National Adoption Standards encourages as much counselling and support as possible to be given to the birth parent before the birth. That will obviously raise questions as to whether there are people within the wider family who can adopt the child. It will ensure that the mother will know all the options and will not feel that she is being pushed into a corner where there is only one choice.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para10"></a>It is important that the new legislation does what it can to support the rapid placement for adoption where that is in the child's best interest. That is exactly what the proposed new clause and the Bill's provisions seek to achieve.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para11"></a>The proposed new clause seeks to tackle two situations: first, to enable baby placements where the parents consent; and, secondly, to allow for placement where there is no consent. Let me set out how we propose to address both those options. As to the first situation, we entirely agree that, notwithstanding what I said earlier about the six-week time limit for giving formal consent, it is important to provide a route for rapid placement where the parents agree and the agency agrees that it is in the interests of the child.
<P>


<a name="column_GC150"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para12"></a>Clause 17(1) allows adoption agencies to place a child under six weeks for adoption without the formal consent given under Clause 18 for the reasons I have given. They will do so with the agreement of the parents. The arrangements for securing the agreement will be set out in regulations and guidance. As to in-depth counselling and so on, we will be able to consult with the agencies on the nature of those consultations.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para13"></a>These provisions will allow young babies to be placed for adoption quickly, within that critical six-week period, provided that all the safeguards have been met. Once the six-week period is up, however, the agency has to secure formal consent and if it fails to do so the authority to place will cease unless the agency is a local authority and feels that a placement order would be justified&#151;and there is no parental consent.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para14"></a>In the meantime, such placements have to be entirely voluntary and the provisions in Clauses 25 and 26 for securing contact apply to those placements as they do in all others under Chapter 3. Adoption agencies are under the same duties in respect of these young placements as they are for everything else. The only major difference, which is a safeguard again for the birth parent, is that during that critical six weeks before formal consent is obtained, parental responsibility is not shared with the agency or with the prospective adoptive parents. We believe that it is not appropriate for that major decision of giving parental consent away in any sense to take place before the six-week period. In a way, that reinforces our problem with the present construction of subsection (2) of the new clause.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para15"></a>Clauses 29 and 30 provide that the parents can request the return of the baby at any time and the agency must return the child within seven days of any request unless a placement order has been applied for. What we have tried to achieve, therefore, is both speed in terms of the situation of the child and also safeguards on the rights of the parents not to be harassed, to have the right support and to make the right decision. However, after six weeks, the proper consent has to be obtained. In the meantime, that young mother is entirely responsible for her child.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para16"></a>This brings me to the second situation, which, as Members of the Committee have already indicated, is where there are considerable issues and I am grateful for the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas. As I read it, local authorities can place children for adoptions without parents' consent where they are satisfied it should be dispensed with, pending the resolution of a later application. That cuts across the principle set out in the Children Act, that there needs to be a clear threshold before the state intervenes in family life; before it takes such a drastic step. That should be sanctioned by a court, not left to an administrative decision. Even if it is for a short time, it still needs to be done with the sanction of the court and those processes need to be followed.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para17"></a>The noble Earl's clause would enable placement against the parents' wishes purely as a result of an administrative decision by a local authority with court sanction, though there would be no guarantee that the <P>


<a name="column_GC151"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>court would not reverse the authority's judgment in that. The combination of the Bill's provision and the Children Act, therefore, already provides an appropriate route in those unfortunate cases where the local authority genuinely believes that it has to take rapid action for the safety of the child after birth. Where it feels that a child is at risk, it can apply immediately for emergency protection orders, for an interim care order, and it could after six weeks, and with the consent of the parent, apply for a placement order to follow on shortly.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para18"></a>In such cases, it be aware in advance that there was a potential threat to the child. Social workers know these cases, by and large. They know the family history, the situation of siblings and the relationship, so they would, in the great majority of cases, know the situation that they were dealing with&#151;often, sadly, because of what has happened to other children in the family. They ought therefore to be able to assemble much of their case. If they have to make an application shortly after the child is born, I know that the courts will be making every effort to resolve those issues quickly for all the reasons that Members of the Committee have given.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para19"></a>I believe that the noble Earl's proposal goes too far in these cases at the moment. In addition, there may not always be an appropriate family available so we need flexibility to allow for initial short-term foster care.
I was however very struck by the evidence about the frequent movement of those children, which is obviously not something that we want to see. It also allows time for the adoptive parents to be found&#151;and that may take longer.
<P>

<a name="20702-14_para20"></a>I am grateful to the noble Earl for his offer to reconsider the clause in the light of what has been said. There is additional help available to plan concurrently for these situations, which makes it clear with very young birth parents and prospective adopters that there are parallel ways of looking at what might be done. If Members of the Committee would like further information about that, I would be very happy to provide it. I hope that under the circumstances the noble Earl will feel happy to withdraw the amendment and I am grateful to those who have spoken in this debate.

<A NAME="20702-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, I should like to ask for absolute clarification on one point. Does this mean that under Clause 51(3) in no circumstances could a child be placed in a home with a view to adoption under six weeks? I think of the situations described by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, where there may be another court order under the Children Act; for example, where a mother may have failed to protect previous children from significant harm and there is a real danger for the child. Surely we would then want to prevent that child being moved from one place to another and there are <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   No, the Bill does not prevent that happening. It simply provides that during that six-week period the relevant agency will look at what is in the best interests of the child for that period. It may be that he will be placed with a foster parent or in a care home on a temporary basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-15_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, for that helpful intervention. I also thank all Members of the Committee who have spoken in this useful debate, particularly the Minister for her gentle reply to me. She fully understands the motivation behind the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para0"></a>I have my doubts about the extent of the expertise present in some, if not many, local authorities to deal with the concerns of mothers who wish to have their very young children adopted, perhaps even before the baby is born. There is a need for a service for women with unplanned pregnancies. The fact is that some women do not want to have the baby they are expecting, nor do they want to have an abortion. Baby adoptions run currently at around 200 a year from care. Most of those entries into care and adoptions will not have been planned properly or very well at all. There is very little social work expertise left in this field and it is very difficult for women to get help while they are pregnant.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para1"></a>I think back particularly to an extraordinarily interesting meeting that the All Party Group on Adoption, of which I am a member, had last November when we heard from an organisation called ASIST&#151;Adoption Support in Society Today. The representative of the organisation explained its role. It is a voluntary, independent adoption support group formed in 1993. It runs a telephone helpline and it became a registered charity last year. Its aims are to make people aware of adoption as an acceptable choice and as a successful alternative for a mother and child. Although ASIST is a very small organisation based in Somerset, calls come in from all around the country and, indeed, sometimes even from abroad. Most of the callers said that they knew nothing about the way adoption works or who to turn to for assistance in answering their questions. Those who tried to seek advice from midwives, medical social workers or GPs invariably found that those people did not know the answers, even to basic questions such as: "What happens if I decide to have my baby adopted?".
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para2"></a>Others reported a negative response of the kind that said: "It is very early days, you will change your mind by the time the baby is born". Many mothers may indeed change their minds but, at the time of the inquiry the response they received was probably a euphemism for, "I don't know the answer", or perhaps even indicated a judgmental attitude, which, I am sorry to say, is common to a number of healthcare and social work professionals who simply do not agree with the idea of adoption at all. It was stated to us that they knew of social services departments which <P>


<a name="column_GC153"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>claimed that baby adoption was not part of their ethos, and there were others who said that there was not really a call for that kind of service, despite it being a statutory obligation to provide it.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para3"></a>The number of babies being adopted from care was stated to be 200 under the age of one and 1,600 between the ages of one and four during the year 2000. That suggested to us that social workers and other professionals are over-optimistic about the ability of teenagers or other single mothers to parent. Had they been properly counselled and received support and encouragement in their decision, some infants might have been prevented from being in the care system at all. So it was against that kind of background that the amendment was tabled.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para4"></a>I do not believe that it cuts across Clause 51(3) because it does not refer to an adoption order. The second subsection, at least, refers to a placement order. The first subsection, of course, refers to adoption but with the consent process built in. I understand where in that context Clause 51(3) cuts in, but I do not believe that what the noble Baroness said dealt with the issue, for example, of foundling children. Furthermore, although she referred to interim care orders, she did not fully take on board the fact that local authorities already have the power to come into a mother's hospital bedroom and take babies away at birth. They do so only for very good reason, where there is a perceived risk of significant harm, but the device of obtaining an interim care order or an emergency protection order is there.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para5"></a>The point I sought to make in my earlier remarks was that putting a baby in that position and then shunting the baby from pillar to post thereafter is a deeply unsatisfactory process. Why not recognise that there are rare cases where babies need to be protected from harm and try to create stability from day one?
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para6"></a>A possible amendment to my amendment in subsection (2) might be to say that the procedure I suggest could take place only with the leave of the court, or something like that. However, I shall give the matter some further thought. I should like to conclude by thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, for their helpful remarks earlier on in the debate. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-15_para10"></a><P>

<a name="20702-15_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: I rise to move this amendment, the meaning of which is self-evident, conscious of the fact that the Minister made some reference to this matter in reply to an earlier group of <P>


<a name="column_GC154"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments. I would like to make sure that we are satisfied that every parent, guardian or other person holding parental responsibility is searched for and contacted.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para12"></a>This is perhaps a little beside the point, but I learned something recently which everybody else in this room may already know; namely, that in some families of African origin, but not all of them, the responsibility for the family goes down the mother's line; in others, it goes down the father's line. In many cases in such families, the natural person to take over the care of a child, if the mother's care fails, is the grandmother. My noble friend has referred previously to the importance of grandmothers.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para13"></a>I realise that that is slightly beyond the point, but there is a tradition in some communities as regards who holds subsidiary parental responsibility, as it were. There is a real meaning to those words, at least in some communities, although perhaps not in all. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I support the amendment, save, of course, for the reasons I gave about other persons holding parental responsibility. But it is obviously an important addition to have in the statute that every effort should be made in this regard. I think that that is a constructive amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   I agree with what my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway has said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-15_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I fully appreciate the intention behind the amendment, which we touched on in an earlier debate. The amendment aims to ensure that the court cannot make a placement order unless every effort has been made to notify the parents and everyone else with parental responsibility. The arrangements for notification are set out in Clause 136, which provides that the court rules must require certain persons to be notified of the date and place where the placement order application will be heard and of the fact that unless the person wishes or the court requires, the person need not attend. That is clear.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para14"></a>The people who have to be notified are those whose consent is needed for the making of the placement order, in so far as they can be found. Under the Bill, the people whose consent is required are first, the natural parents who have parental responsibility. Under the Children Act 1989, mothers have automatic parental responsibility, as do married fathers. Unmarried fathers can acquire parental responsibility either by marrying the mother of their child, or, under Clause 4 of the Bill, by agreement with the mother or by a court order. Under Clause 108 of the Bill they will also acquire parental responsibility automatically where they jointly register the birth with the mother.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para15"></a>Secondly, as we said previously, any guardian of the child. That means a guardian who may be appointed under Section 5 of the Children Act to act in the event of the parent's death. Once the Bill becomes law, this will also include a special guardian. Those are the only <P>


<a name="column_GC155"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people who can consent to the adoption of the child, as we have said, or to a placement order or to an adoption order.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para16"></a>Other people may have parental responsibility, and indeed it is possible for parental responsibility to be shared. But, as we said earlier, it would not be appropriate for those people who are not the parents of the child or the guardians to consent to adoption or to a placement order.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para17"></a>The sharing of responsibility comes into play, for example through a care order where a local authority has parental responsibility. But under the current legislation a local authority cannot give legal consent to the adoption, nor would it be appropriate for it to do so. The same argument that we reiterated earlier holds where the child is under a residence order made in favour of someone other than a parent.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para18"></a>Clause 136&#151;and this comes to the point which was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas&#151;provides that if none of the persons whose consent is required can be found, then any relative prescribed in the court rules who can be found should be notified instead. "Relative" is defined in Clause 139, and means in relation to a child, their grandparents, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles, whether by full blood, half blood or by marriage. Those are the people who formally should receive notice of the placement order hearing.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para19"></a>The question has been raised as regards the position where the parents are separated, or one cannot be found. The agency needs the consent of all parents with parental responsibilities to placement for adoption. If one or other of them cannot be found, the agency will have to take all reasonable steps to find the other parent. Where it cannot find the other parent, the agency will have to consider seriously if it is still in the best interests of the child to be adopted. Those would be the sorts of cases where the agency would seek the guidance of the court. If we have a situation where one or neither parent can be found, there is obviously a serious issue to be resolved on behalf of the child.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para20"></a>I want to reassure the Committee that that is not the end of the story. I anticipate that the concern may be to ensure that other individuals holding parental responsibility&#151;people who are significant in terms of the child, as we discussed earlier&#151;are also properly involved in the adoption process. It is certainly our intention that they should be. When an adoption agency is considering whether a child ought to be placed for adoption, and therefore whether it should apply for a placement order, it will be bound by the duties set out in Clause 1. That includes, in Clause 1(4)(f), considering the child's relationship with any relatives, and with any others who may be of significance to the child.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para21"></a>The agency has to consider the wishes and feelings of these people, and their ability to care for the child and offer him a stable and secure home. That is part of the process of care and identification that occurs before the issue of placement order or adoption is even considered. The process will be set out in the adoption <P>


<a name="column_GC156"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agency regulations and in the guidance. In that respect it will follow the Adoption Agency Regulations 1983 which already set out that as part of the consideration the agency must establish whether there are any holders of parental responsibility under Section 4 of the Children Act.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para22"></a>In considering the placement order, the court will have access to the agency report on the recommended placement, which will in future, as the current Schedule 2 report does, cover the child's relationship with his family and others of significance to him, and report on any alternatives to adoption considered. The court will also be bound by the duties under Clause 1(4)(f)in a similar manner to the agency, and will have to consider the child's relationship with his relatives and anyone else of significance to him. The court also has to consider, under Clause 1(6), all the alternatives to adoption.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para23"></a>I hope I have reassured the Committee that, while we do not consider that there needs to be formal notification given to all those with parental responsibility for the reasons given, we are clear that the views and wishes of all those with a significant relationship with the child must be considered by the court and by adoption agencies well before any court proceedings take place.
<P>

<a name="20702-15_para24"></a>To reiterate the point about unmarried fathers, under the 1983 adoption agency regulations the local authority must make reasonable efforts to contact the unmarried father if it thinks it is in the child's best interest. We will place a similar requirement on agencies in the new regulations to be bound by good practice in that respect.

<A NAME="20702-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   The Minister has given a very full and sympathetic response to the amendment which has covered all the situations mentioned in our brief debate. I thank the noble Lords, Lord Campbell of Alloway and Lord Astor of Hever, for supporting the amendment. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, still does not recognise legally the existence of other persons holding parental responsibility. However, I am comforted by the fact that the Minister takes a marginally different view on the matter.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para0"></a>There is an issue in relation to fathers who deliberately absent themselves from a relationship on the birth of a child so as not to damage the interests of the child and may be difficult to contact for that reason.

<a name="20702-16_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 56 I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 60, 61 and 68. Clause 20(4)(a) relates to a placement order continuing until it is revoked under Section 23. Amendment No. 56 would require that it should be revoked either <P>


<a name="column_GC157"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when a child is returned to local authority care by the prospective adoptive family or at the will of the adoption agency. This would mean that the child's case is examined closely at the revocation. Otherwise, the danger is that the child comes out of an adoptive placement and drifts in the care system without a proper plan in place.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para4"></a>The very fact of the placement coming to an end means that the child will have had a very difficult time. First there was the hope of a permanent family who would love and cherish the child; then a period of deep disillusionment when those hopes were going wrong; and then the finality of the relationship breaking down to such an extent that it had to come to an end. A child cannot come out of that unscathed. It is only right that the placement order comes to an end after which the child can be properly reassessed to ensure the best planning for his or her future.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para5"></a>Amendment No. 61 attempts to strengthen the right of appeal or review throughout the system. Clause 23(2) gives the right of an application to revoke a placement order to the child and the local authority but not to others&#151;for example, the birth family or the adoptive family&#151;without the court's leave. However, subsection (3) then cuts off the avenue of gaining the court's leave by saying that there has to have been a change in circumstances. The birth family might have wanted to revoke it from the start but would now have to prove some substantial changes in the lives of those affected. The removal of this section would allow the birth or adoptive family to ask the court's leave to revoke the placement without having to prove any change in circumstance. Amendment No. 60 is in line with Amendments Nos. 56 and 61.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para6"></a>Placement orders do not specify the putting of a child into a particular family. A child can be placed with any family that the adoption agency sees fit. This could in theory mean that a child with a placement order might not be in an adoptive placement but in a temporary foster placement awaiting an adoptive placement.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para7"></a>Amendment No. 68 attempts to redress that danger if&#151;in the circumstances envisaged in Clause 34, where a child's placement for adoption breaks down&#151;the child would return to care, and that is likely to be a fostering arrangement, and be in peril of drifting in the system. The amendment would force the authorities and the courts to examine the child's case, and if adoption still seemed appropriate for the child&#151;it may not, as any placement breakdown is extremely damaging to all concerned&#151;a new placement order would have to be sought.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para8"></a>If adoption agencies know that they would have to establish the case for adoption again, it is more likely that they would work harder to find the right placement the first time and ensure that they support that placement to the best of their ability. It would also encourage the proper giving of information to prospective adopters. The lack of this is a huge contributor to breakdown because, if people are not forewarned of the circumstances of a child's past, there is little hope that they will be able to plan for and deal <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   As we have gone through this afternoon discussing the various amendments, I have been impressed by how deeply and seriously people feel about what happens to children before the process of placement, during placement and following the outcome. That is certainly reflected in this group of amendments with their expression of concern about drift and the implicit delay in what happens to children. It is to the credit of all noble Lords that we return to this issue time and again.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para9"></a>These amendments concern what should happen to placement orders when an adoptive placement is terminated, and they also cover the circumstances in which orders may be revoked. We are aware of concerns that authorities might not always act in some of these situations and that they might allow children to drift on placement orders. I shall try to address some of those points.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para10"></a>I shall try to describe the amendments as we understand them. Amendments Nos. 56, 60 and 68 concern what should happen in circumstances in which an adoptive placement under a placement order breaks down, either because the prospective adopters return the child, which can certainly happen, or because the local authority itself decides to remove the child from the placement.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para11"></a>The amendments address a substantive issue for the reasons that many noble Lords have already given. What we are trying to achieve in the Bill is security of placement. That is why we want to bring the process of negotiation with the birth parents further forward to an early stage where everyone knows the options and what is in the best interests of the child. We would expect the local authority to review this situation very thoroughly, and, when there is a breakdown, to determine whether they still believe that the child should be placed for adoption and whether there is an alternative. There may be something in the situation itself which contributes to the breakdown and means that adoption is no longer appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para12"></a>If the local authority concludes that the child should no longer be placed for adoption, it can discharge the placement order. That is a very powerful safeguard, especially when it is combined with the new independent reviewing officer system which is coming in with the amendments to the Children Act under Clause 117.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para13"></a>We are also trying to avoid being too rigid in primary legislation, simply because of the variety of circumstances. That is one reason why we have advocated that there should be the concept of placement without a placement order. It comes back to the arguments we had at the beginning of the Sitting. There may be a great deal of difference between a case in which the adopters decide to return a child&#151;it may be a very difficult child; there may be all sorts of <P>


<a name="column_GC159"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasons&#151;and a case in which the local authority decides to end the placement because it has made a bad judgment about the prospective adopters.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para14"></a>It may be that the local authority is clear that the child should still be placed for adoption and that it is a question of finding the right family. In that case, it would be neither helpful nor in the interests of the child to require the local authority to return to the court. It is a part of the argument for delay, but it can also be argued that we need flexibility to allow the agencies to reconsider some of the options that they have which do not involve the court process.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para15"></a>I take the points made earlier by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about the variable practices in local authorities as regards the specific provision made for young mothers and so on. However, in their role as adoption agencies&#151;the National Adoption Standards will help in this regard&#151; properly regulated and performance-managed, with the raft of measures in Clause 1, to which my noble friend Lord Hunt referred, they will have the appropriate skills and scope to undertake the detailed management of adoptive placement and to decide what is best for the child.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para16"></a>We should show some confidence in that capability and not require them to be second guessed by the courts. It will be very undermining, not to say demoralising, if at the back of every decision the local authority makes is a sense that the court will come to the rescue. It inhibits best practice, if anything.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para17"></a>That balanced approach is taken in the Children Act&#151;again, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones is not in his place to hear me say the word "balanced"&#151;and it is appropriate in this legislation.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para18"></a>Amendment No. 56 would require that an existing placement order is automatically discharged when a child is either returned by the prospective adopters under Clause 34(1) or where the decision has been taken to remove the child. Amendment No. 60 would, in the same circumstances, require the local authority to apply for another placement order if it still considered that to be the right choice for the child. Amendment No. 68 is linked and would require any existing placement order to be discharged either when the prospective adopters decided they wished to return the child or the agency decided for itself that it was not satisfied with the adopters and it notified them that the child must be returned.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para19"></a>The net effect would be that where the child was placed for adoption under a placement order and it broke down, the existing placement order would automatically be discharged and everyone would go back to the court. That would reduce the flexibility of the Bill.

<a name="20702-16_para20"></a>As it is currently drafted the Bill provides for local authorities to do what is in the best interests of the child and allows them to consider all the options. We would expect the agency thoroughly to review the case and to consider whether there are options other than adoption.

<a name="20702-16_para21"></a>If the child has been placed for adoption under a placement order and the authority considers that that is still the best option, it can then act swiftly and use the same authority and the same placement order to place the child in another setting; it does not have to go back to the court, with the associated delay and distress. It is a very distressing business for a child to know that, whatever decision has been taken, he is once again involved in a trip back to the court. Even if the child is quite young, he will be aware of its significance. We should bear that in mind.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para22"></a>The general authorisation to place, given by placement order, was widely welcomed in the detailed consultation on placement conducted by the previous administration. The responses were strongly in favour of general rather than specific placement orders because they give additional flexibility. The purpose of placement orders, therefore, is for the court to decide that placement for adoption is in the best interests of the child. The judgment is that while the quality of the placement is absolutely essential, the identity of the prospective adopters need not be absolutely satisfied, either when the child is already placed or possibly where a suitable match has provisionally been identified. The court is being asked to take a decision in principle that the child ought to be placed, not with whom the child should be placed. That is the focus of the placement order.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para23"></a>These amendments create an additional, unnecessary inflexibility, and I hope that I have made the arguments clear to noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para24"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 61, which deals with the related issue of the conditions that have to be met before an application may be made by anyone other than a child or the local authority to discharge a placement order. Clause 23 provides for placement orders to be revoked on application to the court. The local authority can apply to revoke a placement order at any time. That is to allow for all eventualities which might arise when the local authority considers that the child should no longer be adopted, circumstances having changed.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para25"></a>A child, or someone acting on his behalf, can also apply at any time for a placement order to be revoked. That adds considerable flexibility. Otherwise, an application to revoke a placement order may be made only with the leave of the court, and if the child is not yet placed for adoption. The court may grant leave only if there has been a significant change in the birth parents' circumstances since the order was made. Anyone may apply for leave, including the child's birth parents.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para26"></a>Amendment No. 61 would obviously remove the test that there must be a significant change of circumstances before the court could grant leave to apply to discharge a placement order. The requirement that there must have been a change of circumstances before the parents or others might apply is intended precisely to prevent the court from being invited simply to repeal the deliberations that have taken place. The considerations will have been mulled over at different stages of the process.

<a name="20702-16_para27"></a>It seems unfair to us to expect that decision to be reversed unless there is a significant change of circumstances to which people can point and say, "A decision is justified on those grounds".
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para28"></a>In making the placement order, the court will already have been obliged by Clause 1 to consider all the alternatives and to take account of the views of the child's relatives and their capacity to provide a stable and secure environment. The placement order will reflect that.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para29"></a>We believe that it is right in the interests of promoting the security of the child, that the court should consider whether those circumstances have changed before it looks at whether or not to reverse that decision. The alternative would be that at any stage after the making of the order, before the child was placed for adoption, the parents or anybody else would seek leave as if nothing had changed. It would merely cater to whim.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para30"></a>As we are concerned about disruption, I believe that that would be needlessly disruptive. The provision is a way not only of minimising that, but also of collectively saving time and resources, and having regard to the processes that are gone through, and particularly the impact on the child. One of the main aims of the process is to try to increase security.
<P>

<a name="20702-16_para31"></a>Despite the thoughtfulness of the amendments, I hope that Members of the Committee will understand why we are not minded to think that they are an improvement to the Bill in that form.

<FONT SIZE=3>another place, Jacqui Smith, but having read her words, I do not understand why a placement order should stay in force and then be revoked when an adoption order is made, but not when a special guardianship order is made.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para5"></a>I realise that we have not so far in our deliberations spent much time on special guardianship and I know that we will do so later. My broad understanding of special guardianship, as I read it in the Bill, was that it was not a placement but a new form of relationship which is&#151;I hesitate to say on a par with adoption but which has clear continuing ties to birth parents. As I read it, it was one of the clearest things in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para6"></a>I cannot therefore understand why an adoption order should lead to the revocation of a special placement order and a special guardianship order should not. I do not understand from the Minister's answer in another place why it was felt necessary that there should be recourse to the courts to revoke a placement order in the case of special guardianship, but not for adoption. Therefore, this is a probing amendment to ascertain the status of special guardianship with regard to placement. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I understand that this is a probing amendment and, of course, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, suggested, we will be debating special guardianship orders in detail later. However, it might be useful if at this stage I explain briefly what these are and how the provisions relating to them and to placement will work, before responding to the specific probing amendment that the noble Baroness has put forward. Clause 112 of the Bill makes provision for a new special guardianship order under the Children Act 1989. I stress that this is under the Children Act 1989 and not under the Adoption and Children Bill that we are now considering.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para7"></a>The idea of a new status was proposed in the Performance and Innovation Unit report following the Prime Minister's Adoption Review in July 2000 and received widespread support in the public consultation that followed. The Government subsequently gave a commitment in the White Paper, Adoption: A New Approach, to develop a new legal option called special guardianship, which is aimed at meeting the needs of children for whom adoption is not appropriate, but who could still benefit from a permanent, legally secure placement.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para8"></a>We know that children value the sense of legal security and permanence that can come with a court order. The intention is therefore to give the special guardian clear responsibility for all the day-to-day decisions about caring for the child or young person and for taking decisions about his or her upbringing. But unlike adoption, the order retains the basic legal link with the birth parents. They remain legally the child's parents, though their ability to exercise their parental responsibility is limited. The birth parents retain the right to consent or not to consent to the child's adoption or placement for adoption.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para9"></a>The White Paper suggested that special guardianship might be appropriate for some older children who may, for example, be being looked after <P>


<a name="column_GC163"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in long-term foster placements and who do not wish to be legally separated from their birth parents but could benefit from greater legal security and permanence. It might be appropriate for some children being cared for on a permanent basis by members of their wider family. Additionally, some minority ethnic communities have religious or cultural difficulties with adoption as set out in law.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para10"></a>In those circumstances at present, such children would probably be looked after either by local authority foster parents or informally. Where adoption is not appropriate, the only alternative legally secure option available is a residence order.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para11"></a>The new order is intended to offer more than a residence order in terms of the security it brings and the support package that may be provided. It is designed to be flexible enough to work in a range of situations&#151;including, for example, where there is extensive and regular contact with the birth family&#151;and in instances where that would not be appropriate but where it is nevertheless desirable to retain the basic legal link between the child and the parent.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para12"></a>The Government want to see this new order used successfully. Therefore, we are placing in the Bill a duty on local authorities to make arrangements to provide support services for special guardianship placements. We anticipate that these support services will operate in a similar manner to adoption support services.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para13"></a>The new provisions have been widely welcomed as offering a positive new option for delivering permanence for children. We intend to consult widely on the rules, regulations and guidance that will accompany the implementation of these provisions.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para14"></a>As for the relationship between special guardianship orders and placement orders, Clause 28(5) provides that where a placement order is in force, no special guardianship order may be made. We come to the nub of the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. The reason for this is that where a placement order has been made, the court has taken a decision that the child ought to be placed for adoption, having considered all the alternatives, which would include special guardianship, and having considered the views and wishes of those who have significant relationships with the child, in line with the duties set out in Clause 1.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para15"></a>One of the intentions of the placement system is to increase the stability and security for prospective adopters and for children placed for adoption once the decision to place has been made by shifting the point of that decision to earlier in the adoption process. We have already discussed some aspects of that. Where that decision has been properly made&#151;in this case by a court making a placement order&#151;we believe that the placement should be protected. That is why we consider that applications for special guardianship orders, seeking in effect to reverse the placement decision, are not appropriate while the placement order is in force.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para16"></a>If there are problems with placing the child or if the situation changes such that a placement for adoption is no longer in their best interest, the right course of <P>


<a name="column_GC164"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>action would be in the first instance for an application to be made to discharge the placement order under Clause 23. We do not believe that it is appropriate for that decision to be made by default as a result of a special guardianship application.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para17"></a>However, we do believe that it is appropriate that where a child is under a placement order, but where the parent or guardian of a child had the leave of the court under Clause 46 to oppose the making of a final adoption order, they are also permitted to make an application, if they wish, for a special guardianship order to be considered at the final adoption hearing as an alternative to the proposed adoption. This is provided for in Clause 28(5)(a) and (b). Others who are entitled to do so may also make application for residence orders or special guardianship orders to be considered at the final adoption order hearing as alternatives to adoption, provided that they secure the leave of the court to do so.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para18"></a>The court is free, at the final adoption order hearing, to discharge the placement order if it decides not to make an adoption order, but some alternative such as a special guardianship order should be made instead. This is set out in Clause 23(4).
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para19"></a>I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that the special guardianship order needs to be considered at the appropriate place. However, once a placement order has been made, it is made in the context that the end result of that will indeed be adoption.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I believe it was helpful not only to me but to other noble Lords as well. The status of special guardianship and adoption was perhaps not as clear as we thought.
<P>

<a name="20702-17_para20"></a>I understand the Minister's comment about placement orders being specifically a matter for adoption. Following what he said, I did not get the sense that a special guardianship application at the stage of the final adoption hearing is working towards the same end described earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, in which everyone involved has an opportunity to consider options&#151;rather than a situation in which the final adoption hearing is essentially a high noon when everyone faces a fait accompli. I understood that, although special guardianship and adoption orders are not interchangeable, they are certainly on a par in terms of their permanence.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Are there not two points here? First, when it comes to making a placement order, clearly a special guardianship order is an option that the court may consider when deciding whether to agree to a placement order. Secondly, when one reaches the final adoption hearing, if&#151;as we know&#151;the parent has already given consent and the court gives leave to the parent, they may come before the court to argue against an adoption order being made. At that stage, the argument may then be put that a special guardianship order might be more appropriate.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-18_para1"></a><P>

"( ) A placement order must be reviewed by the court two years after it is issued if, at that time, it continues in force."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20702-18_para2"></a>The noble Earl said: Clause 20(4) envisages three sets of circumstances in which a placement order can come to an end. They are: when the order is revoked under Section 23; when an adoption order is made in respect to the child; or when the child marries or attains the age of 18 years.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para3"></a>When I first read the Bill, I formed a view that the provisions for placement orders represented a significant step forward as a mechanism to replace what we have had up to now, which are freeing-up orders. The procedures surrounding placement orders are certainly a major step forward in most aspects, but in one respect I have concerns. What the Government and indeed all of us are seeking to get away from is the situation where a child might find himself in indefinite limbo, neither with his birth parents nor adopted but floating around in the care system.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para4"></a>As Clause 24 reads, that undesirable situation could recur. There is no time limit to a placement order and we have to ask what happens if, despite the provisions of Clause 1, there is a delay in making an adoption order. There ought to be an automatic, in-built check in the system to ensure that children are not left in limbo, which is why my amendment proposes that there should be a review by the court at the two-year point after the placement order had been first made. Unless there is such a check, placement orders will not be seen as such a marked improvement upon the outdated freeing-up orders. I hope that the Minister can give me some reassurance on this point and I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I am very glad to hear the noble Earl, Lord Howe, agreeing with us that it is good to see the end of freeing orders. He talked about the consignment of a child to limbo and there was nothing more designed to put a child in limbo than a freeing order, which left him without any legal parents whatever. The placement order is clearly an improvement upon that and the purpose of the Bill is very much to create that framework, where everyone knows what legal rights there are and what processes can be followed.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para5"></a>I appreciate that the amendment is aimed at tackling the situation where after two years the child has not been placed. Indeed, we are back to tackling drift here but we ought to bear in mind that we would certainly expect the local authorities to leave no child to drift for six weeks, let alone six months, let alone two years. We would expect the local authority to be reviewing this placement regularly. We would expect it to review the plan for adoption and this starts now very early on.
<P>


<a name="column_GC166"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para6"></a>The current regulations from the Adoption Agencies' Regulations 1983 require a review after four weeks and at six monthly intervals thereafter. We intend similar obligations to be placed on authorities through the new regulations that will be made, so we are building in this requirement under regulations for regular and early review. Where a child has not been placed after two years, we would obviously expect the authority to be asking itself whether this route into adoption was appropriate. The reasons it is difficult to place children for adoption are many and complex and it may be that there are other and better routes for that child, given its circumstances. In such a situation, therefore, we obviously go back to the overriding concern for the paramountcy of the welfare of the child and all the other provisions in Clause 1.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para7"></a>However, if the authority decided that placement for adoption and the plan for adoption was no longer in the child's best interests, under Clause 23, it can apply to revoke the order at any point. If there are problems when a child is placed, we would expect the local authority to act and where it considered the problem sufficiently serious to make a change of plan, we would expect it to discharge the placement order.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para8"></a>We are aware that one cannot afford, and would not want to be complacent in this situation about all authorities reaching for best practice. Authorities do not always act and we have to guard against drift. Therefore, Clause 23 allows the child, or indeed someone acting on his behalf, to apply to discharge the placement order at any point. That could be social services, a social care worker, or a range of people acting to safeguard the interests of the child.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para9"></a>That we see as providing a powerful safeguard but it does not stand alone. It also stands with a new independent reviewing officer system that is introduced through our amendments to the Children Act in Clause 115. That also covers children in adoptive placement and, when we reach that clause, I am sure that we shall have a longer debate on its implications and strengths.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para10"></a>Where a placement is not going well to the extent that the reviewing officer becomes concerned and the local authority does not act to rectify the situation, the reviewing officer will be able to refer the case on to CAFCASS, if it considers that the child's human rights may be at risk. CAFCASS could then apply, on behalf of the child, for the discharge of the placement order.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para11"></a>Therefore, we have in place a series of safeguards; we have the regulations about regular review; we have the independent reviewing officer; we have the ability of someone acting on behalf of the child to discharge the order; and we have the reviewing officer being able to come back to CAFCASS. I therefore believe that that system of safeguards will ensure that drift will be avoided wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para12"></a>In light of the arrangements, the Government do not believe that it is appropriate to bring the court into play. I set out the reasons when I spoke to the previous amendment; that is, the relationship that the local authority has, the requirement to act in the best interests of the child and to use the courts when it absolutely needs to have the power to act.

<P>

<a name="20702-18_para13"></a>The Children Act makes this division of responsibilities clear and we feel that the same principles should apply to adoption. However, we are determined to ensure that, in cases where the child has spent an unconscionably long time without being found an adoptive placement, we shall not tolerate drift. Therefore, I hope I have been able to offer some assurance that we have the framework in place and that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-18_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I thank the Minister for her helpful reply. I recognise the force of many of the points she has made, not least as regards the safeguards that she listed.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para14"></a>My fear is still that we could have a local authority that would be reviewing the situation regularly but, despite that, there may be drift and even an absence of best practice; perhaps some political correctness creeping in about matching the child with the ideal set of adoptive parents or something of that nature. There would be supposedly good answers that the local authority would give to anyone who challenged it on why this or that child had not bee placed with adoptive parents.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para15"></a>The thought that the courts could act as a long stop was based on a wish, at least on my part, that the local authority should be kept up to the mark in a way with which it could not argue. However, I shall consider carefully what the noble Baroness has said between now and Report stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20702-18_para18"></a>The noble Earl said: I can deal with Amendment No. 59 briefly. In earlier amendments, we debated the importance of ascertaining the wishes of a child during the process of decision-making relating to his or her adoption. There is nothing that appears to mirror Clause 1(4)(a) in Clause 20. Nowhere in this clause are the child's own wishes referred to. The whole process of a placement order is to be conducted apparently over the child's head.
<P>

<a name="20702-18_para19"></a>Obviously, for very young children, it is impractical to involve the child in the decision about the placement order, but for older children, the child's wishes and views should at least be ascertained and taken into account.

<P>
<A NAME="20702-19_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   On that basis, can I ask the Minister the same simple question that I asked when we debated Clause 1: how would a child initiate proceedings under this measure? The Minister can give me a very simple answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Clearly, there are a number of ways in which that could happen. In the first place, the court has to ensure throughout any of the procedures, including the placement procedures, that the child's ascertainable wishes and feelings regarding the decision are duly considered in accordance with the paramount consideration raised in Clause 1(2). Of course, the child will have access to the matter. If the child's case was being looked after by his social worker, that access could be achieved through the independent case review mechanism that we propose, or it could be achieved through an advocacy system.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para0"></a>It is important to recognise that the way in which the child's views are put before the court will vary in different circumstances and in different proceedings. In some cases it would be right for the child to be a party to proceedings and, for instance, to have a CAFCASS children's guardian appointed to act on his behalf. Indeed, in the Explanatory Notes setting out the Government's thinking in October 2001, the thinking was that the child would automatically be a party in placement order proceedings and would have a CAFCASS children's guardian appointed to act on his or her behalf, in the same manner as is currently done for children in care order cases.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para1"></a>We also currently envisage that a child would not automatically be made a party in adoption proceedings, although he or she would be able to apply for leave to be made a party in those proceedings. In other cases where the child is not a party, there might be other routes for the child's views to be conveyed to the court. Clause 99, for example, would allow the court to ask the CAFCASS officer to produce a general welfare report to the court on the case which could cover the child's views.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para2"></a>I should say that my noble friend Lady Scotland has already written, or is writing, to noble Lords setting out some detail of our early thinking. Although we intend to consult on the issue before setting out the detail in court rules, we currently envisage that placement order proceedings will be specified within the meaning of the Children Act 1989. In other words, a child will be party to the proceedings and a CAFCASS officer and a solicitor will be appointed to act on behalf of the child. A child will not automatically be a party to adoption proceedings, although he or she may be made a party where it is <P>


<a name="column_GC169"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appropriate to do so. Again, the child will not automatically be a party to special guardianship proceedings, although he or she may be made a party where it is appropriate to do so.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para3"></a>In both adoption and special guardianship proceedings we intend that CAFCASS will report to the court on the welfare of the child. That is in Clause 99(3)(b). This may include recommendations to the court that the child should be made a party. The court has discretion to appoint the child a party throughout proceedings.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para4"></a>I conclude by saying that our views on the detail are not at all fixed. The full detail on representation and party status in proceedings will be set out in secondary legislation such as court rules and we intend to consult on these detailed proposals over 2003 and 2004. Clearly, we wish to retain flexibility in relation to secondary legislation to pick up any issues that could be raised through the consultation process.

However, I shall none the less move my amendment which I believe is self-explanatory. It concerns a written procedure under which people who apply for parental responsibility and are turned down may challenge that decision. These are perhaps some of the most difficult decisions that family courts have to deal with.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para17"></a>In moving this amendment, I ask the Minister whether or not adoption, and parental responsibility within adoption, is a special case which perhaps merits consideration under this Bill rather than under any other legislation such as the Children Act. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   This is an interesting amendment which suggests that adoption agencies' determinations about the exercise of parental responsibility when a child is placed for adoption should be subject to an independent review panel under Clause 12. It also appears to suggest that the review panel should in some way be able to initiate determinations in respect of parental responsibility.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para18"></a>We had a very good debate on this matter on Thursday. Members of the Committee will know that my general view is that it would not be appropriate for what I consider to be the agency's day-to-day management of the adoptive placement to be subject to second guessing or micro-management by an independent review process. We have identified the two areas where we think that the independent review process is best operated; that is, first, in relation to where the agency is minded to turn down prospective adopters and, secondly, where the agency decides to exercise discretion on the release of restricted information.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para19"></a>I know that we are going to come back at Report stage to debate this and I shall set aside this debate to concentrate specifically on the amendment. However, I again make the point that there has to be an element of trust as well as an element of regulation and performance management. I am concerned that some noble Lords are seeking to introduce this independent review mechanism to cover almost everything that an adoption agency does. I shall resist that. However, there is a sensible debate to be had as to which areas such an independent review mechanism should cover. Clearly there is room for discussions on those matters between the Committee and Report stages.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para20"></a>As to the amendment, I come back to the point I made earlier about the purpose of placement for adoption. Either the parents have consented or the court has decided that the child shall be placed for adoption by the agency with a view to him being adopted, becoming part of an entirely new family and ceasing in law to be the child of the birth parents. The safeguards, of course, will have been gone through before the parents give consent under Clause 18. They will have been thoroughly counselled and advised by the adoption agency as to the implications of consent; their consent will be independently witnessed by a CAFCASS officer, whose job will be to ensure that the parents have a full understanding of the meaning of the consent that they are giving; and there will be a standard form that will spell out clearly what is involved.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para21"></a>Once the decision is made that the child should be placed, either with consent or under a placement order, until the child is adopted the agency has the primary responsibility for the child's welfare and for overseeing the placement. This is important and <P>


<a name="column_GC171"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reflects back to the question raised earlier about the problems with freeing orders and the position of limbo that some children are in under those orders.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para22"></a>Here the agency is the body with the skills needed to manage and oversee the placement and to prepare all parties for the final adoption. It has both expertise in adoption and detailed knowledge of the individual case. It is right that it should manage the placement and, if necessary, the extent to which others who have parental responsibility may exercise it.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para23"></a>To return to safeguards, it is worth emphasising that where the placement is with consent under Clause 18, if the parents are unhappy with the placement they are, up to the point where an application for an adoption order has been made, free to withdraw their consent and bring the placement to an end.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para24"></a>The Bill provides for the prospective adopters also to have parental responsibility for the child once he is placed with them. This is the crux of Clause 24, which we are debating. This is for practical reasons. Placement may last several months and, as the child settles in to what is intended to be his new family, the fact that the prospective adopters have taken on parental responsibility will enable them to take responsibility for agreeing to, for example, medical treatment, consenting to school trips and so on. Adoption UK, speaking on behalf of adopters and prospective adopters, welcomed this provision in its evidence to the Committee.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para25"></a>The draft Bill of 1996, to which my noble friend referred, gave prospective adopters full parental responsibility from the point of placement. But responses suggested that some prospective adopters might not want the full burden of responsibility immediately and that it might be appropriate for the exercise of parental responsibility to be a gradual process which developed as the placement itself progressed. That is entirely consistent with the debate that we had on Thursday about the process of adoption support. That is why we want the agency to determine the extent to which the prospective adopters may exercise parental responsibility. We would expect this to be the result of discussion between the agency and the adopters. So, in that context, it is appropriate that in managing the placement the agency should be able to determine the extent to which the birth parents may exercise parental responsibility in order to ensure that the placement runs smoothly and to safeguard it from any interference.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para26"></a>If the birth parents or the prospective adopters are unhappy about the manner in which the agency restricts their ability to exercise parental responsibility, we would expect them to discuss this with the agency in the first instance and, if not satisfied, to use the relevant complaints procedure as they would with any other aspect of the management of the placement with which they were not happy.
<P>

<a name="20702-19_para27"></a>In cases of placement with consent, ultimately it is open for the birth parents to withdraw consent and, of course, to have the child returned to their sole responsibility. I hope that, while I suspect the noble <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I thank the Minister again for that full reply. I shall take the opportunity to say to the Minister that our obsession with the written procedure, and our requests for there to be independent reviews, should not always be deemed to be a criticism of the agencies. It is certainly in part a frustration about not seeing the regulations and about having to guess so much about what will happen and what will happen to people. I come to the Bill mindful that we are setting a legislative framework within which individual people make individual decisions, day in, day out, of a very tough nature.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para0"></a>I would also say to the Minister that written procedures are not always a stick with which to beat social workers. They are very often a good basis for social workers to explain to people and their advocates who may have some difficulty in understanding what is happening to them in a stressful situation. Therefore, I do not necessarily buy the criticism that goes with this. However, I understand what the Minister says about the gradual transfer of parental responsibility.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para1"></a>It is perhaps one of the most personal decisions in this whole business and I tend to think that decisions about harm to children are perhaps more easily demonstrable but questions about parental responsibility are often deeply subjective. It is with that in mind and with the aim of protecting some of the people involved that we moved our amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I wonder whether the noble Baroness will give way, because I accept the point she makes. I really want to come back to the point she made about the independent review mechanism and the question of regulations.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para2"></a>I understand that there was always a desire, when debating the framework in primary legislation, to know what would be in the regulations. We have a problem here because it is quite clear that a considerable amount of work needs to be undertaken following passage of the Bill and the enactment of the new procedures in 2004. We intend that there should be a very open debate, discussion and consultation on the regulations. I also say that I believe in relation to independent review of determination, the very fact we have regulation allows us to adopt a flexible response in future.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para3"></a>As noble Lords will know, we have identified these two areas to which we believe the independent review mechanism should relate. However, as things develop, as we gain more experience about how the new procedures adopt, there may well be situations where the performance generally of adoption agencies is deemed not to be satisfactory; where the case for then extending the independent review mechanism to cover such cases will become apparent.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para4"></a>So, while I understand the frustration of the noble Baroness, I would say that regulations allow us some flexibility for the future to make adjustments in the light of experience. I also understand that she is not <P>


<a name="column_GC173"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seeking to criticise local authorities or adoption agencies. The point is well taken; all I would argue for is a degree of flexibility here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I hear what the Minister says. I would take him back to my speech at Second Reading, where I specifically spoke about the fact that there may be times when we could not seek balance because there is no balance to be had.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para5"></a>I do not believe, as some people have done, that argument for independent review is argument for an indefinite appeal on the part of people who perhaps may not be suitable. I believe that there will come a point when usually social workers, or adoption panels, will come to the end of the road and will say, "No, these people are not suitable". That is a tough point to reach.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para6"></a>I believe that asking for written procedures to be on the face of the Bill does not undermine that in any way at all. It is not necessarily as incorrect as it has been deemed to be.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para7"></a>I cannot remember the case&#151;and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, might be able to help me out&#151;but I believe it was in Norfolk where two people went on the run with a couple of children a couple of years ago. I remember vividly that the matter came up on "Question Time" and the panel was asked to talk about it. One person, whom I believe was one of my colleagues, was absolutely right in saying, "All these social services questions are governed by confidentiality and I cannot talk about this".
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para8"></a>Since then I have been struck by the utter frustration that surrounds many social care matters. That is why in many cases I am a fan of written procedures; I do not believe that it is always easy for there to be written answers.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para9"></a>I am sorry that we have trailed off into a slightly convoluted argument, and one which I did not intend to get into. I believe there is a need to ensure that all parties to difficult matters, which usually cannot be resolved by balance, at least have a means of coming away from them feeling that they have been justly treated under the procedures. That was part of the reason for having a go at this. I am sorry that we have meandered slightly off the point, but I believe it has been a useful debate, given that the department is so open to suggestion on these matters. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(ii) allow for the person named in the order and the child otherwise to have contact with each other;
<br>
(iii) prohibit any form of contact between the child and the person named in the order."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20702-20_para14"></a>The noble Earl said: We move now to Clause 25, which deals with what is sometimes a vexed and contentious subject; that of contact. Amendment No. 63 deals with one particular aspect of the contact provisions.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para15"></a>Under Clause 25(2)(b) as drafted, a court may make an order requiring visits, stays, or other forms of contact. It does not allow the court to prohibit contact.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para16"></a>Clause 26 allows the court to provide for contact on certain conditions, and in limited circumstances it allows for the adoption agency to refuse to allow contact. However, those provisions fall short of the court prohibiting contact. The presumption will normally be that facilities should be made for the adoptive child to have contact with his or her birth family in the widest sense.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para17"></a>However, it is a sad truth that many of the children who are looked after and are being placed for adoption come from situations of mental or physical abuse from one or more of their family. There are circumstances where it will be clear to the court that contact should be prohibited. All that the amendment does is to make it clear that the court has that power. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   As the noble Earl suggested, the amendment concerns provisions in Clause 25 covering contact where an adoption agency is authorised to place a child for adoption. Before turning to the specific amendment, perhaps I may explain briefly the thinking behind the approach we have taken.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para18"></a>Clearly, placement for adoption represents a great step change in the future plans for the child. All noble Lords have very much reinforced that point today. It is absolutely appropriate that existing contact arrangements should be revisited. That is why the clause provides that existing formal contact arrangements&#151;in other words, contact orders made under the Children Act&#151;cease to have effect.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para19"></a>Our preferred approach is that the adoption agency, the prospective adopters and the parent should review existing arrangements and agree between themselves what contact arrangements are appropriate in the interests of the child now that the child is placed for adoption.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para20"></a>However, as informal agreements may not be possible, the clause provides for the court to make an order for contact on the application from, for example, the child, its birth parents, the adoption agency and a range of others listed in subsection (3) of Clause 25&#151;such as a guardian of the child or a person in whose favour a residence order had been made immediately before the adoption agency was authorised to place the child for adoption. Unless varied or discharged, those orders would last until an adoption order was made. <P>


<a name="column_GC175"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The provisions are similar to those in Section 34 of the Children Act which govern contact with children in care.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para21"></a>As the noble Earl explained, Amendment No. 63 is aimed at ensuring that an order for contact under Clause 25 can include an order for non-contact. I agree with the noble Earl that it is important for the court to be able to make an order for non-contact. This might happen, for example, where the adoption agency supervising the placement becomes concerned that someone, perhaps a member of the child's family, might seek inappropriate contact with the child that might risk disrupting the adoptive placement.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para22"></a>I should like to reassure noble Lords that the Bill already allows for this. The wording used in subsection (2) is deliberately modelled on that for contact orders under Section 8 of the Children Act. One advantage of this is to ensure that an order for contact may include one that provides for non-contact where that is in the best interests of the child. In addition, the court could also make a prohibited steps order under Section 8 of the Children Act directed at the person thought to be at risk of initiating harmful contact.
<P>

<a name="20702-20_para23"></a>There is case law which makes it clear that a Section 8 contact order can include an order for non-contact. I recognise that the wording of Section 8 does not actually include the words "non-contact". I am happy to send details to the noble Earl. The case is Nottinghamshire County Council v. P in 1993.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-21_para1"></a><P>

<a name="20702-21_para2"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 64 I shall also speak to Amendment No. 121. As we have discussed already, Clause 25 contains very important provisions about contact. Amendment No. 64 is quite simple. It adds siblings to those who can apply for a contact order under this clause. Siblings are defined by Amendment No. 121&#151;uncontroversially, I hope&#151;as full or half brothers or sisters.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para3"></a>The current provision in subsection (3) allows the child or an adoption agency to apply, as well as the parent or guardian of the child and some others, and the court can grant leave to others to apply. However, brothers and sisters are not mentioned.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para4"></a>I am sure that the Committee will be aware that one of the difficult aspects of placing children for adoption is that brothers and sisters have to be split up. It is very often important for children that appropriate arrangements for contact should be made. Of course, I am not suggesting that responsible agencies or authorities do not have in mind the needs of full or half siblings. However, this amendment gives those siblings a little more recognition in the process leading to contact orders being made. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>Report stage, may I ask the Minister, when he replies, to consider the possibility of grandparents also being allowed to apply?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I agree that this is a very important matter. Siblings are very important to the child who may be being considered for adoption.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para5"></a>Amendment No. 64 would give siblings the ability to apply as of right for an order under Section 25 for contact under placement. Amendment No. 121 is consequential and provides a definition of the term "sibling" for use in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para6"></a>I want to make it clear that the Government are committed to promoting links between siblings in adoption. Indeed, the National Standards make the preferred position very clear&#151;these are the National Standards to which I referred earlier in debate and which will very much govern the way in which adoption services are operated by local authorities and agencies&#151;that siblings should be placed together unless this does not meet their individually assessed needs.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para7"></a>We should expect that adoption agencies would make appropriate arrangements for the child to have contact with siblings where it is in the child's interest. If there were any obstacle to this, the agency could apply to the court for a contact order under Clause 25(3)(a).
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para8"></a>If siblings themselves wanted to seek contact, we would expect them to approach the agency and agree an arrangement with it and the prospective adopters. However, if this did not prove possible, it would be open to the sibling to seek the court's leave to apply for a contact order under Clause 25(3)(e).
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para9"></a>I agree that Clause 25 does not provide explicitly for siblings to apply. In this, it is the same as Section 34 of the Children Act, which makes parallel provision for contact where the child is subject to a care order under care orders. Clause 25 is modelled on Section 34. However, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has made a very good case. I give a commitment to noble Lords to look at the issue between Committee and Report stage to see if there would be merit in being explicit about siblings. I should be happy to take that back.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is right: the issue of contact and the role of grandparents is indeed important. It is an issue on which the adoption standards help us in some way. It is certainly a matter that needs to be fully taken into account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-21_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I am very grateful to the Minister for what he has said. He is indeed right that my concern was that siblings should be able, as of right, rather than with the leave of the court, to make an application under this clause. I hope that we can make some progress in this area because I have heard of some quite heart-rending cases where siblings have been denied contact because of various obstructions in the system.

<A NAME="20702-21_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Most certainly. I recognise that fully. Nevertheless, there are equally deserving cases the other way. There is little merit in continuing this debate now. I am grateful to the Minister for his undertaking that he will give further thought to this matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para11"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-21_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 65:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 16, line 37, at end insert "and at the time of making an adoption order the court shall be required to reconsider whether any such order and any other existing contact arrangements are appropriate"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-21_para12"></a><P>

<a name="20702-21_para13"></a>The noble Earl said: The provisions of Clause 25 focus on the placement of the child. Subsection (6) allows for an application for a contact order to be made when an application for adoption is heard. But the Bill does not appear to allow the court simply to re-examine an existing contact order when adoption is made. The issue of post adoption contact would most easily be addressed by the court in the context of the existing order for contact, which was made on placement, rather than in some separate adoption application. I hope that this amendment commends itself. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I hope that I can reassure the noble Earl, Lord Howe. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has raised before the difficulties that we all have with the interconnection between this Bill and the Children Act. Some of the answers to the questions raised by probing amendments are to be found in the continued provisions of the Children Act. I agree with the sentiment behind the noble Earl's amendment. I believe that the Bill provides what the noble Earl seeks.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para14"></a>While any contact order made under Clause 25 would come to an end on the making of an adoption order because the child would no longer legally be placed for adoption, under Clause 45(6) the court, when considering making an adoption order, would have to consider whether arrangements should be made for contact and, for that purpose, review any existing or proposed arrangements to see if they are appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para15"></a>As I said earlier, the starting point for any contact, whether during placement or after the final adoption, must be what is best for the child. There should be no automatic presumption that previous arrangements must continue. Our preferred approach is that the adoption agency, the prospective adopters and the parent should review existing arrangements and agree between themselves what contact arrangements are appropriate and in the interests of the child now that the child is placed for adoption.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para16"></a>However&#151;I repeat what I said earlier&#151;because informal agreement may not always be possible the Bill provides for the court to make a contact order under Section 8 of the Children Act at the final adoption hearing, either of its own motion or on the application of anyone entitled to do so, including the child's parents. This is provided for by Clause 25(5), which ensures that applications for Children Act contact orders may be made at the final adoption order hearing. I hope that in that way I can reassure the noble Earl.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-21_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   That is a very helpful reply. I thank the Minister and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para17"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-21_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 66:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 16, line 43, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702-21_para18"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) In considering any provisions for contact pursuant to this section, the court must consider the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child (considered in the light of the child's age or understanding)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20702-21_para19"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 66, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 67. The thought behind Amendment No. 66 relates closely to that behind my earlier Amendment No. 59. I strongly suspect that the Minister's reply to me on that amendment makes this one entirely unnecessary. Very often when an adoption is in prospect, a child's views will be strongly in favour of contact, especially with parents or siblings. However, there may well be circumstances, especially where abuse has occurred, as the Minister indicated, where the child's views would be strongly hostile to contact. Either way, it is only right that the court should ascertain those views and take them into account. Amendment No. 66 repeats the approach adopted in Clause 1 for contact orders. I hope the Minister will tell me that the provisions in Clause 1, which he so helpfully pointed out earlier in Clause 1(7)(a), cover this point fully.
<P>

<a name="20702-21_para20"></a>Amendment No. 67 deals with a different aspect of the child's views. This allows a child to apply to have contact arrangements reviewed once the child has reached the age of 10. This is designed to deal with the situation where contact arrangements were made while the child was very young and most likely had no ascertainable views. The amendment would allow the child to articulate his views at a later stage and give the opportunity for the contact arrangements to be varied. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   Perhaps I may detain the Committee briefly to ask one question. Am I correct in making the assumption that the definition of contact here includes things like letterbox contact and that it is not just physical contact?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-22_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Yes, it does.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The noble Earl has eloquently answered his own amendments as regards Amendment No. 66. Clause 1(7)(a) explicitly provides that all the obligations in Clause 1 are to apply where a court is deciding whether or not to make, vary or <P>


<a name="column_GC179"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discharge any contact order under Clause 25. So, the welfare checklist in Clause 1 would apply to a decision to make an order under Clause 25. The court would have to take account of the child's discernible wishes and feelings concerning the proposed contact arrangements and consider them in light of the child's age and understanding.
<P>

<a name="20702-22_para0"></a>As regards the second amendment, which I understand is to give the child the right to apply to the court to review any contact arrangements made through orders under this section, again the sentiment is something with which I would agree. However, the Bill provides for the child to have a direct say in his or her own right. We would expect the agency, in line with its obligations under Clause 1, to discuss any proposed contact arrangements with the child and to take his views into account in making any arrangements, formal or informal. However, in Clause 25(3) the child can apply to the court to make provision concerning contact between him any anyone named in the order. So if a child were unhappy with the arrangements made for contact, he could apply to the court to make an order changing them.
<P>

<a name="20702-22_para1"></a>This is slightly different from what the amendment suggests, which is that the child should apply to the court for the court to conduct a review. However, it achieves the same effect in that, where a child is unhappy about how contact arrangements are going, he can take the initiative in getting them changed. In order to forestall the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, <P>


<a name="column_GC180"></a>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column GC180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perhaps I may say that a child with the capacity to do so could instruct a solicitor. The route is also open to the adoption agency and, if the child were very unhappy with a contact arrangement made by an order under Clause 25, it would also be open for the agency to apply on his behalf to make new arrangements rather than placing the burden on the child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702-22_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Once again, that was a very illuminating reply from the Minister for which I thank him. I believe that what he has said in relation to my Amendment No. 67 covers the point fully. However, I shall read carefully what he has said in Hansard. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Orme </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action is being taken to address the United Nations International Day for Victims of Torture.[HL4955]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  On 26 June, UN International Day in support of Victims of Torture, the FCO launched phase 3 of the UK Anti-Torture Initiative.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para0"></a>During the first two phases of the UK Anti-Torture Initiative, launched in October 1998 and December 2000 by my right honourable friend the Member for Livingston, the UK combined a global lobbying campaign for universal ratification of the UN Convention against Torture (at the time ratified by just over 50 per cent of UN member states) with a number of practical measures, including the publication and distribution of 20,000 copies in seven languages of a handbook giving guidance on reporting instances of torture, financial support for the UN's work with torture victims and the secondment of a senior UK police officer to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para1"></a>Phase 3 will combine continued global lobbying with new practical steps. Since December 1998, 13 more countries have ratified the UN CAT. Our target is to secure another five ratifications by the end of 2003, bringing the total to 134 or 70 per cent. We will also be lobbying with EU partners for the adoption of the draft optional protocol to the CAT. The protocol is intended to help prevent torture by allowing both UN and independent national teams the right to inspect places of detention in signatory countries.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para2"></a>New practical measures for phase 3 will include:
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para3"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a new publication on judicial safeguards to provide judiciary and law makers worldwide with examples of best practice regarding judicial control of torture;

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>establishment of a visiting programme to UK for senior clinicians who work in countries where the practice of torture is widespread for work placements with leading NGOs involved in torture rehabilitation; and the FCO will also continue to provide financial support of &#163;175,000 per year to the UN Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture which provides urgent medical and legal support worldwide.

<a name="20702w01_para6"></a>Phase 3 will be the last stage of activity. After this, to consolidate efforts of the past three years to combat torture, the FCO is planning to mainstream torture work within the FCO's general human rights mandate and set up a panel of experts to advise on future strategy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   The Government of the British Indian Ocean Territory are organising and paying for the charter of a ship to take about 100 Chagossians to the outer islands of the Chagos archipelago to visit ancestral graves. Subject to agreement with the representatives of those concerned, the ship, the M/S "Mauritius Trochetia," will depart from Port Louis on 5 October and will visit the islands of Peros Banhos and Salomon. It is expected to return on 17 October. The British High Commission in Mauritius and Seychelles are in contact with the leaders of the various Chagossian groups and are inviting them to draw up a jointly agreed list of passengers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w01_wqn2"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether there have been any recent changes in United Kingdom visa fees:[HL4977]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  On 26 June, the Privy Council made the Consular Fees Order 2002, which sets out the new fees for UK visas with effect from 1 July.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para7"></a>On 17 June Members in the other place approved the draft Section 102 order, made under the Finance (No 2) Act 1987, following a debate in the Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation on 11 June. The Section 102 order provides the legal authority for the visa fee increase by allowing past deficits incurred in the costs of running the entry clearance operation to be taken into account when setting visa fees and for the cross-subsidisation of the costs of different entry clearance services.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para8"></a>Most visa fees will go up by between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. The main increases are:
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para9"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Standard visit visa: up 9 per cent from &#163;33 to &#163;36.

<a name="20702w01_para10"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The single entry visa has ceased to exist since the introduction in October 2000 of visas of leave to enter. The new standard visa for multiple entries valid for six months at &#163;36 is cheaper than the old six-month multiple-entry visa, which provided the same level of service at a cost of &#163;45.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702w01_para11"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Five-year multiple-entry visa: up 10 per cent from &#163;80 to &#163;88.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702w01_para13"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>In addition, the long-term non-settlement visa fee will increase by 50 per cent from &#163;50 to &#163;75.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702w01_para14"></a>A new 10-year multiple entry visa priced at &#163;150 is also being introduced for the first time. There is growing demand for this kind of visa. Its introduction will provide an enhanced service to regular travellers to the UK, without compromising the integrity of the immigration control.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para15"></a>The Consular Fees Order setting new visa fees is being made not only to cover current costs but also to recover past deficits of visa fees (from April 2000), caused by the increased cost of the entry clearance operation world-wide. It is intended that these increases will return the entry clearance operation to a self-financing basis by 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para16"></a>We recognise that these fee increases will be unwelcome. However, we must make sure that the full cost of providing a visa service is covered by visa fees.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para17"></a>To put these increases into context:
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para18"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>These would be the first fee increase for visitor's visas since 1995.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702w01_para19"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The proposed increases still keep UK visas within their service delivery agreement commitment not to increase visa fees in real terms.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702w01_para20"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The standard visit visa at &#163;36 is still cheaper than the old six-month multiple entry visa which provided the same level of service at a cost of &#163;45.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702w01_para21"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Applicants now get more for their money. Since October 2000, the standard visit visa has not only allowed people to visit the UK on multiple occasions during the validity of their leave to enter; they also benefit from an enhanced and speedier immigration process on arrival.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20702w01_para22"></a>UK visas is undertaking a range of measures to reduce costs and increase productivity. But these alone will not be sufficient to recover the deficit. The increases will enable UKvisas not only to recover past deficits but also to cover the increased costs of the provision of visa services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w01_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Marlesford  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>

Whether they will name those police forces which are now equipped with Airwave, the new secure encrypted digital radio system, indicating in respect of each force the date on which the equipment was in service; and whether the system is proving satisfactory in operational conditions.[HL4818]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  The Airwave service is being provided under contract by mmO2 Limited, which has to date provided the infrastructure needed to deliver the service to six forces in England and Wales. These forces are, with their migration status shown in brackets: Lancashire (complete), Greater Manchester (restarting in July 2002), North Yorkshire (complete), West Mercia (started 12 March 2002), Suffolk (started <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>13 May 2002) and Leicestershire (due to start Summer 2002).
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para23"></a>Forces migrate to the Airwave service from their existing systems on a staged basis once the infrastructure, purchasing of terminals and officer training have all been completed. The Airwave contract defines this starting point as being the ready for service (RFS) date.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para24"></a>Once a force has passed its RFS date, migration usually takes place on a division-by-division basis and can last several months.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para25"></a>In view of the demanding requirements and the state-of-the-art technology being used, it has generally taken longer to install and integrate the Airwave infrastructure and equipment than was originally hoped. However, once the system has been optimised, it has been found to meet operational requirements.
<P>

<a name="20702w01_para26"></a>Airwave provides substantial benefits compared to the existing analogue systems, including improved officer safety through an emergency button, secure encryption of all voice and data traffic, improved coverage, good quality clear speech, reduced interference and access to a comprehensive range of data services.

<A NAME="20702w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin:  </B>  (a)  The mandate refugee programme provides resettlement to the United Kingdom of refugees who are in their own country, or in a third country, who are faced with some threat to their safety or well-being and are deemed by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to be refugees. Applicants are assessed on whether the United Kingdom is the best place for them, as well as taking into account the circumstances in their present country of refuge. Funding for this programme is taken from the overall Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) budget.

<a name="20702w02_sbhd8"></a><H4><center>Type 45 Destroyer: RAND Report</center></H4>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w02_wqn9"></A><B> Lord Acton  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the RAND report on Type 45 procurement options has been published.[HL5004]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>   The RAND report on acquisition options for the Type 45 destroyer has now been published. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="20702w02_para4"></a>RAND is a very experienced and influential organisation and has been conducting analyses of military shipbuilding, the industrial base and competition issues for two decades. The Ministry of Defence commissioned RAND last year to carry out an independent study into a range of alternative procurement strategies for our future warship programme over the next 15 to 20 years, with particular reference to options for Type 45 destroyers. This followed receipt of an unsolicited bid from BAES Marine proposing that it should build all 12 ships planned for the Class. This differed from the Type 45 shipbuilding procurement strategy at that time, which envisaged Vosper Thornycroft building one of the first batch of three ships and competing with BAES Marine for later batches.
<P>

<a name="20702w02_para5"></a>Initial results from the study were used to help inform the MoD's decision to proceed with a revised procurement strategy for the Type 45, in which each of the two shipbuilders, BAES Marine and Vosper Thornycroft, will be allocated modules (or blocks) of the ship to build. The revised strategy was announced by my Right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 10 July 2001 (Official Report, col 675&#150;85) in another place.
<P>

<a name="20702w02_para6"></a>RAND's analysis indicated that there would be roughly an even chance that competitive production of the Type 45 by two shipbuilders would yield about the same overall cost as sole-source production. Noting that a competitive strategy could lead to one shipbuilder building most of the ships, RAND also investigated alternative strategies to direct work to each of the two shipbuilders to keep both involved in building warships.
<P>

<a name="20702w02_para7"></a>The RAND results also suggested that, for strategies that directed Type 45 work to a number of shipyards, allocation of blocks is more cost effective that the allocation of whole ships because the workforce increase productivity as it gains experience of building the same blocks. Such a strategy will also have the advantage of keeping both shipbuilders in the Type 45 progamme and potentially available to compete for future warship programmes. In addition, the revised strategy is likely to provide better value for money in the longer term than the unsolicited proposal, if it enables competition to be pursued on other warship programmes.
<P>

<B>2 Jul 2002 : Column WA27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20702w02_para8"></a>Following the Type 45 decision, RAND continued its study, taking a broader look at the foreseeable balance of demand and supply in the warship building sector an the potential effects of different procurement approaches. The report does not make specific recommendations concerning procurement strategies for future programmes, although it has helped clarify issues regarding block production (which is likely to be employed for the future carrier). It also provides an indication of the size of workforce that will be required to sustain the future programme.
<P>

<a name="20702w02_para9"></a>RAND's work has already helped the MoD to arrive at a pragmatic solution for the Type 45. The report will also provide a valuable source of information for further study of the warship building sector.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w03_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Desai  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress has been made on the future basing of Royal Navy ships and submarines and the future requirement for three naval bases.[HL5005]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  A joint Royal Navy/Warship Support Agency study team has recently completed a wide-ranging review of the base porting arrangements for Royal Navy warships and Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and the infrastructure required to support them. Their recommendations have been endorsed by Ministers and will be implemented subject to trade union consultation.
<P>

<a name="20702w03_para0"></a>The three existing naval bases at Portsmouth, Devonport and Clyde are able to provide sufficient capacity to support the ships and submarines that are in service, on order or planned.
<P>

<a name="20702w03_para1"></a>The future aircraft carrier, the CVF, will be based at HM Naval Base Portsmouth. While it should be possible to berth two CVFs in Portsmouth simultaneously, for military reasons this may not be desirable. Options are therefore being considered to make use of an occasional stand-by berth for the high-readiness CVF. Further work on the design, operating patterns and manning are needed before a final decision can be made, although initial indications show that Southampton could provide such a facility if required:
<P>

<a name="20702w03_para2"></a>As announced on 1 July 2002 (WA 13), the batches one and two of Astute class submarines will be based at HM Naval Base Clyde, and the Trafalgar class will remain at Devonport.
<P>

<a name="20702w03_para3"></a>With regard to the remainder of the fleet, the T45 destroyers will progressively replace the T42 destroyers based at Portsmouth. The two new amphibious ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, will join HMS Ocean at Devonport, creating an amphibious shipping centre of expertise. The current arrangements for the Vanguard class nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines, frigates, survey ships and minor war vessels work well and will not be changed.

<A NAME="20702w03_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  It is important that we address the issue of enriched cages sooner rather than later. The industry needs to make long-term investment decisions.

<A NAME="20702w03_wqn3"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How the research assessment exercise (RAE) will be revised (i) to recognise clinical research, especially in surgery and craft specialities and (ii) to ensure that RAE objectives match the priority areas in service and teaching for the National Health Service.[HL4600]<P></UL>

<P>
<A NAME="20702w03_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has announced its intention to review its research assessment policy. This review will be led by Sir Gareth Roberts. At the conclusion of the review, which will cover all disciplines, decisions on the future of the research assessment exercise will be taken.

<A NAME="20702w03_wqn4"></A><B> Baroness Cox  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will provide the figures for each year from 1993 to 2001 for the total number of candidates in England and Wales allowed special arrangements of all kinds of the GCSE examinations.[HL4763]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  Figures are not available on the basis requested. The Joint Council for General Qualifications collates data on the applications for special arrangements agreed by each of the awarding bodies. Candidates frequently sit examinations with more than one awarding body. Data for applications processed therefore exceed the actual number of students receiving special considerations. The applications processed in 2001 represented 2.4 per cent of total entries at GCSE and GCE A/AS-level; the awarding bodies do not have a separate breakdown for GCSEs.

<P>
<A NAME="20702w03_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When data collection relating to children with autism spectrum disorders in schools will begin.[HL4911]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   Provisions now consolidated in the Education Act 1996 require schools to submit information on numbers of pupils with special educational needs. There is currently no requirement for schools to submit information in the Annual Schools Census on the nature of such pupils' disability or learning difficulty.
<P>

<a name="20702w03_para4"></a>In June last year, the department carried out a pilot study involving a sample of 200 mainstream and special schools to assess whether it would be possible to collect data from schoools on a broad range of types of SEN. We are considering introducing a requirement for schools and LEAs to provide this information from 2004 and this is likely to include data on pupils categorised as having autistic spectrum disorder. Further work is needed, including developing appropriate data collection software and taking the views of schools and LEAs.
<P>

<a name="20702w03_para5"></a>We expect to consult widely on an agreed definition of the various types of SEN, including the main autism bodies, before requesting schools and LEAs to provide this information.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20702w04_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>   On 24 January 2002 a consultation paper was issued on possible options for change to the current temporary use provisions. The paper put forward six options for change as well as inviting proposals for alternative options. A preferred option was not given. The closing date for responses was 24 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="20702w04_para0"></a>We have had a significant response to the consultation paper and those views will be given due weight when considering any possible changes. Any changes that are made will only be after further consideration and decisions will not be taken lightly. However, the Government have no intention of disturbing urban and rural communities' traditional social and sporting activities through changes in this area.
