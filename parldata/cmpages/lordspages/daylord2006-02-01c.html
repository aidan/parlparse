<a name="60201-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Energy Policy: Coal</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Ezra </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What role they envisage for coal in future energy supplies for the United Kingdom.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Government strongly believe that there will be a continuing role for coal in meeting this country&#039;s energy needs for some years to come, provided that its potential environmental impacts can be managed satisfactorily. That is being considered as part of the current review of energy policy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Ezra: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that encouraging Answer. Does he recall that the energy review indicated that the share of coal in electricity would decline from the current level of about 30 per cent to half that during the next 15 years? In view of the need to achieve diversity of energy supply and to reduce increased dependence on imported gas, I am sure that the Minister agrees that that trend should be reversed. Furthermore, does he agree that the most effective way of doing that is to press ahead with the development of clean coal technology much more effectively than at present and to establish demonstration plants without further delay? The technology has now been proven, including the extraction of CO2 and its storage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is a strong advocate of that position, which he has sustained in the House for many years. I am pleased to say that the validity of his arguments is accepted. Coal&#151;it needs to be cleaner coal&#151;has a role to play, and it is clear that we have to meet emission targets; to do so, we need to advance with the technology, particularly in the burning of coal in power stations where it has a crucial role to play. I am pleased to say to him that, although he will recognise that we need a diversified series of energy sources, coal certainly has its role to play.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord O&#039;Neill of Clackmannan: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the pursuit of clean-coal technology has more than a touch of alchemy about it at present? None of the technologies has been properly tried in a commercial context, and even some of the research on technologies has evaded the capabilities and wealth of the United States and Japan to bring them to commercial reality. It is dangerous to talk piously about coal in the way that we were able to do <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_188"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 188</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the past because the existing plant is of such an age. To bolt on the new technologies would not be possible in terms of the finances and the running of the coal-fired power stations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is the other side of the case&#151;showing just how difficult it is, despite the advocacy of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. The Government can accept the arguments and the desirability of what ought to be achieved, but actually realising it, as my noble friend Lord O&#039;Neill emphasised, involves very significant challenges. We can of course deal with aspects of power station emissions to increase the use of coal. We are seeking to achieve that so that coal will play a significant role in the generation of electricity. In a more general sense, my noble friend is right: none of the rather more ambitious strategies regarding cleaner coal has reached the market and been market tested.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   My Lords, some of us who had the advantage of hearing from Ms Barbara McKee from the American Department of Energy a few days ago have been startled by the extent of the American research into what the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, calls clean coal. Is not the key to the future not the bolt-on technology mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord O&#039;Neill, but pre-gasifying the coal before it ever goes into a furnace? That is the technology that will allow much more coal to be used in future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am in danger of becoming a table tennis ball between two erudite table tennis bats on the issue of technology, as both noble Lords are better versed in it than I can hope to be. There are optimistic aspects to the American research, and there is no doubt that the Americans consider it significant, with regard to the world&#039;s energy supplies, to make improvements in this area. However, we can invest only a fraction of what the Americans can put into such extensive research.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, how much are the Government spending on research and development on carbon storage, capture and sequestration? Without a massive increase, that technology will be pie in the sky.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is another dimension of expenditure; the noble Lord is absolutely right. I do not have the figures for expenditure on that to hand, because we are working against a considerable number of uncertainties. I wanted to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and the House that the Government see the advantages of coal in supplying our energy needs, but, under present technologies and use, that is a fairly limited future, and we will need breakthroughs in research if coal is to have a future beyond that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Davies of Coity: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend will be aware that I come from a family of three generations of miners. We talk about producing more <br>&nbsp;<br>

coal to meet our energy requirements, but does my noble friend agree that if more and more coal is produced, we will send more and more people back into the belly of the Earth in dangerous conditions where accidents happen?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, first, we are talking about an industry that is a fraction of what the coal industry was in its great days. Then, there were hundreds of pits; now we are talking about fewer than 20 mines. The great expansion of coal production is likely to be through open-cast and surface mining, rather than the sinking of shafts, so the ghastly conditions in which so many miners had to work, which may noble friend attributes to coal, are likely to be rather different.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60201-01_time0"></a><h5>3.14 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What arrangements they are making under the Licensing Act 2003 to restrict the sale of alcohol at designated sporting stadiums.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Licensing Act 2003 allows the police, interested parties and others to make representations on new licence applications and applications for licence variations and to request a review of the licence if problems related to the licensing objectives occur. Where appropriate, such representations may result in licensing conditions that restrict the sale of alcohol. That provides a targeted approach to the regulation of alcohol at sporting stadiums that builds on the additional restrictions in the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985 as amended by the Licensing Act 2003.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Lord confirm that under the Act as originally passed, directors of football clubs and their guests were treated the same as ordinary football fans but that, when representations were made by the Football Association, the Minister not only decided not to bring parts of the Act into force, but undertook to introduce new primary legislation to restore the privileges that the directors had lost? Is there any reason to suppose that directors and their guests are likely to be better behaved if they are allowed to drink at the same moments as ordinary mortals, and should not the Act be left as it stands?
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60201-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the problem with the Act, as the noble Lord knows only too well, is that, whereas it sought to reduce restrictions, it inadvertently increases them in that respect. That was not the intention of the Bill or of all the publicity that attended it. Nor had we thought that that would be the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 190</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

effect until lawyers got to work on the extreme detail of the Act. Therefore, unless we propose some change, we will have a tighter position than we had before.
</p>

<a name="60201-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>As for whether it is fair that those in hospitality boxes should have different conditions from others at sporting events, particularly at the major football grounds, it is not only about directors and their guests. As the noble Lord will know, the economics of our major football clubs depend on providing a substantial range of such boxes for a very wide range of clients, and the privileges that, he says, are not open to ordinary mortals extend to a significant number of people attending grounds, who are expected to pay a pretty heavy premium.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060201/text/60201-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60201-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, in this context, is there a viable distinction between a designated sporting stadium and a supermarket for the purposes of the law?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60201-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am one of those who do not go to supermarkets for entertainment. I certainly go to football grounds, and I imagine that I have that in common with a certain percentage of the population. The difference is straightforwardly a question of the consumption of alcohol. The law allows the sale of alcohol at supermarkets, but we have not yet detected an enormous problem with the hours of drinking on the premises, congenial though those supermarkets are. Supermarkets are not really equipped for that purpose, but football grounds with hospitality grounds are well equipped for it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60201-02_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Falkland: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that on racecourses in recent years there has been a considerable increase in alcohol misuse, as it is called, which is evident mostly in the cheaper enclosures but is still evident in the more expensive enclosures, even if it is not very visible there? Will the Minister say whether there is any awareness of that in view of the important developments at Ascot racecourse and the opening of what will probably be the greatest racecourse in Europe, if not in the world? Should not that authority be made aware of the dangers of alcohol and the differences between drinking habits in different enclosures?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60201-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, let us be clear about why the restrictions are in place regarding certain sports stadia: they apply to football grounds. They have been imposed because alcohol played its part in riotous behaviour at some of our grounds during the 1980s and early 1990s. I have not yet seen a riot at Ascot, nor do I anticipate one under our present more liberal licensing laws. However, I can assure the noble Viscount that if untoward events take place at our racecourses, we will of course address the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60201-02_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Trumpington: </b>   My Lords, just to even things up, will the Minister accept that, speaking personally I have never had any difficulty, sitting in the most expensive seats, drinking a great deal?
</p>

<a name="60201-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, it would be a brave official who sought to intervene in such circumstances.

<a name="60201-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hoyle: </b>   My Lords, would it not be advisable for football to take a lesson from Rugby League where, despite the sale of alcohol at the grounds, no trouble occurs and the fans are friends after the match?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60201-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I have no doubt that football could learn a considerable number of lessons from Rugby League. Certainly, the reason why the restrictive legislation does not apply to Rugby League is that we have not had problems at Rugby League grounds.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60201-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, I have one point of real concern about the situation. Can the Minister tell me how an organisation such as the Football Association is able to influence the Government to such an extent that they are willing to change an Act of Parliament and the Minister concerned writes to the FA saying, &quot;I will do this&quot;? I do not believe that that is very constitutional. Can the noble Lord also tell us how and when it is to be done?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60201-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Football Association, the Premier League and the Football League have all taken a keen interest and made representations on the matter. Like any other affected interest, such bodies will occasionally make representations to government. We get them from organisations that are considerably more powerful than the Football Association, the Premier League and the Football League. The issue for government is to make a judgment on whether such representations have validity. In this Act we intended to relax the restrictions on hospitality boxes. The fact that the football industry has pointed out that the effect of the legislation has been to restrict the provision gives us cause to think again. I cannot give the noble Lord a precise date at this point, but we are looking at amending the Act.

The UK is closely engaged in the NATO force generation process, which will co-ordinate allies&#039; military contributions to the ISAF. Right now, the UK is holding a major conference at which the international community will set out its broader engagement in Afghanistan over the next five years.

</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60201-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Astor, is absolutely right to state that the development of the Afghan national security forces is crucial to the eventual stability of Afghanistan and allowing our own forces to disengage. He will know that the United States has taken the lead on training the new Afghan national army. There are now 34,000 officers, NCOs and soldiers serving in the Afghan national army. We also assist with that; for instance, we have Afghan cadets at Sandhurst.
</p>

<a name="60201-02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a> The police reform about which the noble Lord asked is being led by the Germans, who are leading the international effort. The first stage of the process is complete, and over 60,000 police have received entry-level training.

The position of NATO is that we can see benefits in working closely. NATO&#039;s revised operational plan seeks to ensure far greater synergy between the NATO and coalition operations. The NATO operation is under various UN resolutions. Operation Enduring Freedom is under the invitation of the Afghan Government. The plan incorporates clear command arrangements for co-ordination and, where necessary, for sorting out any conflicts of operations under the respective missions, but there will not be a complete merger yet.

I also agree with the noble Lord about the obligations of other countries with respect to financial support. Some of the other major and very wealthy countries in the Middle East, and going further through to the Gulf, have made obligations which they have not yet met. Were those obligations to have been met, the financial position would be such that the Palestinian Authority would not be experiencing what is close to a financial meltdown.

Unless the issues of the headlong settlement of the West Bank, the cantonisation of the West Bank, the 600 checkpoints in the West Bank and the humiliation of the Palestinians in the West Bank are addressed urgently, there is no hope whatever of keeping power, within the Hamas confederacy, in the hands of the moderates.

</p>


<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60201-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 2, line 43, leave out from &quot;offence&quot; to &quot;if&quot; in line 5 on page 3 and insert &quot;if he engages in conduct falling within subsection (2) and, at the time he does so&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
(a)   he intends an effect of his conduct to be a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism;

<br>
(b)   he intends an effect of his conduct to be the provision of assistance in the commission or preparation of such acts; or


<br>
(c)   he is reckless as to whether his conduct has an effect mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b).


<br>
(2)   For the purposes of this section a person engages in conduct falling within this subsection&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_51"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment does not just stand in the name of my noble friend Lady Scotland. In a model of co-operation and consensus, the amendments that have been tabled also have the support of the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Goodhart, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. We are always grateful to these noble Lords for their co-operation and for the spirit in which they have approached scrutiny of this Bill, but I am especially grateful on this occasion. I understand the concerns they originally had about intent and recklessness and how these could be inserted into Clause 2, but I am particularly grateful to them for working closely with my noble friend Lady Scotland and with colleagues in the Bill team to ensure that we could find a test that would prove satisfactory to us all.
</p>

<a name="60201-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Before turning to the text of the amendments, perhaps I may say something about procedure, a subject I know is always close to your Lordships&#039; hearts. Only last week noble Lords agreed to the recommendations of the Procedure Committee, which touched on, among other things, amendments at Third Reading. What we are doing here today is exactly in line with those recommendations. One of the permitted purposes of Third Reading amendments is simply to tidy up a Bill, and that is what these amendments seek to achieve. They make no change of substance; indeed, if they did, I doubt whether such a star-studded cast of Peers would have put their names to them. Rather, these amendments respect the decision of principle that was taken on Report and ensure that the legislation is both effective and workable.
</p>

<a name="60201-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>For those of your Lordships who may be somewhat bewildered by the amendments before us, and by the differences between them and the text as it stands, I shall explain as briefly as possible why they are required. The text of Clause 2 has two main weaknesses, which these amendments seek to address. First, it does not sufficiently recognise that it is the publication, not the person, that does the encouraging. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_198"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 198</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Secondly, it does not sufficiently cater for those categories of action that do not involve actual dissemination, including, most obviously, possessing terrorist publications with a view to their dissemination. The same problems apply to material of use to terrorists and to recklessness. For those reasons, the text of the Bill is in need of some revision.
</p>

<a name="60201-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, made use of the concept of the effect of dissemination in his provision on recklessness in Clause 2(1)(b). We have been able to use this concept to ensure that the test we now propose to insert can work. The new test says that the person carrying out the conduct has to intend that an effect of his conduct will be the direct or indirect encouragement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism and that references to &quot;an effect&quot; include an effect of the publication or one or more of the persons to whom it may become available as a consequence of that conduct.
</p>

<a name="60201-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 revise the test in Clause 2 in such a way that the current weaknesses can be overcome. Amendment No. 3 is purely to correct a nonsense that I think we can all accept crept into the text on Report. We in the Government, the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Goodhart, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, are all satisfied that the test we now propose will work. I urge your Lordships to accept all these amendments. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="60201-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, we are genuinely grateful to the Government for their decision, taken some weeks ago, to accept the principle that offences under Clause 2 as well as under Clause 1 should require intent, or at least recklessness. We on these Benches would have preferred recklessness not to be there, but we voted on that on the first day of Report, and lost.
</p>

<a name="60201-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>The version of Clause 2 tabled by the Government on Report was, we thought, unsatisfactory, confusing and extremely difficult for anyone to understand. We therefore put forward our amendment which was not different in principle, but which we thought provided a simpler and clearer definition of the real issue. Subsequently, the Government have produced a very much revised version of their original amendment which has been considered by bodies representing the university librarians and has met with their approval. In those circumstances, we see no useful purpose to be served in seeking to insist on our own amendment. We on these Benches, and no doubt noble Lords on other Benches in your Lordships&#039; House, are content to accept the present version put forward by the Government which, we are glad to say, will bring to an end one contentious issue on the Bill.

</p>

<a name="60201-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>I still do not understand how the Government could have made such a mistake at the beginning on producing the Bill. It has taken a lot of time and trouble by many people to get it right. However, we shall not worry about that now. I am sure everyone is extremely grateful that the right solution has been found. Time will tell whether the Government have made sure that innocent librarians will not have to appear in court to defend themselves for simply doing their proper job.

<a name="60201-04_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   My Lords, I join noble Lords in thanking my noble friend the Minister for the characteristically open way in which she has pursued an understanding of the effect of Clause 2. Libraries and the academic community, including Universities UK&#151;I declare an interest as chief executive&#151;saw potential in the original draft to catch innocent activities. They feared that confusion about what was intended to be an offence under Clause 2 as originally drafted might lead to self-censorship. I am delighted that the Minister has sought to make it clear that only those who intend to provide encouragement or assistance to terrorists will be caught by this offence. Not only has she done this by means of numerous assurances; we now have an amendment which puts the matter beyond doubt.
</p>

<a name="60201-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>I pay tribute to the way in which the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Goodhart, have sought to achieve this clarification. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, has also been unstinting in her support for the libraries and academics, as indeed have many other noble Lords who have spoken eloquently on the subject. I wholeheartedly support the government amendment. It will set many minds at ease outside this House.

</p>

<a name="60201-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>While I welcome the amendment, I ask the Minister for two assurances. First, at Second Reading and other stages of the Bill, I raised the issue of the relationship between the requirements of this Bill and of the British Library Act 1972 and the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 with respect to the corporate person of the British Library and the other copyright libraries. The two issues on which I particularly focused were the requirement under the 1972 Act that the British Library maintain a comprehensive collection&#151;and, therefore, it should indeed collect terrorist materials&#151;and the requirement placed on the legal deposit libraries in general under the 2003 Act to receive copyright material whether in print or electronic. Those two requirements do not now conflict with the Bill, as amended, but I should like the Government&#039;s assurance that the Bill does not conflict with the statutory requirements under those two Acts.

</p>

<a name="60201-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>The second assurance that I would be most grateful if the Minister could give me refers to what has now become known as the Hazel Blears letter written in January of this year to many persons interested in this Bill, and quoted on Report by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, in which my right honourable friend Hazel Blears argued that libraries should not allow,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;impressionable people to see such publications&quot;.&#151;[Official Report, 17/1/06; col. 563.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The letter was suggesting that libraries would in future have to examine and test everyone who wanted to look at particular materials.
</p>

<a name="60201-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>My noble friend Lady Scotland, in replying to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said that my right honourable friend&#039;s letter had been written prior to the Government&#039;s change of mind with respect to Clause 2 and that if the letter were to be written again, it would be phrased differently. If the Minister can indicate in what way it would be phrased differently, that would be enormously helpful to the libraries community.
</p>

<a name="60201-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>In conclusion, I echo what has been said by my noble friend Lady Warwick. I thank those who have supported the libraries, particularly the British Library and the copyright libraries, in the discussions on the Bill. I pay particular tribute to the indefatigable support of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, for the British Library, for which, I assure her, the library and its staff are enormously grateful.

<a name="60201-05_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank those who have produced this comprehensive amendment.

</p>

<a name="60201-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>At this late stage in the game I am reluctant to pick any nits, if one can use that phrase in this noble House, but, like the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, I have one other question concerning deposit libraries to which I seek a response from the Minister. This time it involves not the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, but the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, who I am pleased to see is responding to the questions being raised. In the debate on Amendment No. 84 on the final day of Report, the noble Lord said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;This amendment, prompted by those changes, will give further protection to the interests of libraries, for example. That is because publications could conceivably be seized from libraries because of the actions of particular librarians&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 25/1/06; col. 1254.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>He added that it was a &quot;matter of interpretation&quot;. I should be most grateful if the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, in responding to the questions he has been asked, would comment on what interpretation he was placing on that because he will appreciate that a lot of librarians became worried by the awful prospect of gentlemen and ladies, possibly wearing black balaclavas, coming in and forfeiting large chunks of deposit libraries. Perhaps he could say something to calm those fears.

<a name="60201-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, I, too, welcome the amendment and compliment those who drafted it. I do not want to be churlish about it but it shows the value of the way this House runs itself. The House was able to take all the time that was necessary to get this part of the Bill right. That is a tribute to the House and to the way it runs its affairs. I hope that will be a lesson to those people who want to alter the way this House runs itself and to impose on our deliberations the sort of restrictions that the House of Commons has seen fit to accept. I think that this could be a salutary lesson to the House not to change its procedures too quickly.
</p>

<a name="60201-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>What worries me is that the Bill came forward in the first place from the Home Office in a form that was completely unacceptable to virtually everybody in this country. There is a lesson there for the Home Office, too. When it is framing legislation that will have a possible effect on individual people of all sorts throughout this country, it should be ultra-careful. Ministers in that department should also be extra careful in agreeing to allow such legislation to come forward.
</p>

<a name="60201-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>This has been a good experience for the House of Lords&#151;for Ministers, for noble Lords on the Front Bench and, indeed, for the whole House&#151;in the way in which it has been able to improve the Bill. I sincerely hope that the Commons will not try to alter the Bill when it goes back, but I feel sure that Ministers will not allow that to happen.

<a name="60201-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I shall endeavour to ensure that my noble friend Lady Scotland receives the paeans of unadulterated praise that have rained on us this afternoon as a consequence of our bringing forward these amendments. I am genuinely grateful for all the help that we have had.
</p>

<a name="60201-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>It was never the Government&#039;s intention to capture the innocent activity of librarians, as I am sure all Members of your Lordships&#039; House would accept. However, we have been pleased to try to make progress in ensuring that the legislation is more accurately and precisely drafted, so that it does not have any unintended consequences. For that reason, if no other, I think that this exercise has been very useful.
</p>

<a name="60201-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>My noble friend Lord Eatwell has understandably asked for further points of clarification. I am more than happy to try to give him further assurance on the effect of Clause 2, as it now stands, on the work of libraries and librarians; I am happy to put our further thoughts on record.
</p>

<a name="60201-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>The Government are clear that the offence in Clause 2&#151;with intent and subjective recklessness&#151;will not have the effects that some of your Lordships had feared. It will not force libraries to stop activities that we would all, I am sure, regard as legitimate and it will not force copyright libraries to desist from activities that they are legally bound to carry out. Nothing in the Bill will prevent the British Library carrying out its statutory functions under the British Library Act 1972, in particular maintaining the comprehensive collection that it is required to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_202"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 202</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

maintain by Section 1(1) of that Act. Nor does the Bill contain any provisions that would hinder the operation of the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003, including the British Library&#039;s automatic receipt of a copy of every work published in print. It is clear that such works must be deposited at the British Library without the library having to request them in advance, although even if the library had to request them in advance, that would not present any difficulties with regard to Clause 2 of the Bill. In addition, Clause 2 does not present any hindrance whatever to the British Library in maintaining a collection of on-line publications that is representative of this medium. It has never been the Government&#039;s intention that these possible consequences should ever have happened, nor, I believe, has the offence ever been drafted in such a way that they would have happened. The fact that we have now inserted intent and subjective recklessness should remove any lingering doubts on this issue.


</p>

<a name="60201-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Having given the House that general assurance, I should like to explain in a little more detail why any specific provision relating to the copyright libraries would be unnecessary. First, the offence in Clause 2 does not place any new obligation on libraries to examine the publications that they obtain or possess. It will therefore not be the case that if a library does not know the contents of a publication it could be prosecuted under this offence. Secondly, it is now necessary for the prosecution to show that anyone charged with this offence committed it through either intent or subjective recklessness. If someone disseminates a terrorist publication with the intention that it should come into the hands of someone who would be encouraged by it to commit terrorist acts, such a person should be guilty of an offence. If someone disseminates a terrorist publication knowing that this will happen, or knowingly takes an unreasonable risk that it would, they too should be prosecuted. These points should be acceptable with regard to libraries and librarians. Obviously if they commit the offence with intent they should be prosecuted, but even with regard to recklessness there is no problem.

</p>

<a name="60201-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Libraries and librarians are under no obligation to examine publications more than they would otherwise have done. They are not obliged to examine the people to whom they make the publications available more than they would otherwise have done. So I do not see how, in the ordinary course of events, they could be said to be subjectively reckless in disseminating them. Even when they know that a text has the potential to encourage terrorism, for example, if they are alerted to that possibility by its title or reputation, to be subjectively reckless they would still have to know that they were taking an unreasonable risk in lending it to a particular individual. If the librarian did not know that a publication was likely to encourage terrorism, or if they did not know that a person seeking to borrow it was likely to be susceptible to such encouragement, they could never be convicted of the offence because <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_203"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 203</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

they would not have knowingly taken an unreasonable risk. They could therefore not be subjectively reckless. As we have explained, they are under no extra obligation to examine either publications or borrowers. I hope that those reassurances are sufficient to end any concerns that your Lordships may have had about the possible effects of Clause 2 on libraries.
</p>

<a name="60201-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Responding to the reflections of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, at an earlier stage in the Bill, of course the Bill allows for the seizure of terrorist publications, but there is no intention to seize material from deposit libraries or other legitimate libraries. What is more, the amendment made on Report to Schedule 2 ensures that in the highly unlikely event of an inappropriate seizure the material can more easily be returned. I hope that reassures the noble Baroness. I think that we have now come to a reasonable accommodation. I hope that the further assurances that I have given to the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, more than suffice; and I trust that I have answered the point understandably raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams. We do not want to alarm librarians, but we need to have clarity on the way in which the law operates. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have been concerned about this part of the Bill.

</p>

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60201-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart </b>   moved Amendment No. 4:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>Page 4, line 44, leave out &quot;, in the opinion of the constable giving it,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 4, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10. This group of amendments applies to Clause 3, which deals with the dissemination of material by Internet service providers. The Internet is now, as all noble Lords will know, an extremely important method of transmitting information and opinions. The transmission by an Internet service provider could include the transmission of a terrorist publication. Internet service providers do not and in practice cannot monitor all the material that they transmit. Clause 3 contains a mechanism for giving notice to an Internet service provider if the authorities discover that the provider is transmitting what is called in the Bill &quot;unlawfully terrorism-related&quot; material. Notice is given by a constable if, in his opinion, the Internet service provider is transmitting such material. &quot;Unlawfully terrorism-related&quot; material is defined in subsection (7); I will return to that definition later.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_204"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 204</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60201-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The notice to be served under Clause 3 requires the removal of the offending material within two working days. Non-compliance with the notice is not, in itself, an offence, but a non-compliant Internet service provider is treated as endorsing the material and, therefore, exposed to prosecution under Clause 1 or 2. An Internet service provider could, in theory, object to the notice and defend the prosecution on the grounds that the material was not, in fact, unlawful. However, the inevitable result in practice is that the Internet service provider will comply with the notice. That provider has no benefit from fighting the notice. If it does so&#151;or continues to transmit that material and then seeks to defend a prosecution&#151;it faces costs, considerable time and expense from the court, and a possibility of conviction. Against that, it will get no benefit at all in practice from objecting to the notice. The obvious answer for any Internet service provider is simply to accept the notice and remove what is regarded as offensive material.
</p>

<a name="60201-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>On Report, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said that market forces would deal with that problem. Well, they will not; in fact, market forces make it obvious that Internet service providers will not contest any notice that is given to them. It is also extremely unlikely that whoever has authored the material that is being objected to will challenge the notice. They may well not know that it has even been blocked.
</p>

<a name="60201-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>We believe that this gives rise to two big problems concerned with freedom of speech. It is convenient to speak to them together because, while they are quite different in nature, only by doing so does one get the full picture. The first relates to the Internet, which, as I have already said, is an extremely important method of communication. However, many authoritarian governments block unwanted material and take steps to ensure that such blocking is effective. That is notorious in, for example, Saudi Arabia, but particularly in China.
</p>

<a name="60201-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>There has been much recent publicity in China about Google, which is setting up a new search engine for customers there. The Chinese authorities are insisting that it should not carry material which they do not want Google to carry for people there. For example, if in China you search for references to Falun Gong, you would only get extremely critical articles saying that that is a dreadful terrorist organisation. You would not get the other side of the story at all. Therefore, to allow the police to serve Clause 3 notices&#151;in effect, to block transmissions&#151;with no oversight and by any other authority, especially with no judicial control, is not acceptable. It may be acceptable to the Chinese or Russian authorities, but not here.
</p>

<a name="60201-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>We believe that this is a real threat to freedom of speech, and Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 10 would require judicial authority for the issue of the notice. The procedure that we envisage is something similar to that for the issue of an arrest warrant. No notice will be given to the Internet service provider, and the service of the notice will be delayed by a few hours&#151;24 hours, at most. The judge would, of course, have to satisfy himself or herself that there were indeed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_205"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 205</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

grounds for serving the notice. This will have a limited effect for obvious reasons, particularly for time, and we accept that there could be no hearing; but at least this step would prevent obvious abuses and would make the police think twice about whether the notice was really needed before they went to a judge to obtain authority to serve it.
</p>

<a name="60201-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The second problem, dealt with by Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8, is the extreme width of the definition of what is &quot;unlawfully terrorism-related&quot; in subsection (7). I shall read it to noble Lords to demonstrate its breadth. The subsection states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;For the purposes of this section a statement or an article or record is unlawfully terrorism-related if it constitutes . . . something that is capable of being understood as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I draw the attention of noble Lords to the words, &quot;capable of being understood&quot;. All sorts of things are capable of being understood in all sorts of different ways by different people. Material may be capable of being understood in ways that are unexpected by anyone who creates or transmits certain material. Saying that that material is &quot;unlawfully terrorism-related&quot;, simply because it may possibly be understood by some unknown person as encouraging terrorism, is way beyond anything that is reasonable.
</p>

<a name="60201-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Before anything that is being transmitted by an ISP is blocked, the police and the judge should be satisfied that that material is &quot;likely to be&quot; understood as encouraging or assisting terrorism. A Clause 1 offence is committed only if the published statement is &quot;likely to be understood&quot; as encouraging terrorism. That is on the face of the Bill. Similarly, in Clause 2(3) a publication is a terrorist publication only if it &quot;likely to be understood&quot; by persons to whom it is available as encouraging terrorism.
</p>

<a name="60201-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>There is no justification whatever for applying a weaker test in Clause 3 for something that is unlawfully terrorism-related. Otherwise, we will end up in the absurd situation where the police can serve a notice under Clause 3 warning an Internet service provider to remove material from transmission, even though that material is not &quot;likely to be understood&quot; as encouraging terrorism, but merely that it is possible that it might be. It might be material that could legitimately be published or disseminated by its creator under Clauses 1 or 2. That is plainly wrong. The test for the notice under Clause 3 should be the same as the tests under Clauses 1 and 2.
</p>

<a name="60201-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The combination of those factors&#151;the absence of any oversight of the police&#039;s use of their powers under Clause 3 and the unreasonably wide meaning given to &quot;unlawfully terrorism-related&quot;&#151;means that Clause 3 as it stands is likely&#151;I repeat, likely&#151;to be a serious threat to freedom of communication. I have little doubt that those views will be shared by the courts.
</p>

<a name="60201-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>These are important amendments that should be accepted by the Government. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60201-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, in view of the scope and incisiveness of the analysis given by the noble Lord, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_206"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Goodhart, I can be extremely telegraphic. We share the noble Lord&#039;s concern about the threat to freedom of speech posed by the power of constables to issue Clause 3 notices. As the noble Lord rightly said, there is no incentive for an Internet service provider to challenge the notice. The only control contained in the Bill is the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;in the opinion of the constable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The noble Lord has explained graphically why that is a wholly inadequate protection of the principle of freedom of speech. He will have our support.

</p>

<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60201-07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, this is not only a major issue, but it will become more and more important as the Internet extends to more countries and more people in those countries. Members of the House may recall that a couple of years ago the BBC attempted to extend its contract in China to enable it to produce new services for the Chinese people.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The Chinese Government took extreme exception to a harrowing and profoundly disturbing programme, which some noble Lords may have seen, called &quot;The Dying Room&quot;, about the deaths of many infant girls in China which were not prevented. In consequence, the Chinese Government made it plain that they were not likely to accept an extension of the BBC&#039;s remit. In other words, the principle of censorship was once again made central to the basis upon which a contract might or might not be accepted.

<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="60201-07_time0"></a><h5>4.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60201-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>This kind of behaviour is likely to become a greater threat, not only in this country but elsewhere, as my noble friend has indicated, to the freedom of expression at a time when the world badly needs such freedoms. Indeed, the recent willingness of Google to accept certain limitations on the provision of its services to Chinese citizens is profoundly troubling. Similar attitudes have been taken in the past by governments like those of Malaysia, Russia and others.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>This matter is of much more than technical importance. It is extraordinary that an issue of such significance, where the example given in this country may well have an extensive influence far beyond its borders, should be able to turn on the opinion of a constable, however serious and conscientious a police officer he may be.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>I therefore plead with the Government to consider carefully the position put forward by my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, because much more than a simple technicality is involved. There is, in this set of minimal and modest-looking amendments, a great deal at stake.

</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60201-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, this group of amendments seems designed to protect not only freedom of expression but also freedom of information. Those freedoms are highly important for the continued existence of democracy and thus, indirectly, for the restraint of terrorism. I am therefore very pleased the support the amendments.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_207"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 207</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60201-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, to use a word much favoured by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I shall be telegraphic in putting the Government&#039;s argument. I see no point in prolonging a debate which we have had on two, if not three, occasions.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>As ever, we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for tabling these amendments because they enable us to get to the point of the issue. We do not have a lot more to add to comments made from these Benches on Report. I will, however, deal with Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 10, and then Amendments Nos. 6 to 8.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has expertly explained, Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 10 insert a measure of judicial oversight into the notice provisions on the Internet in Clause 3. I understand that this has been principally argued for by the Opposition because they believe that the effect of a notice, when served on an Internet service provider, will be to force it to comply. The Government believe that this is incorrect, and that judicial oversight is unnecessary. First, we do not think that the effect of the notices will be to oblige Internet service providers to comply in all cases. This is the case not just because of the effect of such compliance on their customers and brand reputation, but also because the principal mischief this clause is aimed at is that of those who run websites&#151;the webmasters&#151;not Internet service providers. We expect very few notices to be served on Internet service providers.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Secondly&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, conceded on Report&#151;the amendment is not even desired by the UK Internet industry. UK Internet service providers want a process similar to those already in operation for communications data. They want a single point of contact between them and the prosecuting authorities, and clear guidance on what, how and when to deal with notices when received. That is exactly what we aim to deliver.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Thirdly, the inclusion of &quot;intent and recklessness&quot; in Clauses 1 and 2, while not directly dealing with notices, makes it far more likely that an Internet service provider&#151;or, indeed, a webmaster&#151;will take issue with the serving of a notice, and refuse. More importantly, we are also worried that the insertion of &quot;judicial involvement,&quot; proposed by this amendment, will prove unnecessarily burdensome, especially as the amendment requires a senior judicial level of involvement; that is, the involvement of a High Court judge.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="60201-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, the appropriate judge is not a High Court judge; it can be a circuit judge or a judge of the High Court under Amendment No. 10. So, it is not restricted to High Court judges.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="60201-07_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, having looked at the amendment again, I accept that as a point of clarification and interpretation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="60201-07_spnew5"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, could the noble Lord explain how he reconciles his two statements: the first being that there will be very few notices; the second <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_208"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 208</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

being that judicial involvement will very burdensome? To my simple mind those two statements seem somewhat difficult to reconcile.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="60201-07_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that they are particularly difficult to reconcile. Clearly, when a notice is served, it will be burdensome to deal with that particular procedure, at that particular time, and in that particular case.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>The other argument I take some exception to is that made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in comparing what we are doing here with what has been happening in China with Google. I think the analogy with China is quite inappropriate. After all, a notice under this clause does not require anyone to remove or censor material. It simply advises an Internet service provider that it will not be able to rely on the defence of non-endorsement. In that sense I cannot see that it is a direct restriction to freedom of speech in the terms used by the noble Lord to describe, and compare with, what is happening in China with Google. In any event&#151;and I have heard the noble Lord say this&#151;freedom of speech is not exactly an absolute concept with regard to the Internet. For instance, I am sure the noble Lord would accept the point that it is inappropriate and wrong for child pornographers to have access to Internet to publish their appalling material, and that we should seek to limit such access. So, I cannot accept his argument on that.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8, again I do not believe that there is much to add. The test of whether some or all of the persons who come into contact with a statement are likely to understand that statement as encouragement exists in Clauses 1 and 2. Under Clause 3, a constable applies the test of whether a statement is capable of being understood as unlawfully terrorism-related when considering issuing a notice. That difference is the root of the difference in the tests. The constable is asked to make a judgment as to whether a statement is capable of being understood as unlawfully terrorism-related. The noble Lord&#039;s amendment would require a constable to second-guess whether the court will take the view that an audience is likely to understand the statement as an encouragement. The Government&#039;s view is that this is unnecessary and that the police ought to issue a notice saying that they are concerned about the statement&#039;s presence as they would under present drafting.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I realise that there is a difference of view on this; I suspect that the noble Lord will not favour the Government&#039;s response, but we have to reach a conclusion. I hope that the noble Lord will reflect further upon it; I am asking the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, to withdraw his amendment, but not with great expectation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60201-07_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I shall be very brief. I am very grateful to all those who have spoken in support of these amendments, and particularly to the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, for his very trenchant intervention during the Minister&#039;s response. It is of course true that Internet service providers have not been lobbying for this particular group of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_209"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 209</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendments. That is perfectly understandable. They are commercial organisations concerned with having a procedure which they can understand and comply with. They are not concerned with issues of freedom of speech&#151;indeed, that has been shown by the action of some major Internet service providers in other parts of the world.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I have not been asking for uncontrolled access to the Internet. I entirely accept the principle behind this&#151;that something on the Internet, transmitted in material from a website, which is truly terrorist-related should be removed. It is simply that the police should not have the authority to enable them to go around removing any material which they have the slightest suspicion might possibly be of some interest to somebody for terrorist purposes.
</p>

<a name="60201-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I do not think that something &quot;capable of being&quot; understood and something &quot;likely to be&quot; understood are different in nature; they are simply different degrees of probabilities. Something is capable of being understood if it has maybe a one in 10 chance that it will be understood in that particular way. It is only likely to be understood if it has a 51 per cent chance. I think that the arguments for and against have been fully placed. I therefore seek the opinion of the House.

&quot;(   )   Nothing in this section shall apply to a transmission which is excluded from a criminal sanction under the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2013).&quot;

<p><a name="st_80"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope that we shall have only a short debate on this point and I do not intend to test the opinion of the House. This amendment has been tabled in order to try to get an assurance from the Government. I understand that the Internet Service Providers Association has been having discussions with the Government. Internet service providers are keen to ensure that the protection given to them under the e-commerce regulations 2002 should not be overridden by the Bill. Those regulations implement a European Community directive that is binding on the United Kingdom. However, the ISPA is still not satisfied with the assurances given on the application of the e-commerce regulations, although its concerns have been met on a number of other issues.
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The protections offered by the directive are essential to ISPs in the United Kingdom. Can the Minister answer questions which, if the answers are right, would have the effect of giving the assurances we seek? First, do the Government accept that exemptions from criminal proceedings under the e-commerce regulations should not be overridden by the Bill? Secondly, it appears not to be clear in the Bill that those exemptions do in fact remain in full force. Do the Government believe that the exemptions are not overridden by the Bill or, if they intend to deal with the problem at all, will they do so in some other way&#151;and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_213"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 213</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

if so, how? In particular, are the Government contemplating secondary legislation&#151;and if so, on what basis?
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I should add that the concerns of the ISPA also extend to the possibility of forfeiture of members&#039; servers under Clause 28. If that happened, it would be disastrous for an Internet service provider. My own view is that a court would have no power to do this and therefore I have not tabled an amendment on the point. However, the ISPA would be comforted if the Minister can confirm that this is also the Government&#039;s view. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60201-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, this amendment would ensure that service providers who fall within the definition of &quot;mere conduits&quot; are able to avail themselves of the protections in the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 against criminal liability. &quot;Mere conduits&quot; are, broadly speaking, providers who supply transmission and access services. These are usually Internet service providers who may also perform a number of other functions.
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>During discussions between officials, the UK Internet Service Providers Association and LINX, the ambiguity of the relationship between the regulations and the Bill was of clear concern to the industry. The Government have been less concerned, although obviously not complacent, because of the way the offences in Clauses 1 and 2 are structured. The intent and subjective recklessness tests and the defences of non-endorsement in both clauses mean that mere conduits who would be very unlikely to know about the presence of statements equally would be very unlikely to be considered criminally liable under the terms of the Bill. However, to provide additional clarity, during the Report stage, I confirmed to the House that the Government intend to bring forward a statutory instrument which will apply the protection against criminal liability currently enjoyed by mere conduits to the Terrorism Bill, as well as other provisions of the regulations. It is the Government&#039;s aim to do so as soon as is practicably possible with the aim that it will be completed within this parliamentary Session. So I can say that all sides of your Lordships&#039; House are committed to achieving the same effect. In essence we are seeking to examine the best means to provide the necessary protections via the statutory instrument which we intend to bring forward.
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a> I cannot advise the House to accept the amendment as it confers far wider protection than is granted under the terms of the e-commerce regulations. I am sure that the noble Lord will accept that point. It does so by conferring protection on transmissions rather than just the mere conduits protected by the regulations. We believe that the approach I have outlined to solving this little problem is the best way forward, given all the other safeguards that exist, not least the requirement for intent or subjective recklessness. I do not believe that the short gap that may occur between Royal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_214"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Assent and the making of the statutory instrument will place anyone at undue risk and certainly the industry does not seem concerned about the issue either.
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a> The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, sought another assurance about the seizure of articles under Clause 28. I can give the assurance on the ISPA request regarding search and seizure that the powers to search, seize and forfeit cover only articles that can be disseminated under Clause 2. Servers and other IT equipment owned by ISPs do not come under that definition. The noble Lord asked whether the Government accept that exemptions are not overridden&#151;yes we do and, as I explained, we will deal with the matter through secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a> I hope that having heard what I said about the amendment and about our intention to bring forward a statutory instrument as soon as we can, the noble Lord will feel happy to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60201-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, as I said at the beginning, I do not wish to test the opinion of the House on this amendment. Discussions between the Government and the ISPA and LINX are not concluded and no doubt there will be further issues. As regards your Lordships&#039; House, for the time being we must leave the matter there. I hope that what the Minister said will prove satisfactory to the organisations concerned. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
&quot;DEFENCES

<br>
(1)   Subsection (2) applies where in accordance with a provision mentioned in subsection (3), it is a defence for a person charged with an offence to prove a particular matter.


<br>
(2)   If the person adduces evidence which is sufficient to raise an issue with respect to the matter, the court or jury shall assume that the defence is satisfied unless the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that it is not.


<br>
(3)   The provisions in respect of which subsection (2) applies are sections 1(6)(b), 2(7)(b) and 3(5).&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_86"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment relates to the standard of proof on matters that have to be proved by the defendant. A defendant is never required to prove anything beyond reasonable doubt, but there are two possible standards that a defendant may be required to meet. The higher of the two is that the defendant must prove his or her case on the balance of probabilities. The lower level is that there is what is known as an evidential burden of proof; that is, if the defendant produces enough evidence to raise an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_215"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 215</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

arguable case, the burden shifts back from him or her to the prosecution to disprove that defence beyond reasonable doubt. The lower standard&#151;simply having to show an arguable case&#151;has been applied in a number of terrorist defences; for example, the evidential burden of proof applies to seven different sections of the Terrorism Act 2000 by virtue of Section 118 of that Act.


</p>

<a name="60201-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Requiring a defendant to prove particular facts as part of his or her defence, of course, conflicts with the general presumption of innocence and must, therefore, be used only with great care and when really necessary. I accept that in some circumstances where the facts are in the particular knowledge of the defendant, requiring the defendant to give evidence of those facts may be justified. But a reverse burden of proof should not be used beyond that.
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>This amendment applies to three provisions. The first two apply respectively to Clauses 1(6)(b) and 2(7)(b), which are similar. They both provide that it is a defence for the defendant on a charge of publishing or disseminating terrorist statements to show that what was published or disseminated did not represent the defendant&#039;s own views and, furthermore, clearly did not represent those views. It can be argued that the first issue&#151;that the statement did not represent the views of the defendant&#151;is wholly within the knowledge of the defendant and, therefore, requiring him or her to prove that on the balance of probabilities is acceptable. But the second issue&#151;was it made clear in the context that they did not represent the defendant&#039;s views&#151;is different.
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Let us look, for example, at a magazine which publishes an article which is sympathetic to the terrorist acts of Hamas. The magazine contains an article also which puts the contrary view. The magazine is prosecuted and the prosecution says that it has been acting recklessly. The publishers of the magazine satisfy the court that they do not agree with the article which is sympathetic to Hamas and that that article does not therefore represent their view. But the question arises: have they made that clear? That seems to be to a large extent an objective test. It depends not on the views of the defendants but on the likely reaction of readers, which is not within the specific knowledge of the defendants. I believe that it should be beyond doubt that once the defendants have shown what steps they took to make clear their disagreement with the views expressed in the article, it is for the prosecution to show that those steps were insufficient.
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The third clause to which this amendment applies is Clause 3(5). This arises out of the problem of repeat statements; that is, where a blocked statement reappears in the same form through the same Internet service provider, which is very difficult to prevent. It is a defence under the Bill to show that the Internet service provider has taken every step it reasonably could to prevent a repeat statement being transmitted. It is reasonable to require an Internet service provider to give evidence about what steps it took. But the question of whether it should have taken further steps is technical, because it is a matter of having to tell the court what other steps might have been available to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_216"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 216</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

taken, and objective, because it is a test of reasonableness. The burden of showing that the ISP could reasonably have taken further steps must once again be on the prosecution.
</p>

<a name="60201-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I accept, reluctantly, that it is legitimate to require the defendants to explain their views, or what steps they have taken to publicise those views or to prevent repeat statements being published. But it is wrong to require a defendant to prove matters which may not be within his own knowledge and may be objective in their application. The amendment aims to prevent what I believe would be an injustice and is inconsistent with the rules of our criminal process and the need to prove the guilt of the defendant. Any reverse burden of proof should be limited only to those elements of the offence which are primarily within the knowledge of the defendant and should not go beyond that, as the Bill now does. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60201-10_spmin0"></a><b>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </b>  My Lords, I rise with a little trepidation as I have not taken part in this debate before. The House may know that I am deputising here for my noble friend Lady Scotland.
</p>

<a name="60201-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has made clear, this amendment relates to the defences in Clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill, including as they are applied by Clause 3. The House has debated Clauses 1 to 3 at length, and plainly I do not want to go back over that ground. It is right, however, to remind the House that this is an area where the extensive amendments which have been brought forward into Clauses 1 and 2 have done two things. First, they make it clear that the Government have been prepared to listen to the concerns expressed in Committee and to refine Clauses 1 and 2 to take account of those. I refer particularly to the acceptance that the test of recklessness should be subjective rather than objective. Secondly, flowing from that, the result is the heavy burden on the prosecution in each of these offences. It was always a heavy burden, but it is heavier still. In particular, when one looks at the offences of recklessness, the prosecution will now have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the criminal standard; not simply that it would be reasonable to be concerned about the risk, but that there were those aspects of the defendant&#039;s own state of mind sufficient to justify subjective recklessness. It is important because one does not get into the defences under Clauses 1 and 2 until and unless the prosecution has proved that.
</p>

<a name="60201-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I know that at an earlier stage the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, indicated that the switch of evidential or legal burden was a poor substitute for changing the intent that was necessary, and that the House has not gone quite as far as he wanted on that occasion. It is right to say that although this is not limited only to intent, it is subjective recklessness which is the only addition to it.
</p>

<a name="60201-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I also recognise that in these amendments the noble Lord accepts, in relation to Clauses 1 and 2 but not Clause 3, that the elements in the defence should be treated differently. He accepts that, he said, reluctantly. I am not sure why he said that, but never <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_217"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 217</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mind; he accepts that a defendant should have to show whether he himself endorsed these views. He accepts that in relation to Clauses 1 and 2, and therefore the defendant will continue to bear the legal burden in respect of that element. His concern in relation to Clauses 1 and 2 is showing whether it was clear in all the circumstances that the statement or publication did not express the defendant&#039;s view or have his endorsement. Under the amendment, the defendant would bear the evidential burden only in respect of this element; one needs to be quite clear what that means in practice. Having the evidential burden means no more than raising the issue, whereupon it is for the prosecution to prove&#151;it may well do so before the defendant ever reaches the witness stand&#151;that the defence is not made out.
</p>

<a name="60201-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>In previous debates, the question of whether a burden should fall on the defendant has been discussed. It is not a straightforward matter. The House is also well aware that ultimately it may be for a court to determine whether it is appropriate to have placed a legal burden on the defendant in the particular circumstances. What is being provided by the Government in these clauses does not prevent the court from taking that view. The Government&#039;s view would be that it is perfectly right, appropriate, proper and compatible to place the burden in these circumstances on the defendant; but it would be ultimately for a court to say so. The noble Lord&#039;s final remark was that this is contrary to principles and present law. If that were so to the extent that it made the trial unfair, that is a matter the court could deal with.

<a name="60201-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I then look to why, in the Government&#039;s view, it is fair and reasonable to place the legal burden on the defendants in these cases. I start with Clause 3(5). I was a little unclear about what the noble Lord said. I may have misheard him but I understood him to accept that it was reasonable that the defendant should have to prove what steps he had taken. But the amendment would take that burden away from the defendant because it applies to the whole of the defence in Clause 3(5), not just a part of it.

<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="60201-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. My understanding was that if the evidential burden of proof is introduced, the defendant could not just say nothing. The defendant would have to give evidence about what steps he had taken. Once he had done that, unless they were plainly inadequate, it would be for the prosecution to say, &quot;No, the steps you took do not amount to reasonable steps&quot;. I do not think that there is an inconsistency.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="60201-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, I cannot agree with that. On the example given, I am not sure that it would be necessary for the defendant to give evidence. However, for the purpose of argument, let us assume that. But what about the next limb of Clause 3(5) which, again, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_218"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 218</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by the amendment, the noble Lord takes out of a legal burden on the defendant: that part of the defence is showing that he was a person to whom subsection (6) applied? Subsection (6) includes the fact that he is not aware of the publication of the repeat statement. The effect of the amendment would be&#151;I am happy for him to intervene and explain otherwise but it seems clear&#151;that the legal burden would be on the prosecution to prove that the defendant was someone who was aware of the publication of the repeat statement. There can be nothing more within the knowledge of the defendant than his own state of mind. We are at Third Reading; there is no coming back on the amendment. If the amendment were passed, there would be a real problem with the Act as then passed.
</p>

<a name="60201-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>On Clauses 1(6)(b) and 2(7)(b), I accept that the noble Lord has been more precise in the parts that he has taken out. But let us examine the purpose of the defence. The defence would arise in circumstances where somebody published&#151;and the prosecution would have to prove it&#151;a statement which was, to put it crudely, a direct or indirect inducement to terrorism, as so understood by reasonable people. So the person has published the statement. He also has sufficient knowledge of the risk that the statement will induce terrorism, but is subjectively reckless about taking it. I do not want to try to define precisely what &quot;subjective recklessness&quot; means; it has been discussed before. The person publishes the statement and has sufficient knowledge that it may be an inducement to terrorism, but is prepared to take that risk.
</p>

<a name="60201-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I can imagine circumstances in which somebody&#151;perhaps a broadcaster&#151;is prepared to do that. That person says, &quot;I realise that if I publish this on the television, or wherever, it may have the effect of inducing people to commit terrorism, but I think it is justifiable to take that risk because it is in the public interest&quot;. In those circumstances is it unreasonable to say to that person, &quot;It is a defence for you to do that provided you do not endorse that view, and it is clear that you do not endorse that view&quot;? Is it really unreasonable in those circumstances to say that that person needs not only to have the burden of taking that risk but of proving that that was the circumstance? I respectfully suggest that, given that we are providing this exception to meet that category of offence, it is not at all unreasonable to say, &quot;You may take that risk but you must prove that you did not endorse the view expressed, and it was clear that you did not endorse it&quot;. That will very clearly put on to the person who chooses to take that risk the burden of making it clear that they did not endorse the view expressed, which would be an easy enough thing for them to do.
</p>

<a name="60201-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I respectfully suggest that the amendment would plainly require the prosecution to do something that would not be within its knowledge, at least in relation to the point that I made on Clause 3(5). It would also be unreasonable not to say to someone who is publishing this material with subjective recklessness, &quot;You must take the risk and you must prove it&quot;. We must consider what lies behind this. I think that the <br>&nbsp;<br>

House is agreed on the fundamental principle&#151;we must stop people publishing statements which may encourage other people to commit acts of terrorism. I invite the noble Lord not to press the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="60201-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his very full, clear and thorough explanation of his views. However, I remain largely unpersuaded by them. There is a strong case for applying the evidential burden rather than the higher burden in some cases, as was done in the Terrorism Act. However, we have made the case for the measure. I recognise that there are arguments on both sides. Therefore, I do not intend to divide the House and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60201-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Clause 8 [<i>Attendance at a place used for terrorist training</i>]:
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060201/text/60201-11.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="60201-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart </b>   moved Amendment No. 12:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>Page 9, line 28, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_6"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   In proceedings against a person for an offence under this section it is a defence for him to show that he had at no time while attending at that place intended to further any of the purposes specified in subsection (1)(c) or to assist other persons to further such purposes.&quot;

<p><a name="st_92"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 12 raises a freedom of speech issue. It seeks to amend Clause 8. Under Clause 8, attendance at a terrorist training camp is an offence whatever the defendant&#039;s motive for being there. Furthermore, it is an offence which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, so it is very serious. The offence applies to attendance at a camp anywhere in the world and whether or not the terrorism involved is directed against targets in the United Kingdom. There could be a number of reasons for attendance at a terrorist training camp without having any intention to further terrorism, but I want to concentrate on one which I think is the most important of these&#151;the effect that it will have on journalism.
</p>

<a name="60201-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>It is surely a matter of public interest and, indeed, of very great importance to understand terrorism in all its different aspects. That has become increasingly clear in recent years since we have been threatened by and, indeed, have suffered terrorism in our own country, as we have done for many years. It is important to understand the objectives of the terrorists and how they plan to attain those objectives. Clause 8, as it now stands, would seriously hinder this. It would prevent a journalist from going to the camp under cover in order to report to the world what is going on. Furthermore, and perhaps even more important, it would prevent a journalist from openly&#151;and with the knowledge and consent of those who are running it&#151;visiting a training camp in, let us say, Chechnya or Sri Lanka, where the terrorism is not directed against the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="60201-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Clause 8 would, I believe, seriously undermine investigative journalism. That is also the view of John Simpson, one of our most important, experienced and respected reporters. In a long article in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> on 15 January, he said:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_220"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 220</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;Everyone who saw Peter Taylor&#039;s meticulous series on al-Qaeda recently on BBC television will remember how valuable it was in explaining the thinking behind the violent threat to our society and values. It was an important piece of work, thoroughly in the public interest. Yet already, according to Taylor&#039;s executive producer, Fiona Stourton, Clause 8 of the Terrorism Bill is making the investigation of their next series on al-Qaeda extremely difficult&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>This is, of course, hearsay, but it is hearsay that comes from somebody who is in a far better position than I am&#151;and probably than any other Member of your Lordships&#039; House is&#151;to form a judgment on these issues.
</p>

<a name="60201-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Furthermore, I believe that Clause 8 is plainly incompatible with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. To be compatible, the absolute restriction in Clause 8 would have to come within one of the permitted restrictions under Article 10.2. Is Clause 8, as it stands,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>In its full strength, it is plainly not. Is it necessary in the interests of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;territorial integrity or public safety&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Again, I believe not.
</p>

<a name="60201-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>On Report, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said that the proper thing for any journalist to do when they ascertain that a place that they are visiting is a terrorist training camp,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;is to leave and to notify the . . . authorities&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 17/1/06; col. 650.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>That would presumably be, for example, an obligation to go straight to notify the authorities in Russia&#151;an obligation that is hardly likely to get the journalist into the camp or, if they get in, to get them out of it. It seems to me that this shows a total lack of understanding of the role and ethics of journalism.
</p>

<a name="60201-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>We have gone some way towards meeting the Government&#039;s objections. The burden will be on the defendant to prove a defence on the balance of probabilities; the burden will not be merely evidential, as we proposed in our earlier amendments on the subject. However, the provision is plainly, I believe, a serious danger to freedom of speech. Moreover, it is a danger whose removal would, I think, offer no threat at all to the security of this country. It is important to allow people to make a case to explain why they were at the terrorist camp and to show that they were there for purposes that are in no way connected with the furtherance of terrorism. This is something on which I would certainly wish to insist; I hope that your Lordships&#039; House will have the same view. I beg to move.

<a name="60201-11_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendment for all the reasons that have been outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and for another reason. It is important for the House to know that these camps are not like Sandhurst; they are often very informal and they are often in rural villages in places such as northern Pakistan or in tribal areas. They often operate on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, put together <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_221"></a>

because it is known that a number of people will be willing to attend at a particular time. People often travel there under cover of tourism or say that they are going to visit family members. Sometimes they travel with their womenfolk&#151;wives or sisters&#151;to provide that cover. Therefore, a woman may be there not because of any willingness to be associated with terrorism, but she would find it very difficult to assert her opposition because of the nature of the relationships and the power disparities that there are within many of those family situations, with which I am familiar. Therefore, I am anxious that there is an opportunity for women who are placed in those situations to be able to afford themselves of a proper defence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60201-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I shall keep my comments brief, as we have rehearsed this territory on at least two occasions. I express my gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for at least providing us with the opportunity to come to a view as a House. Nothing in this clause, or the Bill as a whole, will in any way hinder the work of legitimate investigative journalism or legitimate academic pursuits. I repeat the point that was made very capably on Report by my noble friend Lady Scotland; a journalist who has suspicions that terrorist training is taking place can take steps to establish whether there is any foundation to their suspicions. However, at the point when those suspicions have been confirmed, the correct course of action is for that journalist to leave and alert the appropriate authorities. That is as true for journalists as anyone else.
</p>

<a name="60201-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>On Report, many noble Lords pointed out that journalists or academics may want to interview guerrilla leaders for the purposes of furthering knowledge and understanding of the purpose and methods of their movements. That is an understandable, laudable and highly desirable activity. I am sure that many of us have benefited from reading important contributions towards that understanding. I can think of one or two books that I am sure have been gleaned as a result of interviews with those who are very close to or who are involved in guerrilla activity. However, as was explained in correspondence to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, on 24 January, there is no reason why those interviews cannot take place, provided that they do not happen in a place where terrorist training is being provided.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="60201-11_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. Is he really suggesting that it is perfectly legitimate for a serious journalist to have an interview with a terrorist leader 10 yards outside the gates of the camp, but once he goes through those gates he is committing an offence that is punishable by 10 years&#039; imprisonment?
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60201-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, clearly a practical view will be taken of the circumstances in which interviews are given.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_222"></a>

</p>

<a name="60201-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>As we have indicated before, we consider that this amendment would allow a significant loophole. It is not difficult to imagine that our courts may be faced with a steady stream of people claiming that they were simply observing but not participating, and that is not acceptable. The Government&#039;s position is clear; no one has any legitimate reason to be in a place where they know that terrorists are being trained. It is as simple as that. We simply should not allow a get-out clause. I am confident that terrorists would not be slow to exploit one.
</p>

<a name="60201-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>In the light of what has been said and, in particular, the reassurances that we have given and sought to offer in respect of journalists&#151;whose work must clearly be encouraged and fostered&#151;I had hoped that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, would withdraw his amendment. Having heard what he said earlier, it seems extremely unlikely that he will. We simply have to draw a line here and express our clear difference of view on how this part of the legislation&#151;

<a name="60201-12_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </b>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, I took his slight barb that there had been no reception of any notice from me that I would raise the issue of women. I should have thought that the Government, being so mindful of women&#039;s issues, would have had that before them in any event. The reason I raise it today, not having raised it before, is that it has only just been drawn to my attention how people going to such camps frequently use women as cover. It is important that the Government have a view on whether such a woman would have a proper defence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60201-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I suspect that the noble Baroness&#039;s understanding of what she described as informal camps is accurate. She clearly is knowledgeable on the subject and knows much more about it than I. No doubt such a defence could be offered in those circumstances, but that does not deter me from the view that we have expressed before on this amendment and how it has been argued by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. We clearly have a difference of view, and no doubt the noble Lord will seek to ensure that that difference of view is expressed by your Lordships&#039; House.

<a name="60201-12_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt again, but unless there is a possibility of a defence for such a woman, then she will be convicted for being there in attendance with her husband.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;There have been unreflective, knee-jerk laws in this area in the past: the ban on broadcasting the sound of Gerry Adams&#039;s voice, for instance.

Does the Government really mean to do this amount of damage to the meticulous, independent journalistic investigation of terrorism? Surely not&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="60201-12_spmin0"></a><b>The Deputy Speaker  (Lord Lyell): </b>  My Lords, Amendment No. 13 stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. I should advise the House that there is a mistake in the amendment. It should read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;(a) after &#039;terrorism&#039; in subsection (4), insert &#039;advertently or by design&#039;;</p>

<p>




</p>

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60201-12_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford </b>   moved Amendment No. 13:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>Page 18, line 33, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
&quot;(a)   after &quot;terrorism&quot; in subsection (4), insert &quot;inadvertently or by design&quot;;

<br>
(b)&quot;   </p>



<p><a name="st_104"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Government have very properly accepted that intent and recklessness should be an element in the offence under Clause 1 where a person publishes a statement to which the clause applies.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>There is a loophole, because the Government could say, &quot;We cannot prove intent or recklessness in this particular case. We will get the Secretary of State to proscribe the organisation to which this individual belongs. If the Secretary of State does that, and no question of intent or recklessness comes into it, then we can do him simply for being a member of that organisation&quot;. He will face exactly the same penalty&#151;up to 10 years&#039; imprisonment&#151;for being a member of an organisation or, if he wears a T-shirt or carries a banner, up to two years&#039; imprisonment. This is therefore a small amendment to Section 3(4) of the Terrorism Act 2000, which sets out the mechanism by which the Secretary of State adds an organisation to Schedule 2&#151;proscribes it&#151;with the effects to which I have alluded.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>All that &quot;advertently or by design&quot; adds is that the Secretary of State, in exercising his power to proscribe an organisation, must believe, first, that it is concerned in terrorism; and, secondly, that it is deliberately concerned in terrorism, not by accident. It may well be that if a person inadvertently published something that would answer the definition of &quot;indirect encouragement&quot;&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;the making of a statement describing terrorism in such a way that the listener would infer that he should emulate it&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>the Secretary of State could exercise his powers under Section 3(3).
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_226"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 226</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60201-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>These are two simple words, which are simply trying to introduce into the concept of proscription an intent on the part of the organisation to support terrorism. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="60201-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, on some occasions there is nothing so powerful as an example. This is a good occasion briefly to bring such an example to the attention of the House.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>In the course of the passing of the Terrorism Act 2000, provision was made for setting out a list of proscribed organisations, and then to add to it or&#151;in certain circumstances, rarely met&#151;to take a proscribed organisation off the list. In March 2001, an organisation rather amazingly known as Hamas-Izz al Din al-Quassem Brigades was added to that list; we know it as Hamas. It came in two forms. One was a military and terrorist organisation, which will be familiar to those who follow the affairs of the Middle East. The other was a charitable organisation which, among other things, provided welfare, hospitals and medical attention to the people of Palestine. Both those parts of the organisation are on the proscribed list.

</p>

<a name="60201-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>My noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford has pointed out that if somebody wildly enthusiastic about the electoral success of Hamas in the past few days were to appear outside the Houses of Parliament wearing a T-shirt saying &quot;Victory to Hamas&quot;, she would be liable to a two-year sentence. If she appeared and shouted the words &quot;Victory to Hamas&quot; within one kilometre of the Houses of Parliament, she would have committed an offence which could, in turn, lead to considerable imprisonment.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I mention that because we are all aware in this House that we are literally on the edge of an extremely difficult political decision on what one does about a terrorist organisation that decides to cease to be&#151;which Hamas has not yet done but may do at any moment&#151;a terrorist organisation and which abjures violence for the pursuit of electoral victory. We are familiar with this because of the endless drawn-out process under which the IRA has slowly moved from being a terrorist organisation to being part of the political process&#151;and it has been something of a nightmare to decide at what point that organisation changed from one to the other. It is not, however, any longer an academic matter, apart from Northern Ireland. It is an all too present matter and one which means that it would be difficult under this law and its associated laws for British citizens to talk to representatives of Hamas and to do so without any risk of being possibly regarded as supportive of a terrorist organisation.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I believe that my noble friend&#039;s amendment helps to some extent. It does not of course cross the huge question of how we legislate for that change to be made. If we are bent on the concept that we want to see democracy extended to more and more parts of the world, that will involve necessarily more and more so-called terrorist or, if you like, freedom-fighter organisations having to choose to become constitutional and democratic. So far none of our <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_227"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 227</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legislation gives us any indication of how that can be done. My purpose in rising to support my noble friend is to hope that the House will support his amendment, modest through it is, and to give the Government an opportunity, if the Minister wishes to take it, to say how they intend to tackle this extraordinarily difficult problem.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="60201-13_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendment. In doing so, I mention the organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir. Hizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamist organisation that has views with which many will disagree, but which clearly enunciate its opposition to violence. I was recently involved in a case in which a number of eminent public figures gave evidence about the nature of Hizb ut-Tahrir&#151;and from which I learnt a great deal.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>One concern I know that the Government have is the belief that there are oganisations which, although they themselves may not be espousers of terrorism, may because of their strong views act, even unintentionally, as a conveyor belt towards terrorism. That view should be approached with great caution. Many senior police officers and human rights organisations involved in these issues are very anxious that we do not alienate large numbers of people by creating or outlawing organisations whose views we may not espouse but which are not supporters of violence and which in many ways denounce the use of violence. In those circumstances, I am most anxious that we incorporate the idea of intent into this part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="60201-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, has mentioned Hamas in supporting the amendment. I should like to refer to the PKK in Turkey and to the MEK or People&#039;s Mujaheddin of Iran as regards Iran. The latter organisation benefits from massive support in both Houses of Parliament, which may surprise some, but it is perfectly true. There arises in this connection the question of ceasefires and when organisations have or have not come forward with a genuine ceasefire and with a genuine intent to negotiate with governments and others. So I am very much in favour of the two words which this amendment inserts into the Bill.
<a name="time_14"></a>
<a name="60201-13_time0"></a><h5>5.45 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="60201-13_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, in essence, I guess that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, wants to know whether an intent requirement is contained within the new grounds of proscription set out in Clause 21. Intent is a matter that can be proved only in a criminal trial, so it is not an appropriate concept to import into proscription. Nevertheless, there are important safeguards that will ensure that proscription does not happen in inappropriate cases.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>It may be worth reminding your Lordships of how the proscription regime operates. If the Secretary of State believes that an organisation has been concerned in terrorism, he may by order add it to the list of proscribed organisations. However, the order must be approved by both Houses of Parliament, subject to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_228"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 228</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

affirmative resolution procedure. Parliament has the absolute right to reject such an order if it disagrees with the Secretary of State&#039;s decision that an organisation has been concerned in terrorism and warrants proscription.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>In reaching its decision on the provision on grounds of proscription in Clause 21, Parliament can have regard to any statements issued by or on behalf of the organisation and the context and manner in which they were made. In that respect, amendments passed in your Lordships&#039; House at Report stage may not be as helpful as the previous version of Clause 21, which included a description of &quot;unlawful glorification&quot;. However, the Government are carefully considering our response to the amendments and may address them in another place.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I am conscious that generally, in regard to proscription, Parliament is required to some extent to take advice from the Government on trust. It has been the Government&#039;s practice to make available a sanitised version of the intelligence cases against groups that are candidates for proscription but, for obvious reasons, the detail of the intelligence must remain confidential. That is unlikely to be the case for organisations being proscribed on the basis of their indirect encouragement of terrorism. The reason for their prospective proscription will be their public statements, so Parliament will be able to assess the case against the organisations in question and determine whether the Secretary of State was right to say that they are suitable candidates for proscription. Among the factors that can be to taken into account is the nature of the statements in question.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>The Secretary of State, and Parliament in deciding whether to uphold his decision, will be able to consider whether the statements were such as to lead a listener to infer that he should emulate it. Parliament will also be able to consider whether the statement in question was a one-off mistake that did not usually and actually associate the organisation with the indirect encouragement of terrorism, or was symptomatic of the behaviour of the organisation. In forming that decision, the only issue at stake is the behaviour of the organisation. That is what both Houses of Parliament consider when deciding whether an organisation has been correctly proscribed. The process by which they reach their decisions will only be confused if it is suggested that they should stray outside those parameters.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Once an organisation has been placed on the list of proscribed organisations, it, or someone affected by its proscription, can appeal to the Secretary of State against proscription. If he does not accept the appeal, the matter can be appealed to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission, an independent judicial tribunal. If the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission dismisses the appeal, it is still possible for further appeals to go to the Court of Appeal or its equivalents in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Those arrangements are appropriate and would not be improved by the amendment. It does not add clarity to the way the Secretary of State makes his decision; <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_229"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 229</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

nor, for that matter, does it change how both Houses of Parliament will consider the case for proscription and either accept or reject it. In any case, it is inappropriate to seek to impose a statutory intent test in a matter that is not the subject of a criminal trial. The existing safeguards governing proscription are substantial and, we argue, have worked well.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, made some interesting comments and reflections on the proscription of Hamas, but it is worth reminding the House that it is only the military wing of Hamas that is currently proscribed. The political wing of that body is not proscribed, so it would not be affected in the way in which the noble Baroness suggests.
</p>

<a name="60201-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a> My noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws made comments about Hizb ut-Tahrir. Again, that organisation is not currently proscribed. The list of proscribed organisations is kept under review. If the Secretary of State decides that Hizb ut-Tahrir meets either the current criteria for proscription or those in the Bill, the matter will, as I have said, need to be endorsed by Parliament. The same point arises in response to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. I do not intend to comment in detail on individual cases, as that would be inappropriate while discussing legislation which, after all, provides the framework for those later considerations. The amendment is unnecessary, and would add nothing to the process of proscription. It would, if anything, confuse that process, which, as I believe most noble Lords accept, has worked very adequately until now. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="60201-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for his response. I have not used the word &quot;intent&quot; in my amendments for the very reason that he stated; intent is a matter for proof in the criminal court. Instead, I have sought to circumscribe to a very small degree the discretion which the Secretary of State has in deciding whether to proscribe an organisation. However, I have listened with care to the safeguards to which the Minister referred, and note particularly that there is parliamentary scrutiny of the Secretary of State&#039;s decision and that affirmative orders are required before proscription can be affirmed.
</p>

<a name="60201-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Mindful of the fact that the clause is to be considered later in another place, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, and express my great thanks to those who have spoken in favour of it in this short debate. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="60201-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford </b>   moved Amendment No. 14:

<p>

&quot;COUNTER-TERRORIST POWERS

<br>
(1)   Part V of the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) (counter-terrorist powers) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   In section 44 (authorisations)&#151;
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_230"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 230</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<br>
(b)   after subsection (3) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(3A)   The area or place specified in the authorisation may not be greater in extent than is necessary for the purposes of the authorisation.&quot;


<br>
(3)   In section 46(3) (duration of authorisation), after &quot;practicable&quot; insert &quot;and in any event within 24 hours&quot;.


<br>
(4)   After section 46 insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;46A   PUBLICITY


<br>
   The Secretary of State shall publicise without delay and in such manner as he considers appropriate, the confirmation, cancellation or renewal of an authorisation under sections 44 and 46.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_111"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, your Lordships will recall that more than 20 years ago, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 abolished the infamous sus laws, which had enabled policemen to stop and search and to arrest individuals on the street without any cause. As a result of that Act, an officer was required to have reasonable grounds for suspecting that when he stopped and searched someone, he would find a weapon or stolen articles or tools for the purpose of committing offences. That is the basic law, to which Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is a very considerable exception.
</p>

<a name="60201-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>When the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, replied to a similar amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, she said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;We think that Section 44 is merited and that it does exactly what it was intended to do inasmuch as stop and search under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is an important tool in the ongoing fight against terrorism&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20/12/05; col. 1635.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>Having listened to that point, I checked what was said when the Bill that ended in the Terrorism Act 2000 was introduced. In the House of Commons on 14 December 1999, Mr Straw said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;The main purpose of the Bill is not to extend the criminal code, but to give the police special powers to enable them to prevent and investigate that special category of crime. Those powers include an enhanced power to arrest and detain suspects, and powers to set up cordons, to stop and search vehicles and pedestrians, to investigate terrorist finances and to examine people passing through ports.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;The police have no interest in using those powers in circumstances in which the normal criminal law will suffice, nor do they have the resources to do so. In 1998, only 45 people were detained in connection with terrorism, and extensions of detention were granted for just 21 of them&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 14/12/99; col. 162.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Considering those words given by way of introduction to Section 44 of the 2000 Act, it is fair to say that the Home Secretary had in mind a limited power to be exercised in limited circumstances. Indeed, save in one or two respects, the power was limited.


</p>

<a name="60201-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Authorisation under Section 44 for a uniformed constable to stop a vehicle or a person in a place specified in the authorisation was limited, for example, to a certain period of time. It was to be exercised only for the purpose of searching for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism, and could be exercised whether or not the constable had grounds <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_231"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 231</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for suspecting the presence of articles of that kind, but only for a period of 28 days beginning on the day on which the authorisation was given. The authorisation could be given only if the person giving it considered it expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism. Those were the limitations of the 2000 Act and it is interesting to note how the legislation has been applied.
</p>

<a name="60201-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>When the Act came into force in 2001, not 45 people were arrested under the powers, but 10,200; by 2003&#150;04 that number had risen to 33,800, and the most recent report from the Home Office records 35,776 searches of vehicles and people, of whom only 455 were arrested&#151;not for terrorism offences but for matters discovered on their arrest under Section 44.
</p>

<a name="60201-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>On the type of people who have been arrested, a detailed breakdown of those stopped in 2003&#150;04 under this Act showed that more than one in five was black or Asian, and of course that was before the events of last July, since which time there has been a huge increase in the number of black and Asian people who have been stopped. Noble Lords may recall that while saying that they were not stereotyping, the British Transport Police issued a directive to their officers saying that they should target a part of the population.
</p>

<a name="60201-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Another group which has been targeted is demonstrators, the most famous of whom is Mr Walter Wolfgang, who was arrested under Section 44 powers at a Labour Party conference. A Mr John Catt, an 81 year-old anti-war campaigner was stopped while making his way through Brighton to an anti-war demonstration wearing an anti-Blair T-shirt. So the initial purposes announced by the Home Secretary back in 1999 for the way the powers under Section 44 were to be used have been ignored. The result is a grave danger that sections of the population will feel as targeted under this provision as those who were targeted under the sus laws, abolished some 22 years ago.
</p>

<a name="60201-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>So it is in that context that I put before noble Lords this modest amendment. It would substitute the words,


</p>

<a name="60201-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The amendment also attempts to limit the area in which the provision can be applied. Since 2001, the whole of the Metropolitan Police area has been designated within which the powers of the section can operate. Noble Lords will recall that initially the power was to be given for 28 days in very specific circumstances directly related to terrorism. Now the whole of the Metropolitan Police area is designated on a rolling basis. At the end of a 28-day period, the person who authorised the previous 28-day period signs a piece of paper, takes it to the Home Office where it is rubber-stamped, and the period is renewed for a further 28 days. That has been repeated over a period of five years. No thought is given to individual circumstances.

</p>

<a name="60201-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>For example, one can understand that if a political party conference is being held in Brighton and there are security problems, an authorisation under Section 44 is justified. But to designate the whole of the Metropolitan Police area on a rolling basis year after year was not the original intention of the Act. So the third amendment to the section I want to introduce provides that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;The area or place specified in the authorisation may not be greater in extent than is necessary for the purposes of the authorisation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>It should relate to the area where terrorist activity is thought to be likely to take place. I shall turn to the question of publicity in a moment.
</p>

<a name="60201-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>The Act requires the person authorising the powers under Section 44 to inform the Home Secretary &quot;as soon as practicable&quot;, to which I seek to add the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;and in any event within 24 hours&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>and finally, to introduce some transparency. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, suggested that we do not tell anyone which areas are subject to an authorisation under the Act, because all the terrorists will go to some other area and therefore that would be wrong. That is not a sensible way of proceeding: if a particular part of London, or of England and Wales is thought to require this special protection, the public should know about it and it should not be a matter of operational secrecy simply rolling over the authorisation, as has happened over a wide area. That is the reason for the final part of the amendment on publicity: that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State shall publicise without delay and in such manner as he considers appropriate, the confirmation, cancellation or renewal of an authorisation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="60201-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a> Obviously we on these Benches are anxious&#151;as are noble Lords in every part of the House&#151;to have effective tools to combat the curse of terrorism in our society, but we believe that those tools need to be focused, specific and not in themselves to cause a problem in the community by bringing about a sense of grievance among tens of thousands of people who are being stopped and searched for no proper reason.

<a name="60201-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Swynnerton: </b>   My Lords, I speak as the father of someone who was once stopped in such circumstances. He looks a responsible person; indeed, once when he was at university he was in this House and asked by the then-Conservative Whip to delay his departure from the House on the grounds that the Whip supposed he was a hereditary Peer, so I assume that he looks respectable in normal circumstances. He was stopped in Walton Street on his way to a luncheon appointment. All his possessions were put on the pavement. He was detained for about 40 minutes and was therefore late for lunch. To be late for lunch is not a very serious matter, but there is no question that if the police did not cause a sense of grievance they caused a sense of distress and anger in the person concerned&#151;perhaps anger is too strong, but in all events there was a sense that inconvenience had been unnecessarily caused. I shared that naturally, because I always side with what my family does or does not do. <br>&nbsp;<br>

I have heard my son pouring ridicule on the police in consequence of that action, which seemed an excessive intrusion on his privacy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="60201-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the views that have been expressed about the abuse of the former sus laws and that it would be extremely undesirable if Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 was abused, misused or used in a totally inappropriate circumstances. I cannot comment on the account given by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, of what happened to his son. It may not have been a reasonable use of powers under Section 44.
</p>

<a name="60201-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>However, we have to examine what the powers are there for. I have not had the opportunity of looking in detail at the comments that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, quoted from my right honourable friend Jack Straw. In that context I do not know whether he was introducing just this section or a wider part of the Bill, but my understanding of Section 44 has been that it is used under a range of different circumstances. It may be used in relation to a particular location, where there is a specific concern.
</p>

<a name="60201-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a> I would like to pose a question to your Lordships&#039; House. If, for example, there was intelligence suggesting that a particular site was in danger and by taking action in response the source of that intelligence would be compromised, I think that publicity would not be helpful and that highlighting a particular location and therefore potentially the source of the intelligence would be a mistake. Similarly, if a counter-terrorist operation was under way in a particular area&#151;for example, a surveillance operation involving a number of properties&#151;it might be a proper use of Section 44 for the police to be stopping either at random or virtually everyone in the surrounding area. However, because it was a continuing operation, it would not be in the interests of that operation to publicise the fact that the operation was in process.
</p>

<a name="60201-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>There needs to be very careful thought on this amendment. In the context that we are talking about, I certainly do not see that publicity will ever be helpful. It is also important that there is the opportunity&#151;I know that the police authority of which I am a member takes this very seriously&#151;to monitor closely the use of these powers, the way in which it happens, the circumstances and the statistics that are available. But there should also be the opportunity to get underneath that in order to know what guidance is being given to individual police officers on how they should use Section 44 powers when an authorisation is in force and to understand what happens when a police officer uses the power.
</p>

<a name="60201-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>One very clear message relating to the problems arising from stop and search in other contexts is that the way in which the stop takes place causes the most offence&#151;whether people are treated individually with respect or whether they are given any reason. I do not know the precise details of the example given by the noble Lord. But a lot of hurt, irritation and subsequent anger is mitigated if individuals are treated with respect and an explanation is given which at least they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_234"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 234</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

can understand. They would be able to say, &quot;Yes, clearly, I am not who you are looking for&quot; or &quot;I am not the sort of person you are looking for&quot;. It should be done in a way where that explanation is given.
</p>

<a name="60201-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>While I understand the nervousness about the Section 44 powers, we need to be very cautious about the amendment. It will impede counter-terrorist activity in a number of circumstances. It would be dangerous to pursue the lines that have been set out. I hope that after the Minister&#039;s reply the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60201-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, made much of the growth in the stop and search figures. But Section 44 of the Terrorism Act was part of the Terrorism Act which was passed in 2000. It was prior to the events of September 11 in New York and Washington and, of course, long prior to the events of last July. I do not find it surprising that the number of stops that have taken place under the terms of the Terrorism Act have increased sharply since the initial period after the introduction of the Act.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="60201-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord has been a member, and perhaps still is a member, of police authorities. What is his view on the application of this power to the whole of the metropolitan area for a considerable period of years?
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="60201-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I have discussed this in some detail. If you go through London borough by London borough to identify potential targets, your Lordships may be surprised to know that there is no London borough which does not have significant potential targets in its area&#151;whether they are installations of military significance or of major importance to the infrastructure or to the functioning of the state, or whatever else. Every part of London could potentially be a target. If you add to that the present objective of the terrorism that we are having to deal with&#151;to inflict mass casualties&#151;you start to think about places of entertainment, major shopping centres, football stadia and so on. It becomes very difficult to say that there is no part of London which is immune.
</p>

<a name="60201-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Whether the approach of saying, &quot;Let us designate the entire metropolitan police district rather than being a bit more selective&quot; is right or whether it is right that this should happen on a regular basis, it is not appropriate to comment. But I come to where I started when I intervened initially. Clearly, the police in using the powers under Section 44 must be very mindful of the danger of misuse and must avoid a situation in which we have recreated the sus laws, which many of us were involved in arguing against at the time. That is why I come back to the way in which the Act is used&#151;the way in which guidance is given to individual police officers about the circumstances in which they should do this, the way in which the stops take place, and the nature of the interaction between the police stopping an individual or a car and what is said to the individual concerned.

<a name="60201-15_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for having missed the first minute or two of what he said in moving this amendment. The powers under Section 44 are of great utility. Everyone agrees with that. Like many others, I am concerned that they are being used to an extent which is far in excess of whatever anyone originally imagined and, in some cases, are clearly being abused. The amendment is carefully drawn to limit the opportunities for abuse and to confine the powers to within the limits which were originally intended. I lend strong support to the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="60201-15_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </b>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment. I want to elucidate some of the confusions existing around this amendment. I had originally placed an amendment before the House, which I accept was probably much too complicated. I am grateful to my noble friend on the Liberal Democrat Benches for making a better go at this than I did. The reason why I support the amendment&#151;and the reason why I think there is some confusion&#151;is that when Section 44 was brought into the terrorism legislation in 2000, there was agreement that there could be circumstances in which stop and search should not require a reasonable suspicion and that the circumstances would be of such an extreme kind that one would want to move away from the police being expected to have a reasonable suspicion, which is what we require ordinarily.
</p>

<a name="60201-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>We were saying that there could be circumstances where, for example, the whole of Whitehall&#151;because of information or because an event was taking place, such as a visiting dignitary&#151;has to be subject to greater scrutiny and security and everyone, or every fifth person, has to be searched. One did not want to have the possibility of an individual police officer looking around and saying, &quot;I&#039;m going to search that chap there&quot;, because of the risk of discrimination in that. It may be that when my noble friend on the Cross Benches described the stopping of his son, it was because a police officer on a whim decided that here was a toff who looked like a Lord and that he would interfere with his going on his way. I do not know what the motivation was. But as regards the suggestion that politeness or giving a good reason would meet the problem, this is precisely where a policeman does not have to give a reason. The point of Section 44 is that no reason has to be given.
</p>

<a name="60201-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>It gives an incredibly new power to a police officer. For that reason, it should be used only in very special circumstances and in ways which are not discriminatory. This amendment attempts to put those limits back. There is clear evidence that police officers use it to select people without knowing full well that they will not be required to give a reason. That is the difficulty which we have to countenance.

<a name="60201-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I understand the point that my noble friend makes. There is a distinction between not having to have reasonable grounds of suspicion of an offence or whatever and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_236"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 236</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

making the stop; but there is then a distinction concerning what you say to the individual. In circumstances where you stop the person and say, &quot;We are stopping you because we are stopping one in five of the people going down this road&quot;&#151;I doubt whether that was the circumstance to which the noble Lord referred&#151;people can understand that.
</p>

<a name="60201-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Similarly, in wider cases of stop and search, if you say, &quot;We are stopping people with yellow anoraks with hoods over their heads, because someone has just been seen doing something, and you happen to have a yellow anorak with a hood over your head&quot;, that again people can understand. They may still resent it, but it removes some of that sense of hurt. I am not trying to suggest that simply being polite and providing that sort of background reason is a sufficient guardian against abuse of the power. I am saying it is an important component, and one which police authorities will take extremely seriously.


</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="60201-16_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </b>   My Lords, to respond to the points made by my noble friend, the example he gave of the person in the yellow coat answering a description is precisely the circumstance in which you do not use Section 44.

<a name="60201-16_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   Yes, I was not suggesting it should be.

<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="60201-16_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </b>   My Lords, the point of Section 44 is that you do not have to have an explanation. The difficulty, about which many organisations complain, is that police officers are not understanding the provision. Indeed, the Metropolitan Police Authority raised this as a source of anxiety, saying that it was interfering with trust in the police and they were worried about the consequences. Their powers are not sufficiently explained to them, and are using the provision in ways which are indiscriminate. As a result they are discriminating, using their powers most particularly against people deemed to be politically active, or who are brown-skinned and who look as though they may be Arab or of Islamic persuasion, or for whatever other reason they think might be involved in terrorism simply on appearance. That inevitably leads to real alienation within certain communities. That is what we have to guard against and the amendment attempts to return limitations to this power, to ensure that it is used only in the proper way.

</p>

<a name="60201-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>I entirely agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, that Section 44 plays a vital role in combating terrorism. Your Lordships should not be in any doubt about that. Yet it is important that it combats terrorism in a way that does not adversely affect the community from which so many of those who are stopped and searched come. Without the confidence of that community, we are never going to get to grips with the terrorist threat.
</p>

<a name="60201-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>What the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, has achieved in this amendment is getting the right balance in both the circumstances of stop and search, and defining the relevant geographical area. One can argue about the exact nature of the text, but we have here, in my view, the best of all possible worlds. I for one, on behalf of the Opposition, intend to support it if the noble Lord presses it to a vote.

<a name="60201-16_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that although strictly speaking we were not working within the confines of debate at Third Reading, it was a useful exchange and there was value added through the points made. Although we may ultimately disagree, and it seems as though we will have a Division on this, there is a spirit in your Lordships&#039; House which recognises that there is a real and genuine problem, that there is merit in the current way in which the powers work, and an understanding at least of the import of those powers in combating terrorism. There is a shared objective to do exactly that.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_238"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 238</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60201-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, recognised, stop and search under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is an important tool in the ongoing fight against terrorism. It is part of a structured anti-terrorist strategy. The powers help to deter terrorist activity by creating a more difficult environment for would-be terrorists to operate in. An authorisation under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act gives the power to stop and search pedestrians, vehicles, drivers and passengers, in the area specified in the authorisation. An authorisation can only be given if it is expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism. I do not agree with the point that was made about them being merely rubber stamped. They have to be made by an officer of ACPO rank and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State within 48 hours in order to remain valid after that period. The powers can be authorised in particular locations and for a particular period of time. The noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, made some extremely important points why that might be, in particular with regard to London.
</p>

<a name="60201-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s proposal would amend the grounds for authorisation of the powers from &quot;expedient&quot; to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;necessary for the prevention of acts of terrorism&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The terrorist threat is, as we all recognise, evolving. It has changed much since the passing of the Terrorism Act 2000. The terrorist threat is now much higher and has changed in its nature, from hostile reconnaissance through to the planning and commission of actual attacks. Applying grounds of necessary for the prevention of acts of terrorism would demand, I argue, an untenable threshold to be reached, and would require a level of intelligence about the specific movements of terrorists that would greatly reduce the police&#039;s capacity to deter and disrupt terrorist activity proactively. Intelligence rarely allows such a defined threat to be identified, and the police must be allowed to make informed and evidenced assessments of where the powers are best utilised, based on the information available.
</p>

<a name="60201-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, made much of the increase&#151;as he put it&#151;of stops and searches since previous legislation. Our point is simply this: Section 44 of the Terrorism Act is the equivalent of previous powers contained in the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, something of which the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will no doubt be familiar. Numbers of people stopped and searched under those powers were at a similar level in the late 1990s to the latest published figures under Section 44. It is important to differentiate between arrest and stop-and-search powers. Arrests are not necessarily a measure of the effectiveness of these powers, but they do help to deter, disrupt and detect terrorist activities.
</p>

<a name="60201-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>It may help the House if I provide some further statistical information in terms of the section and the way it is operated. In 2003&#150;04, of the vehicle occupants stopped and searched under Section 44(1), 70 per cent of those searched were white, 10 per cent were black, and 12 per cent were Asian. Of the pedestrians stopped <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_239"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

under Section 44(2), 72 per cent of those searched were white, 14 per cent Asian and 7 per cent black. Overall, searches of white people increased from 14,429 to 20,632&#151;up 43 per cent. Searches of black people increased from 1,745 to 2,701&#151;admittedly up 55 per cent. Searches of Asian people increased from 2,989 to 3,661&#151;up 22 per cent. Of the total number of stops and searches, 78 per cent took place in the Metropolitan police district and the City of London Police area. It is worth noting that the ethnic breakdown of the populations of those areas is significantly more diverse than the overall figure for England and Wales as a whole.
<a name="time_16"></a>
<a name="60201-16_time0"></a><h5>6.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60201-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a> The figures for the 2003&#150;04 period show that the number of stops and searches has risen across all ethnic groups, but the proportion of Asians stopped and searched has fallen slightly. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, made particular reference to the arrest of Mr Walter Wolfgang. It is the case that the police can use Section 44 in support of a structured counter-terrorist operation. Every senior member of the Government was present at the Labour Party conference, so it is not unnatural that the local police put in place appropriate security arrangements, and rightly so. It has been averred that this is an important factor and feature of conference activity now, and sadly that will probably remain the case for some time. We have always maintained that law enforcement agencies must have appropriate powers, which must be used properly, fairly and consistently. With regard to Mr Walter Wolfgang, my understanding is that the Sussex police rightly apologised to him, and acknowledge that the mention of powers under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act was a genuine mistake in this instance.
</p>

<a name="60201-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The contributions about the rubbing points, if you like, with regard to the use of the powers were important. We must ensure that these powers are used in a way that does not alienate part of our population and make them hostile to the overall effect of the terrorism legislation. Without that policing by consent in this field, the operation of counter-terrorist activities will be made all the more difficult. I entirely agree with that spirit. I do not think that, in the round, powers used under this part of the Terrorism Act do that. The police are extremely conscious of the need to take people with them. My noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey made those points very well, with his experience as chair of the country&#039;s largest police authority and his long involvement with policing in London.
</p>

<a name="60201-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a> The final point I ought to respond to is that made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, about the intent of the Act. It envisages that the whole of a force area can be authorised, and it was clearly the intention of Parliament that this option was available to police, in circumstances where it is warranted and justified. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, gave a good explanation of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_240"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

why that might be the case in London. The public would not greatly thank us if the police were not able to exercise their powers in that way, if it was felt there was a major terrorist threat. I argue that these powers will be used proportionately; the powers that have preceded them have been used proportionately, and the British public deserve the protection they afford. We cannot accept these amendments.

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60201-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for his reply, and to all those who have spoken in this debate. The contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, was a wonderful illustration of precisely where Section 44 is not being used properly. I remind your Lordships of something I said at the beginning; that under Section 45 of the Act the power conferred by an authorisation may be exercised only for the purpose of searching for articles of a kind that could be used in connection with terrorism. I fail to understand how, in the circumstances described by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, the police officer could have thought he was likely to find any articles concerned with terrorism. That is an unpublicised situation. When we deal with the position of Mr Wolfgang or anyone else who is simply a protester, the matter becomes even more absurd.
</p>

<a name="60201-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The purpose of this amendment is not to alter Section 44 in any drastic way. Indeed, I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Harris, would happily accept subsections (1), (2) and (3); it is only the question of publicity that he objects to, and I will deal with that in a moment. The amendment would bring the section back to the purposes for which it was originally designed, as stated by the then Home Secretary, Mr Straw, when he introduced the Bill in 1999.
</p>

<a name="60201-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I said that I would say a word about publicity. It is a fundamental principle that when we are abroad, in England and Wales, we know the law that affects us. We are entitled as citizens to know whether there are any specific provisions that give the police powers in the area where we are. It is incumbent upon the Secretary of State to declare the area to which the special powers apply. No one could be more concerned about the protection of the public than I am, but I do not believe it is helpful, or that it was the intent of this Act when it was passed, for whole areas&#151;and there may be whole cities outside London; we do not know, because they are not declared&#151;to be subject to these special powers permanently, rolling on, 28 days after 28 days, without any obvious consideration being given on a monthly basis to whether they are necessary.
</p>

<a name="60201-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>The word I take from the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, whose amendment was the precursor to what I am saying&#151;I am merely a follower in her footsteps&#151;is &quot;alienation&quot;, to which the Minister also referred. It is a balance. Everything we have dealt with in the Terrorism Act ultimately turns out to be a balance between the liberty of the people of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_241"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 241</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

this country and the need to protect them. I think the Act as originally drafted, in its original intention, struck a reasonable balance, but it has been misused in the way that I have indicated. Therefore, I seek to test the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="60201-18_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Byford </b>   moved Amendment No. 122:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>Page 2, line 15, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_9"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   In the event of a conflict arising between any of the aims included in the general purpose, Natural England shall give priority to the aim in subsection (2)(a) and (b) over any other paragraph in subsection (2).&quot;

<p><a name="st_132"></a>The noble Baroness said: In my humble opinion this is one of the most important amendments that we have tabled to the Bill as it deals with the whole question of the conflict that could arise when Natural England makes decisions. Although the list of aims under the clause is not ranked, as was explained in earlier sittings, we feel that the wording,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;promoting nature conservation and protecting biodiversity&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>is considerably weightier and more pointed than,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;contributing in other ways to&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>With no clarity over what the ultimate duty of Natural England might be in a situation of conflict, the pressure exerted by third parties and their supporters&#151;especially if the commercial opportunity is great&#151;could be considerable. Natural England needs to be given teeth and direction to help it meet the challenges that it will face as a major environmental body&#151;something to which the Minister referred at an earlier stage.
</p>

<a name="60201-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>We think that it is correct to give greater weight to the first aim. The purpose of this amendment is simply to ensure that no one can be in the slightest doubt about what the pecking order is. For example, a proposal to site an information centre and caf&#233; on the limestone pavement of Whernside would, I hope, be stillborn. However, an application to build it near the summit of Helvellyn might be accepted more readily although it would still pose a threat to the environment. I bring to the Committee&#039;s attention the conflict surrounding the proposals to build Horkesley Park&#151;supposedly an interactive John Constable experience&#151;in the Stour Valley. That proposal is likely to attract some 760,000 people to this part of an area of outstanding natural beauty, which has the highest level of landscape protection available. But at the same time the proposal could be seen as offering open air recreation. The developers could claim that Natural England&#039;s list of inclusive statutory purposes would not allow it to advise against policies or proposals which might seriously damage the natural <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_244"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 244</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

environment if the contribution to other aspects of sustainable development were great. Potentially there is a major conflict but, as the Bill stands, Natural England will have no teeth to address it. Not only will it not have the teeth to resist outside pressure, its direction could be compromised by unresolvable disagreement between board members. What is more, if major decisions are inconsistent, or seriously damaging to the environment, Natural England&#039;s reputation and credibility with stakeholders and the public could be seriously damaged.
</p>

<a name="60201-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The amendment is not intended to prioritise natural environment objectives over and above any others and in all circumstances; it would be an emergency brake mechanism that could be used in cases of irreconcilable conflict. I must emphasise that it would not form part of Natural England&#039;s motivation but would ensure that it could be a trenchant champion of the natural environment. If the situations I have described do not persuade the Committee, I turn to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee report, which recommended that provision be made in the Bill to address,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;those exceptional circumstances where there is an irreconcilable conflict, to make clear that the aim of conserving and enhancing the natural environment takes precedence over other purposes. We therefore recommend, for the avoidance of doubt, Clause 2(2)(b) be amended to include reference to the &#039;protection&#039; of the English landscape&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The Government&#039;s response, quoted in the Select Committee&#039;s report, misses the point. The Government state that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;it would be inappropriate to automatically give primacy to biodiversity and landscape over access and recreation in rural and urban environments in general&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The document continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;There is no call for &#039;automatic&#039; primacy for biodiversity and landscape in terms of funding or policy priority. What is required, and this view is widely shared, is a need for a clear priority for biodiversity or landscape where conflicts arise with some forms of recreation which are damaging to biodiversity or landscape and people&#039;s enjoyment of these things&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>So it is not just we on these Benches who are claiming that.
</p>

<a name="60201-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I refer the Committee to the announcement only this week of the swingeing cut of &#163;1 million that casts a shadow over Wordsworth country, and to the statement that the Lake District faces the biggest ever reduction in services; park authorities warn Ministers over the cash crisis. If Natural England will not fight its corner on behalf of some of those areas, we are not doing the right thing in setting it up in the way that the Bill proposes.
</p>

<a name="60201-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>In Standing Committee A, the Minister, Jim Knight, said that applying the Sandford principle to regional development agencies would be difficult, and that the Government want the RDAs to take the lead in the economy but with due regard to sustainable development. That adds more weight the other way. If the RDAs&#039; real purpose is to take the lead regarding sustainable development&#151;which I believe it is&#151;surely that is all the more reason why Natural England should act as a counterbalance to that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_245"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 245</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60201-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>On Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said in winding up the debate that he wanted:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;Natural England to be a trenchant champion of the environment. I hope that noble Lords will find it reassuring that the Sandford principle will continue to apply in national parks and that in nature reserves and sites of special scientific interest the strong presumption that biodiversity considerations take precedence will continue&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7/11/05; col. 472.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>That is fine as far as it goes but what happens to the areas outside that? I mentioned places where people wanted to set up new recreation areas that will bring a lot more people to areas which perhaps cannot cope with that.
</p>

<a name="60201-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>This is a very important amendment. The Minister in another place was not persuaded by it but I hope that even if the noble Lord, Lord Bach, cannot support me today, he will at least take the measure away and think about it, as Natural England is being put in a position where it will have to take some very difficult decisions. As I said, the regional development agencies have a different primacy. Therefore, it is even more important that Natural England should take the Sandford principle on board. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="60201-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   I did not intend to speak to this amendment but I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said that it was not intended to give automatic primacy to the environment. The brief from the Campaign to Protect Rural England states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;The proposal for a conflict resolution mechanism does not mean that natural environment objectives should take automatic precedence . . . The supporters of a conflict resolution mechanism have no intention to change the purpose of Natural England as the Government has described it&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Then I read the amendment and I wonder whether it is correctly drafted to meet the objectives that the noble Baroness mentioned, as it states clearly:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;In the event of a conflict arising between any of the aims included in the general purpose, Natural England shall give priority to the aim in subsection (2)(a) and (b) over any other paragraph in subsection (2)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>As I was about to say, I was brought up on the Sandford principle. I recall that, when it was introduced, I was a county councillor and a vice-chairman of a national park committee. I have long been a proponent of the principle, because it seems to me critical in rural areas that there is somebody to stand up for this particular interest. If Natural England is not going to have that responsibility, no organisation&#151;no other government adviser or government agency&#151;will have it. As has been explained, most of the other partners and participants in the discussion about what should happen in rural areas have other responsibilities and priorities. If Natural England does not have this as a mainstream responsibility, no one will.
</p>

<a name="60201-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Of course there is specific legislation that deals with national parks, AONBs and SSSIs, but the countryside generally will not have a champion unless Natural England performs that task. In that context, surely we should take very seriously the advice of the Select Committee on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the other place, which I remind the Minister has a government majority on it. The committee was very specific on this issue and I think that we should listen carefully to it.
</p>

<a name="60201-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>I understand the anxieties expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, about the precise wording, but I believe that, if we are not clear about the purpose of Natural England, that organisation will start its life with one hand tied behind its back and the countryside will suffer as a result.

<a name="60201-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   I support the intervention made by my noble friend Lord Carter. I have a great deal of sympathy with the intention behind the amendment and with the way in which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, moved it. However, I think that its wording requires more attention.
</p>

<a name="60201-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>It seems to me&#151;I made this point the other day&#151;that we want to promote nature conservation, to protect biodiversity and to conserve and enhance the landscape not as ends in themselves, but so that we can enrich the lives of an increasing number and an increasingly wide cross-section of people in our society. To introduce, through the way in which the amendment is worded, the concept that access to the countryside is not also of over-riding importance is unfortunate. If one were to begin to break down the wording in the Bill as it stands, one might make more progress. For example, it is arguable that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;promoting access to the countryside&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>should not be lumped together in the same paragraph as &quot;encouraging open-air recreation&quot;&#151;perhaps they are not quite the same point. If one were arguing that,

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>was also still of paramount importance to Natural England, that would carry more weight. However, I am worried that, as the amendment is drafted, this business of encouraging and enabling people to enjoy what is there and to be enriched by it could be put at a disadvantage. Therefore, I urge those behind the amendment to go away and think again and perhaps to come back with more appropriate wording.

However, I believe that it is incumbent on all of us who carry direct or indirect responsibility for these affairs to make sure that our arrangements are in such good order that the best possible use can be made of the money that is made available. I also note that any reduction in forward funding is in the context of considerably increased funding over recent years. We have to keep these issues in perspective.

Therefore, I suggest that she did not present a very good argument to back up the otherwise commendable objective that I think is at the centre of her preoccupation. I believe that&#151;and I am sorry to put it like this&#151;the amendment has not been well drafted.

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I am a bit disturbed by the doctrine that we should preserve the countryside merely so that we, as human beings, can enjoy it. We need to be concerned about conserving and preserving our landscapes for their own sake. To take it to the ultimate limit, there would be no countryside to enjoy if we had not preserved it. I think that the substance of the amendment is right: where there is a conflict of interest between access to the countryside and preservation of the countryside, preservation of the countryside must come first. Therefore, in principle, I support the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>It is important that, in looking at the amendment, we recognise that &quot;priority&quot; does not mean &quot;paramount&quot;, as some people seem to be reading it.

We have to be careful that we are not going to condemn more species to extinction by not setting a priority order among these things. I entirely agree with the right reverend Prelate when he says that we are conserving the environment for its own sake, not just for future generations.

I have listened with great care to what the noble Baroness said in moving the amendment, and I appreciate the difficulty of having priorities among the objectives of Natural England. However, it is worth considering that it is not about the access priority, which others have spoken to, but about the last priority:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;Contributing in other ways to social and economic well-being through the management of the natural environment&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>It is significant that later in the Bill, in Clause 58, the restraint on spending money on economic and social well-being is removed. It always was that it should be done,

</p>

<a name="60201-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The fact that this is being removed must be given some significance. In my judgment, therefore, there is every reason why the board and management of this new and very important body will be conscious that their predecessors were restrained financially on how much they could commit to social and economic well-being, and that that restraint has now been lifted&#151;and why? I am of the opinion that to keep the balance and the essential importance of the first two priorities, it is only reasonable to give every favourable consideration to the amendment.

development, which caused enormous rifts in all sorts of ways within the national park community, within the local authority and within the wider community that had interests in the countryside. There were many arguments on both sides about the detrimental effect on the landscape, the right of people to enjoy some sort of access at affordable prices to that area and the enormous economic benefits that the local authority felt that it might bring to the area. It was a difficult decision, and following the arguments through their various stages is a good example of where some things are extremely difficult to resolve. At the end of the day, the resolution probably needs to take place in a democratic forum rather than in the forum of an agency.

<a name="60201-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>However, Natural England will have to resolve some difficult issues.

Noble Lords will recall the slightly bad tempered debate that we had last time in Committee; there was some loose talk in the Lobby afterwards that we should perhaps just abandon Clause 2(2), since it would remove many of the amendments that had up until then been put forward, because of the disagreements about the fine grain of its wording. It is an important elaboration of the role of Natural England. Indeed, with one of my other hats on as chief executive of the Environment Agency, I would be extremely grieved if it disappeared, since it would then be creating a body that appeared to have very similar purposes to the Environment Agency. The five elements of the elaboration are important, and in most cases I suspect that they will not come into direct conflict. One of the important roles of Natural England will be to find cunning ways to deliver on all the objectives in an integrated way.

</p>

<a name="60201-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>There is no doubt that conflict can occur; I say that as a former chairman of English Nature. On many occasions we were faced with propositions where we had to make extremely difficult decisions about balancing the much more limited purposes of English Nature for biodiversity and conservation in the face of real pressure for economic development, increased access and increased recreational development. Considerable work has been done in the past few years on the research base and the evidence of the impacts on wildlife and landscape of access and recreational development. I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to some examples that were given in the briefing from the Wildlife Trust, the RSPB, the Woodland Trust and the Council for the Protection of Rural England. The RSPB has collated all the research on issues where there is a conflict between access and birds, and the British Ornithologists&#039; Union held an extremely important and definitive conference last year on disturbance and its impact on bird population trends. The report on that conference will shortly be published, and I will provide the Minister with my references, because that publication will demonstrate that in some circumstances recreation has a real impact on conservation.
</p>

<a name="60201-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>It is not only what I would call quiet access. Natural England will also come under pressure from all quarters for increased recreational and economic development, particularly as the drying-up of other sources of income in the countryside increases the need for landowners to diversify. There will also be pressure for recreational facilities to back up the increased housing development that we will see in the countryside. We will see holiday developments and golf courses and developments of the Jeremy Clarkson style, if I may designate them like that, such as jet skis and war games. The pressure will be pervasive, and we must seek to ensure that the sorts of tourism and leisure developments that depend heavily on the abundance of wildlife and the natural beauty of the area do not in fact undermine that very wildlife and that very beauty in seeking to deliver social and economic benefits.
</p>

<a name="60201-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>I hesitate to give examples, because in many cases I have been involved in them. There are two where I was only on the periphery and mercifully they are outside England and Wales. The funicular up the Cairngorm was a highly unnecessary development, which is a blot on the landscape. There is also the much lamented visitor centre in the Burren in Ireland which, at the end of the day as a result of a European edict, was quite rightly demolished, having been built inappropriately in a highly sensitive area.
</p>

<a name="60201-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>I was quite taken aback by the Natural England partnership briefing for our Committee stage. It tried to assure us that the open access provisions of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 have not resulted in irreconcilable conflict with biodiversity. I gently challenge that position; it is too early to judge the real impact of further open access. Indeed, that open access in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act was to wide open spaces; to mountain and moorland, upland and downland. The research evidence is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_251"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 251</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

indicating that linear access in restricted areas&#151;such as along riverbanks or coasts&#151;disturbs wildlife the most.
</p>

<a name="60201-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>I am not saying that it is universal. There are many rivers and coastal areas that can be opened up to access, but in those sensitive areas where the concentration of people, wildlife, plants and animals in narrow strips is of particular importance, biodiversity really must be predominant. So, pressure on Natural England further to expand open access provisions will, from time to time and on rare occasions, result in more significant and irreconcilable conflicts between its purposes.
</p>

<a name="60201-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I take the points of the noble Lords, Lord Carter and Lord Judd, that the amendment possibly needs a little tightening up and clarification. Personally, I would add the words &quot;significant and irreconcilable&quot; to demonstrate that we are talking only of extreme occasions. But on those occasions, Natural England needs a clear steer from Government, to support it in doing the right thing when facing that sort of pressure and significant or irreconcilable conflicts between elements of its purposes.
</p>

<a name="60201-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The Minister may well say, as he did at Second Reading, that adequate assurances have already been given that Natural England will be a trenchant champion for the environment. There have also been assurances, as already mentioned, in another place that biodiversity and landscape will take priority in national parks, SSSIs and nature reserves. I welcome those assurances but, as has already been said, there are elements of biodiversity and landscape outside protected areas that nevertheless need to be considered.
</p>

<a name="60201-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>I am sure that the Minister will also say that it is self-evident from Clause 2(1), on general purpose, that conservation of the natural environment is pre-eminent. If that is indeed self-evident from the Bill, and already sufficiently clear in his view, I would welcome the Minister saying so on the record tonight. That would mean he was supporting the view that&#151;if your Lordships will pardon the technical term&#151;if push comes to shove, biodiversity and landscape will take priority in those rare instances where increased access, recreation or economic development cannot be accommodated without significant and irreconcilable risk to them.
</p>

<a name="60201-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>That signal from Government is vital to help Natural England deal with the pressure that it will face. If that is not to be in the Bill, we need clear assurances on the record from the Minister&#151;and, I believe, we also need to incorporate this provision in the ministerial guidance to be given to Natural England. I will give way to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, if he insists. However, I am about to finish; perhaps the noble Lord would like to wait.
</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="60201-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   Perhaps I may clarify one point. We are obviously agreed that there is great purpose behind the amendment. It needs to be examined seriously&#151;there is no difference between us on that&#151;and there seems to be some agreement that it could be better expressed. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_252"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 252</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

However, the noble Baroness has just suggested that economic development and biodiversity might, for example, be in irreconcilable conflict. That is where we get into the quagmire. I would argue that the vital importance of people being able to regenerate themselves in a completely different setting from their urban existence&#151;and to enjoy the richness of the countryside&#151;could be in conflict with economic development. When we start making those comparisons, we immediately begin to see the complexities. I am therefore inclined to think that whichever amendment is put forward, it would have to be strongly argued because the Government have tried to get everything in the Bill, and thus to say, &quot;Right; Natural England now has the responsibility to get the right balance&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="60201-20_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, but that really inclines me to believe that there is a need for a conflict resolution provision, because I believe that it is important for people to experience the joy of biodiversity and landscape. It is equally important to recognise that it is in no one&#039;s interests if, in enjoying them, we inadvertently diminish or destroy them. I would like the Minister to see his way to putting this strong steer, which I seek, into the guidance given to Natural England. If we destroy our biodiversity and landscape, then once they are gone, they are gone. I support the views of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Peterborough.
</p>

<a name="60201-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>I was going to say that the varied views which might have been voiced around the Chamber tonight are, in themselves, an example of why Natural England needs a strongish steer. Alas, we have not had quite such a variety of views as I expected. I have heard pretty strong support all around the Chamber for something to be done here; I was hoping that economic developers and people wanting paintball games across the country would be rising in their masses in the Chamber, so that I could demonstrate how much pressure there might be. Alas, they have stayed doggo so far. Nevertheless, I hope that we can urge the Minister to give that steer in some fashion or other.

The other option is to ship in much of the salad crop from southern Spain, an area which has problems with its own water. That consumes air miles and is a good example of where there will be definite conflict; that is between having either a landscape sullied by polytunnels or a possibly greater but invisible ill for the landscape&#151;given the effects from everything I mentioned that would contribute to climate change&#151;because of the lack of ability to grow what will be consumed in this country.

However, in my early days of being in county hall four days a week, some non-agricultural friends often used to ask me how I managed to run a farm and yet spend all of my time away from it, doing other things. For a number of years, I used glibly to answer that while I looked after the farm for 10 minutes a day&#151;and that that was all it required of my time&#151;the good Lord had it for 23 hours and 50 minutes. I got away with that for a long time. Everybody accepted that it could probably be done; the truth was that there was growing inefficiency in the system, but that is neither here nor there.

You need to stop and think about that&#151;but not very hard. There is a reality there and we need to recognise that the countryside is a totally artificial creation. It has been driven by economics. Latterly, in the past 30, 40 or 50 years, it has been driven hard by government policy and we have arrived at the present situation.

That is fine, but as I have already said in this Committee, other factors are at work in what we are doing that will be tremendously destructive if we are not exceedingly careful.

<a name="60201-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Such matters are not taken into account in this debate, but are the inspiration that lies behind my noble friend&#039;s amendment, and I understand why she <br>&nbsp;<br>

has moved it. We need to be realistic about the countryside. It is not a divine creation. It is a creation of man in combination with nature. If there were inspiration, it perhaps came to man divinely&#151;if we were lucky. I hope that that can continue, but we need a judgment.

<a name="60201-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   I have great sympathy with my noble friend Lady Byford&#039;s amendment. Whether correctly drafted or not, such an amendment is needed. Do we really need to go down this route? The briefing from English Nature says that there certainly are areas that have been given exclusion; 44 SSSIs out of over 1,000 qualify for access and little over 1 per cent of SSSIs have been given partial exemption&#151;I presume, for breeding seasons. That will come as a great relief to those, such as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who rightly argue for not limiting open public access. We are not talking about a large area, but a very small area. That is important.
</p>

<a name="60201-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Clarity is needed in this area. The countryside has an ever-increasing population. We are increasingly pushing the habitat of our wildlife on a daily basis. We often read in the press of wildlife whose numbers or varieties are diminishing through problems that we cannot understand. There is irreconcilable conflict in sensitive areas and fragile habitats.
</p>

<a name="60201-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>In my experience at home, public access was allowed across an area containing ponds and lakes and waterfowl in that area ceased to breed. There are now few waterfowl living there. That case was like the examples we are arguing about and it resulted in human beings winning over wildlife. I am anxious to ensure that in future we come second to wildlife in the pecking order.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="60201-21_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Chorley: </b>   There has been a fascinating interchange of views and I am swaying in various directions. It is clear that the board of Natural England will have to be a Solomon in its work. Much depends on the drafting. Here I am at one with the noble Baroness, Lady Young. We are talking about irreconcilable conflicts. My memory is not good and I do not remember whether the Sandford principle was incorporated into the national parks legislation in 1995&#151;but I have always seen that as an irreconcilable conflict. Some conflicts are small and the SSSI issue is different from landscape issues.
</p>

<a name="60201-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>I am therefore not entirely at one with my noble friend Lord Judd. He is president of Friends of the Lake District and I am a mere vice-president; and we are both vice-presidents, as is the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, of the Council for National Parks. So I am torn. On the whole, I favour Sandford here, particularly as the Bill includes subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b)&#151;the first two purposes&#151;but that can be applied only when the chips are down.
</p>

<a name="60201-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young, mentioned the Cairngorm funicular, which is a classic case where wild landscape has been destroyed. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, mentioned the bluestones, a classic example of destroying a very sensitive part of a national park. They were massive <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_255"></a>

developments, but many are not massive, so while we need to think more about the drafting, I favour something along the lines of the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60201-21_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I echo the comments that this has been a fascinating debate with a huge amount of expertise from noble Lords. We are all grateful for what they have said. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that this is an important part of the Bill. It is at this stage, in a sense, neither here nor there whether or not her amendment is properly drafted. It sets up the debate that occurred in another place and is occurring here. I am sure that a lot of people are listening to what we say.
</p>

<a name="60201-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I start by saying, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young, forecast, that we expect Natural England to be a strong&#151;I shall not use the word &quot;trenchant&quot; just because she used it&#151;champion of the natural environment. This new NDPB is being established to ensure that the precious resource of our natural environment is conserved, enhanced and managed for present and future generations. No one reading the purpose can be in any doubt that Natural England is an environmental organisation. It is about managing and enhancing places and nature and encouraging people to enjoy and benefit from them.
</p>

<a name="60201-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Natural England will make decisions in the context of sustainable development. Through its environmental work, Natural England will contribute to sustainable development by actively seeking economic and social benefits for present and future generations. Sustainable development cannot be delivered by social, economic or environmental work alone. To that end, we hope and expect Natural England not to work in isolation, but together, often in close partnership, with existing bodies.
</p>

<a name="60201-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Natural England will be one of the Government&#039;s main sources of expertise and advice on managing the natural environment, operating within a sustainable development context. The regional development agencies take a lead on economic issues, also within the context of sustainable development. I would not want to see a conflict resolution clause applied to the RDAs so that in their decision-making the environment always lost out to economic considerations&#151;and I am sure noble Lords would not want that, either.

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="60201-22_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   For the record, it would be interesting to have an example of where an RDA had, to date, made a decision that did not see economic interest winning out very strongly over environmental issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="60201-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   As I understand it, no conflict resolution clause applies to RDAs; they make up their own minds. It is important that they should do so, bearing in mind the various issues that are set out in Clause 2 as far as Natural England is concerned. It has been suggested that RDAs give primacy to economic development, so Natural England should give primacy to the environment. Both take their decisions&#151;or ought to&#151;within the context of sustainable development, and we believe that helping people to <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 256</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

enjoy the natural environment is an inextricable part of its conservation and enhancement. Bringing the two together in Natural England will help achieve the right solutions to conflicts.
</p>

<a name="60201-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I do not think that the best solutions come out of adversarial debate between, for example, a public body with a total focus on protecting the environment and another with a total focus on economic development. That is why both the regional development agencies and Natural England are required to contribute to sustainable development. This reminds me of my promise to the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, to share a definition of &quot;sustainability&quot; with the House. John Locke, the great English philosopher at the end of the 17th century defined &quot;sustainability.&quot; Of course, when he uses the word &quot;man&quot; he covers humankind. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;Each man is entitled to the fruits of his labour, as long, and as much, and as good, is left for the next [man]&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Not a bad definition. Our definition is a little more prosaic. Our strategy for delivering a better quality of life through sustainable development was set out in the UK sustainable development strategy, launched in March last year and copies of which are available in the Library. It explains the actions required to ensure that the care of the environment is an integral part of policymaking from the start, rather than just dealing with the consequences of neglect further down the line. The UK Government and the devolved administrations agreed to the following purpose:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;The goal of sustainable development is to enable all people throughout the world to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life, without compromising the quality of life of future generations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>It is against that background, or both definitions, that I believe this amendment to be wrong, both in principle and in practice. It would not lead to better protection for our most treasured natural resources, and it is inconsistent with practice elsewhere in the public sector.
</p>

<a name="60201-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>Why do I say that it is wrong in principle? Many of the proposals put forward for this Bill by noble Lords have aimed to secure the independence of Natural England. We support that concept, which is why we have created it as an executive, non-departmental public body. Natural England must have the freedom to engage in debate with interested organisations, customers and the public; then, in discussion with Ministers, to decide how it can best achieve its purpose. Frankly, that is the point of having a board of an independent NDPB. We do not believe that it should be told how to resolve any particular conflict. A conflict resolution clause would effectively be a legislative straitjacket. It would not give it teeth, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, suggested. It would mean extracting its teeth; it would have no teeth. It would have, effectively, no independence. It would erode its ability to make independent decisions on how best to achieve its purpose.
</p>

<a name="60201-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>That is the principle. Let me give two examples of some of the problems a conflict resolution clause would create in practical application. First, how would it apply to urban green spaces? There are many areas <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_257"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 257</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of damaged and derelict land around our major towns and cities. Some have been designated as SSSIs, or local nature reserves, because of their wildlife variety. Priority should be given to biodiversity in these areas, which might, for example, lead to restrictions on public access. Other areas have less value for wildlife and here it may be judged&#151;and judged is the crucial word&#151;that access should have priority, even if the effect is detrimental to some plants and animals. This amendment would prevent Natural England taking part in any such project, despite its role as a leading national body on access to the natural environment. A project might well proceed under local authority or voluntary-body leadership, but Natural England would be excluded. We do not think that is right.
</p>

<a name="60201-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Secondly, how it would apply to a designed landscape, such as a Repton parkland? Many noble Lords will know much more about the great landscape architect, Repton, than I do. Restoring the historical importance of the landscape by, for example, clearing undergrowth, or dredging an ornamental lake, might be detrimental to some aspect of biodiversity. Natural England would be required, if this amendment became law, to give the highest priority, without question, to enhancing biodiversity.
</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="60201-22_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </b>   I wonder whether we might tempt the noble Lord to take the view that the two circumstances he has just described would not, in fact, straitjacket Natural England because they would not be significant and irreconcilable. On a day-to-day basis any public body tasked in the way Natural England is will be making these balancing decisions. To take his example of a Repton landscape, I am sure that dredging the lake and clearing the rhododendrons would probably not be regarded as significant or irreconcilable, but were the veteran tree at the bottom of the view, which harbours probably some of the most important beetle collections in Britain, to be demolished, that might be an irreconcilable and significant issue. It is a question of degree. I wonder whether the noble Lord might feel that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="60201-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I am sure that the noble Baroness is right: it is a question of degree, but who is to decide if it is serious enough to be irreconcilable? It seems to me that Natural England, the independent body we are setting up should do so. It may be painful for it, but it should have the duty to decide when there are such conflicts, whether more extreme than the ones I have given by way of example, or ones which are truly irreconcilable. That is what we have to decide.
</p>

<a name="60201-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>In addition to being wrong in practice, the amendment would not help to protect our most treasured natural resources, such as SSSIs, Natura 2000 sites, AONBs and national parks, because the purposes of national parks are laid down in Section 61 of the Environment Act 1995:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;(a) Conserving and enhancing the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the areas specified;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>(b) Promoting opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of those areas by the public&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60201-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The Act goes on to make clear that any relevant authority,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;if it appears that there is a conflict between those purposes shall attach greater weight to the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area comprised in the national park&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>That is what is known as the Sandford principle, taken from the reverend Lord Sandford&#039;s recommendations in 1974 that enjoyment of national parks,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;shall be in a manner, and by such means, as will leave their natural beauty unimpaired for the enjoyment of this and future generations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Natural England will be bound, like all other relevant authorities, to give greater weight to conservation in these specially designated areas. No other similar NDPB has a conflict resolution clause. A glance at the founding legislation of other such bodies in this area prompts the question: what problem is this amendment seeking to solve? The Countryside Agency, which has statutory duties for conservation, access and rural economic development does not have a conflict resolution clause. The board of the Countryside Agency, which noble Lords will remember is one of the organisations that will form Natural England, has not suggested that problems with its current statutory responsibilities should be resolved in this Bill by giving Natural England a conflict resolution clause.
</p>

<a name="60201-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The Countryside Council for Wales and Scottish Natural Heritage, which combine most of the functions being taken over by Natural England, do not have a conflict resolution clause. Nor does the Environment Agency, where it could be argued that there is great potential for conflict between environmental and economic objectives. In short, we want Natural England to be more than the sum of its parts. It will bring with it the Countryside Agency&#039;s expertise in promoting positive access management and administering legal restrictions on access where necessary; English Nature&#039;s expertise of advising on nature conservation restrictions and enforcement of byelaws on national nature reserves; and the Rural Development Service&#039;s excellent track record, expertise and experience in administering the environmental stewardship schemes. We want Natural England to draw these together, sharing good practice and ideas and integrating delivery.
</p>

<a name="60201-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Instances of irreconcilable conflict between access and conservation are rare in practice&#151;and I believe that is the consensus around the House. English Nature&#039;s recent figures about access on Sites of Special Scientific Interest exemplify this point. More than 55 per cent of SSSIs are on open access land. These are our most valuable nature conservation and earth heritage sites. Yet, even here, in areas already recognised in legislation for their importance to nature conservation, irreconcilable conflicts are extremely rare. There are no SSSIs in access land in England where preventing access to protect flora and fauna all year round has so far been necessary. To date, only 0.3 per cent of SSSI access land is subject to partial access exclusion all year round, and only 1.06 per cent of SSSI access land has so far required a seasonal exclusion.

<a name="60201-23_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I thank the Minister for giving way. I think what he says is largely right but, certainly in the Peak District, I can confirm that there has been great difficulty with dogs. Unfortunately, people have not been abiding by the byelaws. Dogs have been allowed to run pretty well free on too many occasions. There are all sorts of statistics on this which I do not have to hand, but I assure the Minister that the dog issue has been creating a great deal of difficulty in the Peak District National Park.
</p>




<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="60201-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I am probably rightly corrected by the noble Earl, Lord Peel. I am not saying that there have not been issues with dogs. The question is how we resolve those issues. That is done, it seems to me, by good management rather than some statutory clause in an Act.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>I am clear that it would be wrong for us not to continue to trust in this wealth of expertise, and instead provide Natural England with an inflexible decision-making framework from the outset. I am also clear, as was set out in the rural strategy, that Natural England is being established to take an integrated approach to nature conservation, biodiversity, landscape, access and recreation in the context of sustainable development.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Before I invite the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, to withdraw her amendment, I shall mention a couple of things. The noble Baronesses, Lady Young of Old Scone and Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, referred to statutory guidance. I accept, in principle, that guidance on dealing with conflicts between objectives could be dealt with in the statutory guidance in a way which might satisfy concerns. Discussions with the Natural England confederation over the statutory guidance are at an early stage, and I will undertake to put conflict resolution on the agenda. I am prepared to look into it, but I make it absolutely clear that a black and white form of conflict resolution clause, such as that expressed in this amendment, would be no more appropriate to us in statutory guidance than it is in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="60201-23_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I am puzzled by the remarks of Mr Jim Knight in the other place, who implied that there would be such guidance.

</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>

I think some 12 noble Lords have expressed their views. Whether they agree with my amendment, or think it is technically incorrect or could be improved, I am still grateful for their views.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bach, was not the Minister when we took the CROW Bill through, but his colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is sitting at the back of the Chamber, and will remember well our discussions on the challenges and difficulties of encompassing and encouraging more people to the countryside while protecting it and the wildlife that they come to see, particularly in certain seasons.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>I smile slightly because I was recalling only the other day that I had quite a bit of pressure at one stage of the CROW Bill from one of the wildlife groups, which shall remain nameless. It said that it thought that I was not interested in getting the CROW Bill through. Obviously, the first part, being on the question of access&#151;or the &quot;right to roam&quot;, as it was then called&#151;took a lot of discussion. I tried to persuade it that if we did not get the first part right, the very things it wanted to see, encourage and enjoy would be jeopardised. When the CROW Act was finally passed, one of the first groups to write to me was that one, saying that it was experiencing the problems we had debated, which it had not realised that we could have tightened up.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I, too, had the question of dogs, raised by my noble friend Lord Peel, brought to my attention&#151;I was going to say &quot;my ear bent&quot;&#151;when I was on holiday in the Brecon Beacons only last September. When people, in their lack of understanding&#151;rather than ignorance&#151;walk through areas where they had not been able to go before and let dogs slip off the lead, it is quite likely that sheep, let alone any other wildlife, will be disturbed. Flocks will be intertwined. So my noble friend is quite right that there are issues there.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>The issue rightly raised by noble Lords who were not in favour of my amendment was that it might not be worded correctly, or whatever else.

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>I would like to say, particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that I am very anxious that people should visit the countryside. The contribution made by the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, highlights even more why, on this occasion, a conflict clause is needed. In the old days, and certainly when we took through the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, we were talking about access for people to walk and enjoy, whereas nowadays a lot of the applications coming through are for what I would call active participation in the countryside. That is a real issue that we will develop more.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I have young grandchildren and a young family. When they go on holiday they like to be active&#151;not in the sense, perhaps, of walking on the moors, but they would like to be active, either doing water sports or in Centre Parcs, where there are more active things for them to do than purely to walk and enjoy. Certainly, the amendment is not there to preserve and keep the countryside from growing. The countryside must grow; I have no doubt about that. My real concern in tabling the amendment is that I believe that Natural England must be a champion for that, and I think the Minister has kindly suggested that he agrees. It is a question of how we ensure that. It is not for everyday dealings, but for those few times when the board will be asked to judge and decide how you balance these two opposing interests.

At this stage, I am grateful that the noble Lord will perhaps think about some guidance, or at least have discussions within the department on it.

If noble Lords who tabled the other amendments in the group would forgive me, I would like to speak only to Amendment No. 125, listen to what they have to say about their amendments and perhaps come back to the Minister when he responds to them.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Amendment No. 125 requires the new agency to keep under review its <i>raison d&#039;&#234;tre</i> and review it at least annually. This is a probing amendment to try and establish the intended nuances in the use of this phrase. One may keep under review by insisting that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_262"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 262</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

subject to be reviewed is brought into every discussion it reaches when the body has to make a firm conclusion. It could be, &quot;Right, gentlemen, we have decided that and we are all satisfied that nothing about the decision conflicts with our remit&quot;, and so on.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>Legislation sometimes lays down that there should be a review session every so often. For example, all school exclusions of longer than five days have to be reviewed annually by the governing body, mainly to ensure consistency and fairness. It is possible that an injunction to keep under review could be honoured more in the breach by relegating it to a periodic paper, to be discussed only if anyone raised an objection to something in it. Such an approach would tend to ignore omissions and might easily overlook matters that had occurred in early weeks and months of the period it covered.
</p>

<a name="60201-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>We feel that the Bill should be more specific concerning the frequency of that required review, and we would prefer the words that demand a formal report at least in the form of a board minute. That review should be at least annually. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="60201-24_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   I shall speak briefly to Amendment No. 125. On page 47 there is a great list of things which Natural England has to do every year. A point that should be added is that that can become discretionary&#151;that is, people can include in their annual report what they choose to put in it, rather than covering all the matters that are of importance. The value of the amendment is that it suggests that any report made should cover the whole waterfront and not be too selective.
</p>

<a name="60201-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>In Amendment No. 128 I am away from weighty philosophical matters. It may be that the Minister will be able to relax and say, &quot;Thank goodness, we are down to practicalities&quot;. That leaves me to hope that he will have no problem in agreeing to my amendment. It intends to bring the relationship between Natural England and interested bodies into a better balance. Clause 3(2) currently reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;When reviewing any matter, Natural England must consult such bodies as appear to it to have an interest in the matter&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The wording is slightly different in the Explanatory Notes, which say that Natural England,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;consults bodies that it considers to have an interest&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>If the amendment were approved, the subsection would read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;When reviewing any matter, Natural England must consult such bodies as have an interest in the matter&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>It is clear that the Bill, when enacted primarily as an enabling measure, will give rise to many declarations of interest, some of which are unpredictable and some of which can be controversial. For example, gardens are not much mentioned, yet the Royal Horticultural Society undoubtedly has an interest. No doubt Natural England would be willing to talk to the Royal Horticultural Society, but what about the horticultural development and research association or the Centre for Alternative Technology? Both have an interest in biodiversity and conservation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_263"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 263</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60201-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>As drafted, the clause gives Natural England what amounts to a veto. Its officials will be busy people and would be able to say, &quot;Well, with regret, we did not consider at the time that you had an interest&quot;. Any such conclusion would be subjective and difficult to challenge. As amended, Natural England would need to give due attention and weight to representations made to it, rather than being able to decide with whom it communicates. No doubt Natural England would be strong enough to safeguard its own position. Therefore, it does not need this right to decide unilaterally. This right is also undemocratic.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="60201-24_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 131. Clause 3(3)(b) states that Natural England may,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;commission or support (by financial means or otherwise) research into any such matter&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The amendment probes whether Natural England should take account of existing bodies. It holds the purse strings for a lot of research that can take place into biodiversity and other issues. I am interested to know whether it will take account of existing bodies that have done a terrific job, and their research&#151;for example, the county records office, funded by Defra, and the wildlife trusts, which continually research into all sorts of things; I should declare that I am a member of both Somerset and Devon Wildlife Trusts&#151;and not simply take what may often be the quicker and easier route of going straight to consultants.
</p>

<a name="60201-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Of course, universities now play an interesting part. As so much of their finance comes from independent consultancies, without the Minister saying clearly what is meant by the clause, there is a danger that Natural England could not take account of the bodies that have been in the business for a long time and commission research left, right and centre, to the detriment of the bodies that I mentioned&#151;there are a number of others that I will not take the time of the Committee by mentioning now. By whom does the Minister imagine that the research may be carried out?
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="60201-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Cameron of Dillington: </b>   In speaking to my Amendment No. 132, I should first like to apologise to the House because, in my enthusiasm last week, I forgot to repeat my interests&#151;for the purposes of this Committee, they are as a farmer, landowner, rural businessman and chair of the Somerset Strategic Partnership.
</p>

<a name="60201-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Amendment No. 132 is merely a mechanism to draw attention to the need to have acceptable common standards established by the JNCC, as proposed by the Bill. We have nothing against the clause but would like to be reassured on the rigour by which those standards are judged by the JNCC. They must be based on published, acceptable, scientific data. They should be based on sound peer-reviewed science.
</p>

<a name="60201-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Furthermore, it would be preferable if they could be tested for practicality with some form of on-the-ground consultation. For instance, to take a fairly obvious example, there is no point promoting standards of management of heather moorland that undermines grouse shooting, when it is the shooting <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_264"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 264</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

management that creates the habitat in the first place&#151;that is the <i>raison d&#039;etre</i> of the habitat; no shooting, no habitat. I should be grateful for some reassurance from the Minister on that point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="60201-24_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, for having introduced Amendment No. 132. I appreciate the principal objectives behind the common standards as a means of assessing and monitoring the condition of designated sites. Some such mechanism is advisable if the statutory agencies are to carry out their functions effectively. However, from my experience in such matters, which is based entirely in the uplands, the system appears far from satisfactory.
</p>

<a name="60201-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>One of the fundamental difficulties rests in the lack of consultation between JNCC, Natural England as it will be, or English Nature as it has been, and land managers. We seem to have foisted on us what I can describe only as rather arbitrary condition assessments. All those who are responsible for the management of such sites have their views not entirely ignored but certainly pushed to one side. The lack of appreciation of practical management is the real problem. The most common complaint is that the term &quot;favourable condition&quot; too often relates to what I may describe as a past point in the ecological development of the site. That often seems to have little bearing on the purpose for which it is being used at the moment. That seems quite unrealistic, especially when such an objective is unlikely to be met with a realistic timescale and a site has historically been managed in ways inconsistent with the JNCC&#039;s objectives. I am bound to say that some of the criticism that I have read makes me wonder why the site was designated in the first place.
<a name="time_23"></a>
<a name="60201-24_time0"></a><h5>8.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60201-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>In attempts to try to enhance some species that may have been present at some moment in the deep and distant past, such as some rare bryophyte, some current conservation gains could be lost that depend on the present management structure. In the uplands, the guidance suggests that favourable conditions should be assessed by reference to their original historic state. We could be talking about the Ice Age. Sometimes, I cannot see the point. There must be a more realistic approach to how those condition assessments are carried out. Furthermore, it is clear from comments that I have read and conversations that I have had that there is dispute&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, referred to this&#151;about many of the conditional assessments for the lack of clear science, which should be a prerequisite for any material change in the management structure of the site.
</p>

<a name="60201-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>I cite an independent ecologist who, quite recently, when commenting on the condition assessment of an area on the North York Moors National Park, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;The way that results are reported can cause misunderstanding and damage relationships between moorland managers and conservation agencies. Many managers are proud of their moors and believe that they have been managed well for conservation, as <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_265"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 265</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>well as for commercial purposes. It would be much better if the results could be presented in a more accurate light, which reflects the degree of failure, e.g. eight out of 10, rather than just &#039;fail&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>She has a very good point. That is particularly important when vegetation condition may be a legacy of circumstances outwith the manager&#039;s control&#151;for example, past air pollution or a severe wildfire created inadvertently by a visitor several decades ago.
</p>

<a name="60201-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>This is clearly just a probing amendment. I hope that the Minister will appreciate the real concerns expressed by managers of upland SSSIs. As I said, I can speak only for uplands SSSIs, but I am sure that similar situations occur in other parts of the country. I hope that we can try to instigate a more realistic approach to the assessment criteria, with greater co-operation and dialogue from the beginning. It is important for JNCC, English Nature and the Government to appreciate that the manager has just as much to offer as a scientist and should be consulted more often. I know that the Minister will agree with me. As the noble Lord said, we must make sure that we apply rigorous science in these conditions.
</p>

<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="60201-25_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   Amendment No. 128 is important. It should not just be up to what the people operating internally in the agency feel that they should pick. There should be a duty to consult with everyone concerned&#151;not just with the people that they feel like. Everything that has been said about Amendment No. 132 has made me realise its importance. The danger is that the agency becomes a law unto itself. We must be careful about that. We could use many examples, although I cannot lay my hands on any at the moment, where such powers have been abused in the past.
</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="60201-25_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   It may be helpful if I briefly set out the rationale behind Clause 3. Natural England will be a key source of independent expert advice to government on environmental matters and a statutory consultee on many planning processes. To carry out that role, it is vital that Natural England remains up-to-date in matters relating to its general purpose. The requirement to consult others will help foster a culture of partnership working, ensuring that the expertise of other public bodies, such as the Environment Agency, and specialist non-governmental authority bodies, is used effectively and duplication avoided.
</p>

<a name="60201-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Clause 3 also gives Natural England powers to carry out, to commission and to support research in matters relating to its general purpose. This power is clearly required for Natural England to develop and test new approaches or techniques aimed at helping to ensure that our natural environment is managed, conserved and enhanced. The term &quot;research&quot; is to be taken in its widest sense. Clause 30 defines research to include inquiries and investigations, and therefore empowers Natural England to carry out surveys and monitoring.
</p>

<a name="60201-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The three amendments raise different but related issues, so I will address them one by one. Amendment No. 125 would require the Natural England board to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_266"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 266</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

carry out at least an annual review of all matters relating to its general purpose. I understand the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, but ask her to consider the view that it would be best if the Natural England board were given responsibility to decide when reviews are needed. In some cases, it may want and need to review matters relating to its general purpose more frequently than annually, and in other cases less frequently. I know that the noble Baroness would not want the board to have to carry out unnecessary work to meet a legal duty, and I hope on that basis that she will withdraw this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60201-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Amendment No. 131 would require Natural England to take existing bodies into account before commissioning or supporting research into matters relating to its general purpose. We are not opposed in principle to the intention behind the amendment, but this proposal deals with matters more appropriate to Natural England&#039;s corporate plan and management statement. I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, that discussions are already well advanced for jointly managing parts of Defra&#039;s and Natural England&#039;s research programmes. From my experience through involvement with the College of Agriculture and Horticulture in Lancashire and the University of Central Lancashire, I am well aware of the valuable contribution, to which the noble Baroness referred, of university departments, among others. With that reassurance, I hope that she will not press the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60201-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Amendment No. 132 would remove Natural England&#039;s requirement to have regard to the JNCC&#039;s common standards on research into nature conservation. Natural England should, in common with its sister bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have regard to UK common standards established by the JNCC. I have listened to the noble Earls, Lord Peel and Lord Erroll, and the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, and I understand that there may be concerns about the lack of opportunity for review and comment on these standards before they are adopted and about the science underlying them. I particularly took note of the points made by the noble Earl, Lord Peel, about the need for proper consultation with land managers in areas with particular issues.
</p>

<a name="60201-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>The work of the JNCC in this area is subject to review by the individual bodies represented on the committee, and I understand that that also happens at a working level as standards are being prepared. In some cases, independent input is sought from outside the statutory conservation community. Additionally, the committee&#039;s papers are publicly available and its meeting is open to the public. Common standards are required on a wide range of topics, and it would not be appropriate for legislation to set out in detail how the JNCC should prepare them. Having said that, I understand the concerns and the strength of feeling of the three speakers about the amendment. I undertake to pass on all their comments about the need for wider consultation to the JNCC chairman and to suggest that his committee gives further <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_267"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 267</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consideration to the points that have been made today. I hope that will help noble Lords who have expressed their concerns about the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="60201-25_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   The amendment is clearly probing, and the noble Baroness has listened very carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, and I have said. I was hoping merely that she would give the appropriate authorities the chance to consider it and to develop a more streamlined, effective and user-friendly system that would please us all, so I am extremely grateful for what she has said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="60201-25_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I thank the noble Earl. On Amendment No. 128 in the name of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, if a body has a particular interest, it must make itself known to Natural England to get its name on the circulation list. It is certainly not the intention for Natural England to have a veto against bodies that can express an interest and be involved in circulation about issues. On the other hand, it is not possible for Natural England to put on a circulation list every body that has anything to do with matters within Natural England&#039;s purpose. However, I hope that the noble Viscount is reassured that no restriction is intended by the use of the words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;as appear to it to have an interest&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>That is to give Natural England the power to stop the circulation list. It would not then be used to exclude people from the process. I hope on the basis of that reassurance that the noble Viscount will not feel the need to press his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_170"></a>
<a name="60201-25_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness. However, I still have some reservations about this. It is a difficult subject that raises many questions. Several noble Lords have discussed for over an hour whether there should be priorities, the conflicts, and how to reach difficult judgments. That position will persist. Given that we are being promised a strong, independent non-departmental public body, I really do not see why it needs the protection of being able to decide who has an interest. The noble Baroness shakes her head, but officials in non-departmental public bodies are good at drawing attention to and using the words set out in Acts of Parliament, and they do not need this protection. It is not just a question of a body being on the list; rather it is one of someone thinking outside the box and coming up with ideas. However, if they cannot get to Natural England, those ideas may never be heard.
</p>

<a name="60201-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>I feel strongly that we need to return to the nature of the relationships between Natural England and the people with an interest in the subjects covered by Clause 2. For the time being, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_171"></a>
<a name="60201-25_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I am sorry, but the amendment has not been moved because it is not the first in the group. I hope that the noble Viscount will consider carefully the words I used, because I sought to make it absolutely clear that this does not empower <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_268"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 268</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Natural England in any way to exclude people from the list of consultees. However, it is important to understand the range of matters which Natural England may review. If Natural England reviewed exclusively issues such as the value of wildlife on a patch of land or the case for designating a national park, that would be one thing. But it may wish to consider the impact of climate change on England&#039;s landscapes. In those broader areas it would be extremely onerous on Natural England if it were required to identify all the bodies with an interest in such an issue.

</p>

<a name="60201-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>The noble Viscount also said that not much mention is made of gardens. Perhaps I may put on the record that gardens and some other urban green spaces are included in Natural England&#039;s purpose. Garden biodiversity is extremely important in terms, for example, of bird populations. Like me, the noble Viscount may be an early riser and listen to the &quot;Today&quot; programme. He will know that thousands of people join in studies of our bird population as part of a national programme. I am sure he will agree that if part of Natural England&#039;s work is to look at the bird population, consulting every household taking part in studies of that kind would be far too onerous. However, the groups and organisations involved in this work could require Natural England to consult them wherever they deemed it appropriate.

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="60201-26_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>   moved Amendment No. 135:

<ul>

&quot;(   )   Natural England shall advise the Government on policy about the natural environment and Ministers shall take due regard of such advice.&quot;

<p><a name="st_175"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 135 would apply to Clause 4 which concerns the bodies to which Natural England should give advice. In this clause there are a number of references to public authorities; for example, local authorities and so on. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_270"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 270</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

One omission that my amendment aims to correct is the Government and Ministers. My amendment, which may be more than a probing amendment, seeks to discover how much teeth Natural England is supposed to have with regard to the Government and whether Ministers should pay due regard to advice given to them by Natural England.
</p>

<a name="60201-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>Defra is likely to have a very close relationship with Natural England. I do not expect there to be any particular problem. After all, Defra is its sponsoring body. However, we should look at other government departments, such as the ODPM, the DTI, the Department for Transport and the MoD, which has a particularly good record of paying attention to biodiversity matters. On several occasions I have had the great pleasure of looking at some of the projects which it is undertaking. There is no doubt that government departments and Ministers need to pay attention and should have a statutory obligation, like all other agencies and public authorities in Britain, to take regard of the advice of Natural England. Without that, the hours that we have spent debating the statutory purpose will count for very little. It is the decisions of government departments that often literally change the face of Britain in many ways. For that reason alone, this amendment is very important.
</p>

<a name="60201-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>It is also important to hear from the Government the exact demarcation&#151;I am sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, is not in her place&#151;between Natural England and the Environment Agency with regard to the advice that is given on things natural. The Environment Agency has a very big part to play, albeit a more regulatory part very often. Natural England&#039;s role is to do research, to give advice, and so on. However, when considering estuaries and migrating fish, the role of the Environment Agency moves out of the regulatory and into far more of the research and advice-giving area. It is far from clear to me exactly what the demarcation between the two bodies will be. I believe that there may be in existence a memorandum of agreement between English Nature and the Environment Agency. I would be interested to know whether that will carry over into Natural England. If it is, will it carry over in exactly the form that it is in now or will it be adapted to take account of the much wider remit of Natural England?
</p>

<a name="60201-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>We referred to the marine Bill on the second day in Committee. The Government have said that they are preparing a marine Bill. I hope that the provisions of this Bill will be applicable to that Bill and that it will not need redrawing in great detail when we come to it. I do not expect that we will get this Bill perfect, but, as the Government have committed themselves to the marine Bill and know that it is coming in the near future, we should take account of that fact. With that in mind, and as we move into the marine area, the Environment Agency has responsibilities that one might expect to sit with Natural England.

</p>

<a name="60201-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>For those two reasons, I very much want to hear what the Minister has to say on how the Government expect the advice of Natural England to be converted into having some teeth when it comes to the effect on other government departments. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="60201-26_spnew3"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   As we seem to be addressing &quot;advice&quot;, two of our amendments are grouped with Amendment No. 135. My amendments are to Clause 4. On Amendment No. 138, I should like to determine whether this really relates to Clause 4. The explanation I have here is that Clause 11 confers on Natural England the right to charge for its services, and specifies things done under&#151;I quote from the Bill here&#151;Section 4. This shows my inexperience in things, but I believe that the terms are interchangeable. Can the Minister clarify that? If it is really intended to refer to subsection(4) of Clause 11, that is to do with licences. The word &quot;give&quot; is defined as bestow, impart, yield, grant and gift. The point of this amendment is to discover whether Clause 11 refers to the fact that it applies only in Clause 4(4)(a), or whether the use of the word &quot;give&quot; here is inappropriate. &quot;Provide&quot; or &quot;supply&quot; allow for the making of a charge and would be clearer in this context.
</p>

<a name="60201-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Amendment No. 149 follows quite closely on the previous one about giving advice, but how do the Government imagine that Natural England will charge for advice that has been given unsought? Is this a situation where somebody might receive a bill for being told by Natural England that his plan to grub up a field of 50-year-old apple trees would be acceptable only if he first obtained a quantity of viable root-stock, so that the variety would not be lost; or would he be charged if he had sought its advice on how best to manage the operation? If somebody went ahead and did it without seeking the advice or consent of Natural England, might they then be charged for being told that they should not have done so?

<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="60201-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Before I address these three amendments to Clause 4, it would be useful briefly to set out what Clause 4 does. One of Natural England&#039;s major roles will be as a key independent adviser to government, public authorities, its stakeholders and its customers. Ministers and the Government would fall under the definition of public authorities given in Clause 30, which I hope reassures the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. It will inherit the positions of English Nature and the Countryside Agency as statutory consultee in planning and other processes, and will be expected proactively to contribute to regional plans&#151;I notice that the noble Earl, Lord Peel, is not in his place&#151;such as the regional spatial strategies, which we will discuss in more depth when we move on to Clause 15.
</p>

<a name="60201-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>Clause 4 reflects the Government&#039;s expectation that Natural England will provide public bodies with advice on request. Clause 4 also gives Natural England powers to advise any person either on request or on its own initiative. In order for Natural England to become the powerful and determined environmental advocate envisaged in the rural strategy, Natural <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_272"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 272</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

England will also have the power to ask public authorities for a written statement should it believe that its advice has been sought but not acted on.
</p>

<a name="60201-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>Amendment No. 138 seeks to leave out &quot;give&quot; and insert &quot;provide&quot;. Having listened carefully to the noble Duke, I am not sure why this is considered necessary. Both words appear to be synonymous. There are examples of both usages throughout the Bill. On that basis, I am happy to accept the amendment in principle but would like to ensure that there is at least consistency within different clauses, and will undertake to ensure that appropriate amendments are tabled at a later stage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="60201-27_spnew1"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. The distinction we have put between &quot;give&quot; and &quot;provide&quot; is that there seems to be a need that Natural England should be able to make charges. We felt that if &quot;give&quot; was the word used it might make it slightly anomalous.       
</p>




<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="60201-27_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I am not sure the noble Duke is not reading more into the giving of advice. We do not envisage in any way that Natural England will charge for unsolicited advice.
</p>

<a name="60201-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Amendment No. 135 seeks to make it explicit that Natural England should advise the Government and that the Government should have regard to that advice. I am sympathetic to the rationale behind this amendment but I am not sure that this change would add anything of practical significance. Natural England&#039;s purpose makes it clear that the body is one of the Government&#039;s experts on natural environment matters and one of the principal means of delivering the Government&#039;s programmes. This clause already goes one step further. Ministers, as I said to the noble Baroness, are among the public authorities to which it applies, including the requirement that an explanation must be provided for any advice sought from Natural England which is rejected. We do not think it necessary to say more about Natural England&#039;s advisory role towards Government.
</p>

<a name="60201-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>I was also asked about the marine Bill. We do not want to say more at this stage about the situation in the marine area. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, knows, we are considering what changes are needed, if any, and we will consult shortly.
</p>

<a name="60201-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>Having said what I did about the public authorities, I do have some concerns about the precise working of this amendment. I cannot make any promises, but will consider the general aim of the amendment before Report in order to see whether the existing clause can be bolstered or made more explicit.
</p>

<a name="60201-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Amendment No. 149 seeks to remove Natural England&#039;s power to give advice of its own volition. We think it essential that this function remains on the face of the Bill. Natural England&#039;s advice will often be challenging. If it is to be the powerful champion that I think all sides of the Committee are seeking, it must promote its views both to those who want to receive advice and, often, to those who do not wish to do so.

<a name="60201-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>I was asked about memorandums of agreement. Partnership working was one of the main themes of the rural strategy, and the Forestry Commission and Environment Agency were identified as key partners for Natural England. Rather than setting the relationship between the three bodies in stone in the legislation, a more flexible approach will be taken. Partnership arrangements covering respective roles and responsibilities and how these will operate in practice will be set out in agreements between those bodies; for example, work is already under way on a three-way memorandum of understanding between them. This flexibility is important, as it will enable the three bodies to adjust how they work together in the future, learning from experience and taking account of new challenges and tasks. The memorandum is being drawn up at this stage.

<a name="60201-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>It would be remiss of me, in asking noble Lords not to press these amendments on the basis of what I have said, not to agree totally with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, about the valuable work often done by the MoD on land for which it is responsible in the field of biodiversity.

&quot;(   )   Natural England shall publish an annual account of the amount and recipients of such assistance.&quot;

<p><a name="st_182"></a>The noble Baroness said: This small amendment arises from Clause 6 which enables Natural England to give financial and other assistance to any person who appears to further its general purpose. The amendment seeks to discover whether Natural England would be expected to publish an annual account of any recipient of that financial assistance. It is a public body. It will be funded by and large with <br>&nbsp;<br>

public money. If it provides financial assistance to any persons that should also be public knowledge. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="60201-27_spnew5"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   The amendment has slight echoes of our request to have a review. As it might fulfil some of the role of the rejected proposal, I support the noble Baroness.

<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="60201-27_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   As is currently the case with English Nature, the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service, Natural England needs to have powers to give grants to customers, the most obvious example being farmers who are part of the environmental stewardship scheme.
</p>

<a name="60201-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>Clause 6 is not limited to financial grants alone. Natural England will be able to provide assistance to customers and stakeholders in the form of grants, equipment and goods. This, together with the advisory powers in Clause 4, and powers to provide training in Clause 10, will leave Natural England, we believe, well placed to deliver its purpose through others with the freedom to provide assistance through the most appropriate means for any given situation.
</p>

<a name="60201-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>Amendment No. 156 would require Natural England to publish details of all those&#151;and there could be many&#151;who receive financial or other assistance from Natural England.

</p>

<a name="60201-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>There are already legislative mechanisms in place under the Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 to ensure that where reasonable requests are made for this type of information then, subject to a few narrowly construed exceptions, information is made available. Amendment No. 156 would appear to be aimed primarily at payments made to persons in connection with matters relating to the environment. It would be covered, therefore, under the heading of environmental information and, subject to very limited exceptions, be disclosed under the 2004 regulations.

</p>

<a name="60201-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>As the Bill stands, Natural England is not being asked to think hard about the kind of management agreements that it enters into. The only assessment that it will be required to make by law will be whether a management agreement,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;appears to it to further its general purpose&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>At first sight, that seems relatively harmless, if not terribly effective. However, the Committee will note that Clause 7(2)(f) states that a management agreement may,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;contain incidental and consequential provision&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>If noble Lords then turn to Natural England&#039;s incidental powers in Clause 13, they will see that they include power to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;acquire or dispose of property [and] borrow money&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Will the Minister give the Committee guidance on whether, although Natural England is being given extensive incidental powers, its attitude in exercising them is expected to be comparatively relaxed?
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Secondly, surely if Natural England will have the power to impose restrictions on landowners and managers by entering into management agreements, it should have solid reasons for doing so, not only that it should not be required to tell the recipient under which of its various equally ranked purposes it reckons that it is necessary to do so. Thirdly, will a landowner have a great deal of choice on whether to enter into a management agreement? That is slightly different from the issues that we shall discuss on Clause 8 and compulsory purchase orders, but it will be important none the less.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Amendment No. 162 would leave out subsection (3) of Clause 7. Our concern is that the subsection will mean that if a farmer enters into a management agreement with Natural England, he might be unable to terminate it in the event that he chose to sell his farm. Here again we appear to be dealing with powers brought forward from previous legislation that, we feel, it is right to question.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>Even more difficult might be the situation where the owner or farmer unfortunately dies relatively young, leaving a widow and children not old enough to take the farm on. In those circumstances, a management agreement might prove an obstacle to the family <br>&nbsp;<br>

achieving the best possible price, should they wish to sell and cease to run the farm. On the other hand, the existence of a management agreement might prove to be an asset in selling the property, but that cannot be known at the moment. There do not appear to be specific references to regulation, guidelines or codes of practice governing the agreements. Moreover, there is nothing in Clause 7 that binds Natural England to a particular code of conduct.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Finally, there is nothing to indicate how an agreement may be ended if it proves unsatisfactory to either party. The Minister will wish us to understand that such matters will be dealt with in the normal course of reaching an agreement, but perhaps he can tell us what the current situation is. In the absence of any provision to that effect, we feel that subsection (3) should be removed. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="60201-28_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   We have similar suspicions to those mentioned by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose. Management agreements are a good way forward and comprise a system that has been used time and again by English Nature. However, there is no doubt that land management is changing fast. For example, we have just moved from one system of farm payments to another. There is no doubt that there is a wish to bring all our SSSIs up to a much more favourable condition more quickly. Natural England will be absolutely out to prove itself&#151;I very much hope that it does&#151;in a fairly short time, so I imagine that it will be keen on making and keeping the management agreements. That is why it is particularly important that we get them right.

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>English Nature assures me that there is already such a code and that therefore the amendment is unnecessary, which is no doubt what the Minister will say. However, that code was drawn up for the much narrower purposes of English Nature. We have established this evening that Natural England will have some much wider purposes; even if Clause 2 ends up being amended slightly, Natural England&#039;s purposes will still go much wider than English Nature&#039;s. Therefore, I cannot believe that a code of practice drawn up for English Nature will be suitable in its entirety for Natural England, which will address some very different issues.

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>Amendment No. 161 would delete paragraph (f). That paragraph, which the noble Duke also did not like, is so wide that it could provide for management agreements to be made for absolutely anything. At this stage, the amendment to delete it is a probing amendment, but of course I reserve the right to view the paragraph with even more disfavour if the Minister does not give a fairly rigorous reply.

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>if influencing the way in which the land is managed would further Natural England&#039;s general purpose. Of course, management agreements are an essential and supportive tool used to secure a wide range of objectives. They are a real mark of partnership with landowners and occupiers. In the other place, responding to a specific concern, my honourable friend the Minister for Rural Affairs gave a reassurance that the wording of this clause did not mean that those who entered into such agreements with Natural England&#151;for example, the landowner&#151;could bind other interests in the land by its terms and against their will&#151;for example, those holding shooting rights or common rights.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Another concern has been expressed&#151;not in the debate today&#151;that the use of the word &quot;impose&quot; in relation to obligations and restrictions is contrary to the spirit of partnerships and represents an imposition of Natural England&#039;s will. That is not so. &quot;Impose&quot; is the word used in relation to obligations and restrictions in the various existing management agreement powers available to English Nature and the Countryside Agency in the relevant legislation. It is a familiar and long-standing term, and nothing is changed. To answer the noble Duke&#039;s third question&#151;I will come to the first two in due course&#151;I should tell him that agreements are entered into voluntarily and any obligations or restrictions imposed by the agreement are accepted as part of the bargain. Therefore, a landowner has a choice whether to enter into a management agreement, and agreements can be reached only by mutual consent.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>Clause 7 harmonises the previous position, whereby Natural England&#039;s constituent bodies had different powers, suited to their particular purposes, for entering into management agreements with land managers. That broad power covers the whole of Natural England&#039;s purpose and so simplifies the current position by effectively integrating the existing powers. Apart from agreements and schemes wholly within Natural England&#039;s design and remit, it is also possible that certain co-funded agri-environment agreements could be administered directly by Natural England under the power.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Amendment No. 159 implies the removal from Natural England of the decision on whether a particular negotiated management agreement will further its own general purpose. The issue is left somewhat open and could invite challenge by others whose motives might serve neither the interests of Natural England nor the prospective agreement holder. The prospective holder, with the assistance of any advisers, is perfectly capable of deciding whether to make the commitment. If other persons were to intervene in a debate, resources would be wasted, agreements would be delayed and nothing would be usefully gained.

</p>

<a name="60201-28_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>The noble Duke&#039;s first point, about which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, was also exercised, was about the expression &quot;incidental powers&quot;. Clause 7(2)(f) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;Contain incidental and consequential provision&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-28_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>The incidental powers in Clause 7 are different to the incidental powers in Clause 13 referred to by the noble Duke. Those in Clause 7 are incidental only to the management agreement requirements themselves. There is no question of them involving borrowing money or the other items that are referred to in Clause 13, which we will debate in due course. It is a restricted use of that expression. His second question was on whether and why you must have solid reasons for management agreement. That is because the clause is an enabling power. The reasons for the management agreement will be set out elsewhere. One example is to receive an agri-environment payment.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>Amendment No. 160 would require that the exercise of the management agreements power by Natural England would be dependent on there being a code of practice. I do not believe that the amendment is necessary, for reasons that I shall try to explain. Apart from agri-environment agreements, English Nature already has in the region of 2,700 existing management agreements in place with landowners and managers of SSSIs. Those will remain under their current terms but by virtue of other provisions in the Bill will in future be administered by Natural England under the general enabling power for agreements. They will therefore come within the authority of the provision on transfer and will continue as before with no impact for their holders as to the terms on which they were made.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Agri-environment schemes already have clear rules and procedures, and use of the existing SSSI and nature reserve management agreement powers by English Nature is governed by guidance issued by the Government in February 2001: the <i>Guidelines on Management Agreement Payments and Other Related Matters</i> issued under the various provisions, including Section 50 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Section 50 provides for guidance concerning SSSI and nature reserve management agreements, and by virtue of Schedule 11(94) that will in future cover use of the Clause 7 powers for those purposes. Coupled with the provisions at Clause 15 for the Secretary of State to give guidance to Natural England on the exercise of its functions, there is sufficient scope for advising or influencing the way in which Natural England will exercise its powers to enter into management agreements. We do not think that a further requirement for a code of practice would be helpful.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>Amendment No. 161 would remove the provision for incidental and consequential provisions; I have attempted to cover that already. Amendment No. 162 would remove a critical provision from Clause 7. It is essential that agreements can be secured for the necessary duration if they are to produce the desired outcomes, some of which may take considerable time to emerge. That is particularly so where significant commitments are entered into and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_279"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 279</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

perhaps significant capital works are supported upfront with public funds. That is true for English Nature agreements and the co-funded agri-environment agreements, where the normal minimum term for such agreements, as stipulated by EU rules, is five years. The normal default position is that an agreement continues&#151;the noble Duke asked about this&#151;should the agreement holder relinquish his interests in the land to another. Clause 7(3) makes it abundantly clear that, unless the agreement says otherwise, it will be binding on successors to the interests of the original agreement holder. That is not new; the same principle is already enshrined in the management agreement provision in Section 39 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and experience of the past 25 years has given us no grounds to review that position.
</p>

<a name="60201-28_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>Subsection (3) again provides that Natural England will have the same ability to enforce the terms of the agreement against the successors as it would have against the original agreement holder. Once that continuity is made clear, it is implicit that Natural England must also honour its obligations to the successors, who will have available to them any beneficial terms contained in the agreement that were available to the original agreement holder.

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>I have done my best to answer the important points made in this brief debate.

<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="60201-29_spnew0"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for going into that detail, as we raised a number of issues, and he has certainly tried to deal with quite a few. I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for supporting the elements of my amendments that she spoke to.
</p>

<a name="60201-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>It is interesting to realise that a code of practice is already in place and being used by English Nature. The only thing is that nothing draws people&#039;s attention to that fact other than our debate. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, made a sound point, for it is something that could be checked and slightly reviewed, because of the enlarged powers proposed for Natural England.
</p>

<a name="60201-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>The Minister also made a useful point&#151;again, not mentioned in the Bill&#151;that the making of an agreement was actually subject to agreement. There is no particular power for Natural England to force the agreement. I will read what the Minister said more carefully in <i>Hansard </i>when it appears tomorrow.
</p>

<a name="60201-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>The fact there is a default position of five years perhaps answers, in some ways, the question of the ongoing value of an asset when something untoward happens. It would be interesting if the Minister was prepared to see whether, when agreements were drawn up, some escape clause could be provided if the agreement happened to be for a longer time. That difficulty might need to be overcome, but in the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>The noble Earl said: Clause 8(4) would give the Secretary of State the power to authorise Natural England to compulsorily acquire land for the purposes of implementing experimental schemes. Given the extensive powers afforded to the new body to enter into management agreements, it really seems somewhat excessive for compulsory purchase to be an option.

<a name="60201-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I apologise for interrupting the noble Earl so early in his speech. He thinks that it must be good news, and it is. We think that there is something in what he has said already, about compulsory purchase orders being a part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60201-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>Experimental schemes are absolutely vital, as new delivery methods must be tried. However, as for allowing for compulsory purchase orders, even though they would be used very rarely indeed, I think I know which way the noble Earl&#039;s argument is going. I am not, of course, inviting him to sit down straight away; he must make his point. However, would he be so good as to bear in mind that we are inclined, if not to accept the amendment as it stands, to return with another view on Report regarding compulsory purchase orders?

In relation to Amendment No. 176, will the Crichel Down rules still apply? There is no need for the Minister to answer now.

<a name="60201-29_spnew6"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   From the very enthusiastic way in which the Minister leapt to his feet I assumed that it would be game, set and match with really good news, but it is certainly quite good news and I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord for that.

<a name="60201-29_spnew9"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   I have two points. First, if compulsory purchase is to remain in the Bill, the landowner or whoever can sometimes appeal against it. That can be costly and, with the state of the rural economy at present, possibly unaffordable, so funnily enough one can be easily blackmailed. That should be borne in mind. I do not need answers, but I ask the Minister to consider these points.
</p>

<a name="60201-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>Secondly, the National Trust was exempted from this provision and I could not see any justification for that, because it may be just as guilty as anyone else of not being co-operative. If there is to be a principle that land and property can be expropriated from someone in a non-communist environment, I do not see why it should not apply equally to charities, government bodies and private landowners.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>Page 5, line 11, leave out &quot;provide&quot; and insert &quot;commission&quot;</p>

<p><a name="st_204"></a>The noble Baroness said: I wonder whether I shall be as successful second time around. Perhaps that is expecting too much.
</p>

<a name="60201-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>We are asking the Government to clarify their thinking on how Natural England will work in practice. The amendment seeks to establish whether Natural England will use outside expertise rather than provide in-house training. Local authorities are changing in response to government diktat the way that they supply services to schools, to social services and to other bodies that have hitherto been, in effect, customers.
</p>

<a name="60201-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The emphasis now is on operating as commissioners of services. Against that background, Natural England should also concentrate on commissioning training rather than providing it. Such a move has two distinct advantages, which I am sure will appeal to the Minister. First, the overheads are reduced. Natural England would not have to foot the bill for any shortfall in the taking-up of training programmes, whereas organisations such as Lantra or other bodies such as agricultural colleges will doubtless be prepared <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_282"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 282</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to develop, credit and deliver suitable courses. Secondly, by commissioning training, Natural England can monitor its delivery and review its effectiveness far more easily than if the organisation were carrying out both roles itself. It is a fairly short amendment; I beg to move.

<a name="60201-29_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   I urge the noble Baroness to consider that she may be over-prescriptive&#151;almost ideological&#151; on this point, if I dare say so. Surely we want flexibility. The great thing about &quot;provide&quot; is that it does not exclude commissioning, whereas &quot;commissioning&quot; would exclude Natural England doing something itself if it felt it were the obvious thing to do. I do not think we want to say that it must be one thing or the other. We want what is best for the particular situation. Some training may be in-house; a lot may be commissioned. I think &quot;provide&quot; is a more inclusive term than &quot;commission&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="60201-29_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I must come to the noble Baroness&#039;s defence on tabling this amendment, because it goes back to some of the earlier comments we made, notwithstanding the strong feelings of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, on this issue. There is indeed quite a big question mark over exactly how public money is spent, whether in duplicating things that local authorities might be providing&#151;as mentioned by the noble Baroness&#151;or by having consultants come in to provide them, very often in a more expensive manner, albeit that it may be cheaper because one does not have to retain staff annually. Of course there are judgments to be made.
</p>

<a name="60201-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>I think it is quite useful, for the record, to hear what the Government intend their agencies to do about consultants. We have seen in some areas of growth&#151;regrettably, local authorities are one of them&#151;very high expenditure on consultants. It is absolutely no coincidence that the Capitas of this world, for example, have their very own <i>Private Eye </i>column. When we look at some of the most profitable companies, they are very often those employing lots of consultants. I have no doubt that sometimes they do an excellent job, but they should not be doing a job to the exclusion of other agencies that are very capable of doing it, but simply lack the marketing skills to push themselves to Natural England. I support the spirit behind this amendment.

<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="60201-30_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   It seems to me that Natural England would need the maximum degree of flexibility in these issues. My question is quite simple. Going back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, does exclusively having &quot;provide&quot; in the Bill prohibit Natural England from commissioning? I do not think that it does.
</p>




<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="60201-30_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I am in the happy position of being able to agree with virtually everything every noble Lord has said on this amendment.

England offering training directly, and require it to commission third parties. Natural England will always seek to achieve best value for money, and I am certain that this will often lead it to buy training and many other services from specialist bodies. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, referred to local authorities and their experience, and to universities and colleges of agriculture.
</p>

<a name="60201-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>However, that will not always be the case. In order to further its purpose, Natural England needs to be able to use its expertise directly to help others to deliver. This clause allows, as my noble friend Lord Judd said, Natural England to run its own training courses when doing so is most cost-effective. This might be particularly appropriate, for example, in relation to the nature reserves it manages.
</p>

<a name="60201-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>The existing word also sends the positive signal that Natural England will engage directly with customers and stakeholders to deliver its outcomes. I think, on the basis of the virtual unanimity around the House, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

</p>

<a name="60201-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>I know that we are looking to the future so I should not be pessimistic, but experience suggests that training has sometimes been offered in-house which is not as cost-effective. The Minister&#039;s response to me was that work would be commissioned or provided when doing so was cost-effective. Somebody, presumably Natural England, has to make a decision on that.
</p>

<a name="60201-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>I certainly hope that the board of Natural England will think a bit about how it goes about its practical business in that way. Outside organisations could bring a wealth of additional experience to the concept of what the non-departmental body will achieve, which is very important, and I certainly do not wish to see them excluded. Although the Minister is shaking her head and saying that they are not&#151;I accept that, because I always listen most carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and accept what he says&#151;I do not think it amiss that we have had our very short discussion on it, so that both avenues might be kept open. All of us want to ensure two things: that it is cost-effective, and that the advice sought&#151;or the training given&#151;is of the highest quality.

If Natural England will look around for small parcels of land&#151;say, at the edges of woods, fields or ponds, or close to riverbanks&#151;there will probably be no important problems at all. If, however, the requirement is for a few acres in the middle of a field or wood, the knock-on pressures on that landowner could be significant. The price to be paid under compulsory purchase legislation may be inadequate to compensate for the difficulties of the farming in the rest of that land. Is there any overwhelming reason why Natural England should not purchase land in the open marketplace, in the normal way? I beg to move.

<a name="column_286"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 286</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I am slightly taken by surprise by a Clause 12 stand part debate, but the noble Baroness is absolutely entitled. Let me do my best with my surprise to answer what she said.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The clause provides certainty and removes any ambiguity in existing legislation where English Nature and the Countryside Agency&#039;s prosecution powers across their enforcement duties&#151;for example, in relation to by-laws&#151;are not clearly expressed in legislation. I want to make it clear that there is no intention for Natural England to become a wider enforcement body than the three existing bodies that will make up Natural England. By way of example, Natural England will be working with landowners and occupiers to encourage them to enter long-term agri-environment agreements that will help to protect and conserve our natural environment.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Breach of such agreements will primarily result in administrative penalties by way of reduction or loss of all annual payments. However, where there are serious breaches of legislation, we believe it is useful for Natural England to be able to bring such cases to the criminal courts. It is implicit that Natural England will be able to prosecute only in areas within its general purposes, as set out in Clause 2. Will it have more powers of enforcement? There is no intention for Natural England to become a wider enforcement body.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>The reason for mentioning the power in the Bill at all is simply to clarify the position. Although the Schedule 5 substantive alterations to wildlife inspector powers within the enforcement provisions in the Wildlife and Countryside Act and the protection of badgers, deer, and seals Acts will in many instances involve entry and inspection by Natural England inspectors&#151;I have no doubt that we will debate that in due course&#151;there is no present intention to expand the number of wildlife inspectors above those currently employed by our regional development service. The additional powers of entry will primarily assist Natural England with the necessary routine checking of wildlife licence compliance. Criminal proceedings are used only as a last resort or where there has been a blatant abuse of wildlife legislation.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>Where an offence is suspected to have been committed and further evidence is required to be taken with a view to possible prosecution, a Natural England inspector will normally expect to call on the assistance of special Defra-trained investigators experienced in collecting evidence for the purposes of criminal proceedings. Such Defra investigators may be authorised as wildlife inspectors for the sole purpose of investigating a suspected offence.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>Will Natural England be seen as having a similar enforcement role to the Environment Agency? The simple answer is no. The noble Baroness asked about non-legally qualified persons pursuing criminal actions. I must tell her that it is not yet decided whether legally qualified persons will be employed by Natural England but, in any event, where a case is taken in the name of Natural England, it can still bring the case <br>&nbsp;<br>

using outside prosecutors. I stress that there is no intention for Natural England to become a wider enforcement body.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>I hope that that goes some way to answering the questions raised by the noble Baroness.

<a name="60201-31_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister, especially as he was not expecting to respond to this debate, for which I again apologise. Perhaps I may draw his attention to a couple of other things. The more I read the Bill, the more I am alarmed by some of its far-reaching consequences. The more I cross-reference parts of the Bill to other parts, the more apprehensive I feel about some of the hidden effects. That is worth sharing with the Committee.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>For example, we learn from Clause 54 that those who are responsible for wilfully damaging SSSIs may be liable to a fine of &#163;20,000. But if we turn to Schedule 10, we find that someone who objects to being questioned by a levy board will be liable not only to the highest possible level of statutory fines but to a two-year prison sentence. So someone who is convicted of damaging an SSSI will have a lighter punishment than someone who refuses to &quot;provide information&quot; or produce documents &quot;of a description so specified&quot;. He will be liable to a far higher penalty.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>Even worse, to my mind, is the fact that if someone tries to prevent an officer entering his property, he is liable to the same heavy penalty. I suggest that the punishment will not fit the crime in some cases. As the Minister was not expecting me to speak to clause stand part, I should be grateful if, between now and Report, he would consider this further to see whether the Government accept that proportion has gone out of the window for some of the offences. That is why I was opposing clause stand part.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Clause 12 agreed to.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a>Page 6, line 3, leave out paragraphs (b) and (c).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_225"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a simple, clarifying amendment that seeks to identify how exactly and to what extent Natural England will use its so-called incidental powers. I have been reassured in consultation that it is quite natural for a public body to have incidental powers, but I am slightly alarmed that under Clause 13 Natural England may,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a>&quot;do anything that appears to it to be conducive or incidental to the discharge of its functions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>The clause continues:

</p>

<a name="60201-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>That seems to be a remarkably wide-ranging description of powers that are meant to be merely incidental. In my layman&#039;s reading of the clause, if Natural England decided that it wanted to carry out a biodiversity function on a farm, it would be perfectly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_288"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 288</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

able to do so under the clause, overriding the management agreements and constrictions that have already been heavily debated.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>Will the Minister tell us how Natural England will be financed in the future? In earlier debates, we talked about start-up clauses and the costs and savings. Certainly, the review by the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, was clear about two things: first, the body should reduce regulation; secondly, it should reduce costs. We have debated those costs, and the Minister has kindly written to me about them, but I am talking about future costs. Will Defra or other departments give grants so that Natural England can maintain the very nature of what it is supposed to be doing, or might Natural England look elsewhere for funding; for example, from the National Lottery?
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>Will the Minister comment on the article in Monday&#039;s edition of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, which said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>&quot;&#039;Green&#039; farms face 40pc cut after EU deal by Blair&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>That suggests that there will be great pressure on money available through the Rural Development Service for the agri-environment agreements. If so, what will happen to the bodies and to the agreements that farmers and former bodies have had? I understand that money is likely to be obtained from the National Lottery, which slightly alarms me. I must question whether this is the right place for the funding of such a major new non-departmental public body, because on the whole the lottery is a one-off available funding source. If it will be competing with other bodies that might want to appeal to the lottery for grants, will it have the prime pull on that money, and if so, is that not likely to jeopardise other smaller bodies that want to appeal on their own behalf rather than through Natural England to gain extra grants. There is therefore quite a large question mark on the future funding of Natural England. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_226"></a>
<a name="60201-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Jopling: </b>   When I read Clause 13, my mind goes back&#151;probably a good deal further than that of many noble Lords who sit in the House at this late hour&#151;to another place in the late 1960s, when I spoke on behalf of the opposition and when the then Minister of Agriculture, Fred Peart, who was much admired by a great many of us and who became Leader of another place and then Leader of your Lordships&#039; House, introduced legislation to set up rural development boards.


</p>

<a name="60201-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>Those rural development boards from the 1960s also had a power to acquire and dispose of property. I recall that the organisation was set up in the north Pennines, with its headquarters in my old constituency of Appleby. One of the things it did was to acquire a very run-down estate owned by the trustees of a Member of your Lordships&#039; House who is now deceased and whose name I shall not repeat. The board purchased that property with a view to setting up a project of great social and economic engineering in Nidderdale. At the time the project generated deep hostility because it was felt that it was not for a state organisation to acquire large swathes of country, whether in Nidderdale or elsewhere, in order to carry <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_289"></a>

out the sort of social engineering which I think is implicit in Clause 2, covering Natural England&#039;s general purposes.
</p>

<a name="60201-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>I have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment. Call it <i>d&#233;j&#224; vu</i> if you like, but I am anxious about setting up an organisation with powers to acquire and dispose of property and to carry out social and economic well-being policies, as described in Clause 2. Can the Minister tell us what he thinks Natural England will do if it acquires or disposes of property? If he cannot do so tonight, perhaps between now and Report he can consider whether the example of the rural development board set up in the 1960s is being resuscitated today. It really was a disaster and the board was wound up in the early 1970s, largely because of its grandiose plans to acquire swathes of the countryside in order to carry out social and economic engineering exercises. I hope that we are not retracing that disastrous step which, thank God, was cut off at its stocking tops in the early days.

<p><a name="st_227"></a>
<a name="60201-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </b>   Perhaps I may develop briefly the wider concern about finance mentioned just now by my noble friend Lady Byford. If we compare Clause 14 covering grants with Clause 13 covering incidental powers, it is difficult to work out where the financial decision about money will be made. Clause 14 states simply that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State may make grants to Natural England of such amounts as the Secretary of State thinks fit&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>At the same time, as my noble friend on the Front Bench has just pointed out, Clause 13 sets out the specific possibilities for Natural England. She said also that perhaps those possibilities go a bit far.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>Is there not an essential contradiction between Clauses 13 and 14? On the one hand, powers and functions are given to Natural England, but in the very next clause it is clear that decisions on the amount of money available are taken away and put in the hands of the Secretary of State. On that basis, how can the board of Natural England reasonably plan its finances over a three-year period? Add to that the factor brought in by my noble friend Lady Byford. The current thinking is that because of the relative decline in the CAP budget and the fact that single farm payments are more or less guaranteed for the next seven years, the amount of CAP money coming forward from Pillar 2 for agri-environmental schemes is likely to fall very substantially. Indeed, we know that some people already suggested a fall of 40 per cent in the money. I am glad to see that the Minister shakes his head: I hope that he is right. It is therefore hard to see, looking at Clauses 13 and 14 together against the background of a diminishing CAP budget in relation to Pillar 2, where the money is going to come from. It would be helpful to have some guidance from the Minister.

<a name="column_290"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 290</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mind from that in the mind of the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry. My worry would be that in Clause 14 the grant may be made subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State thinks fit, so Natural England may acquire the property subject to the money coming from the Secretary of State, who can impose any conditions that he likes, all of which might add up to the expression used earlier&#151;social engineering. If we were conspiracy theorists or paranoid, that would be a worst-case scenario. The Minister needs to address our worries in that regard.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>I have a slightly less paranoid worry that the power, the grants, and this way of spending public money will encourage public money to be spent as the easy way out where management agreements and so on may be difficult and onerous. I have in mind, for example, the contrast between national parks&#151;which were mentioned earlier&#151;where voluntary agreements with landowners can produce outstanding results satisfactorily and much more cheaply to the public purse; and the easier option where a national park has chosen to buy itself out of a problem. That way of addressing issues, for example, simply by spending public capital on buying land&#151;as I would fear&#151;we need to question. I am glad that the noble Baroness raised the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="60201-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   There are two issues here: one arises out of the amendment which deals with the incidental powers in Clause 13; the other is an important issue around the future of rural development in this country, which the noble Baroness mentioned and on which the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is a knowledge expert. I have to put it like that because he is asking me a Question about it in a week&#039;s time&#151;next Tuesday to be exact.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>If I do not go into huge detail on the point tonight, I hope that the Committee will forgive me. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is initiating a debate on rural affairs tomorrow, to which we are all looking forward greatly. I am also looking forward to answering the noble Lord&#039;s Question next Tuesday, but I will have a word to say about it. Let me deal with the first part: the incidental powers provision in Clause 13.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>It is a standard provision for any non-departmental public body; for example, the Environment Agency has equivalent powers, but there is frequently some cause or confusion around those powers. That is what the noble Baroness is getting at. Let me try to spell out briefly what they are about. Without such powers in Clause 13, Natural England would be able to do anything incidental or conducive to carrying out its functions. However, there can be doubts about what is or is not incidental or what is or is not conducive to the functions of an NDPB, so this provision makes Natural England&#039;s incidental powers clear. We are not in the business of setting up a trading company, so in common with all public bodies Natural England would be able to use these powers only in situations where it is helpful to do so to carry out its functions. That is a significant and important safeguard.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_291"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 291</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60201-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>The amendment would remove Natural England&#039;s express powers to acquire property and to borrow money. It might still be possible for Natural England to do those things as a matter of law, but it would not be in the Bill. We do not think that there is any danger in keeping those express powers. They are useful and will allow Natural England, for example, to take out a loan in order to buy land to provide study facilities. We do not see anything wrong with that. But Natural England would be able to borrow money or to buy land only&#151;I stress, only&#151;where the transaction is incidental or conducive to its own functions. In other words, these incidental powers are constrained by the scope of Natural England&#039;s functions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="60201-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </b>   What is the definition of &quot;incidental or conducive&quot; in this context?
</p>




<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="60201-32_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I have said that these are the equivalent powers that are given to other NDPBs. They are therefore not the purpose of a non-departmental public body, but are incidental powers in order to be able to make such a public body function in an appropriate way in carrying out its responsibilities. That is the best answer that I can give the noble Lord today. He may want me to reflect more on his question and to answer him in writing, which of course I will do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="60201-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </b>   I would appreciate that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_233"></a>
<a name="60201-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   So we believe that Clause 13 strikes the right balance and will enable Natural England to carry out its functions properly and efficiently. The budget was agreed as part of the EU budget deal in December with a seven-year ceiling of &#8364;69.75 billion, which is roughly&#151;I repeat, roughly&#151;equivalent to current spending; that is, for the present financial perspective, which is 1999-2006. This one is for 2007&#150;13. The new budget will include spending for Bulgaria and Romania plus the current 25 member states. The agreed budget also increases emphasis on new member states&#039; rural development expenditure&#151;at least, &#8364;33.1 billion.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>However, the rural development budget for the EU 15 was cut in order to get a deal due to reluctance to further cuts in Pillar 1. Securing voluntary modulation was an important part of the budget agreement, certainly for the United Kingdom. Member states can voluntarily modulate up to 20 per cent of their Pillar 1 budget for use on Pillar 2 rural development expenditure. Unlike compulsory EU modulation, financing voluntary modulation does not have to be co-financed by member states before it is spent. It is a welcome flexibility to choose co-financing levels rather than to have to accept imposed levels. As the Committee will know, there is pressure from farming bodies against moves to increase modulation without co-financing.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>A number of further details have to be worked out. The agreed EU budget still needs European Parliament endorsement and the allocation of main funding&#151;that is to say, outside convergence regions <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_292"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column 292</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for all member states to be proposed by the Commission in line with the rural development regulation. The amount left to be allocated to the EU 15 from ex-guarantee will be &#8364;18.91 billion. Compulsory EU modulation will add approximately &#8364;7 billion across the EU, all of which must be match-funded by member states.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a> That takes us to the article in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, which was referred to by the noble Baroness. While I encourage all Members of the Committee to look at that article, written by a most reputable journalist, I also encourage the Committee to read my letter, published in that newspaper today, which attempts to deal with some of the points on which we think that the article was wrong. My letter makes it clear that it is no secret that we wanted, as a country, to reduce mainstream CAP subsidy payments to provide funds for rural development. I believe the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, would heartily approve of this. The agreed EU budget for rural development spending is roughly the same as expenditure in the current period. It is not true that the deal will cause a 40 per cent cut, I argue, in payments for green farming in the UK. The key to funding the new environmental stewardship scheme in England was agreement in December to allow transfers of up to 20 per cent from CAP subsidies to fund such schemes. We believe that is a significant step forward in our strategy to shift CAP funds to environmentally sustainable farming.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>It was also not true that only the first 5 per cent can be match-funded by government. Member states can choose the level of match funding that they allocate. Lastly, the article claimed that Defra Ministers have written a joint letter to the Prime Minister with the Environment Agency, RSPB and English Nature. Defra Ministers have not written such a letter. I could go on, but think that at this hour to say more about that settlement would mean that we have less to say when we come to debate these matters in due course.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>The noble Baroness asked about future funding of Natural England. Natural England will receive the core of its funding from Defra. A large part will be for the agri-environment programme. We expect Natural England to seek appropriate sources of income from other areas, as the Countryside Agency and English Nature have done. That could include the lottery, sources of targeted EU finding and even commercial sponsorship. It is for the lottery distributors to decide their policies for giving awards, and it would not be right to prevent Natural England from receiving lottery grants. Natural England will have a total budget of over &#163;300 million.
</p>

<a name="60201-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>I hope I have gone some way to answering the points made in this debate.

The noble Lord, Lord Renton, and the Minister will no doubt resolve his anxieties as regards his particular question.
</p>

<a name="60201-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>To return to the issue I raised on the long-term funding of Natural England, the Minister has suggested&#151;I will have to read it carefully&#151;that the main core funding will come from Defra. When he says &quot;main core funding&quot;, is he talking about 50 per cent, 60 or 90 per cent? How much is actually committed at this stage from Defra or from other sources? How much of that money is going to be sought from other areas as the Minister has described? How much of the use of lottery and other moneys is actually desirable in the long-term interests of a non-departmental government body, and even further on those who might be applying to the lottery? Our concern is for organisations that work in the community which wish to seek lottery money. If they seek to cover or be involved in some of the aspects covered by Natural England, their moneys may not be forthcoming because the lottery could say that Natural England has applied for that particular purpose, and that it will distribute money as and when to causes it feels are worth while. Although I thank the Minister for his attempt in answering, we must return to this issue because it is unsatisfactory. If between now and <br>&nbsp;<br>

Report he could let us know what degree of core funding is likely to come, that would be helpful. Perhaps a message is coming, so I will keep chatting for a minute. As I say, I am not at all happy that some proportion of that money will be sought from organisations such as the lottery that could grant money one year and not be in the position to grant it another. That does not give Natural England a good base financially. Perhaps the Minister has some news for me. No, I see that he does not. Then we will return to the issue later, but at this stage I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_0"></a>Page 30, line 39, leave out subsection (1) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

&quot;(1)   If an application under section 70 is upheld, the adjudicator shall make an order, either&#151;

<br>
(a)   requiring the respondent company to change its name to one that is not an offending name, and requiring all respondents&#151;


<br>
(i)   to take all such steps as are within their powers to make, or facilitate the making of that change, and


<br>
(ii)   not to cause or permit any steps to be taken calculated to result in another company being registered with a name that is an offending name, or


<br>
(b)   requiring the respondent company to undertake to the applicant and to the Secretary of State not to operate under the registered name in connection with such activities as may be specified in the order.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_1"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment would correct what we see as an anomaly in the scope of the order that the adjudicator can make under Clause 73(1). In the case of many company names and trademarks, the goodwill attached to them will apply only in certain fields of activity or endeavour. Except where a name is especially well known or famous, uses outside those specific fields might not be likely to mislead; therefore, the requirement to change a name just because it is similar is, in our view, too restrictive.
</p>

<a name="60201-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_0"></a>It should be open to the adjudicator, in appropriate cases, to order that the respondent company may retain the disputed name provided that it gives an undertaking not to operate in fields of activity where the applicant&#039;s name has goodwill attached to it. It is fairly obvious how that would work. I beg to move.

<a name="60201-33_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   For reasons that are not clear, Amendment No. 74, which is in my name, contains the last part of this amendment. Therefore, rather than allow that to pass by and then deal with the matter again in Amendment No. 74, I associate myself with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and I, too, look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s response to this query.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_3"></a>
<a name="60201-33_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   I support my noble friend Lord Sharman. This is not a theoretical problem. At present there are a number of very practical cases&#151;I am inclined to use Sainsbury&#039;s as an example, although I cannot see how anyone using Sainsbury&#039;s at <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC120</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

any level of activity would be caught by our amendment&#151;where companies with similar names are trading at completely different levels of activity without a problem. Therefore, it seems appropriate that the adjudicator should be given the power&#151;in this case, to make an order&#151;to require one of the companies not to change its name but to undertake not to trade in the activities where there is a conflict.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_4"></a>
<a name="60201-33_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   As has been described, Amendment No. 73A seeks to give company names adjudicators additional powers. Instead of ordering a company to change its registered name, they could order it to refrain from using its registered name in relation to certain activities. However&#151;this is where we part company&#151;where someone has grounds to stop a company trading under a particular name, whether it is its registered name or not, there is already a remedy. It is found in the law on trademarks and passing off. We think that that is where the matter should be dealt with; it is not a matter for company law. Therefore the amendments are unnecessary.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_5"></a>
<a name="60201-33_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   I have heard what the noble Lord has said. I just observe that the problem with trademark legislation is that one is engaged in courts, laws and, despite the fact that my noble friend Lord Razzall is a member of that noble profession, lots of fees to lawyers. I should like to reflect on what the noble Lord said and come back to this matter at a later stage. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="gc_st_7"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is also concerned with Clause 73, on orders requiring a name to be changed. This, too, is an issue brought to our attention by the Law Society.

</p>

<a name="60201-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_3"></a>The clause defines an offending name as similar to the name associated with the objector in which he claims goodwill. The expression &quot;goodwill&quot; is already defined in the Bill as worded in the amendment for its purposes in Clause 70, but we wonder whether it needs to be defined for its purposes in Clause 73 as well. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_11"></a>
<a name="60201-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </b>   moved Amendment No. 76:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_2"></a>Page 31, line 31, leave out subsection (3).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_12"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 76 relates to the clause dealing with appeal from the adjudicator&#039;s decision. This issue has been of concern to the Confederation of British Industry. Clause 74(3) provides that, in the event of an appeal upholding an application, the effect of the adjudicator&#039;s decision is to be suspended. Therefore, until the appeal process is completed, the respondents will be free to use the name that was previously declared to be offending. This is surely an incentive to companies not only to appeal but to drag out any such appeal for as long as possible and continue trading under the name, possibly cashing in on another company&#039;s goodwill or causing further damage to the goodwill of that company and its general prosperity. Instead, in the event of such an appeal, it should be open for the respondents to apply for a court order suspending the initial adjudicator&#039;s order until the appeal is decided. The amendment would remove the automatic suspension, thereby minimising the incentive to pursue a vexatious or frivolous appeal. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_13"></a>
<a name="60201-34_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The thinking behind the amendment is that a company should change its name as soon as an adjudicator tells it to. It should be relevant whether the company plans to appeal. The concern is that the company will string out proceedings for as long as it can and, while it retains its registered name, will continue to trade under it, damaging the applicant&#039;s goodwill.
</p>

<a name="60201-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_7"></a>The concern is unfounded. First, the fact that a company has registered a particular name does not confer a right to trade under it. If somebody is concerned about the name the company is trading under, the remedy is in the law of trademarks and passing off. This applies whether or not a company is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC122"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC122</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

trading under its registered name. Secondly, there will be cost consequences if a company appeals unsuccessfully.
</p>

<a name="60201-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_8"></a>In any event, the amendment would negate the clause. If a company had to change its name immediately, its name might then be taken by anyone else. In particular, it is likely that the applicant would wish to register the name, if only as a precautionary measure. This means that the company would have lost the name even if the court were to reverse the adjudicator&#039;s decision. A company cannot register a name which is the same as one already on the register. The outcome would be wholly inequitable.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_14"></a>
<a name="60201-34_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   The last concern could be tackled by a further addition to our amendment: that during the appeal procedure neither party would be in a position to register the name or take action with the registrar to improve their position. We need to reflect on the issue of other remedies and perhaps come back to it. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="gc_st_16"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 78, which concerns Clause 76.
</p>

<a name="60201-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_12"></a>Clause 75 allows the Secretary of State to direct a change of name by a company in the event of misleading information being given at the time of registration of the name. This decision can be made up to five years from the date of registration of the name. The question is how long the period should be. Five years seems a long time to have this potential threat hanging over a company. During a five-year period a number of things could have happened. The company could, for example, have been sold and the person providing the misleading information might have realised his or her profit on the investment and moved on, leaving those with no responsibility for providing the misleading information suffering as a result.
</p>

<a name="60201-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_13"></a>The amendment does not seek to eliminate the penalty, merely to reduce the period to three years. This would fit with our earlier amendment to Clause 12, in which we sought to increase the length of the continuing liability of companies limited by guarantee from one year to three years. Three years would be a reasonable period for any problems and misleading information to come to the surface and to the notice of parties who might be offended thereby.
</p>

<a name="60201-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_14"></a>Amendment No. 78 is probing in nature and concerns a change from the Companies Act 1985. Under that Act, officers of the company are not liable. Nor is it a criminal offence under the corresponding section of that Act&#151;I think it is Section 32&#151;to fail to comply with a direction by the Secretary of State. Slightly more concerning is the assurance in the table of derivations that this clause makes no substantial <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC123"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC123</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

change to Section 32 of the Companies Act 1985. I would argue that the introduction of a criminal offence and the expansion of the liabilities of officers of the company represent a substantial change. The amendment seeks to remove these additions and to return the meaning of the clause to that found in Section 32 of the Companies Act 1985. It also sets the level of the fine at &#163;1,000 initially, followed by a &#163;100 daily default fine for continued non-compliance. This seems a reasonable level which would encourage businesses to act promptly. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_17"></a>
<a name="60201-34_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 75 supplements the clauses earlier in this part on registration of names containing sensitive words, expressions and so on. Typically, companies have to contact government departments or other bodies for permission to use these words. Sometimes they have to give undertakings. Clause 75 allows the Secretary of State to direct a company to change its name if it has given misleading information or breached an undertaking.
</p>

<a name="60201-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>The Secretary of State rarely uses this power but that does not mean that it is an insignificant safeguard. Directions are usually given on the basis of a complaint either from the police or the body whose view was sought for the name&#039;s approval. The question is: after what period should a company be able to retain a name even if its current activities do not justify the inclusion of a sensitive word or expression? The period has long been five years. It might well be argued that it would be in the public interest for the period to be lengthened substantially, as the reason prior approval was required in the first place was to protect the public. We recognise that there comes a time when a name is so strongly associated with the company that its independent meaning loses relevance; however, I do not think that time is reached after only three years.

</p>

<a name="60201-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>Making the company, and none of the directors, liable for a fine would be very hard on the members on whom ultimately the penalty will fall. The current drafting says that the directors are liable only if they are in default. I see no reason why a director who is in default should not be liable. I note the proposal that the penalty be expressed in sterling. This certainly makes it clearer&#151;but it means that the penalty cannot be adjusted along with other financial penalties.
</p>

<a name="60201-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_17"></a>With regard to the regime for penalties, most of the regulatory requirements associated with company law are currently enforced through criminal sanctions. The Company Law Review looked at that issue in detail and concluded that so long as it was enforced sensibly, the efficiency of the criminal sanctions regime was sufficient to overcome any misgivings about proportionality of applying these sanctions to breaches of procedural requirements. We and the great majority of consultees agree with that conclusion. Therefore, the Bill does not substantially change the sanctions regime.

<ul>

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_22"></a>The noble Lord said: The clause requires a company to inform the registrar when it is agreed by special resolution to change its name. That is all well and good; however, it also requires a company to inform the registrar when a name change is agreed by special resolution but subject to the occurrence of a certain event or certain events. I do not follow the reason why companies should have to do that. Presumably, if that certain event does not happen there will be no name change and the notice will have been a waste of time. I also assume that the notice will not&#151;as it makes no mention of registering the name&#151;preclude a second company from registering the name in the intervening period, and therefore bar the first company from effecting its change of name on the occurrence of the event. Surely it would be more sensible and more deregulatory for companies to have to inform the registrar of a change of name only when that change is actually going to happen. The amendment seeks to give effect to that argument by removing subsections (2) and (3), which require notice of a conditional potential change. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_23"></a>
<a name="60201-35_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I understand why noble Lords might consider that these two subsections add unnecessary complexity to the Bill. However, they deal with a real problem that has been identified. All special resolutions have to be filed with the registrar within 15 days. This means that if a company passes a special resolution to change its name, it needs to be filed. However, often, particularly in the context of mergers, the resolution is conditional. The change of name will not take effect unless something else happens. It is important that a mechanism exists to let the registrar know when the condition has been fulfilled, so that a new certificate can be issued at the right time. The noble Lord&#039;s proposition was that you <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60201-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_29"></a>Clause 82(1)(a) allows the Secretary of State to make provision by regulations to require companies to display specified information in specified locations. In practice, this is often a long list of names that the company has registered that is to be displayed in its office. No one looks at it and it serves no useful purpose. Even more futile is the even longer list of company names displayed in offices of lawyers and chartered accountants. I quite understand and support the need for regulations to provide for certain information to be required to be shown on documents and communications&#151;that is covered in Clause 82(1)(b). I am not sure whether the paragraph covers passive information such as websites but perhaps the Minister will cover that. I am equally happy with Clause 82(1)(c), which requires companies to put information on letterheads and so on. Those are both important aspects of a company&#039;s positioning in the marketplace, but I am less convinced by paragraph (a). In the interests of deregulation, the amendment would remove this admittedly small burden on companies by removing this paragraph from the list of things that the Secretary of State may make provision for by regulation.
</p>

<a name="60201-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_30"></a>On the Question whether Clause 82 shall stand part of the Bill, it would be helpful if we could learn from the Minister about the timing of regulations to be made under this clause and where we are with draft regulations. Clearly, our debates on these clauses are better and more informed if we can see what the Government have in mind, since the powers are often wide-ranging. I beg to move.

<a name="60201-35_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I shall speak to the amendment and the clause-stand-part debate. The current rules on trading disclosures by companies are extremely complex. The rules that apply to GB <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC126"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC126</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

companies are in Chapter 1 of Part 11 of the 1985 Act. Section 693 applies similar rules to overseas companies. However, there are separate rules in the Business Names Act 1985 which apply to every company that trades under a name other than that in which it is registered, even if the only difference is the omission of &quot;Plc&quot; or &quot;Limited&quot;. These rules are not identical. The information required, and which premises and documents are covered, varies. As recommended by the Company Law Review, it is intended to use the powers conferred by this clause, and the similar power provided under Clause 666 for overseas companies, to replace all these disclosure rules with a single set of regulations.
</p>

<a name="60201-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a>The noble Lord asked about regulations. Clause 82(5) provides that these will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I move that this clause should stand part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60201-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>On Amendment No. 80, at present there are two legal requirements for signage that affect companies. Under the 1985 Act, a company is required to have a sign showing its registered name outside every place in which it carries on business, and under the Business Names Act 1985, if a company carries on business under a trading name that differs in any way from its registered name, it must have a sign showing its registered name and service address displayed in a prominent position to which customers and suppliers must have access in premises where it carries on business. We agree that these two requirements are excessive, but it is most certainly in the public interest that there should be some such requirement and that it be enforced. We agree with the Company Law Review that the detail of such requirements is better addressed in regulations. I am advised that the provision of documents or communications covers websites.

<p><a name="gc_st_30"></a>The noble Lord said: Part 6 is entitled &quot;A company&#039;s registered office&quot;, as is Clause 86. In speaking to Amendment No. 81, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 82 and 89. Amendment No. 81 requires a company registered in the United Kingdom to have an office registered in the United Kingdom to which all communications and notices may be addressed. It must be right that a company that wishes to be a UK company should have a registered office in the UK, not abroad. The service of documents would be much <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC127"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC127</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

easier if the office were in the UK rather than overseas. It is not clear from the Bill whether that difficulty can be avoided.
</p>

<a name="60201-35_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_37"></a>Amendment No. 82 covers a matter brought to our attention by the Law Society and we are grateful to the Liberal Democrats for having tabled a semi-similar amendment. Our amendment makes clear that a company may not have its registered office address outside the area stated in the register. Clause 87 deals with a company changing the address of its registered office. However, in the absence of a specific provision to change the stated area in which a company has the address of its registered office, it seems that a company would be unable to make that change, with the exception of Welsh companies, which are dealt with separately in Clause 88. This should be put beyond doubt by specific wording in the Bill, which Amendment No. 82 supplies.
</p>

<a name="60201-35_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_38"></a>Amendment No. 89 is concerned with Clause 88, on Welsh companies, and returns to a point covered earlier in Committee. It is tabled to show the illogicality of the registration by region system. Why should a company registered in Wales and whose registered office is in Wales be allowed to register as being in England and Wales? We do not have companies registered in Scotland and Northern Ireland at the same time, nor can companies, at present, register in England alone, as they have to register in England and Wales. We covered this issue on Tuesday, and I fear that the response from the Minister will be no more satisfactory than the response I had then. I beg to move.

<a name="60201-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   Amendment No. 83, which is grouped with Amendment No. 81, is in my name. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, has already drawn the Committee&#039;s attention to the subtle difference between the amendments, the subtlety of which escapes me. However, we support all the arguments he has advanced; the difference between the two amendments is entirely accidental.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_32"></a>
<a name="60201-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Before I speak to the amendments, it might be helpful if I explained the tortuous background to this part of the Bill. Clause 9 requires the application for registration to specify the jurisdiction within the UK in which the company&#039;s registered office is to be situated&#151;England and Wales or Scotland or Northern Ireland. So that companies may benefit from special provisions in the Bill relating to the Welsh language, if the selected jurisdiction is England and Wales, there is the option of restricting the location of the company&#039;s registered office to Wales. But, of course, Wales is not a separate jurisdiction.
</p>

<a name="60201-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_39"></a>The Bill does not provide for a company to change the jurisdiction of its registered office. This may come; there are proposals within Europe to enable companies to move their registered offices across states. If that were to become a reality, it is inconceivable that we would not wish to allow UK companies to move also between jurisdictions within <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC128"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC128</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the UK. But that is for the future. In the mean time, we considered it prudent to allow companies to move their registered office only within the jurisdiction selected on incorporation. Changing jurisdiction may be a more complex matter and the rules regulating it should not be changed now, when there are likely to be further changes in the foreseeable future.
</p>

<a name="60201-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_40"></a>Amendment No. 81 is unnecessary. As I have explained, the Bill already requires a company&#039;s registered office to be situated in a specific part of the UK. The Bill follows the Act in this regard. It has not been a source of confusion.
</p>

<a name="60201-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_41"></a>Amendment No. 82 would provide an option for a company to have the situation of its registered office restricted to England. At first sight, this may appear to have attractions, comparable to that requiring the registered office to be in Wales. But England and Wales are a single jurisdiction with two languages. If the option of Wales has been taken for a company&#039;s registered office, then its name may conclude with the Welsh version of &quot;Limited&quot; or &quot;plc&quot; and the company may file documents in Welsh, provided they are accompanied by a certified translation into English.
</p>

<a name="60201-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_42"></a>There is no similar purpose for restricting the choice of registered office to England. Companies whose registered office is to be in England and Wales are therefore free to choose where in this jurisdiction to locate their registered office. Therefore, there would not be any benefit for the company in having to restrict its choice of location for its registered office to England, only an additional and unnecessary restraint on freedom.
</p>

<a name="60201-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_43"></a>Amendment No. 83 is not necessary. Clause 9 makes it clear that the application for registration must include a decision on the jurisdiction in which the registered office is situated. There is no provision for a change in jurisdiction.
</p>

<a name="60201-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_44"></a>Amendment No. 89 would substitute &quot;England or Wales&quot; for &quot;England and Wales&quot;. However, as I explained at the beginning of our consideration of this part of the Bill, on the incorporation of a company there is a choice of jurisdiction, rather than a choice of country for the location of its registered office. The choice of jurisdiction is England and Wales or Scotland or Northern Ireland. If &quot;England and Wales&quot; is chosen and the company is to benefit from the Welsh Language Act 1993, then it must specify that its registered office will be in Wales; otherwise its registered office may be anywhere in either country of the single jurisdiction &quot;England and Wales&quot;. That is why, however strange it may look, it is correct for subsection (3) to use the phrase &quot;England and Wales&quot;.

<p><a name="gc_st_38"></a>The noble Lord said: This issue has been raised with us by Mr Paul Salmon of Salans, the City law firm. The clause provides that a company must accept documents served on a previous address up to 14 days after notice of a change of address has been registered by the registrar. The argument is that, in this age of electronic registers and fast communications, 14 days seems a long time. The amendment seeks to reduce that to five working days&#151;seven days, in non-technical language&#151;which will still allow leeway for those needing to serve documents while not requiring the company changing its address to carry on monitoring what will then be a defunct post-box and postal address.

<p><a name="gc_st_44"></a>The noble Lord said: Here we are dealing with Part 7 and re-registration as a means of altering a company&#039;s status. The amendment has been raised with us by the Law Society. It would enable a company limited by guarantee to re-register as a company limited by shares and vice versa. The clause deals with the company changing its status by re-registration. Because of the restrictions in Clauses 102(2) and 105(2), it is not possible for a company limited by guarantee to re-register as a company limited by shares or vice versa, via registration as an unlimited company. The only routes available, both under the existing Companies Acts and as proposed under the Bill, are either a scheme or arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985, which involves a court hearing and is cumbersome and expensive, or, alternatively, a transfer of the assets and, as appropriate, the liabilities of the existing company to a new company of the other type.

Lord Hodgson. This obstacle causes a great deal of difficulty. I encourage the Government to look on the amendment favourably.

<p><a name="gc_st_47"></a>
<a name="60201-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   It may be useful to set out the background to Amendment No. 90. If a company of type A wishes to become a company of type B, it is always open to the members of company A to form a company of a different type&#151;company B&#151;and then for company B to acquire essentially everything in company A, with company A being wound up. This is not always straightforward&#151;it has been acknowledged that there could be tax and other implications&#151;but it is possible.
</p>

<a name="60201-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_62"></a>Certain transitions of company type are, however, fairly common; for example, those from a private company limited by shares to a public company. Company law has, therefore, provided an express mechanism&#151;re-registration&#151;for dealing with this sort of transition. Necessarily, the re-registration mechanisms need to provide proper safeguards for members of the companies concerned, and for their creditors. The procedures are, therefore, different in different cases. Essentially, the existence of a specific re-registration procedure for any given type of transition recognises that there is a market need for a specific procedure, and that the complexity of the process which would need to be established does not outweigh that need.
</p>

<a name="60201-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_63"></a>The current law permits certain types of re-registration, but, as acknowledged, not the kind that the amendment would provide for between companies limited by shares and those limited by guarantee, and vice versa. There are reasons for this. First, guarantee companies are nowadays not as common as companies limited by shares, and are certainly far less used in the commercial world. There is simply less market need&#151;I do not say none, but less&#151;to make such changes of status.
</p>

<a name="60201-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_64"></a>Secondly, some specific and quite complex legal issues would need to be considered in deciding how to translate a guarantee company which does not have a share capital, and whose liability is limited by that guarantee, into a company with a share capital whose liability is limited by shares and where the shares can generally be disposed of by the member. These issues do not arise in, for example, transitions from one type of share company to another. I am not saying that it would be impossible to design a scheme which permitted re-registrations of this sort but, in considering the possibilities, we were struck by the potential complexity of the arrangements that would be necessary for legal drafting and for the processes that companies might need to go through.
</p>

<a name="60201-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_65"></a>Although it is clear that some organisations would find such options helpful in some circumstances, neither we nor the Company Law Review, which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC132"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC132</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

recommended that the option be explored and which recognised the particular difficulties attached to it, received any overwhelming evidence of dissatisfaction with the current legal position, or a need for change. On balance, therefore, I remain of the view that the case for change does not outweigh the difficulties of delivering it.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_48"></a>
<a name="60201-37_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   That is a slightly disappointing reply, but I thank the Minister for it. His speaking note shows that a good deal of thought has been given to this. The argument hangs on two points. The first is that companies limited by guarantee are not in frequent use nowadays and therefore we do not need to design a special procedure for them. If I had a pound for every time I have heard governments argue that infrequent use is not a reason for getting rid of something, I would be a rich man. This time, the Government are arguing the reverse.
</p>

<a name="60201-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_66"></a>The second point is the complex legal position that would have to be adopted. Our amendment pointed out that this merely shifted the complex legal issues to the private sector. As the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, pointed out, practitioners and companies have found this difficult&#151;not necessarily very often&#151;and since we are now setting up a universal company law system, it would be helpful to deal with all the re-registration possibilities. We will read carefully what the Minister said, because he has clearly addressed the issue in some detail, and see whether the Law Society feels that we ought to push the Government a little harder on this. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_50"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 92 and 98. The underlying intention behind Clause 90 is to enable any private company, whether limited or unlimited, to re-register as a public company, provided it has a share capital. Subsection (4) makes this clear by explicitly providing that unlimited companies may re-register as public. However, subsection (2)(a) provides that the company must first be &quot;limited by shares&quot; in order to re-register as public, a condition that an unlimited company cannot satisfy. The first amendment puts beyond doubt that both limited and unlimited companies may re-register as public under this clause. The second amendment removes any scope for confusion resulting from the condition that an unlimited company must be &quot;limited by shares&quot; by providing instead that the company must &quot;have a share capital&quot;.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_53"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 94. The amendments concern the size of the capital that should be deposited <i>ab initio</i> in a public company. Clause 91 sets out the requirement that companies must meet in order to re-register as a public company. The nominal value of the company&#039;s allotted share capital must be not less than the authorised minimum&#151;currently &#163;50,000&#151;of which only a quarter of the nominal value must be paid up. That could mean that to re-register as a public company, with all that that implies in the public mind, the paid-up value on shares need be only &#163;12,500&#151;a quarter of &#163;50,000. That is hardly what is brought to mind when one thinks of a public company.
</p>

<a name="60201-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_75"></a>The amendment seeks to test the Government&#039;s thinking on this matter and would raise the nominal value of the share capital to &#163;100,000, of which three-quarters must be paid up. That would go some way to ensuring that companies that wish to be viewed by potential customers, suppliers, employees and investors as large and trustworthy have some substance with a minimum of &#163;75,000. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_54"></a>
<a name="60201-37_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The proposed amendments relate to a clause that sets out the requirements relating to the share capital that a private company must have if it is to re-register as a public company. The clause, which is substantively the same as the existing provision, provides for a minimum monetary value for the share capital and specifies that each share must be paid up to a particular fraction of its nominal value. Those two variables are the subject of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson.
</p>

<a name="60201-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_76"></a>The existing Companies Act provides that the two variables&#151;the minimum monetary value and the paid-up fraction&#151;are &#163;50,000 and one quarter respectively. That was acknowledged. The Second Company Law Directive on Capital Maintenance obliges us to retain the requirement for a minimum allotted share capital of at least &#8364;25,000&#151;about &#163;17,000&#151;with each share being paid up at least to one-quarter of its nominal value.
</p>

<a name="60201-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_77"></a>The Company Law Review consulted on whether the level of the minimum allotted share capital should be maintained, increased or reduced. It noted that, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC134"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC134</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

although the original purpose of many of the capital maintenance rules was to protect creditors by preventing companies dissipating funds subscribed for shares, today major creditors attach relatively little importance to the amount of a company&#039;s share capital compared with other indicators of its creditworthiness.
</p>

<a name="60201-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_78"></a>The Company Law Review received 29 responses to its consultation. Of those, six argued for an increase, five for a decrease, two had no opinion and, most significantly, 16 respondents believed that the minimum allotted share capital should be maintained at its present level. Consequently, the CLR recommended that the paid-up minimum allotted share capital of a private company that wishes to re-register as a public company should be maintained at its current level. We agree. We believe that the current level strikes the right balance between, on the one hand, the benefits of public company status and, on the other, the check that is required to minimise the misuse of this vehicle.

<a name="60201-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. Clearly, nowadays paid-up share capital is not of great concern to major creditors and, in a way, has only symbolic value. But, in my view, to say that we are achieving the right balance in the appearance of a public company with paid-up capital of &#163;12,500 defies belief. But there we are.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_57"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 95 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 96. The amendments relate to Clause 91, entitled &quot;Requirements as to share capital&quot;. This is a probing amendment about changes in the relative positions of previous Companies Acts.
</p>

<a name="60201-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_81"></a>Section 47(3) of the Companies Act 1985, which is the corresponding section, did not require the provision of paragraph (b) in this clause. Therefore, the registrar did not need to rely on the supporting evidence in that paragraph; for example, a solvency statement, an order of the court, or a reduction made under Section 582. The table of derivations claims that this clause makes no substantial change from Section 47(3) of the Companies Act 1985, but it seems to us that the above changes are quite substantial. It would be helpful to have on the record the Minister&#039;s comments on why that has happened. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_58"></a>
<a name="60201-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The amendments remove subsection (5)(b) of Clause 91. The subsection provides that the registrar must not re-register a company as public if certain conditions, related to a proposed reduction in share capital, are satisfied with the effect that the nominal value of the company&#039;s share capital is below the authorised minimum. We <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC135"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC135</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

acknowledge that the reason for the inclusion of subsection (5)(b) is not readily apparent, but it does serve two purposes. First, it provides clarity as it specifies the mechanisms by which a private company might legitimately reduce its share capital, and, secondly, and more importantly, it provides that in certain exceptional circumstances the law will function correctly.
</p>

<a name="60201-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_82"></a>It is easiest to illustrate those circumstances by way of a slightly contrived example. Let us imagine that a private company resolves on day one to reduce its share capital to a level where the nominal value of its allotted share capital is below the authorised minimum. For the reduction to take effect, various documents&#151;notably the solvency statement&#151;must be filed with the registrar. On day two, the circumstances of the company change, for whatever reason, and the company now decides that it does not want to reduce its share capital but instead wishes to re-register as a public company, and therefore, it does not wish to file the solvency statement with the registrar. Without subsection (5)(b), the company would find itself in a cleft stick. Although it had not reduced, and was not going to reduce, the nominal value of its share capital below the authorised minimum, because it had initially resolved to do so&#151;the resolution would be on the file&#151;the registrar would have no choice but to block the re-registration, notwithstanding that the company may have resolved to reverse that decision.
</p>

<a name="60201-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_83"></a>Subsection (5)(b) provides that, unless the resolution to reduce share capital is supported by the documentation necessary to effect the reduction, the resolution can be disregarded by the registrar when deciding whether to permit the re-registration of the company. To put it another way, the subsection ensures that, in the circumstances that I have just described, the registrar will not be required to block a legitimate request to re-register a private company as a public company. For those reasons we resist the adoption of the amendment. I hope that helps to clarify the position.

<p><a name="gc_st_61"></a>The noble Lord said: The question that has been raised with us, and on which we seek the Government&#039;s view, is the need for Clause 92(1)(c). It requires a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC136"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC136</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

company to have a written statement from its auditor that the balance sheet amount at that date is not less than the aggregate of its called-up share capital and undistributable reserves. We accept that this is not a new provision, as it comes from Section 43(3)(b) of the Companies Act 1985. However, we are told that it prevents many companies re-registering as plcs, which they would need to do if they wished to make an offer to the public.  In practice, we understand, that problem is overcome by forming a new plc and for that new company to acquire, normally by a share swap, all the shares in the existing company. That creates work and expense and achieves nothing. The amendment would remove that requirement which, in practice, often is only fulfilled by the artificial device that I have just described. Therefore, we question its value. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_62"></a>
<a name="60201-38_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The purpose of Clause 92 is to ensure that when a private company re-registers as a public company, its allotted share capital is backed up by assets. The most important part of Clause 92(1)(c) provides that the company&#039;s auditor make a written statement that, in his opinion, the company&#039;s net assets are not less than the aggregate of its called-up share capital and undistributable profits. When we discussed the amendments proposed to Clause 91, which covers requirements as to share capital, I said that the provision struck the right balance between the benefits of the public company status and the check required to minimise the misuse of this vehicle. The amendment would nullify that check, as a company could state that it fulfilled the requirements as to share capital without having to provide any evidence to support this claim.
</p>

<a name="60201-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_88"></a>I had thought that the amendment argued that if Clause 92(1)(b) was satisfied&#151;that an unqualified report by the company&#039;s auditor be obtained&#151;paragraph (c) was an unnecessary duplication. If it is just duplication, it is hardly a material duplication. But if that is a point of substance, whereby the balance sheet would not readily answer the question about net assets, it is important that the provision exists.
</p>

<a name="60201-38_para10"></a>

<p><a name="gc_st_63"></a>
<a name="60201-38_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I thank the Minister. The purpose of the amendment was not to argue that Clause 92(1)(c) could not be important but that it could easily be circumvented by this device. If it can so easily be circumvented by the creation of the new plc, what does it achieve other than cluttering up the Bill? This is a technical matter. We shall not ask the Minister to return to it this afternoon, but we will take advice from practitioners and perhaps seek to persuade him at a later stage that the provision is superfluous.

<p><a name="gc_st_68"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 100 and 101. We discussed earlier some of the issues relating to the registration of company secretaries under the Bill. The Bill proceeds on the basis that the office of company secretary is a requirement for public companies, but not for private companies.
</p>

<a name="60201-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>The amendments address the situation where a private company re-registers as public. In these circumstances, details of the person who is to be, or continues to be, company secretary ought to be disclosed to the registrar.
</p>

<a name="60201-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_97"></a>In the light of this, the amendments clarify what needs to be done by the company. The amendment to Clause 94 provides that where a company re-registers from private to public, the company must in all cases provide a statement of its proposed secretary, since it is a condition of being a public company that a company has a secretary and that their appointment is notified to the registrar. This is the case even if the company had appointed a company secretary in its previous life as a private company, as the appointment of the previously appointed secretary would not have been notified to the registrar.
</p>

<a name="60201-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_98"></a>The amendment to Clause 95 will remove any doubt that where a company had appointed a secretary in its previous life as a private company, the statement of the proposed secretary on re-registration reflects that this secretary continues to be the secretary.
</p>

<a name="60201-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_99"></a>The amendment to Clause 96 provides that on the issue of the certificate of re-registration, any person nominated as company secretary in the statement is deemed to have been appointed or reappointed to that office, reflecting the fact that a private company may previously have appointed a company secretary, but that under the Bill, where such an appointment is not obligatory, it may not have done so. I hope that that is clear to noble Lords. I beg to move.

I am delighted to remove things from the Bill, but that provision seemed part of the clause&#039;s purpose.

<p><a name="gc_st_78"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment would make it clear that, if all or a sufficient number of the members voted in favour of the resolution to re-register, so that there were insufficient dissenting members to make an application under Clause 98&#151;normally 95 per cent in favour&#151;there would be no need for the registrar to wait until the 28-day period had expired, which is provided under subsection (2) of Clause 98, headed &quot;Application to court to cancel resolution&quot;.

<a name="60201-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_111"></a>      Clause 97 addresses the situation in which a public company changes its status to a private limited company by re-registering as such. Subsection (2)(a) states that one condition that must be satisfied before a public company can be re-registered as a private company is that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_26"></a>&quot;the period during which an application for cancellation of the resolution under section 98 may be made has expired without any such application having been made&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<a name="60201-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_112"></a>We are told that, often, enough members vote in favour of a special resolution to leave an insufficient number of potential dissensions to make an application for cancellation. In practice, the registrar allows the re-registration to proceed in such cases, without waiting the 28 days allowed for making the application. But it would be helpful if that could be enshrined in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60201-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_113"></a>Conversely, if there is a possibility that an application may be made because of a sufficient number of dissentient members, the registrar has in the past tended to wait for a further period, typically 28 days, after the end of the period for making the application to ensure that no application has been made within the period, in spite of the obligation imposed on the company to give the registrar notice of any application immediately under Clause 99(1). This adds considerably to the time taken to achieve re-registration. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that, in view of the wording of Clause 97(2)(a), this practice will cease in future. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_79"></a>
<a name="60201-39_spnew9"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Where a company changes its status from a public to a private limited company there can be important implications for the shareholders. Such a re-registration may, for example, affect the marketability and transferability of a company&#039;s shares. Where such an application for re-registration is made, it is clearly right that there should be stringent conditions as to the consent of the shareholders before this happens. This serves to protect minority shareholders. The Bill, like the 1985 Act, provides this, along with a mechanism for a dissentient minority to appeal, so to speak, if they believe that the conditions have not in fact been met. Twenty-eight days are allowed for any dissentient minority to apply to the court to cancel the resolution for re-registration, and the question is what action, if any, the registrar should take during this period to register the change formally.
</p>

<a name="60201-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_114"></a>While on the face of it, it may appear that the notice period could be waived if certain conditions are met&#151;for example, if it appears that the shareholders have given their unanimous consent&#151;it is not difficult to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC140"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC140</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

think of reasons why such a practice might produce unfortunate results. There is a possibility that a company may mislead the registrar and the proposed change might allow an unscrupulous director to rush the re-registration process through, to the disadvantage of minority shareholders. More commonly, it is not unheard of for companies to make mistakes when filing documents with the registrar. It would, therefore, be wrong to waive the notice period unless sufficient safeguards are in place. I have, however, listened to what the noble Lord has said and will reflect upon this further, not least in the light of the present practice of the registrar in this area, to which he has referred. I will come back on this matter.

<p><a name="gc_st_83"></a>The noble Lord said: We are moving through Part 7, which deals with re-registration. Here we come to the re-registration of private limited companies as unlimited. Clause 102(2) prohibits a company re-registering as an unlimited company if it has previously been a limited company, having previously been unlimited, or, an unlimited company, having previously been limited. We do not see the purpose behind this prohibition. Why should companies not be able to register as unlimited in such situations? There do not seem to be any good reasons why a company cannot change its status more than once. We are for achieving and maintaining maximum flexibility. This amendment removes the prohibition and enhances flexibility. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_84"></a>
<a name="60201-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The amendment would remove subsection (2), which prevents companies changing their status successively from limited to unlimited and back again. The Bill reflects existing companies legislation in preventing this practice, and the Company Law Review considered carefully whether the bar should be maintained or removed. It <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC141"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC141</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

concluded that it should be retained to prevent companies taking short-term advantage of a merely temporary change of status. The Company Law Review does not seem to have believed that this has placed any obstacle in the way of legitimate market developments; nor are the Government aware of any evidence to that effect. I therefore support the CLR&#039;s conclusion that the bar should remain.
</p>

<a name="60201-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_122"></a>I should add that we are currently considering whether the condition in Clause 102(2)(b), which prevents a company beginning life as limited, re-registering as unlimited, then re-registering as limited and finally re-registering as unlimited again, is strictly necessary given that Clause 105(2) prevents a limited company which has re-registered as unlimited reverting to limited status. These highly technical issues are complicated by the need to consider possible multiple re-registrations under earlier legislation. We are considering whether any change is needed.
</p>

<a name="60201-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_123"></a>As to the potential mischief that the subsection is designed to prevent, in some areas regulation of unlimited companies is less strict than for limited companies&#151;for example, unlimited companies are exempt from the requirement to file annual accounts and reports with the registrar&#151;reflecting the lesser need for third-party protections, given the unlimited liability of the members. I understand that the Company Law Review was influenced in reaching its conclusion by the possibility, however remote, that in some circumstances companies might change their status to unlimited to take momentary advantage of this less stringent regulation before reverting to limited status.

<p><a name="gc_st_87"></a>The noble Lord said: Subsection (4) makes allowance for companies to act in situations where a member of the company is bankrupt or deceased. That is obviously important. However, it makes no provision for someone of unsound mind. The amendment seeks to rectify the omission by allowing the Master of the Court of Protection, acting for a member of the company, to assent to a company becoming unlimited. I can see no reason why provision should not be made for that eventuality.

company re-registers as unlimited. It makes specific provision for situations where a member has died or become bankrupt but not where a member has become mentally incapable. I am very grateful for the noble Lord&#039;s suggestion that we should add the Master of the Court of Protection to the clause, thus making some explicit provision in the latter case. However, I am not persuaded that that is necessary.
</p>

<a name="60201-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_125"></a>There is a fundamental difference between, on the one hand, death and bankruptcy, which change ownership, and, on the other, incapacity, which does not. In the latter case, someone is appointed to act on behalf of the person who is incapable. In making a distinction between these cases, the Bill reflects the position not only under previous Companies Acts but also, I understand, under other not dissimilar legislation, and I do not think it would be helpful to make a change here. The important point is that people who are incapacitated should have opportunities for shares to be voted so that, if necessary, all the members can participate.

The re-registration of a public company as a private limited company comes under Clause 97, while the application and accompanying documents are covered in Clause 100.

The subsection which would be removed by the amendment includes the important substantive requirement that where the assent is provided in electronic form, it must be authenticated.

We are not objecting to that, but our reason for striking them out here was to see why the provision was not in the other clauses.

</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_110"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment. It concerns subsection (4) of Clause 113, on the register of members. It raises two issues. The first is to question the Minister about the meaning of the word &quot;member&quot;. My understanding was that only a shareholder could be classed as a member of a company and that stockholders were not classed as members. However, Clause 113(4) seems to suggest that a stockholder is classed as a member and would, therefore, be entitled to all members&#039; rights. I hope that the Minister can give some guidance in this area. It may be that my precise knowledge of the definition of the word &quot;stock&quot; is faulty.
</p>

<a name="60201-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_151"></a>The second point is to consider the implications for convertible stock, as that is a form of security&#151;at least in my experience when the word &quot;stock&quot; is now used most frequently. We attempted to track this through the Companies Act 1985 without much success. Therefore, I hope that the huge resources available to the Minister will be able to provide us with enlightenment tonight. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_111"></a>
<a name="60201-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The amendment would delete subsection (4) from Clause 113 and thus remove the obligation on the company to enter in the register of members details of the amount and class of stock where shares have been converted to stock. The power to convert shares into stock is to be repealed under the Bill. This means that the requirement for the register to provide the information required under subsection (4) will apply only to conversions effected prior to that repeal. Since the 1948 Act removed the practical advantages to conversion, it has rarely taken place over the past 50 years. So we are not talking about an onerous obligation to enter information into the register of members, but we are talking about whether information that is already recorded should continue to be held.
</p>

<a name="60201-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_152"></a>For companies limited by shares, the register of members also includes information on each member&#039;s shareholding. That is essential as, depending on the company&#039;s articles, it determines each member&#039;s voting power and entitlements. Where shares have been converted into stock, it makes sense to require the register to be updated to reflect that fact, as it is arguably misleading for the register to continue to record the member as holding shares when he does not. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC147"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Subsection (4) continues to be needed as the information is evidence of the voting rights of the members in question.
</p>

<a name="60201-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_153"></a>I am confident that the affected companies would continue to keep the information even if it were not required but, if this subsection were deleted, information about stock conversion would have a different status under the Data Protection Act from the information required by this clause. It is arguable that even without subsection (4) this information would be required to be entered in the register in any event because the definition of &quot;shares&quot; in Section 744 of the Companies Act 1985&#151;which applies for the purposes of the Bill&#151;includes stock, so the noble Lord&#039;s deletion would not achieve its intended purpose. Notwithstanding that, we regard it as helpful to companies to state expressly the extent of their obligations in this regard. Only fully paid shares can be converted into stock, so one has to be a member before one becomes a stockholder. The current Act merely requires the register to be updated to reflect that.

<a name="60201-42_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. This is a probing amendment to try to discern the gravity of what we had on subsection (4).

</p>

<a name="60201-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_154"></a>I am still not clear as to the exact meaning of &quot;stock&quot;. It may be an old term but we were trying to elucidate the underlying purpose here. I understood what &quot;shares&quot; and &quot;convertible stock&quot; meant, but not what &quot;stock&quot; meant when it stood on its own. When I talked to company law experts, they were not always clear about what it meant. If the Minister has a note, it would be helpful if he could put something on the record now.

<p><a name="gc_st_113"></a>
<a name="60201-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   I would be delighted to do so, although I am not certain that it would carry this debate forward to any great extent.

</p>

<a name="60201-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_155"></a>The difference between shares and stocks is that stock is said to have two advantages over shares. First, it is possible to deal in fractions of stock but it is not possible to deal in fractions of shares. However, this advantage is more theoretical than real. If the price of a share is regarded by the market as too high for dealings, the shares may be sub-divided into new shares with lower par values than those which they replace instead of converting the shares into stock. The second advantage is that stock does not have to be numbered. However, where all the issued shares of a class are fully paid, such shares do not require a distinguishing number. This relaxation of the rule was introduced in the Companies Act 1948. As it is uncommon for shares to be issued on a partly paid basis, that means that advantage can normally be <br>&nbsp;<br>

Up to 100 members&#151;and, for that matter, perhaps more than 100&#151;could easily be examined by an ordinary shareholder without needing an index. It may be only a small piece of deregulation but we seek the Government&#039;s view on this small step. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_117"></a>
<a name="60201-42_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Amendment No. 115 would remove the requirement for an index of members for companies with between 50 and 100 members whose registers are not themselves an index. Fifty members has always been the trigger for an index where the register is kept in a bound book. The amendment would require a company to keep an index only where it had more than 100 members, but I very much doubt whether many companies with more than 50 members do not currently keep their register of members electronically in a form that exempts them from the requirement to keep an index. So we consider that the noble Lord&#039;s amendment would not have a practical impact for most companies.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_163"></a>At present, Clause 116 retains the good principle of the rights of inspection of the register and the provision of copies. I assume that the new powers to refuse access have been inserted to protect members from the predations of fanatics and serious nuisances, yet I think that they may unwittingly create difficulties for those with a legitimate interest in knowing who the members are. My amendments are designed to ensure that the new restrictions added in subsections (3) to (5) of Clause 116 do not unwittingly allow a company to delay, stall or refuse access to the register when access is required for a legitimate purpose but one which the company may not be too keen to support.

<a name="60201-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_164"></a>For example, it is not uncommon that a shareholder can come across disquieting information that he or she may wish to share with other shareholders and alert them to a particular set of facts or circumstances before the AGM in order to influence and gather support for a point of view. It is often also the case that shareholders&#039; support organisations want to bring certain relevant matters to the attention of shareholders. I can remember them doing exactly that to me as an investor in a particular venture capital trust, and I was very grateful for it.
</p>

<a name="60201-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_165"></a>Under these new regulations, a reluctant company could stall or delay access to the information and stifle legitimate debate simply by announcing that it was referring the matter for an opinion to the court, knowing well that it was likely perhaps that the court would support access. But by then the AGM would be over and the matter stitched up. They also allow courts to narrow down what &quot;proper purposes&quot; might be. So I believe we need much stronger support for a wide range of proper purposes and an ability to prevent access for those purposes which are clearly improper, hence the inclusion in the amendments of a suggested definition of &quot;improper&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60201-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_166"></a>The threat to refer the matter to the courts would deter shareholders&#039; requests for access unless they had very deep pockets. The cost of legal representation would be prohibitive for most individuals and even most shareholder organisations or groups. In addition, the way the Bill is worded, if the application is rejected by the court then the applicant has to pay the company&#039;s costs. So even the slightest risk of losing would doubly deter people. A lack of certainty about what is or is not a proper purpose is unhelpful. I beg to move.

perfect way for people to get around this obstacle&#151;for good or bad purpose&#151;is to apply to Companies House for the register of members that is available there. If an improper purpose was found, how would that be dealt with in relation to access to Companies House records, which could provide a loophole for people who had malice aforethought? I very much support the thrust of the noble Baroness&#039;s remarks.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_122"></a>
<a name="60201-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   If the noble Baroness agrees, I should like to take together her proposed amendments to this clause. We believe that there is a need for changed laws so that there are circumstances in which companies may be relieved of the obligation to allow public access to the register of members. The Bill provides that a company may apply to the court for relief and that the court shall grant it, provided only that it is satisfied that the inspection or copy is not sought for a proper purpose. Obviously this is a less restrictive test than that contained in Amendments Nos. 116 and 117, which is that the court must be satisfied that it is sought for an improper purpose.
</p>

<a name="60201-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_168"></a>Amendment No. 118 provides a definition of &quot;improper purpose&quot;. A definition of either &quot;proper purpose&quot; or &quot;improper purpose&quot; could give rise to unintended loopholes or scams to get around the measure. We therefore consider that what is a proper purpose in this context is a matter best left to the courts to determine.
</p>

<a name="60201-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_169"></a>In Amendment No. 118, the noble Baroness&#039;s first example of an improper purpose is uncontroversial, but the second does not, I consider, achieve her purpose. The promotion of widgets is not, I believe, a proper purpose for permitting access to the register of members of a company manufacturing widgets, and yet, under the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment, the court would have no discretion to relieve the company from its obligation to permit access to an applicant wishing to use the register as a mailing list to promote such widgets.
</p>

<a name="60201-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_170"></a>There is not much room for disagreement on this point. The courts and everyone else are clear that there is not a problem in regard to the governance of a company. People such as animal rights extremists and others are clearly using the register of members for improper purposes, but the kind of situations referred to by the noble Baroness are clearly concerned with the governance of a company, and that is not at all in debate. We intend to introduce regulations to change the requirements for the annual return to include the register of members.

Perhaps I can take away the Minister&#039;s response and think about it. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(3)   An entry relating to a former member of the company may be removed from the register, or from the separate register of former members, after the expiration of five years from the date on which he ceased to be a member.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_125"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 119, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 121 and propose that Clause 118 should not stand part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60201-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_175"></a>Amendment No. 119 seeks to insert a new clause entitled &quot;Entries relating to former members&quot;, to give credence or legal status to paragraph 11.40 of the Company Law Review final report, which recommended that a company should be permitted to keep entries relating to former members on a separate register from that for current members. We find it hard to see why the Government have not followed this recommendation. The absence of such a power has been used by hard-nosed researchers as a means of pressurising companies to provide analysis of and information from their registers of members, which they are not strictly required to do by the existing Companies Acts. Accepting this recommendation and introducing the new clause would also provide greater privacy for those no longer involved in the company. Once a person has realised his investment in the company, there is surely no reason why the fact that he was once a shareholder should be a matter of public record.
</p>

<a name="60201-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_176"></a>Although the recommendation of the report was to keep the period for which records must be held the same as currently in the Bill&#151;I think under the Companies Act 1985 it is longer; it is 20 years&#151;our amendment also reduces the length of time that the entries relating to former members must be kept from 10 years to five years. It seems to us that 10 years is an unduly long time for companies to have to keep these entries and that some deregulation and cost savings could be achieved by reducing this period without any real risk.
</p>

<a name="60201-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_177"></a>Amendment No. 121 merely seeks to reduce the period for which records relating to former members must be kept. We offer it as an alternative approach if the Government are not prepared to accept our more radical redrafting of a new clause.
</p>

<a name="60201-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_178"></a>As to Clause 118 stand part, if the Government are minded to accept the approach we are proposing, the clause will be redundant and we would seek its removal. But, in the first instance, I beg to move.

<a name="column_GC152"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC152</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The amendment is identical to Amendment No. 119 in all but one word: in Amendment No. 119 the word is &quot;five&quot; and in Amendment No. 120 the word is &quot;ten&quot;. I endorse entirely all of the arguments made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. We have not got an alternative measure; this is our preferred method. I am totally supportive of his arguments.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_127"></a>
<a name="60201-43_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The first two subsections of new Clause 117 contained in Amendments Nos. 119 and 120 are identical. They would make explicit that the details of former members may be kept separate from those of current members. This is unnecessary as Clause 743 gives companies freedom to arrange their records in such manner as they wish provided only that the information in question is adequately recorded for future reference. This would therefore permit companies to maintain a separate register containing entries relating to former members. This should significantly reduce the cost of keeping registers of members.
</p>

<a name="60201-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_179"></a>As to the third subsection, Amendments Nos. 119 and 120 differ significantly. Amendment No. 119 would reduce the period for which details of former members must be kept to five years. As the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said, the present requirement is to keep the details of former members for 20 years. I think we can all agree with the Company Law Review that this period is longer than needed, but the period needs to be consistent with the time limit for claims arising from errors in the register. Clause 125 sets this limit at 10 years because that is the long-stop limitation period for claims for a remedy for a wrong recommended by the Law Commission in its 2001 report on limitation of actions. Amendment No. 120 proposes that the period should be 10 years, and that is what Clause 118 of the Bill provides.

</p>

<a name="60201-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_192"></a>A great deal of legal drafting is expended on Clause 120 and the single-member company. The issue of why such companies should be treated differently from other companies has been raised with us and, in particular, why it is necessary to produce a statement. If you have a one-member company it becomes pretty clear when it is altering its status because you have one member. I suspect the Minister will tell me that this is to do with the EU directive, but it seems to be taking a sledgehammer to crack a rather small nut. We have therefore initiated this stand part debate to get on the record the Government&#039;s views on the value of this extremely lengthy clause on a series of events which seem self-evident.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_200"></a>This chapter deals with the prohibition on subsidiaries being members&#151;that is, shareholders&#151;of their holding companies, a policy which, in general terms, we support. However, Clause 128 makes provision to allow subsidiary corporate bodies who became shareholders in their parent company before the prohibition came into effect to remain as members. The relevant dates for this exclusion from the prohibition are in 1948 in Great Britain and in 1961 in Northern Ireland&#151;58 and 45 years ago respectively.
</p>

<a name="60201-44_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_201"></a>We wonder how many companies there now are taking advantage of this provision. Further, it could be argued that this handful of companies have had sufficient warning that this prohibition is in effect.

<a name="60201-44_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   This explanation will be a short journey into company legal history. The clauses in this chapter restate Section 23 of the 1985 Act and the related schedule. There is no change of substance, nor has there been any pressure for change.
</p>

<a name="60201-44_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_203"></a>The statutory prohibition on a subsidiary being a member of its holding company, which reinforces a longstanding common law rule that a company cannot be a member of itself, was enacted in Section 23 of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC155"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC155</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Companies Act 1948. That provision was introduced on 1 July 1948, hence the reference to that date in both the existing Section 23 and this clause.
</p>

<a name="60201-44_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_204"></a>The effect of the clause as drafted, which again restates the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, is that where a company acquired shares in its holding company prior to that date and the related date for the introduction of the prohibition in Northern Ireland, it is not subject to the ban in Clause 127 and may continue to be a member of that holding company, but it may not vote in respect of the shares at class or general meetings of the holding company.
</p>

<a name="60201-44_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_205"></a>If the amendment were accepted, the right of a subsidiary to continue to be a member of its holding company would apply where the subsidiary acquired the shares before the commencement of this chapter of the Bill, which would cover shares acquired before 1 July 1948, but only if the shares were acquired in circumstances in which the prohibition in Section 23 of the Companies Act 1985 or its predecessor, Section 27 of the Companies Act 1948, did not apply. Clearly, the ban in Section 27 of the 1948 Act could apply only from its commencement&#151;1 July 1948&#151;so it leaves open the question of what is to happen to shares acquired before the ban was introduced. Are subsidiary companies permitted to continue as members or not?
</p>

<a name="60201-44_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_206"></a>We consider that the current drafting renders the position relating to such shares clear so that subsidiary companies may continue as members of the company, subject to the curtailment of their rights to vote in respect of them. This is the current position and we are not aware that there has been any doubt or controversy surrounding it. We do not know the number of companies covered by this requirement.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_213"></a>The clause&#039;s title appears to us to be unusual. &quot;Authorised dealer in securities&quot; was a title given to those firms which, before the Financial Services Act 1986 received their authorisation direct from the DTI under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958. I have looked through the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, but have not found clarity about an up-to-date definition of &quot;authorised dealer in securities&quot;. It would be helpful if the Minister told us a little about how that has been brought up to date in modern legislation.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_214"></a>On the clause itself, while I understand that there can be a need for a subsidiary to hold shares in its parent company, as allowed in subsections (2)(a) and (b), the prohibition introduced by subsection (2)(c) seems difficult to understand. In this connection, the provisions of subsections (3)(a) and (c) are particularly perplexing. With regard to subsection (3)(c), for example, does the clause prohibit a company such as the investment management division of a quoted investment bank from investing its clients&#039; money in the shares of the parent? My reading of this suggests that that is the case. If so, why should this be?
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_215"></a>Subsection (3)(c) refers to a business that consists in insurance business. Despite the definition in subsection (4)(d), that wording seems unusual. It may be that there are so many double negatives in the clause that I have failed to gather properly its sense and meaning. But the advice we have had does not seem to make the clause any less opaque. I hope that the Minister will be able to shed some light on the way the clause operates, as it has baffled me and a good many lawyers to whom we have spoken.

<p><a name="gc_st_142"></a>
<a name="60201-45_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   This clause retains an existing exemption to the general prohibition, retained in Clause 127, on a company owning shares in its own holding company. The exemption is in the circumstance that the shares are held by the subsidiary in the ordinary course of its business as a dealer in securities. The intention is to ensure that intermediaries who deal in securities, as defined, are not inhibited from dealing in the course of business by the general prohibition on a subsidiary holding share in its own holding company.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_216"></a>I am not certain that I can take the noble Lord by the hand and guide him exactly through this clause, but perhaps I can tell him about its historical origins. Most of this clause dates back to 1997, when the provisions were substituted by the Companies (Membership of Holding Company) (Dealers in Securities) Regulations 1997&#151;Statutory Instrument 1007/2306. The exception is subsection 3(BA), which was a consequential amendment made following the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Arguably, the title &quot;authorised dealer in securities&quot; is misleading. The clause is self-standing and I do not think that it is dependent on the Financial Services and Markets Act definition.

<p><a name="gc_st_146"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to Part 9, which is entitled &quot;Exercise of Members&#039; Rights&quot;, and it contains some very important issues. In moving Amendment No. 130, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 132. Both amendments concern Clause 136 on the enjoyment or exercise of members&#039; rights. As this is an important issue, I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I speak at slightly greater length than I have to the fairly rat-a-tat series of amendments that we have had today and earlier this week. I am extremely grateful for the noble Baroness&#039;s support on this matter and I am grateful, too, for the slightly more guarded support from the Liberal Democrat Benches.

<a name="60201-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_222"></a>I made it clear in my remarks at Second Reading that we did not find the present proposal in the Bill persuasive. We argued that there should be a link between the person who has chosen directly and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC158"></a>

individually to invest in a particular company&#039;s shares and the company itself. We further argue that the increasing modern practice of holding shares in the name of a nominee holding&#151;not the name of the individual&#151;puts this link at risk. Finally, we argue that that is not a good development if one seeks a vibrant, participative public financial market.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_223"></a>In that connection, our concerns about the provisions of Part 9 as currently drafted have been supported by a number of interested parties: the UK Share Association, the Share Centre and the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers (APCIMS). These amendments impose on companies that trade on a regulated market&#151;note we use the phrase &quot;regulated market&quot;&#151;the requirement to give effect to members&#039; rights where the shares are held in nominee accounts, such as those of ISA managers, stockbrokers or investment managers.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_224"></a>As it currently stands, the Bill relies on the voluntary support of companies to change their articles to support enfranchisement of nominee shareholders in full. However, from the responses by a number of parties, it is clear that many companies are unenthusiastic about implementing such enfranchisement, primarily based on concerns of cost, despite the financial savings that will arise in the use of electronic communications with their shareholders, as will be allowed in other parts of the Bill. APCIMS has indicated to us that out of 10 million individual shareholdings, 80 per cent are now in nominee names and only 20 per cent are certificated to the individual in question.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_225"></a>Currently, the Bill contains reserve powers in Clause 137 to enable the Secretary of State to compel companies to provide information but only to shareholders in nominee accounts. As far as we can see, there appears to be no power to compel the provision of voting or other rights. It must be argued, and should be argued, that full shareholder enfranchisement requires much more than the simple provision of information to shareholders. In reality such information is often freely available. Even if, and when brought into operation by the Secretary of State, the existing wording of the Bill would, at best, provide little extra benefit to shareholders. They really need to be enfranchised and that has not been guaranteed at all.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_226"></a>In addition, to be effective, those who operate nominee names must support those companies that have selected to enfranchise their nominee shareholders. If they are not willing to supply the names and addresses of their nominee shareholders to the companies and their registrars, the companies cannot send them the information. Similarly, nominees must be required either to have to vote on behalf of the shareholders, having ascertained their wishes, or to pass those voting rights on to the individual shareholders in question. There is no compulsion for nominee managers to do any of those things under the Bill and it is clear that many see no need to do so or have objections to doing so on the grounds of cost.

</p>

<a name="60201-45_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_227"></a>In practice, with this level of commitment from many companies and from many members of the financial community, implementation of shareholders&#039; enfranchisement will be patchy at best. Individual shareholders may find that if they hold a number of shares in a nominee account portfolio, only some of them may provide enfranchisement and it may not even be easy with the Bill as currently drafted for the shareholders to determine which ones are doing so. Simply on the grounds of practicality and clarity for shareholders, the Bill needs significant revision along the lines of the amendments that we have tabled this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_228"></a>I argue that if a company has taken an investor&#039;s money and accepts responsibility for it, it should have to account to that investor as a full member of the company. With more and more investments being held in nominee names, we are in danger of companies being able to take investors&#039; money and not having to communicate directly to the shareholders at all. Surely that is not the basis on which our company law was built.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_229"></a>I fully accept that many shareholders are not interested in the progress of their investee companies and are irritated by the flow of paper that they receive. That is a double whammy. Companies produce and mail extensive and expensive information to thousands of shareholders, many of whom put the whole package straight into the wastepaper basket.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_230"></a>Where would a possible solution lie? The system in Canada seems worthy of consideration. Under that system, shareholders must be told annually of their entitlement to members&#039; rights and asked whether they wish to opt into the system. Those who do not so wish need not reply and the next they will hear from the company will be in a further year&#039;s time, reminding them again of their right to opt in if they so wish. For those who do wish to opt in, which may well be a minority, they can do so and receive the enfranchisement that their money has earned them. I really do not see any significant downside to that system, which seems both fair and workable.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_231"></a> Good practice is beginning to emerge already in this country, so I do not wish to be unduly critical of companies or their nominees. Only this week, I received a really interesting communication from GlaxoSmithKline. It is worth just showing how the system is moving towards what seek from that example. The letter tells me that I shall be sent a copy of the annual review, because, as the letter says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_49"></a>&quot;We believe that the annual review better suits the needs of most shareholders, as well as saving money and avoiding waste of natural resources&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-45_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_232"></a>It explains that the annual review will be sent to me at the end of March. It also says that, if I prefer, I may elect to receive it electronically&#151;and I have been given the details of how I may receive it in that way.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para26"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_233"></a>The letter then lays out what is in the annual review, including the details of the directors, the summary financial statements and the responsibility statements. It goes on to tell me that it will also contain statements from the auditors and that the auditors will confirm <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC160"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC160</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that the summary financial statements are consistent with the full annual report. It warns me that the summary financial statements will be an overview document and will not contain all the information to allow me a full understanding of the results. It then invites me to accept the annual review, if I wish, or to fill in a tear-off slip to get the full annual report. That sort of thing already goes halfway toward the system that we should like to see emerge; all that we need to add to it is the opportunity for people to receive their enfranchisement in this way and for it to be an annual mailing, not just a once-off mailing. The letter says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_50"></a>&quot;Our records show you have become a shareholder of the company since the publication of last year&#039;s annual review&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60201-45_para27"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_234"></a>We have gone a long way down the road. It only requires the Government in this Bill to give shape and purpose to the whole area.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para28"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_235"></a>The amendments that I have tabled will not require all companies to enfranchise their nominee shareholders&#151;simply those companies whose shares are traded on a regulated market. That will limit the cost effect on any companies that are small and untraded, while enfranchising the nominee shareholders of listed companies. That will provide much greater clarity as to which companies offer members&#039; rights and which do not. These amendments do not, however, force nominees to provide the service; the pressure is on the company.
</p>

<a name="60201-45_para29"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_236"></a>I fully accept that the amendments are almost certainly not the finished article and will need refining. However, I hope that they lay out adequately the point of principle that I am driving at. I hope that the Minister accepts our amendments, if not in this form, certainly in principle, with a view to tabling a government amendment at a later date to give effect to it. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_148"></a>The noble Lord said: I have tabled this amendment to make the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, more amenable to acceptance by the corporate sector. We are talking about an issue known as dematerialisation, a process by which shares are no longer issued to all shareholders in certificated form, but electronically. Although, as the noble Lord said, some 80 per cent of shares traded are traded in electronic form, a recent survey concluded that only between 3 per cent and 10 per cent of shareholders would respond to rights that were not automatically granted when their shareholding was dematerialised. So you could conclude that there would not be a vast increase in cost if this was all done by mailing.
</p>

<a name="60201-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_237"></a>However, the Bill also enables companies to default to electronic means of communication with their shareholders, with all the significant savings that that engages. The best way in which to serve the ordinary investor would be to link the take-up of electronic communication with the obligation to enfranchise dematerialised shareholders. That is the sole purpose <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60201-46_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Murphy: </b>   I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, and have nothing further to add to his very eloquent speech. I remind Ministers that 40 per cent of all shareholding is in nominee shareholder accounts. The Government have gone out of their way to encourage us all to invest in wonderful PEPs and ISAs, and savings are sewn up like that; but we have no rights to exercise in those shareholdings at all. So I very much support what was said in that regard.
</p>

<a name="60201-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_238"></a> My Amendments Nos. 133 and 134 are in a different grouping, but they relate to the same clause and go to the same purpose.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_150"></a>
<a name="60201-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that this is a very important part of the Bill. Clause 136 is part of a package of measures designed to encourage the enfranchisement of indirect investors. These include provisions that enhance the ability of proxies to exercise full meeting participation rights, in Clause 299, provisions to encourage voting transparency, in Clause 316, and provisions to improve accessibility to company information, such as annual reports and accounts, in Clause 406.
</p>

<a name="60201-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_239"></a>The amendment to Clause 136 moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, supported by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, seek to compel all companies trading on a regulated market&#151;that is, quoted companies&#151;to recognise any person nominated by the registered member to enjoy or exercise all rights of the member. The amendment to those amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, takes a different approach; when a company passes a resolution to use electronic communications with its members, the company is compelled to recognise indirect investors.
</p>

<a name="60201-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_240"></a>The Government fear that all these amendments would impose disproportionate cost burdens on industry, compared with the benefits to be gained&#151;and I emphasise that point very strongly. Let me take Members of the Committee through the Government&#039;s approach on this important matter. We believe that the benefits of greater enfranchisement of indirect investors can and should be achieved by working with the industry to promote and develop standard practice, not through a one-size-fits-all legislative regime. Clause 136 ensures that all companies can enable indirect investors to enjoy and exercise all or certain governance rights of the registered member. When companies make provision in their articles to extend rights to those nominated by the registered member, such provision is legally effective in relation to various statutory requirements.
</p>

<a name="60201-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_241"></a>Investors today wishing to invest in discrete holdings of shares have the choice of which companies they invest in and which broker they invest through. Some companies already make provisions through <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC162"></a>

their articles to recognise and enfranchise indirect investors, and some brokers also enable indirect investors&#151;including those investing through ISAs and PEPs&#151;to opt into exercising certain governance rights. Clause 136 ensures that such arrangements are not undermined and that there are no legal obstacles preventing companies and participants down the investment chain making similar arrangements to extend certain governance rights to nominee investors.
</p>

<a name="60201-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_242"></a>The amendments in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord De Mauley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, propose to compel a traded company to enfranchise anyone whom the registered member nominates to exercise all or any governance rights. We believe that this is not a workable solution. Let me highlight our greatest concerns.


</p>

<a name="60201-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_243"></a>First, this would impose disproportionate cost and burdens on industry, such as the practical need to maintain, not one, but at least two registers&#151;one for registered members, the other recording those with governance rights. Secondly, and importantly, we would be concerned at the scope for abuse that these amendments open up. Safeguards would be needed to ensure that Clause 136, if amended in this way, could not be misused by a member to compel companies to provide information to, and enfranchise, anyone, whether or not they had any beneficial or economic interest in the company. Any safeguards would involve imposing obligations to provide evidence of being a genuine indirect investor. This brings us back to the problems of definition that I mentioned at Second Reading. Moreover, it would lead to further costs.
<a name="gc_time_8"></a>

</p>

<a name="60201-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_244"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Sharman and Lord Razzall, propose to compel traded companies taking advantage of the electronic communications provisions in the Bill to enfranchise automatically any persons nominated by the registered member to exercise all governance rights. The extension of governance rights to indirect investors and the provisions enabling companies to use e-communications are entirely separate measures. E-communications present great opportunities not only to reduce costs, but also to enhance the immediacy of dialogue between companies and their shareholders and indirect investors. This will, for example, enable nominee operators to forward company information more easily, quickly and cheaply to indirect investors.
</p>

<a name="60201-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_245"></a>We have seen that making enfranchisement of indirect investors mandatory would impose disproportionate cost burdens. We should not put this kind of obstacle in the way of companies, shareholders, nominees and indirect investors benefiting from the e-communications measures that the Bill will facilitate. That is why we prefer market solutions to develop. However, if the market does not develop appropriate solutions, the Secretary of State may exercise the power under Clause 137 to compel companies to provide information to indirect investors. The power is intended as an additional tool towards encouraging and achieving greater enfranchisement benefits. We are not convinced that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC163"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC163</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the benefits for the relatively small number of indirect investors who want to, but cannot, exercise governance rights justify the regulatory cost burdens these amendments would create. This is the view we have reached after considering carefully the interests of many different business and investor groups and other interested parties.
</p>

<a name="60201-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_246"></a>Essentially, what the argument comes down to is that we believe a facilitative approach, which we are delivering through Clause 136, is a better way to achieve general enfranchisement of indirect investors. We want to work with industry to promote an environment in which enfranchising indirect investors becomes standard practice. As the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, pointed out, there are already many examples of good practice in the market; he mentioned the case of GSK. Some companies already have in place, through their articles, provisions to recognise and enfranchise indirect investors, such as depository receipt holders. Some brokers also enable indirect investors to opt into exercising certain governance rights. Our approach ensures, first, that existing best practice and contractual arrangements are not undermined and, secondly, that there are no legal obstacles to prevent companies moving forward in this area.
</p>

<a name="60201-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_247"></a>The system in the United States and Canada is quite different; we believe it to be complex and costly. United States securities legislation requires intermediaries, regulated by their financial authorities&#151;which would include those acting as nominees&#151;to forward company information to, and solicit proxy instructions from, underlying beneficiaries. Such intermediaries may or may not be registered members of the company, but company law is not the place to impose similar obligations on securities intermediaries in the UK.

<a name="60201-47_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for that response, which is clearly very considered, and for his assurance that the Government take this very seriously. The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and I could agree that a facilitative approach is the right one; but the reality is that not a lot is happening. I have a modest number of shareholdings, and the fact that the GSK letter struck me as being extraordinarily open and novel in its approach indicates how far we are from getting the happy approach that we all seek. The Minister, in his carefully considered remarks, took too much for granted about how practice is emerging.
</p>

<a name="60201-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_248"></a>I have two further points. My first point is that I was seeking to apply the amendment only to Stock Exchange listed companies&#151;the biggest companies, which have the most responsibility to investors. In these amendments we were not trying to impose a burden on much smaller companies, let alone private companies. I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, said and there is a lot of attraction in his approach but it has a weakness. First, the company has to do something, and we have to ensure that it wants to do something. Secondly, if the company is linked to the electronic form of sending out information, every shareholder receives that <br>&nbsp;<br>

information, whether he wants it or not. Under our approach, people who wanted the information would have to sign in.
</p>

<a name="60201-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_249"></a>The great glory of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment is that it drives a coach and horses through the Minister&#039;s argument about cost, because the cost will fall dramatically when information is transmitted electronically. Therefore, if some additional cost is involved in following the system that the noble Lord recommends, it will be more than compensated for by the fact that it is all done electronically and mounds of paper will disappear. So I fully accept that there are some pluses to his amendment.
</p>

<a name="60201-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_250"></a>My second point is that I do not think that the Minister was right to pick the US example, which is undoubtedly very prescriptive. The Canadian example is much more elective. We will not reach a conclusion on this matter but I hope that the Minister will take on board what we have said. I am sure that we will want to come back to it at a later stage. It is a big and important issue for UK plc, but I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s carefully considered remarks.

<p><a name="gc_st_158"></a>
<a name="60201-47_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Clause 137 confers on the Secretary of State a power to make regulations to compel companies to provide information to other persons nominated by the registered member. The intention, should the power be exercised, would be to require companies to provide information electronically or by website. However, the power may be exercised to the extent of compelling companies to provide information in hard copy&#151;paper format&#151;if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the benefits arising to the nominated persons would be significant and would not impose disproportionate costs on companies.
</p>

<a name="60201-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_258"></a>The Secretary of State&#039;s power is intended to encourage the development of voluntary measures to ensure that indirect investors have access to the information they require to engage in the governance of the companies in which they invest.

<a name="60201-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_260"></a>We welcome the fact that the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, does not oppose the Question that Clause 137 shall stand part of the Bill. However, her amendment would extend significantly the scope of the Secretary of State&#039;s power to compel companies not only to provide information to other persons nominated by the registered member, but also to enfranchise such persons to exercise all governance rights of the member. We believe this is unnecessary. The mechanism whereby nominee operators can confer voting and other governance rights on indirect investors already exists. Nominee operators will be able to use the proxy rights under Clause 299 to allow indirect investors to attend, speak and vote at general meetings.

<a name="60201-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_261"></a>The current scope of the power is the result of considerable consultation through the Company Law Review and the Government&#039;s subsequent White Papers in 2002 and 2005. The clause was originally drafted to allow companies to opt, through their articles, to send or supply information to those nominated by registered members electronically only. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="gc_stpa_262"></a>In light of the concerns raised in some consultation responses to the 2005 White Paper, the scope of the power was extended to compel companies to provide information in hard copy, subject to the Secretary of State being satisfied of the cost benefit case.

We have heard a lot about facilitating and market forces but we have not heard much about timetables. When does the Minister think that we would move to the powers under Clause 137? When would he be inclined to press the button because things had not moved quite as he thought? When would he feel that market forces had not worked sufficiently well to move to the desirable state that the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and I are seeking? His answer would be a helpful hint to us all. It would perhaps enable us to reflect in a different way if we knew that the Minister had an &quot;itchy trigger finger&quot;, which is perhaps the phrase that I am hoping to hear from him.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_270"></a>The amendments with which I hope to deal&#151;I understand that we will try to reach Amendment No.148 this evening&#151;are all probing amendments. They are designed to elicit clear explanations for what may not be as clear in the Bill as appears at first blush. I repeat what my noble friend said on Second Reading when he congratulated the parliamentary draftsman on the clarity of the Bill. In dealing with this and other amendments, I have found the Bill much easier to understand than others with which colleagues have had to deal.
</p>

<a name="60201-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_271"></a>In moving amendment No. 137, I should like also to speak to Clause 142 stand part. Amendment No. 137 and Clauses 141 and 142 deal with the age of directors. I argue that the age of capacity for directorships should be 18, not 16, and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response. There are two reasons: the first is legal and the second concerns the message that might be sent out to young people and those at school if the Bill passes in its present form.
</p>

<a name="60201-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_272"></a>Let me deal first with the legal objections. The age of capacity for contract, which was reduced to 18 by the Family Law Reform Act 1969&#151;below which age you are a minor&#151;would clearly support the argument that the minimum age should be 18, not 16. Secondly, there is the age of capacity for legal proceedings under the civil procedure rules&#151;below 18, you are a child, and special court rules apply with regard to being involved in legal proceedings. The courts are willing to enforce a contract of employment against a minor but only if it is held to have been beneficial to the minor when entered into. There could be difficulties in enforcing certain provisions of a company&#039;s articles of association or a shareholder&#039;s agreement against a shareholding director who was under 18. For example, it may not be possible to put options over shares in the company to be enforced against a minor.
</p>

<a name="60201-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_273"></a>The message to young people should be that becoming the director of a company, however modest and private the company, is an important task that should be taken seriously. I appreciate that under common law there is no restriction on the minimum age for a director. But the Bill provides an opportunity to set that down and I think it should be 18. Clause 142 provides the Government with an opportunity, by regulation, in special circumstances, to reduce that age below 16. My question to the Minister is why? And when would such regulations be introduced? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_164"></a>
<a name="60201-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   It is a fact not known to many people that, as the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, said, companies&#039; legislation does not specify a minimum age at which an individual may be a director. It is quite an interesting fact that last week there were 432 directors under the age of 16, some of whom hold several appointments. Of course, their directorships were all in companies registered in England and Wales as those under 16 do not have legal capacity under Scots law and the register in Edinburgh <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC168"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC168</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

does not accept their appointment as directors. A significant number were under 10. In January 2005, 205 out of 443&#151;nearly half&#151;were such young children. We believe that that is not a totally satisfactory situation and the clause introduces a minimum age of 16. Amendment No. 137 would make the minimum age 18.
</p>

<a name="60201-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_274"></a>In general, I agree with the Law Society that those who appoint directors are best placed to judge whether a particular individual is able to undertake the duties of a director.


</p>

<a name="60201-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_275"></a>However, there are those who appoint children and young persons as directors in order to exploit their immunity from prosecution or the reluctance of enforcement authorities to pursue young persons. A safeguard is clearly needed. That is why the Bill includes this clause.

</p>

<a name="60201-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_276"></a>I consider that the minimum should not be set unnecessarily high. There have been some extremely successful teenage entrepreneurs. There are at present more than 1,000 directors aged 16 or 17 who do not give any cause for concern. So while I agree that the vast majority of teenagers are not ready for the responsibilities of a director, I consider that those who appoint directors should be able to decide whether a particular 16 or 17 year-old would be a suitable director of a particular company. Generally, those whom the law requires to be at school should not be able to be a director, but there may be circumstances in which the knowledge and experiences of a younger person would be useful. For example, charitable companies associated with youth work may want their directors to include a young person.
</p>

<a name="60201-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_277"></a>Clause 142 provides power for the Secretary of State to prescribe circumstances and conditions for the appointment of someone under 16 as a director of a UK company. It might, for example, be used to permit young persons to be directors of such companies provided that, say, the majority of the directors were over 16. There are cases of companies set up by schools to give young people experience. In those circumstances, there might be cases&#151;which we would develop through regulations&#151;where young people could be directors of such companies provided that the majority of directors were over 16.

<p><a name="gc_st_175"></a>The noble Lord said: I agree that shadow directors should generally be considered to be directors&#151;we are not arguing against that proposition&#151;and, therefore, have like duties obligations and responsibilities. However, this probing amendment seeks an explanation for why shadow directors should also be treated as officers. All directors are officers, but not all officers are directors. There may be a very simple explanation but I would appreciate hearing it. We think that an obligation on a shadow director to compile the register of directors is somewhat illogical, especially as directors have an obligation to compile the register of directors, including shadow directors. That is covered in Clause 151.
</p>

<a name="60201-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_287"></a>I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 146 and 147. Amendment No. 146 poses the question why a shadow director should also be treated as an officer. Amendment No. 147 raises a different, although related, point. Although I agree that shadow directors should be on the register of directors, I do not think that compilation of the register should be an obligation on the part of shadow directors. I am also concerned about the severity of the obligation on directors, hence the amendment. It strikes a reasonable balance to what is otherwise a strict obligation on the part of directors, a breach of which is a criminal offence under Clause 146(5). I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_176"></a>
<a name="60201-49_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Clauses 146 to 150 retain the requirements of Sections 288 and 289 of the 1985 Act as regards companies keeping a register with up-to-date particulars of all their directors and notifying the registrar of their particulars and any change in their particulars. Section 288(6) of the 1985 Act extends this requirement to shadow directors; Clause 151 does likewise. It must be remembered that not every shadow director is trying to conceal his, or her, identity. But these provisions are needed to prevent the easy evasion of the legislation by persons who control companies but who either do not wish to be appointed to the board or, more typically, cannot be appointed because they are undischarged bankrupts or the subject of disqualification orders under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. It is right that if such a person is a shadow director of a company, he or she should be liable for any default in the duty to keep an up-to-date register of directors, seeing as it must include their particulars. However Amendments Nos. 141 and 146 would relieve the shadow director of such liability.
</p>

<a name="60201-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_288"></a>Amendment No. 147 would remove the director&#039;s liability for failure to register a shadow director&#039;s particulars unless,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_59"></a>&quot;it is proved that he (ie the director) was actually aware of the facts which constituted that person a shadow director and that he knew or ought reasonably to have known having regard to the general skill and experience that he actually possessed and to the function which he was actually carrying out as a director that those facts constituted the person shadow director&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60201-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_289"></a>I understand the noble Lord&#039;s concern lest someone be unwittingly guilty of an offence. I recognise that there have been occasions when whether a particular person was, or was not, a shadow director has been a matter of some contention. But I would point out that no officer is liable unless in default. Clause 730 provides that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_60"></a>&quot;An officer is &#039;in default&#039; for the purposes of the provision if he authorises or permits, participates in, or fails to take all reasonable steps to prevent, the contravention&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="60201-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_290"></a>The effect of the amendment is to reverse the burden of proof in this respect. The question is whether this provides sufficient protection given the wide meaning of &quot;shadow director&quot; and the risk that, for example, a bank might fear that it would come within the definition. Experience since the concept was first introduced has been that the banks have not been held liable as shadow directors in large numbers of cases. That seems to me to suggest that the definition is not as wide as is feared. I therefore suggest that the concerns may be exaggerated.
</p>

<a name="60201-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_291"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 288, which would water down the liability of a shadow director arising from a public company&#039;s failure to comply with a direction to appoint a company secretary. As the amendment would have it, such a shadow director would be liable only if he was aware of the direction or should have been aware of it. But if the directors are acting in accordance with the shadow director&#039;s instructions, it is only right that the shadow director, if in default, should, as with the other directors, be liable. I do not consider that it would be helpful to provide a different test for the liability of shadow directors in this context.

&quot;(a)   the company, and

<br>
(b)   &quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_185"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to extend liability for failing to notify changes of directors, or registered particulars of directors, to the registrar of companies to the company as well as to the officer in default. It appears that the basis adopted by the Government for imposing liability for offences, in its most simplistic formulation, is that, where the underlying provision is for the benefit of the shareholders of the company only, breach of those provisions will not give rise to a liability on the company itself but only on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC173"></a>

responsible officers. Other offences that affect the public, whether or not also having an effect on the shareholders, give rise to liability on both the company and the responsible officers. If that policy is to be adopted, it should be applied consistently and it should be applied in Clause 150.
</p>

<a name="60201-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_306"></a>The purpose of the delivery of particulars of directors to the registrar of companies would appear to be to inform the public, including those planning to deal with the company. Accordingly, in order to adopt a consistent approach, the liability should extend not only to the officer in default but also to the company. This replicates the existing position under Section 288 of the Companies Act 1985 and is consistent with the liability attaching to persons under Clause 146(4) of the Bill in the event that the required particulars are not contained in the register of directors. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_186"></a>
<a name="60201-50_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   This clause replaces Section 288(2) of the 1985 Act so far as it applies to directors. It retains the requirement that the appointment of a director, a director ceasing to hold office, or any change in an existing director&#039;s particulars be notified to the registrar within 14 days; default is an offence. It also requires a notice of appointment to be accompanied by evidence that the appointee has consented. This provision ensures that the public record is kept up to date.
</p>

<a name="60201-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_307"></a>The new provision is substantively different from the 1985 Act in that only officers of the company in default will be liable for a breach of its requirements. The current formulation is &quot;the company and every officer of it who is in default&quot;. As noble Lords will know, there are offences in the Bill where we are removing company liability. We are doing that because we believe, as did the Company Law Review, that there should be presumption against liability falling on the company itself where the perpetrators are clearly the directors or other individuals and the victims of the offence are the shareholders of the company. In these cases, making the company liable would impose an additional penalty upon the shareholders. However, the obligation in the provision is specifically on the directors of the company, and therefore we believe that it is appropriate to limit the scope of liability in this case.
</p>

<a name="60201-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_308"></a>This change to the existing law was set out in Annex D to the March 2005 White Paper. In the subsequent consultation we did not receive any comments from interested parties suggesting that it would be inappropriate to remove the liability of the company from this provision.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_189"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 148 will possibly be the last amendment that we deal with tonight. It is an important amendment. As a director of a company, I had the experience of colleagues on the board deciding that it was appropriate for a director to be removed for reasons that were given. I was very dissatisfied with the procedure open to that director to make representations. That was not only because his representations were difficult to read, but also because of the seeming injustice that was being done to him.
</p>

<a name="60201-50_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_317"></a>Therefore, this clause makes provision for a director to be removed by a general meeting, but also gives him the right to have representations circulated. In public interest and mutual interest companies, a group of members and/or directors may decide for their own purposes to remove a particular director. That director may have no access to the share register and no means of explaining his position to the other shareholders. The only means he may have of alerting the other members to the difficulties is to have his representations circulated. If the representations are not circulated, the other shareholders may not be aware of the issues and therefore may not attend a general meeting. It is submitted that, at least in such companies, the director should have the right to prevent a vote being taken at a meeting and to have the meeting adjourned until such time as his submissions have been circulated to the membership, which is not earlier than 14 days as provided in the amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_190"></a>
<a name="60201-50_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 152 provides an important protection against a director being removed without an opportunity to present his case. However, I understand that its predecessor, Section 304 of the 1985 Act, is rarely used. The removal of a director of a public company is rarely a matter for a resolution in general meeting. While in private companies members are no doubt fully apprised of the arguments without resort to the prescribed formalities, it is nevertheless important that there be sufficient safeguards for a director against his removal.
</p>

<a name="60201-50_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_318"></a>I consider that Clause 153 already provides sufficient safeguards. First and foremost, it provides a director with the right to be heard orally at the meeting at which the resolution to remove him or her is considered. This is in addition to the right to insist on any written representation he has made being circulated beforehand or, in default of that, being read <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC175"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column GC175</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

out at the meeting. Amendment No. 148 would provide him with the additional right to require that the meeting be adjourned for at least 14 days after the company circulates his representations if his written representations have not been circulated beforehand. This could, of course, be used as a delaying tactic when timing might be important to the company. As I have mentioned, where the representations have not been circulated, the director can already insist that his representations are read out at the meeting and be heard orally at the meeting. In the light of these safeguards, I am not convinced of the need for an additional safeguard and consider that it would be more than can be justified.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_191"></a>
<a name="60201-50_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Freeman: </b>   That is a logical and understandable argument. However, I am not entirely satisfied. One of the main benefits of probing amendments is that, when <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60201-51_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>The Review Group on Common Parts was set up during the passage of the Disability Discrimination Bill, which gained Royal Assent in April 2005, because of concerns expressed by Members of the other House that some disabled people could become confined to their homes if the common parts of the premises could not be adapted to meet their needs.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The review group was asked to investigate the need and evidence for change in relation to alterations to the common parts of let residential premises and to make recommendations to the Minister for Disabled People (Anne McGuire) and the Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper).
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The review group has considered a wide range of evidence including: a review of landlord and tenant and housing legislation; information on the experience of disabled people; research concerning the attitudes of tenants, lessees and landlords to adjustments to common parts; and a range of surveys and statistical reports.

</p>

<a name="60201-51_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>It has come to the conclusion that while there is evidence of good practice by some landlords, there is also evidence of unmet need for adjustments to common parts to assist disabled people. Therefore, it has concluded that a problem does exist and has made a series of detailed recommendations in its report, entitled <i>A Review of the current position in relation to adjustments to the common parts of let residential premises, and recommendation for change</i>, 23 December 2005. The Government are now considering the detail of the report and its recommendations. The report has been placed in the Library.

<a name="60201-51_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  The Austrian Justice and Home Affairs Informal Council was held on 12&#150;14 January in Vienna. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary and I represented the UK.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The Austrian presidency opened the council by introducing the discussion on asylum and immigration. It drew attention to its ideas in relation to regional co-operation; rapid intervention teams; charter flights; and information exchange.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS18"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column WS18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60201-51_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>The Commission stressed the work it is currently undertaking and, in particular, its intention to produce, by the end of January, a communication on practical co-operation. In advance of that, the Commission has issued an information note setting out the ideas likely to be contained in the proposal. The intention is for these to be discussed in more detail at the February Justice and Home Affairs Council.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>Key ideas included information on countries of origin and the Commission&#039;s ideas for a European information system. In the medium term the aim would be to establish a common European database on countries of origin with information pooled by member states. In the short term, it would be useful to consider a common form for the collection of information and agree a common format for this. The Commission&#039;s communication would contain ideas on how to respond to particular pressures on specific member states. These proposals would include amendments to the European Refugee Fund/ARGO funding programmes to establish a fund for emergency situations. The Commission communication would also propose the creation of rapid reaction/emergency teams capable of providing such things as emergency medical assistance and interpretation. Training would be an essential component. Finally, the Commission&#039;s communication was likely to look at the procedures for examining applications for refugee status, with a view to harmonising processing procedures across the EU. This would be a key element in the longer-term move towards a common European asylum system (CEAS).
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>In subsequent discussion, most member states were broadly supportive of the ideas set out in the presidency paper and the Commission&#039;s analysis.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The Home Secretary stressed that strong EU action on immigration/asylum was essential. The solutions were, in principle, simple and included a need for:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>strong borders;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>a clear relationship with third countries; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>a clear system for managing and processing asylum applications.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60201-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>These principles are easy to lay down but in practice difficult to achieve. The Home Secretary therefore stressed the need for the EU to focus on achieving practical outcomes.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Antonio Gutteres, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), gave his organisation&#039;s full support to regional protection programmes, both at a political level and on the ground. The migration and asylum nexus was the key policy issue in looking at the large-scale flows of population. The key question was to ensure that those genuinely in need of asylum got the right treatment. Gutteres stressed it would be important, however, to tackle the root causes in a global and comprehensive way. That would involve looking at broader issues such as conflict resolution; institutional good governance; trade; debt relief; and common migration management. Regional protection programmes needed to be part of that overall process <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS19"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column WS19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and not something done in isolation. The EU needed to provide strong political initiatives in taking forward this work in partnership with UNHCR.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>In summary, the presidency noted broad support for its ideas and for the ideas put forward by the Commission. It was clear that a comprehensive programme would need to be developed and that work on many of these issues would need to be taken forward in close co-operation and co-ordination with UNHCR.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>On criminal law, Ministers discussed the future of the draft framework decision on procedural safeguards for defendants in criminal proceedings, and the impact of the recent European Court of Justice judgment (Case 176/03) on environmental crime. Ministers agreed that the extent to which criminal law measures should come within the first pillar needed to be considered in greater detail, and the Commission agreed to reconsider its proposals to fast-track the movement of third-pillar measures to first-pillar legal bases. All member states agreed that the JHA council should have an important role in ensuring consistency in the way in which the court&#039;s ruling was applied in relation to subjects falling outside the third pillar.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>In the afternoon the discussion moved on to Europol. Presentations were made before the council by Gijs de Vries (EU counter-terrorism co-ordinator), Max-Peter Ratzel (Europol) and Mike Kennedy (Eurojust), highlighting the progress that has been made but also the need for further improvements.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The presentations led to a debate on how Europol could be developed further, ensuring that law enforcement authorities of the member states derive maximum benefit from its progress. It was clear that greater flexibility was needed in handling the work of the management board, and it was necessary to ensure that the director of Europol had the proper tools to lead and guide the organisation. At present, the bureaucratic processes involved made it difficult to respond flexibly to changing priorities and to revise the staff regulations.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The commission called for greater information flows to both Eurojust and Europol&#151;especially now that both bodies are internationally recognised. The majority of member states agreed on the need to create a more flexible Europol, better able to respond to the demands of member states and to the needs of the day, and with more flexible internal management. The point was also made that competence lay principally with the member states&#039; own bodies and that it was therefore necessary to look at the development of Europol in that context. Europol should not duplicate work properly undertaken at a national level and should not be given any greater operational powers: it had a co-ordinating and analytical role.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>In this context, member states also discussed how better to improve co-operation and co-ordination and whether there was a need for the creation of a committee on internal security, as envisaged by the constitutional treaty. A number of member states warned against anticipating the treaty and emphasised the need to use existing bodies more effectively.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60201-51_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The presidency in its summing-up noted general agreement on the need for greater co-operation&#151;eg, in the fields of analysis and information exchange. In relation to Europol, it needed to be more involved in joint operations but not to lead these operations. It needed more flexibility and adaptability and to build on what had already been developed. Member states needed to ratify the Europol protocols and there was a general view that no new structures were needed but that the EU needed to make better use of its existing arrangements. In particular, the EU needed to identify key areas and topics&#151;such as the western Balkans; Afghan drugs; and the Mediterranean/Africa, and ought to develop priority road maps for each of those areas. Member states welcomed the presidency commitment in this area, and supported the country and topic priorities and the need to take regions and issues together for best effect.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>On the justice and home affairs external relations strategy, the presidency stated that it intended to make concrete progress on the basis of the strategy agreed under the UK presidency; and will be working closely with future presidencies and other member states in relation to key geographic areas such as the western Balkans.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>In the Commission&#039;s analysis, priority needed to be given to neighbouring regions and the strategy ought not to be confined simply to security issues. Attention was drawn to the idea of action plans focusing on particular policy issues such as drug trafficking; cyber-crime; human trafficking and illegal migration. It recognised, too, the need to work closely with the UN and other international organisations. A number of member states commented on the clear priorities in the strategy thanks to the work done under the UK presidency. Work now needed to be developed in a balanced way&#151;and with sufficient resources. Member states welcomed the notion of action-oriented papers and there was broad acceptance that the existing EU frameworks and agreements were sufficient to take forward the strategy. Relevant operational agencies such as FRONTEX, Europol and Eurojust should be involved in taking that work forward. A number of member states mentioned other geographical areas which should receive attention in addition to the western Balkans.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>In conclusion, the presidency noted the need to get down to practical steps in partnership with other bodies, and to ensure a co-ordinated and consistent approach. European neighbourhood policy countries, the western Balkans and the southern Mediterranean were all important and the presidency noted in particular the Euromed meeting that it had planned. An EU-Africa meeting would be taken forward under the next presidency. Work with countries such as Russia was also highly important.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>In concluding the council, the presidency looked in particular at the way in which civil law matters were dealt with in the current institutional structures. It asked member states whether they felt adequately informed about justice and home affairs-related issues that are dealt with in other council formations. Member states supported the analysis set out in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS21"></a>

<b>1 Feb 2006 : Column WS21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

presidency paper. I noted that the Civil Law Committee was set up on the initiative of the last Austrian presidency in 1998, and that one of its purposes was to ensure that justice matters which arose in other council formations could be considered by civil law experts. I also noted that this had met with some success but that the presidency was right that the system could be improved.
</p>

<a name="60201-51_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>Summing up, the presidency noted that member states broadly shared its analysis; that the Civil Law Committee should play a greater role; and that both COREPER and the JHA council should receive information on all subjects touching on civil law in other councils.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>I have received the eighth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). This report has been made under Articles 4 and 7 of the international agreement that established the commission and it reports on levels of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. I have considered the content of the report and I am today bringing it before Parliament. I have placed copies in the Library of the House.
</p>

<a name="60201-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>The IMC has confirmed that PIRA paramilitary activity has ceased since 28 July. Also, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) has today confirmed its position on the decommissioning of PIRA arms. In its report, the IMC says that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>&quot;We are of the firm view that the present Provisional IRA (PIRA) leadership has taken the strategic decision to end the armed campaign and pursue the political course which it has publicly articulated . . . We see a number of definite signs of the organisation moving in the direction indicated in the statement&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60201-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>of 28 July 2005. Compared to where the PIRA stood only a few years ago, there has been a sea change.
</p>

<a name="60201-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>This is a positive report which shows that the IRA is moving in the right direction and is closing down: no murders, no recruitment and no bank robberies. Of course the report does not paint a picture of perfection and the Government did not expect it to. While the report shows that there have been significant changes <br>&nbsp;<br>

in IRA criminal activity with some criminal operations being closed down, any on-going criminal activity is unacceptable and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Assets Recovery Agency will continue to bear down on it.
</p>

<a name="60201-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>In addition, the IMC draws attention to the activities by loyalists. The commissioners acknowledge the work of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG) to move things in,

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>&quot;a better direction and in efforts to influence the UDA&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60201-52_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>(Ulster Defence Association). Loyalist paramilitary activity and criminality as described in this report must come to an end.
</p>

<a name="60201-52_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>The IMC concludes that the financial sanctions against Sinn Fein and the PUP should not continue.
</p>

<a name="60201-52_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>More can and should be done to speed up the process of bringing loyalist paramilitary activity and criminality to an end, and remaining PIRA activities should cease. The Government believe that after this report of significant progress by the IRA, there is every basis for proceeding with political discussions on re-establishing the Assembly. Once again, I am grateful to the commission for its submission of this report and for its careful analysis.

Since the first meeting, the membership and remit of the group and the chairing arrangements have been reviewed. The group is due to meet again in February 2006 and is expected to meet bi-monthly thereafter. Meetings will be chaired jointly by the lead Home Office Minister and by the Solicitor-General <br>&nbsp;<br>

with secretariat functions provided jointly by officials from the Home Office and the office of the Solicitor-General. The primary function of the group is to advise ministers on policy; as such it has no allocated financial resources for specific programmes of work. The stakeholder group was established prior to the launch of the draft UK Action Plan on Human Trafficking but was not set up specifically to advise on the consultation. It will continue to meet to discuss a range of issues relating to trafficking in human beings after the end of the consultation period. We believe these arrangements are adequate and appropriate to the remit of the group.

<a name="60201w02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   In planning service specifications for passenger rail franchises, the Department of Transport takes account of passenger flows which are best served by connecting services. Westbury station, where north/south and east/west routes cross, provides several such opportunities. The principal demand is for travel to London, and the increase of Westbury-London services to hourly under the new Greater Western franchise will improve connections for travellers from west Wiltshire. Demand for connections to and from the west is much smaller but will still be served, though with some reduction compared with present levels.

<a name="60201w03_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  The law is clear that where a faith school is oversubscribed it is permissible for it to give priority to members of its faith, although there is no requirement for it to do so. This policy is consistent with the widely accepted and long-standing historical tradition of church schools. Faith schools cannot refuse admission to non-faith applicants if they have available places and there are insufficient applicants of faith.

<a name="60201w03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   Maintained faith schools in England and Wales, designated under Section 69(3) of the School Standards and Framework Act as having a religious character, are able to use religious criteria to decide who should be offered a place when they are oversubscribed. No maintained faith school may keep places empty if they have places available and applicants who are not of the faith wish to apply.
</p>

<a name="60201w03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a>Under the provisions of Part 2 of the Equality Bill such schools will continue to be able to use religious criteria. Article 9 of the ECHR recognises rights in relation to religion and belief, and in education terms the convention provides in Article 2 of the first protocol that no person shall be denied education. However, the second part of this article provides that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_8"></a>&quot;the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="60201w03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a>Similarly the convention recognises the need for plurality and diversity in state educational provision, and the role of religion in society.

<a name="60201w03_para2"></a>
