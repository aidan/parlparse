The introduction of polyclinics is not about closing hospital beds but about preparing the infrastructure to cope with future demand for health services. There is an international evidence base for developing integrated services based around the needs of patients and providing access to a range of community-based services with convenient opening hours.</p>

As I understand it, the answer is that the Government have absolutely no idea at all. Secondly, of the 31 PCTs in London that signed up, rubber-stamping the idea, how many undertook independent clinical and managerial assessments before they agreed, as the noble Lord stated in his previous paper that they were required to do? Why does the Minister ignore the 1.2 million people who have signed petitions against this idea and the majority of doctors who are against it? Would not the money be better spent on getting rid of the superbugs that have killed 8,000 people and on a number of other areas, not least the waiting lists, as well as the 50 per cent of young mothers who are turfed out 24 hours after having their child?</p>

The first question was on cost. As I highlighted, a polyclinic is not a building. In the London report, which I led with 100 clinicians in London, I described a number of different models of polyclinics, one of which is a network, or federated, model. It is not a building; I say that for the record. The costs will have been carefully estimated by London&#146;s SHAs. I shall be more than happy to send the proposals to the noble Lord. As far as the petitions are concerned&#151;I should declare to the House that I am a member of the BMA&#151;I met the chair of the patients&#146; forum this morning. Patients signed these forms based on their understanding at the time of their visits to their GP practices that the practices were about to close. This is not about closure. We have invested &#163;250 million in

I am sure that noble Lords will agree that the trusting relationship between any clinician and patient is sacrosanct; it is one of the key values that underpin our professions. Misleading patients and breaking their trust by causing them unnecessary concern and worry breaks that professional vow that we all take.</p>

However, will the Minister please tell us the difference between a large health centre, a community hospital and a polyclinic?

At the end of the day, this is an investment in the primary and community setting to meet the healthcare provision demands facing the nation over the next 10 years. We are all getting older and we all want to enjoy a better quality of life as we do. We all know that the biggest challenge is long-term conditions. As the noble Baroness said, we are trying to shift diagnostics and care closer to the patient&#146;s home. On funding, whatever the clinics are called, there is a major shift. As we have demonstrated with our investment of &#163;250 million in these new GP-led health centres, our future investment must be in primary and community settings.</p>

Because of the baseline historical growth in A&amp;E attendance over the past three or four years, this is one of the biggest growth areas that we envisage in London: we calculate a 66 per cent growth in attendance by 2016. The system as it stands will be unable to cope with that. The health centres to which we are referring will cope with the significant number of patients that are currently attending A&amp;E. In my hospital, you could claim that 60 per cent of them could be dealt with in a primary and community setting.</p>

As I said, capacity expansion creates the choice for patients to register with these new health centres if they wish. However, they do not have to change registration; they can just walk into these health centres to get access to treatment.</p>

Is my noble friend aware that the Joint Warrior exercise, which consisted of some 36 ships and 70 aircraft, coincided with the lambing season? While the population in Durness and north-west Sutherland has always been supportive of the use of the Cape Wrath range, is she aware that that relationship seems to have deteriorated somewhat since the Army took over responsibility from the Royal Navy in the past couple of years? Does she agree with me that the training needs of the United Kingdom and NATO forces can still be well met by avoiding such crucially important times for a fragile local economy as the lambing season?</p>

It is an area where certain training can be done that cannot be done anywhere else in the United Kingdom. The fact that the training exercise takes place during part of the lambing season is to be regretted, but the lambing season has extended and there were local consultations about when the best time for this exercise would be. As I mentioned, we consult as widely as possible, but my noble friend will be interested to hear that an integrated rural management plan for Cape Wrath went out for consultation today, which includes matters such as military activity, nature conservation and local farming interests.

Advisers will work alongside disability employment advisers to ensure that activity identified for disabled customers is appropriate to their needs. Where available, customers will be able to access the department&#146;s specialist disability provision.

We believe that should be job-related and supportive of individuals. The number of incapacity benefit claimants fell by 31,000 over the past year, after two decades of inexorable rise. The approach is right. It supports those who can to go back into work. We know that work is generally good for people&#146;s health. It is their best route out of poverty, as well as being good for their general well-being.</p>

For example, blind and partially sighted people have distinct needs which have to be met to enable them to access training, educational and other work-related opportunities. If the Government are to ensure that all disabled people get the individually tailored support that they need to move towards work, provision by private and voluntary sector providers delivering Pathways must be monitored by impairment groups. If detailed impairment-specific monitoring does not take place, it is unclear how the Government will either identify whether all groups of disabled people are receiving the help and support they need or meet their commitment to tackling poor performance from contractors delivering Pathways programmes. The Government do not presently hold any statistics which show the outcomes for blind

The key issue about New Deal is that it is flexible. As the noble Lord has acknowledged, it will be provided in due course by a range of external providers. Monitoring can and will take place under the contractual terms because the contractual arrangements are fundamentally outcome-based. As the noble Lord suggests, we should seek to ensure that that monitoring is detailed and covers all the groups affected by the benefit.</p>

However, looking at the history of the programmes in place to date, we can see that Pathways to Work has helped more people back into employment and has contributed to fewer people being on incapacity benefit. Therefore, in practice, it is working now. There will be a legislative requirement, which, as the noble Lord will remember, we put in place in the Welfare Reform Act last year, to ensure that monitoring on this takes place on an annual basis over the first five years.</p>

I think it is right to say&#151;I hope that it is not controversial&#151;that most authorities recognise that the treaty of Lisbon is and has to be technically dead. It had to be ratified to become alive&#151;to exist&#151;by all 27 of the signatories to it, and one of those signatories has declared that it does not wish to do so and has rejected it. That is the technical position; I do not think it is widely disputed.</p>

<a name="80618-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="080618112000075"></a>One has to be realistic&#151;perhaps in this House it is particularly our duty to be realistic&#151;and recognise that corpses can be resuscitated in certain circumstances and by certain ingenious devices. Anyone who has studied the commentaries in the chancelleries of Europe and in Brussels over the weekend will have heard some of those devices mentioned. One is that explanatory protocols should be somehow attached to the treaty that would not change the text but would make life easier for the Irish to review their situation. Another is that there should be political commitments by the other 26 member states that would again make special exceptions for the Irish and meet some of their obvious worries. There have also been some proposals about the so-called provisional application or disapplication of certain parts of the Lisbon treaty, which would not affect the treaty but somehow become internationally binding in law&#151;our law as well as international law.</p>

<a name="80618-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="080618112000076"></a>That is the position that we face. While the treaty text cannot be changed in any way and has been rejected by the people of the Republic of Ireland, some of the provisions and moves that I describe could take place. I do not know whether they will&#151;none of us does&#151;and we do not know whether they will succeed in keeping Ireland within the European Union, which I think is what most people want. What is crystal clear to me, and I hope to your Lordships, is that Parliament will need to take account of any changes in its legislation and in the Bill. My contention, which seems straightforward, is that the other place&#151;the elected Chamber; we are not the elected Chamber&#151;must be allowed some control in these matters.</p>

I know, having been in politics for some time, that there is no gratitude in politics, so I do not expect any thanks whatever. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the prudent course is to wait a few months and see if further amendments are called for&#151;none of us knows&#151;or whether the Bill is redundant and can be discarded because the treaty cannot be brought into force. This seems to me so obvious that I wondered&#151;it may be pure self-delusion&#151;whether we might have the benefit of the Liberal Democrats&#146; support for this democratic course. I have two quotes from the Liberal Democrat leadership to give me some hope, although I am the first to recognise that quotes fly off the Liberal Democrats in all directions like sparks from a catherine wheel and others may be found to contradict them.</p>

<a name="80618-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="080618112000079"></a>First, the Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs Spokesman said in the Commons that the Liberal Democrats,</p>
<ul><a name="080618112000320"></a>&#147;find it difficult to see any way in which to continue with the Lisbon treaty&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 16/6/08; col. 708.]</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000080"></a>Secondly, their leader, Mr Clegg, said on the &#147;Andrew Marr Show&#148; on Sunday:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="080618112000321"></a>&#147;We should not just somehow airbrush out of history the Irish vote ... I really hope that the European elite won&#146;t behave with the arrogance that a lot of people think they should&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000270"></a>That seems pretty decisive and would indicate that the Liberal Democrats will give me some support, but I live in slender hopes. There is also some Liberal Democrat theory that Third Reading and Royal Assent, which will happen immediately, do not automatically mean ratification, but the Government have made it clear that once the Bill is through&#151;if it gets through&#151;the ratification will happen immediately. That is a distinction without a difference.</p>

<a name="80618-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="080618112000081"></a>Either the treaty is truly dead, and no longer exists, in which case the next stage of Third Reading is pointless and a waste of all our time, or there will be some clever changes to help the Irish to stay on board. In the Government&#146;s language, the treaty is not killed off entirely. In that case, it is our duty in your Lordships&#146; House to give the elected Chamber the chance to reflect on the new situation and accordingly suggest changes that will be necessary to our legislation. Either way, it is a deep misjudgment to hurry the Bill through its final stage and seal off further discussion of the new situation rather than carefully and prudently delay it until the situation is clearer and Parliament has had a chance to reassess.</p>

<a name="80618-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="080618112000082"></a>Our bright and active Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, who is a very able young man, says that patience is needed in this situation. So it is; and that patience should begin with the Government and with the handling of the Bill. I therefore beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="080618112000083"></a>Moved, as an amendment to the Motion that this Bill be now read a third time, to leave out from &#147;that&#148; to the end and insert &#147;, notwithstanding the normal practice of the House, this Bill be read a third time no earlier than Monday 20 October 2008 to allow&#151;</p>

Progress on the Bill has been slow and it has been thorough. Let us look at the statistics. Parliament has had 24 days of debate, with 10.5 days in this House; 315 amendments were tabled in the Commons; 266 were tabled in the Lords. There have been no less than 57 Divisions: 12 in this House and 45 in another place. The Bill has been scrutinised thoroughly, minutely and in great detail. It is at the final stage of its parliamentary progress. It should now proceed.</p>

<a name="80618-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="080618112000087"></a>It is noteworthy that those who are most in favour of postponing the Bill are the very people who are opposed to the treaty. I am sure that it is a great coincidence, but it is difficult to find, at least in this House, someone who says that he is in favour of the Bill and also in favour of not proceeding with it. I listened to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, with great interest, as I always do. He uses elegant words and flowing phrases. I was reminded of incident that took place many years ago in the other place when I rather upset the late Lord Hailsham. I cannot remember what the issue was, but he made a great speech in which there was great talk of honour, constitution and principles. I had to follow him, and follow him I did. I accused him of something I called &#147;vintage Hoggery&#148;. I then defined vintage Hoggery as the art of elevating a political motive into a high-flown constitutional principle. He was not very well pleased&#151;your Lordships may not be surprised. Nevertheless, it is good, I suppose, to see that Hoggery still flourishes and exists, at least on the Conservative Front Bench.</p>

<a name="80618-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="080618112000088"></a>The issue here is very simple. It is whether, having got this far, there is any justification for not continuing. We should look first at what the Irish say. They have urged other countries to proceed with their own ratification processes. The Irish Minister for Europe, Mr Roche, said on the BBC on Monday:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="080618112000293"></a>&#147;I believe that the Irish people have had their say. I believe that they now want to allow each of the other member states to have its say and then at the end of this process to say, &#145;Well where does this leave us? Where are we?&#146; I mean, the whole genius of Europe is that it has moved together and that it moves together in unison. The idea of a two-tier Europe is not attractive to any member state&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80618-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="080618112000089"></a>Mr Roche was then asked by the interviewer, Evan Davis:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="080618112000294"></a>&#147;You want the rest of us to continue with the ratification process, do you, because the British are voting on Wednesday?".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000271"></a>He replied:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="080618112000295"></a>&#147;Well, we certainly have said we're not going to intrude on any other member state's ratification process. It's right and proper that each member state deals with this matter in its own constitutional procedures as we did with our process. Our process is respected and we respect everybody else's right to deal with it through their processes&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="080618112000090"></a>If the Irish Government do not think that the process of ratification should be postponed, why on earth should we? Nor do I accept for one moment the argument that somehow or other postponing the Third Reading of this Bill gives the Government more elbow room, latitude and clout in any future negotiations. It seems to me to be exactly the contrary. If we pass this Bill, the British position becomes clear. If we do not, it will remain imprecise and opaque, which seems to me to be what the Opposition want.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80618-0003.htm"/>


<a name="80618-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="080618112000091"></a>I do not accept the arguments that the result of the Irish referendum makes it more difficult for us to play our full part in European affairs or that by passing this Bill we are somehow joining with others in bullying Ireland. I cannot help wondering whether these objections would still be made if we had proceeded on a different form of ratification other than the one we chose. There is nothing wrong with ratifying a treaty by the parliamentary process. That is how Maastricht, Nice and the Single European Act were done. The other form of ratification is by a public referendum. Either one is equally valid in law and produces the same effect. I cannot help thinking that the attitude of the Opposition would hardly be the same if we had chosen to ratify via a referendum. Consider this possibility: if that referendum had been arranged, say, for next Monday, is it seriously contended that it would be postponed because of the difficulties that it is alleged might flow from the Irish vote? I do not think the Opposition would advocate that for an instant, even though the effect of the referendum, if positive, would be precisely the same as the passage of this Bill. Either way, therefore, we would go on with it.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="080618112000092"></a>The fact is that the Official Opposition just do not want the treaty; it is that which has motivated their actions. I do not think that this House should pander to them any longer. We have come a very long way in considering the Bill. It would be ludicrous for us now to refrain from completing our job.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="080618112000296"></a>&#147;The rules of the treaty and of the EU are clear.

</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000094"></a>He is completely correct in what he said. I hope that I shall be forgiven for reminding your Lordships of some of the relevant legal provisions, as I do not think that we spent any instant of time on them. You have to go to the treaty of Lisbon in its unreadable form, which is in Command Paper 7294&#151;the hunks and not the rewritten version that we have all been working from, which the Government kindly produced. If you toil your way through to page 156 of the treaty as printed, you come to the final provisions. The key provision for today is Article 6:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="080618112000297"></a>&#147;This Treaty shall be ratified by the High Contracting Parties in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.

</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000095"></a>Those provisions require ratification of this treaty&#151;not some other amended or altered version&#151;by all 27 member states. The treaty will not enter into force until the last of the 27 has deposited the instrument of ratification with Italy. That event, we know, will never happen.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="080618112000096"></a>Ireland has duly followed its constitutional requirements and a referendum was held. I have looked at the Constitution of Ireland. Articles 46 and 47 deal with proposals for an amendment of the constitution, which have to be,</p>
<ul><a name="080618112000322"></a>&#147;submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people in accordance with the law for the time being in force&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000097"></a>That law is the next article, which simply says that a proposal for amendment of the constitution should be,</p>
<ul><a name="080618112000323"></a>&#147;submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000098"></a>The proposal will be held to have been approved if a majority cast their votes in favour at such a referendum. I am shortening it, but that is the gist.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="080618112000099"></a>That event has not happened. The opposite has happened. The people have refused it; they have rejected it. For the sake of accuracy, I should record that there are two referendum Acts in Ireland&#151;those of 1994 and 1996. As far as I can tell from a textbook summary, they add nothing of relevance to the present debate.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="080618112000100"></a>What are the facts as they are today? The best source for me was today&#146;s <I>Irish Times</I>. On page 8, we are told that the Taoiseach, Mr Brian Cowen, said in the Dail yesterday:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="080618112000298"></a>&#147;In my discussions with my colleagues&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000272"></a>he is talking about discussions that will take place tomorrow&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080618112000324"></a>&#147;I will be stressing that the people have spoken and that the Government accepts the result&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000273"></a>The Labour leader, Eamon Gilmore, spoke in a similar vein. The <I>Irish Times </I>quoted him as saying that it was important that everyone accepted and respected the decision made last Thursday. The Fine Gael leader, Enda Kenny, joined in, emphasising his disappointment with the result but adding that the decision must be accepted and respected.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="080618112000101"></a>Meanwhile, the first page of the <I>Irish Times </I>carried the headline, &#147;EU may offer concessions and opt-outs to win new treaty vote&#148;. We read from the reporter:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="080618112000299"></a>&#147;France and Germany are quietly hoping the Government will consider holding another referendum in the spring before the next European elections on the basis of several opt-outs from core EU policies or declarations explaining how the Lisbon Treaty does not affect Irish tax or abortion laws. British diplomats are more cautious, believing a second failed referendum could provoke an EU crisis&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000274"></a>One understands from that that the discussion has moved on from the text of the Lisbon treaty to some improved version that the Irish&#151;and, we must add, the other 26 member states&#151;will be content with. That will be a new treaty and will lead to a new Bill coming to this House and to the House of Commons for approval.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1036"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1036</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80618-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="080618112000102"></a>We must be prepared to face the facts&#151;the legal facts and the facts of the world&#151;which are that the Lisbon treaty is dead and that there is no possibility of the treaty in its existing form ever coming into operation. Ireland, by its own due process, has rejected it. All the political parties in Ireland accept that result. It is inconceivable that the text, without a change, will ever be put before the Irish people again in a referendum. It is possible that there will be something different in a few months&#146; time, but the Government are planning to ratify a dead treaty. I say &#147;dead&#148;, because the treaty itself so dictates by insisting on unanimous ratification. Nothing in existing law on the Lisbon treaty says that there is some way in which you can deal with it now with less than a 27-member vote.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="080618112000103"></a>The other thing that we need to think about and to which the Government have given no consideration, so far as I can see, is the effect on the Bill, of which we are being asked to give a Third Reading, of the Lisbon treaty never coming into effect. I will take your Lordships to that, but I can summarise in advance by saying that the absence of a Lisbon treaty strikes a lethal blow at the Bill as it is. I shall start with the commencement clause, Clause 8, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="080618112000300"></a>&#147;Section 3 (and the Schedule) come into force in accordance with provision made by the Secretary of State by order&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000275"></a>Clause 3(3) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="080618112000301"></a>&#147;The Table in the Schedule to this Act sets out substitutions required to reflect terminology after the commencement of the Treaty of Lisbon&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000276"></a>The whole exercise of relabelling and amending existing treaties will not come into operation until the treaty of Lisbon has commenced&#151;an event that I submit to your Lordships will never happen. Clause 8(3) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="080618112000302"></a>&#147;The other provisions of this Act come into force on Royal Assent&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000277"></a>that is, in a day or two from now.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="080618112000104"></a>Let us look back to see what we have in the rest of the Bill. Clause 1 defines the treaties that we are talking about. They are defined in terms of signature. I make that point in case anyone seizes on it. The clause states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="080618112000303"></a>&#147;In this Act &#145;the Treaty of Lisbon&#146; means the Treaty of Lisbon Amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty Establishing the European Community signed at Lisbon on 13th December 2007&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80618-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="080618112000105"></a>Clause 2, which is headed, &#147;Addition to the list of treaties&#148;, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="080618112000304"></a>&#147;At the end of the list of treaties in Clause 1(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 ... add&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="080618112000305"></a>&#145;; and</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="080618112000306"></a>(s) the Treaty of Lisbon Amending the Treaty&#146;&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000106"></a>et cetera. That is the language. We are to add to the list of treaties a treaty that will never have any effect. What, precisely, is Parliament doing in telling everybody who writes a textbook or completes a list of up-to-date legislation on the EU that they are to add to the list of relevant EU treaties a treaty that is, at the moment, completely dead? A new one may come along, but we have not got there. In Clause 3, we have the changes in terminology. I am not going to take any more time. I have referred to subsection (3)&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="080618112000309"></a>&#147;Condition 2 is that the Treaty results from the application of Article 48(2) to (5) of the Treaty on European Union (as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000114"></a>That condition can never be satisfied, so Clause 5 can never operate.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="080618112000115"></a>Clause 6, which is headed, &#147;Parliamentary control of decisions&#148;, gives a whole list of provisions that will need parliamentary approval. All make reference either to the treaty of European Union, covered in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (1), or to the treaty on the functioning of the European Union, covered in paragraphs (d) to (i). Those treaties are defined as the Lisbon treaty in subsection (4). The effect of that is that no provision other than Clause 1&#151;and possibly the clause on commencement&#151;will ever come into force, or bite on anything, if there is no treaty of Lisbon. For Parliament to be asked to give a Third Reading to a Bill that has nil effect, and submit it for Royal Assent, seems entirely wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="080618112000116"></a>Your Lordships may say&#151;and I see the smiles of some noble Lords facing me&#151;that there has been a big win for the proponents of the treaty. So it is. Everybody in the House knows that every vote has been won by the Government and their allies and lost by the Conservatives. We all know that. We know that the Bill is in a position where, if we were asked to put up our hands, a majority would be in favour. I have not the slightest objection to any parliamentary procedure that could be devised for taking the opinion of Parliament on approving the terms of the Lisbon treaty. However, we ought not to be asked to go through what is now a charade of Third Reading of a Bill that, as I have demonstrated, can never achieve its intended result.</p>

However,

To complete the passage of this Bill to which both Houses have devoted exhaustive scrutiny will strengthen our Prime Minister&#146;s position in this weekend&#146;s European Council.

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="080618112000127"></a>For many years, the Conservative Party was a responsible Government. When the Danes voted against the Maastricht treaty, in a Statement to both Houses, the Prime Minister, John Major, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="080618112000310"></a>&#147;The ratification and implementation of the treaty is in our national interest&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report,</I> Commons, 3/6/1992; col. 827.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000278"></a>He went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="080618112000311"></a>&#147;My right hon. friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary and I believed that this was the right treaty when we negotiated it. The treaty itself has not changed, nor has my view of the treaty&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 3/6/1992; col. 834.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000279"></a>We now have an irresponsible Conservative Opposition. I note that the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, has now been taken over by the Front Bench, in the same way that so many amendments put down by Bill Cash in the other place were taken over by the Conservative Front Bench in this House.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="080618112000128"></a>We find it difficult to grasp exactly the way that the Conservative Party now feels on this. William Hague said of the Amsterdam Treaty:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="080618112000312"></a>&#147;Amsterdam was a bad treaty; bad for Europe and bad for Britain&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000280"></a>even though it was negotiated largely by John Major&#146;s Government. On the Nice treaty, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="080618112000313"></a>&#147;Is not the truth, when we cut through the spin, that the agreement represents three more major steps to a European superstate?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000281"></a>Now the Conservatives are saying that the Nice and Amsterdam treaties are fine; it is just the Lisbon treaty that takes us one step two far.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="080618112000129"></a>I read with interest Daniel Finkelstein&#146;s article in today&#146;s <I>Times</I>, arguing that the Conservatives will do much better to fight the next election while obscuring their policies, hoping that if they win, they can then spell out their policies. So the suggestion is to fight without a coherent foreign policy which has to include a coherent European policy. That is slick marketing but it is also irresponsible populism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="080618112000130"></a>Last Wednesday, many of us wanted to be at the Tim Garden memorial lecture but had to be here because of the debate that day. I read the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, in that lecture last night. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="080618112000314"></a>&#147;So many of today&#146;s threats to our comfortable existence, to our taken for granted safety and security, are rooted in the ongoing process of globalisation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000282"></a>He talked about climate change, immigration, threats to employment, and rising food and fuel prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="080618112000131"></a>The popular mistrust of globalisation in Britain is focused on the European Union. In the United States, it is focused on the United Nations and on international law; in France, it is focused on the United States,

We recognise how large a problem we all face in democratic politics in all democratic countries, but what is common to all those countries is a popular mistrust of government above the level of the nation state, of negotiations behind closed doors by people who are seen to be out of touch with the common man, and a fear of change imposed by outside forces.</p>

<a name="80618-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="080618112000132"></a>The European Union is, however, the least undemocratic, most visible and transparent institution that we have. Compare, for example, the World Trade Organisation. It is much blamed by Irish farmers&#151;I was following the debate as well&#151;because Peter Mandelson was seen as giving away Irish rights on the beef trade within the World Trade Organisation. The WTO is an international institution which carries direct impact on national policies. There is a WTO assembly&#151;I saw an ITU document asking whether some of us would like to join it. It is completely impotent compared to the European Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="080618112000133"></a>On the OECD, the noble Lord, Lord Howell, who is very keen on the Commonwealth, might like to know that last weekend I was reading the Commonwealth Secretariat paper on co-operation in tax information exchange. The paper attacks the &#147;democratic deficit&#148; within the OECD. It refers to a very interesting paper by Joseph Nye for the Trilateral Commission on the democracy deficit in the IMF and G8.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="080618112000134"></a>We all face a large number of problems of managing to co-operate in a globalised world. I pick up today&#146;s newspapers and I see the <I>Sun</I> and the <I>Daily Mail</I> deliberately distorting the French Government&#146;s decisions on their security strategy paper by saying that in future the Royal Navy is going to be commanded for some purposes from Brussels. They do not actually mention that, for some purposes, the British Royal Navy is already commanded from Brussels; that is where the NATO headquarters are. NATO is an organisation rather less transparent and less held to account than the European Union. Drifting to the fringes of the European Union will not spare us from the management of globalisation; it will simply reduce our influence over its management on climate change, energy, international security, foreign policy&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Howell, has said on several occasions in our debates that we need stronger co-operation on our foreign policy towards Russia and the Middle East&#151;or on containing trans-national crime and terrorism. The Lisbon treaty contains useful measures to strengthen our joint capabilities in managing these issues. We need some of those changes in order to be able to cope more effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="080618112000135"></a>Noble Lords should recognise that there is a real danger of giving way to populism, or following media campaigns with all their slickly obscured internal contradictions, rather than providing a lead&#151;which is what politicians must do in a democracy&#151;explaining political challenges and their choices to our citizens. We failed to do that on the European and international issues from Margaret Thatcher&#146;s prime ministership on. That has been one of the greatest failures of the current Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="080618112000136"></a>May I just compare that with the drift to populism in crime and punishment, which I know many people in this House are horrified by? Again starting under

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="080618112000137"></a>The question that we have to consider today is where British national interests lie. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, referred to certain ingenious devices. This is yet another ingenious device in an attempt to block the passage of this Bill and the implementation of this treaty and to weaken Britain&#146;s commitment to European co-operation. Our choice as a revising House should be taken in the light of Britain&#146;s long-term national interests.</p>

However, I want to make clear my own personal position before I say anything more on the amendment, because many of us on these Benches have been misrepresented.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="080618112000139"></a>I have always been a strong supporter of Europe. In the world in which we live, there is undoubtedly an importance in being an effective partner in a grouping of nations. It was important enough when we first agreed to join; in the present world climate, with security issues, the energy crisis and the food crisis, global warming and the prospect of possibly mass migration, and with the seismic shift of wealth out of European developed countries into oil-producing countries, there never was a more important time for us to have the strength of collective action in these areas. It is because I care about that, and because I have supported Europe over the years, that I am deeply concerned about the great gulf now emerging between that concept, which is honourable and persuadable, and the great public disaffection with Europe.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="080618112000140"></a>I say to those who are the most passionate supporters&#151;and there are many others here, among them distinguished former Commissioners&#151;that the defence on these issues may imperil the very existence of Britain in Europe, if we do not address that public concern. I say to those on the Liberal Benches who have addressed this issue that I was not surprised that my parliamentary neighbour David Heath, as he was when I had the neighbouring constituency, decided to resign from the Front Bench and vote against the Liberal Whip. It was not totally unconnected with the fact that in his own, Liberal-held constituency, they took a poll on whether there should be a referendum and 87 per cent voted in favour. He understood that perhaps&#151;and increasingly the elected Members next door and the Government with their declining popularity may be able to appreciate this as well&#151;that the public are getting more and more concerned about how they appear to be disregarded in these issues and how other, grander people are supposed to know better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="080618112000141"></a>I sat through the whole of last Wednesday&#146;s debate and I have considerable respect for those who have the integrity to say that they are opposed to a referendum.

It is embarrassing for them&#151;it is embarrassing for everybody&#151;that all political parties undertook that there would be a referendum on the constitution. To noble Lords who have tried to make this argument, I have to say that I have no real respect for those who try to pretend that the treaty is significantly and manifestly different from the constitution. The trouble is that the public believe that, too; they believe that there is a subterfuge here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="080618112000142"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Neill, spoke most interestingly, and I look forward with great interest to what the noble Baroness the Leader of the House is going to say in reply to his very interesting points. I have the honour still to be a member of what was the Nolan committee, which the noble Lord took over as chairman. Originally, I had the honour to serve under the late Lord Nolan. I remember that in looking at the standards of conduct in public life, we set out the seven principles that we thought were key. They are repeated in the latest report that the noble Lord will have received. The two key ones were honesty and integrity. I have to say that the way that these issues have been handled&#151;the issue of whether there should be a referendum; the situation we face after the Irish referendum; and people outside looking to build and reinforce public support for the concept of Europe&#151;has been catastrophic. It has done absolutely nothing to improve public attitudes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="080618112000143"></a>I appreciate that the referendum was last week and that now we have a new situation. On the Irish referendum, leaving aside the fact that there is no quick and easy answer to what I thought were pretty powerful points made by the noble Lord, Lord Neill, it is quite clear that all honest people recognise it is all now a bit of a muddle. We do not know what is going to happen. Can anybody in the Chamber tell me what is going to come out of the meetings of the head of states and the Prime Ministers on Thursday and Friday&#151;the next two days? I do not imagine that the Prime Minister knows what is going to come out of them.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="080618112000144"></a>It seems to me to be quite incredible that we do not know what is actually going to happen&#151;my noble friend has put down an amendment proposing late in October for the Third Reading, but somebody might like to table another amendment proposing that we wait until the end of next week, the day before heads of state are due to start considering what we do about this. Is the noble Lord, Lord Neill, right: are we dealing with a corpse? Are we meant to carry on the farce of a Third Reading on a corpse? It seems to me to be an insult to Parliament. People actually care about parliamentary sovereignty and the respect of Parliament. That seems to me to make no contribution to it at all. So I have to say quite simply that it is extraordinary that we should be here today. I think that the only way in which Parliament can recover some honour out of this&#151;and the House of Lords can truly conduct its revising, amending and warning process to the elected House&#151;is that we should pass my noble friend&#146;s amendment tonight.</p>

This morning, he also put his case on Radio 4&#146;s &#147;Today&#148; programme, when he said that he was &#147;a bit&#148; surprised that his amendment was being opposed. Actually, I think that the noble Lord knew jolly well that his amendment would be opposed and why. It was because of the point that he reluctantly admitted to in answer to a question about whether the amendment to the Motion is a pretext. The noble Lord who is, as we all know, a very honest man, accepted that point, saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="080618112000315"></a>&#147;Well, it&#151;accept it is; it&#146;s maybe a pretext&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080618112000284"></a>That much we knew already; his amendment had been tabled, and so we are here debating the reality. It is a debate to delay a Third Reading, and that has not happened in your Lordships&#146; House for more than 30 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="080618112000146"></a>The noble Lord was of course right: this amendment is indeed a pretext. It is a last-ditch attempt to block or delay the Bill. The noble Lord and his party have freely admitted that they do not like the treaty. Now he and they are using the Irish vote to try to block a Bill which has been thoroughly debated in both Houses. He is trying to do so as a pretext. He is trying to do so to delay the properly considered legislative process of Parliament.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="080618112000147"></a>This is the third European treaty that I have debated in this House since I joined your Lordships in 1996. In all that time, the party opposite has upheld the rights, the powers and the legitimate law-making capacity of this Parliament here in this House and in another place. The party opposite have often rightly questioned anything that might lead to this Parliament&#146;s decision-taking responsibilities and powers being in any way compromised. Now, however, the party opposite asks us to set all that to one side to put on hold&#151;to delay&#151;the results of 24 days&#146; debate, 266 tabled amendments and 57 Divisions.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="080618112000148"></a>I simply do not believe that the argument that it is because of the Irish vote is the real one. I believe it is because, in all that debate and after all those discussions, the Opposition failed to land a single punch or pass a single amendment to the Bill. They now look to the Irish vote to deliver for them what they so conspicuously failed to deliver for themselves: to override the legitimate legislative process in which we have been engaged, to put this Parliament&#146;s considered view to one side and to use the Irish vote as an excuse to try all over again.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="080618112000149"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, in citing the Irish vote, made another very telling observation this morning. He was asked whether he would have voted for the Bill if Ireland had voted in favour of the treaty. He said: &#147;Well, frankly, I wouldn&#146;t&#148;. Again, he was very straightforward and honest. However, in this context, the argument that the Irish voted against the treaty in the only referendum held and that they must therefore be listened to, falls completely. If the Irish had voted for the treaty, the noble Lord&#146;s party would not have listened. We know that. They would not have said, &#147;It is the only referendum and they have voted yes&#148;. They would have not have said that at all. They would have said, &#147;We want a British decision, taken in

That is the point. This is a British decision and we as British parliamentarians must take it. We cannot duck that duty.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="080618112000150"></a>There are two issues. First, do we complete the British business of whether to give this Bill a Third Reading in the British Parliament? Our answer to that as parliamentarians must be yes; it is our duty after 26 days of debate properly conducted and 57 votes properly taken. Secondly, our Government must join the debate on how the Irish position is to be dealt with. I do not know what the outcome of that will be; none of us does. Maybe the treaty will fall. Maybe a compromise is available. We can all speculate but, to be frank, it is utterly pointless to do so now.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="080618112000151"></a>I do not want this Parliament&#146;s right to reach a view on this treaty overridden by any decision elsewhere. After all our debates and decisions we cannot be overridden by any outside power: not by the European Union, not by the Commission or the European Parliament and not by the Irish referendum. As parliamentarians it is our right and duty to take our own decision in this Parliament. I urge your Lordships to do it at Third Reading.</p>

I agree with them that this has been a very thorough debate, and I have been through most of these debates. Given our procedures, it has been a rather more detailed and considered debate than that in another House. Therefore, I have no complaints about the procedures. I was expecting a vote from which I would have abstained. I admit that that is not a marvellous position to adopt, but I am not prepared to vote against a treaty under which I may well want to live. But then the Irish vote came. In the referendum debate I said that if the Irish voted yes, I would support the treaty and campaign for it in a referendum.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="080618112000153"></a>In the circumstances we face today, however, we have to make a much trickier and more difficult political decision. I believe that it is our role to help the Irish. Ireland is a country with which we have very close affiliations. We know that a lot of our people would have voted in exactly the same way and in probably rather larger proportions if they had had a referendum. The noble Lord made a good debating point when he asked whether we would have cancelled a referendum. He said that we would not have done so. However, exactly the same situation has occurred. The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, told the country that there would be a referendum on the constitutional treaty regardless of whether the French or the Dutch voted against it in their referendums. When they did vote against it, he very sensibly changed his mind. We had not undertaken all the elaborate procedures to get a referendum going and he saw that it would be pretty pointless to have one in the circumstances of their rejection. I think that that is the answer to the noble Lord&#151;that if a referendum were cancellable, we would have cancelled it; if it were not cancellable because it was due to take place in the next three or four days, we would have gone through with it. We are pragmatic people trying to make practical decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="080618112000154"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, who is in her place, wrote an article in today&#146;s <I>Guardian</I> addressing this complex situation. The article explains her long record of pro-Europeanism and asks:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="080618112000316"></a>&#147;So what is to be done? The European Council, meeting later this week, should launch two working groups with a remit to report back by the end of the year, one to see what elements of the Lisbon treaty that were needed to make the enlarged union function efficiently could be introduced by cooperation between governments&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000285"></a>She suggested that a lot could be done and cited the Maastricht treaty, and I agree with that. She continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="080618112000317"></a>&#147;The second working group would propose steps to reduce the volume of EU legislation, simplify contorted language and provide explanatory memoranda&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000286"></a>and went on to talk about the need to involve our citizens and to learn from this experience of failing to carry conviction with our people if the European Union is to remain rooted in democracy. Those are the practical ways to do it.</p>

<a name="80618-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="080618112000155"></a>Now comes the question. Some people argue that the Prime Minister would be in a better position on Thursday and Friday if the treaty had been ratified. I note that the noble Lord who follows these things agrees with that. That is a serious argument and we should not disparage it. However, we now know pretty comprehensively that a number of countries want to force the Irish to have a second referendum. That is very clear from what the French and German Ministers have said and from a very good report in Monday&#146;s <I>Financial Times</I> from a correspondent who follows these things very closely. There is a very strong element, supported by France and Germany, which wants to muscle the Irish and either put them into a state of undefined limbo for a year or more until the Croatian accession treaty comes along, and proceed with 26 countries, or force them to have a second referendum before that. Those seem to be the only two options. That is unacceptable for many people in this country, and I believe it would be unacceptable to our Prime Minister. It is much better for this House to take this unique opportunity to exercise its judgment and simply say, &#147;Let us wait a few days&#151;maybe no more than  a week&#148;.</p>

He is motivated decently by concern for the Irish position as it stands now and as it will transpire over coming days and coming months. I share that concern completely. I put to him the dilemma that many face regarding how best the United Kingdom can assist our neighbour in the current situation. Is it not better that the treaty is ratified by the United Kingdom Parliament, so putting us in a very strong position to safeguard the interests of Ireland, rather than to put ourselves on the sidelines and thereby add nothing to the strength of Irish arguments?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="080618112000158"></a>I think it would be better to make the decision in this House when we know what the Prime Minister feels after spending two days in the European Council on Thursday and Friday. This debate should be resumed, if he wants, in a week&#146;s time. After all, the Government can bring this debate back. Third Reading can be resumed at any stage on a Motion from the Government, as I understand the Conservative amendment. If the situation is not clear after the Heads of Government meeting, then it could come back at a later stage. I do not want to speak for any longer. My judgment, for what little it is worth, is that it would be better for us to postpone this debate and take a decision on Third Reading either next week, next month or next year.</p>

<p><a name="080618112000287"></a>I am one of those who would rather follow the normal practice. I do not want this House to know what the Prime Minister may want us to do, because the processes come from the other House to this one.

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="080618112000162"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, said that we must give the elected Members a chance. In paragraph (a) of the Motion he says that Parliament should,</p>
<ul><a name="080618112000327"></a>&#147;consider the most appropriate response to the changed circumstances and uncertainties caused by the rejection ... any amendments made to the bill made necessary by those changed circumstances to be considered in detail by the House&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="080618112000163"></a>The problem now is that some people will use it as a precedent. Decisions of this House have sometimes been frustrated by the other place using the Parliament Acts, but this House has always said that it will revise legislation and send it on as it believes it should be adopted. For that reason and for historicity, we really should not push the point because we are frightened of what will happen. The noble Lord, Lord Neill, is absolutely right that nothing in the Bill will be implemented, because the Irish have not agreed with it and because all member states are required to ratify it. However, we have a duty to ratify the treaty or not to ratify it, regardless of what someone else has done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="080618112000164"></a>Suppose the Irish were voting today and suppose the results were known on Friday, would we have ratified it or not? The answer is that we would have ratified it. We would not have waited to see what the Irish were going to do. I also do not buy the idea that the Irish are going to be bullied by anyone else. It is a sovereign state. No one should bully it. If it is bullied, then the British Government will have a duty to say, within the Council of Europe, that that is not on. That is what we should be doing and not fighting about something that will not happen.</p>

I was trying four cases, supposedly of stealing, brutality and lawlessness in the northern part of Uganda. Over two weeks I listened to the evidence but there was not really any evidence against the seven accused. Before I gave my verdict, I looked around and I could see Amin&#146;s killing squad in the court. I knew that if I did not find the defendants guilty, as soon as they left the court they would be killed. I knew that the rule of law said that these men were not guilty, so I had better release them. But I found myself doing something that someone who abides by the rule of law would find quite difficult. All I could do was to say, &#147;I am going to send you to prison for a fortnight and then you will come back and I shall make my decision&#148;. I knew that according to the penal code that was not on, but the people listening did not know that. The seven men were sent to prison and they came back in a fortnight. I looked around and Amin&#146;s men were not there, so I said to them, &#147;There is no evidence against you. You have served the past two weeks, so you can now leave the court&#148;. Afterwards I asked my interpreter to tell them to get out of the country, and they did.</p>

The Irish situation must not hang like the sword of Damocles over our parliamentary process, forcing us to say, &#147;We will not ratify it because of what will happen&#148;.

Nor am I prepared to believe that they are doing so as simply another way of expressing their opposition to the treaty, which I respect but do not share. Therefore, the question which has to be asked is: is any practical benefit to be achieved by deferring Third Reading and ratification, as proposed from the Opposition Front Bench?</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="080618112000168"></a>I can think of only one circumstance in which it would be useful to do that&#151;if the deliberations in Brussels were to lead to a conclusion that there should be an amendment to the treaty which we are proposing to ratify, which would necessitate an amendment to the legislation currently before the House. In my judgment, that is the least likely outcome. There is absolutely no stomach in any country in Europe for renegotiating this treaty and changing its text&#151;none whatever. Therefore, we do not need to consider that option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="080618112000169"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Neill, is right to say, as he did with clarity, that the current treaty cannot become the law of the European Union and the law of this country unless it is ratified by all 27 countries. However, I must depart from his view that because Ireland voted as it did, this is a dead duck&#151;that ratification serves no useful purpose and is a pointless formality. In order to make good that statement, one has to look at what is actually happening, or likely to happen, in the European Union.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="080618112000170"></a>It is correct that we do not know what the outcome will be. However, it is not correct that there is no possibility of ratifying this treaty. Broadly speaking, there are two schools of thought in the European Union and infinite gradation between them. There are those with powerful voices who would like to advance further in the integrative process, whether through this treaty or in some other way, and leave behind Ireland and anyone else who does not want to join them. It is profoundly in the national interest that that school of thought does not prevail in the European Union. It is not bound to prevail but it is sufficiently powerful for it to be worth our exerting every nerve and using whatever procedures are open to us to prevent that happening.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="080618112000171"></a>The alternative school of thought says that the Irish have a problem and we share it. We want to help. We are respectful of what has been done in Ireland and the way to handle that is ultimately a matter for the Irish people. We want, in discussion with them, to see whether anything can be formally decided, short of amending the treaty, which would give sufficient reassurance to the Irish people for them to think again and decide to ratify the treaty. This is not just a vain hope. It has happened in the past with regard to the same country, so you cannot say that it is impossible.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="080618112000172"></a>Of course it will be for the Irish Government to decide, by Irish procedures, whether what is ultimately offered by the member states is acceptable to them, whether through a further referendum, as has happened in the past, or through some parliamentary procedure. If it is not acceptable to them and the no remains a no, then and only then, this treaty will die. It is possible that something will come up which is acceptable to the Irish people. The overriding interest of this country and of this House is to make that more probable rather than less. It is to strengthen the hand of our Government&#151;I do not believe that this will be resolved in the next few days, the next few weeks or the next few months&#151;so that it is possible to devise something which rescues Ireland, rescues the treaty, rescues the European Union, and prevents us being marginalised and put in a box while others forge ahead, as some have always wished would happen.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="080618112000173"></a>I have no doubt that the completion of Third Reading and the ratification of this treaty strengthen the hand of our Government and of the British people in seeking to bring about a solution which is acceptable all round. There is no way of guaranteeing that that will be the case, but there is a way of maximising the possibility that it will happen, not by showing that we never liked the treaty and are glad to have the first opportunity of being shot of it, but rather to say that we have considered it fully and have completed our

The lesson is precisely the opposite&#151;that the Irish referendum has proved that any such referendum was totally inappropriate. I realise that the Irish Government had no option because of the Irish constitution, but I find it almost impossible to imagine any issue in recent years less suitable for decision by referendum than this one. For a referendum, you need an issue that is big and simple. That was true of the 1975 referendum on whether we should stay in or get out of the European Community, as it then was. It was true of the 1997 referendums in Scotland and Wales on devolution. It is emphatically not true of the Lisbon treaty. There is no single big issue&#151;it is a collection of small ones. Few of them are simple. Some are comprehensible only to experts. Taken together, the changes are mainly administrative ones which need to be made following the enlargement of the EU and which will make the EU more democratic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="080618112000180"></a>Why then did the Irish referendum fail? I do not criticise the Irish electorate. There is a simple principle which applies to all of us. If we are asked to vote yes or no to a proposed change and we do not understand it or know what the impact of that change will be, most of us will vote no, as did the Irish.</p>

Surely that denial of democracy that the treaty brings is the root cause of why people are so anxious to have a referendum to express their views.</p>

Some of the blame must rest on the Irish Government and the main political parties in Ireland for failing to provide a much fuller and better explanation of a treaty which they supported. However, much of the trouble rests on the unsuitability of the treaty itself for a decision by referendum. How can you expect hard-working people to spend time learning about the operation of the passerelle clause, the consequences of merging the Third Pillar into the First, or the powers assigned to the proposed President of the Council?</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="080618112000185"></a>The voters were never given adequate reasons for voting &#147;yes&#148;, or for seeing through the smokescreen of misinformation spewed out by the &#147;no&#148; campaign. That is why, when the &#147;no&#148; voters were asked for their reasons by the media, so many of them came up with irrelevant or mistaken reasons, such as: concerns about the recent increases in the cost of food and fuel, which were far beyond the control of the EU; the idea that the treaty would deprive Ireland of its right to neutrality, or force its young men into a European army; the idea that the treaty would require the legalisation of abortion; and the idea, put forward by the leader of a small left-wing party, that the treaty would somehow limit workers' rights, which it does so much to protect.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="080618112000186"></a>So Ireland has proved the absurdity of a referendum on this treaty. I would go further and say that this applied also to the so-called constitution, which was to a large extent no more than what we in Parliament would call a consolidation Act, putting what was previously in several documents into one. I believe that Tony Blair as Prime Minister, and Charles Kennedy as leader of my party at the time, were wrong from the start in supporting a referendum.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="080618112000187"></a>It is difficult to see a way forward. But I have no doubt that the right course for those of us who believe that the Lisbon treaty will make the EU both more efficient and more democratic is to vote for a Third Reading now. The enactment of the Bill will make ratification of the treaty possible. It will not in itself amount to ratification. Ratification, as the law now stands, is an exercise of the royal prerogative and it will be for the Government to decide when that happens. But I believe it is important, and will be helpful in the negotiations which will now commence, for those countries which support the treaty to make their position clear by ratifying it as soon as possible. I will vote accordingly.</p>

I can remember one in particular where it was obvious within days of Royal Assent that it was never going to be more than a dead letter.

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="080618112000189"></a>The proposal to postpone until October does not seem a particularly useful exercise. We should make our own decision today. Not to do so will send an unhappy message to the other member states of the Union, of which we are a member. Whatever anyone in the House says, everyone&#151;apart from two or three Members of the House&#151;is in favour of us remaining members of the European Union. As has been said several times, the Irish Government have not asked us not to ratify. They have left it entirely to us. They have not asked us to hold our horses. We should take a decision and complete the process of Third Reading today.</p>

I much prefer the legal opinion of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, to that of the noble Lord, Lord Neill. The people of Ireland may not have understood the complexities of what they have done, but they spoke clearly and decisively. That is a fact. We have to ask ourselves what the vote tells us and how we in this Parliament should respond. Certainly&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said this well&#151;the vote tells us about the disconnect between the European Union and its citizens. It is a fact that in the past three referendums the people of France, the Netherlands and Ireland have said no.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="080618112000191"></a>It is perhaps an irony that the Lisbon treaty tried to deal with part of that disconnect by increasing the powers of national parliaments in respect of the Union. Euro-cynicism, which some bewail, arises in part because of the success of the European Union. We take so much of that success for granted. The vote also tells us something about referendums and their usefulness in our democracies. It is clearly easier to mobilise opinion to opposition than support with a complex proposition.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="080618112000192"></a>It is difficult to interpret the reasons for the Irish rejection. The reasons that motivated the Irish citizenry last week might be different from the reasons if the referendum were to be run next week, so how can one interpret it? Should one have opt-outs? Should one, for example, satisfy the church by some opt-out saying that abortion is not part of the treaty? Well, it never was. Should one try to satisfy Sinn Fein by saying that neutrality is not part of the treaty? It is not, and never was. That is part of the problem that we face. I note that, in despair, one cartoonist suggested that the only way of getting over the problem is to rename the treaty &#147;the treaty of Dublin&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="080618112000193"></a>So how do we proceed? Chancellor Merkel struck the right note in Gdansk on Monday. She said that we can find only a common solution with Ireland and all the signatories of the treaty. Our partners have asked us to proceed. Certainly the Irish Government have asked us to proceed with our process. We should respect that, but also respect the 18 other member  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1052"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1052</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>countries who have already proceeded to ratification and the others who, pace the Czech Republic and Poland, will, after certain hesitations, almost certainly continue and ratify by November. Therefore, by November, Ireland is likely to be in a minority of one and will certainly need all the friends that it can muster, including this country, as we proceed to those discussions.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="080618112000194"></a>The call for a postponement is plausible and I think that the noble Lord made a strong case for it. I do not question his motives in putting it forward, although some have suggested that this is, in effect, the last gasp of those who are opposed to the treaty. It is a call for a postponement, but a postponement to when? Monday? A month? Three months? The ides of March? Indefinitely? The call for a postponement comes essentially from those who have opposed the treaty root and branch from the start.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="080618112000195"></a>Ireland has made its decision and we should make ours, to strengthen our weight tomorrow and the day after in the Council and in the discussions to come. It is obviously too early to see the solution to this. There may or may not be opt-outs. As some have suggested, there could be some sort of bilateral treaty between Ireland and the 26. The status quo is unattractive, but we could continue with the Nice treaty until we come to a treaty to include Croatia, which will be in 2009 or 2010. However, the postponement of Lisbon would come at a cost and would mean that the European Union would function less smoothly for the benefit of all its citizens.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="080618112000196"></a>Finally, I was saddened by the tone of some of the contributions to the rather lengthy debates that we have had and by the negative, indeed, hostile view of the European Union taken by some noble Lords. Some noble Lords appear to want a European Union that stagnates and is less relevant to the major challenges of today&#146;s world. On the contrary, many of us want to see greater strength through co-operation with our European partners to meet the great challenges of climate change, immigration and terrorism, on all of which we, in our national interest, will have a much stronger voice as part of a stronger and more coherent Union. In my judgment, the passage of the Lisbon treaty will streamline and make the Union more ready to function in the interests of us all.</p>

It seems to me, as other noble Lords have said, that the European Union now faces an extraordinarily difficult situation. All the options in front of us are difficult and many of them are unpalatable. There is the option that 26 member states ratify and implement or try to reach some sort of accommodation with a semi-detached Ireland, which I think all Members of the House would find unacceptable. There is the possibility that the Irish might have a second referendum and say yes after Irish concerns have been met. That was the model for Denmark&#151;with which I was much concerned&#151;which allowed the Maastricht treaty to come into effect. The Irish concerns, however, are unspecific. The no vote was more substantial than in Denmark and the Irish Government at the moment do not seem to want to take that course.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="080618112000199"></a>There is the possibility of the member states agreeing in due course collectively to implement those aspects, or some of the aspects, of the treaty that can be implemented without treaty change, with other aspects being wrapped up later in the treaty on Croatian accession. That course will have its supporters. There is also the possibility of saying that we drop the whole idea and continue on the basis of Nice. All those courses will have their advocates within the EU, including some courses that are deeply unattractive to the United Kingdom. We are indeed already seeing the advocacy of some of the less attractive options by some other member states.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="080618112000200"></a>The debate about these options will be long, difficult and important. Whether we like it or not, that debate has in effect already started. It seems to me essential that the UK should from now play a full and active part in those discussions, starting at the European Council this week. The question is, therefore, whether we are better able to exert our influence in that debate having ratified the treaty of Lisbon or having postponed ratification. That is, as the noble Lord, Lord Owen, said, a matter of judgment.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="080618112000201"></a>My judgment, which is based on my experience of negotiations in the European Union over many years, is that we will have more influence by completing the ratification of the treaty now and by taking part as a full member in the debate starting this weekend. If we do not do that and postpone, there is a real risk that the member states that have long hankered after some sort of two-tier European Union, with Britain in the second tier, however unrealistic that may be, will have an excuse to try to discuss matters on their own without us, arguing that here is Britain once again in some semi-detached position. Let us not give them that excuse but engage fully, as from now, in looking for a course of action that will be acceptable to all 27 member states and to Ireland in particular and  that respects the integrity of the European Union  as a whole. For that reason, I support the Government&#146;s position.</p>

It would be possible for the expanded European Union to operate effectively&#151;indeed, more effectively than it has under Maastricht and Nice&#151;as a result of certain administrative changes that can be made, as the noble Lord, Lord Jay, has said, without any new treaty. The role of the presidency and the size of the Commission, for example, do not require treaties. They can be agreed intergovernmentally among the member states of the European Union.</p>

<a name="80618-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="080618112000203"></a>However, I share some of the views expressed by the noble Lords, Lord Owen and Lord King, in that I believe that there are other lessons to be garnered from the Irish referendum, and they should be taken extremely seriously. The first lesson is that no political elite must simply assume that people will follow it because it is a political elite. I do not wish to be critical of my Irish neighbours, but they made one great mistake: putting a treaty to their people that they had not read themselves. The second lesson is that the Irish referendum tells us more widely that we badly need to be able to get factual information out to our people to counter some of the extraordinary rumours and stories that have beset the European debate.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80618-0006.htm"/>


<a name="80618-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="080618112000204"></a>I shall not repeat except briefly the extent to which the Irish referendum was affected by completely unproven claims that Ireland&#146;s neutrality was at risk. Noble Lords who have read the treaty of Lisbon, as a number of us have done word for word, will know that there was specific mention of the absolute right of a country to be neutral and of the absolute obligation of NATO members to carry out their obligations regardless of the obligations of the European Union more generally. It could not have been more precise, but that made no difference to the claims made at the Irish referendum. The same could be said of the ludicrous arguments about abortion, which is entirely a matter for domestic legislation.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="080618112000205"></a>There is another conclusion to reach. We are just as guilty as the Irish people may be in that we have never effectively set up systems of information and communication that enable our citizens to find out the facts&#151;the objective truths&#151;about the European Union. Let me give the House just one example before inevitably I am interrupted. Noble Lords will see on page 17 of today&#146;s <I>Daily Mail</I>, under the heading &#147;EU LIARS&#148;, the following statement:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="080618112000318"></a>&#147;What is true is that Britain&#146;s ability to get its own way in the EU will be seriously undermined by the Treaty, as we will be giving up the veto in 61 areas and allowing our voting power to be cut by one third&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000289"></a>That is the exact opposite of the truth. Our voting powers under the Lisbon treaty would have been increased from 8 per cent of the voting total in the Council to 12 per cent&#151;a substantial increase. Noble Lords who are mathematically inclined will note that the figure is exactly a third upwards, not downwards. That article appeared today. It would not have been difficult for somebody to check the treaty of Lisbon for the truth. Here is a distinguished, widely circulated newspaper repeating the exact opposite of the facts, and nobody rebutting that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="080618112000206"></a>The Government of Mr Blair had a heavy responsibility, not least because they were inclined to support referenda, to ensure that there was an informed and proper debate in which they would take part if necessary. That never happened, with the result that our electorate, like that of Ireland, have been under an illusion for a long time, because they have not had access to objective information. I do not mean information from people like me who are strongly pro-European, I mean getting as close to the truth and the facts as one possibly can. That is the real lesson of the Irish referendum: the need to stop behaving as though we can have a misinformed, poorly understood debate. Unsurprisingly, the largest group of &#147;no&#148; voters in Ireland said that they did not understand the questions put to them, as my noble friend Lord Goodhart pointed out.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="080618112000207"></a>We have to take the European Union more seriously. We have to include information about us as EU citizens in citizenship education. Believe it or not, we are EU citizens, though one would never know it from our school curricula. We have to take the education of ourselves and our people more seriously by improving the process of European scrutiny and extending best practice&#151;not least as exemplified by the European Scrutiny Committee in another place&#151;to our neighbours in Europe. Before I conclude, here is one interesting fact: when the other member states of the European Union believed that the constitution was likely to go through, a large majority set up new scrutiny machinery to protect subsidiarity. Those machineries were dropped when the constitution went. It is vital that they are reinstated so that people&#146;s doubts about where subsidiarity lies can be met properly in whatever we agree after the European Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="080618112000208"></a>I wish the Prime Minister and the Government well, but I hope we will take into account the necessary humility that we should show as a country that has demanded referenda but failed to produce the necessary basis on which decisions can be made. That was a failure of the previous Government and is one that we, like our Irish neighbours, need to rectify as quickly as possible. The Council should look much more closely than it recently has at how we communicate with our citizens, and give them the opportunity to communicate with us.</p>

If that is the case, noble Lords certainly ought to know. The real reason why we should respond to the Irish vote is not that 1 per cent of Europe&#146;s population should decide the fate of the other 99 per cent, as has recently been said in Berlin, but that that 1 per cent is a proxy for the 400 million citizens of voting age in the European Union who have not been given a voice.

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="080618112000211"></a>I spent many hours on Monday with Mr Declan Ganley, who ran the Libertas campaign for a no vote in Ireland. Your Lordships should know that he is a very serious businessman and very strong pro-European and has studied every word of the treaty. He will not be rolled over easily by modifications. Libertas campaigned on greater democracy, transparency and accountability in Europe. Where the campaign was supported by Sinn Fein it invariably lost votes. It won with a high turnout against the entire Irish political establishment, which outspent it by 15:1. Yet, more than 80 per cent of those who voted no were supporters of the mainstream, pro-treaty political parties.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="080618112000212"></a>When the French and the Dutch rejected the constitution, the Government stopped trying to ratify it. If the same thing does not happen when a little country rejects a treaty, what will the public think? Their worst suspicions will be confirmed, that when the Government can get away with it they push ahead, and only when they face certain defeat in a referendum do they reluctantly do the right thing. The Irish vote will now be &#147;analysed&#148;&#151;that is what they call it&#151;which is code for a concerted effort to explain the vote away and to persuade the Irish to change their mind. But the unpalatable truth is that the affection for the Community that once used to exist is undermined, as my noble friend Lord King said, by just this sort of cynical manoeuvring by the political class.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="080618112000213"></a>We do not know what will happen next and whether Ireland will stand on the rule of law. I believe that it will. The rule of law was established by the treaty of Rome as a community of nation-states&#151;in which case this treaty is dead. Possibly, but very much less likely, modifications will be offered which require a modified response by this country. By closing off our options today, we would help those who wish to do so to put pressure on Ireland, but we would gain absolutely nothing and would sacrifice far too much standing with the people whose assent is indispensable to democracy in this country and in Europe.</p>

History tells us that one possible outcome is that all the other member states will ratify the treaty and that the Irish people will be invited to reconsider their decision, as a number of noble Lords have suggested. If that option is not pursued, Governments will have to try to agree the text of a revised treaty which gives effect to changes in the organisation of the European Union to enable it to operate effectively with 27 members instead of 15.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="080618112000216"></a>The process of obtaining parliamentary approval for the Bill which would enable the Government to ratify the treaty of Lisbon is, after many laborious days of parliamentary debate, nearly completed. We have it in our power to complete it today. We would lose nothing by completing it. In real life we know that there is not going to be a referendum. The Government have decided not to propose a referendum on the treaty of Lisbon and Parliament has accepted that decision. A fortiori the Government will not propose a referendum on a revised treaty which would be almost by definition less far-reaching than the treaty of Lisbon.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="080618112000217"></a>We close no options by completing the parliamentary process today. If the treaty survives and is able to be put into effect in its present form, we shall not have to spend another series of parliamentary days debating its ratification. If it does not survive and a revised treaty is agreed by Governments, we shall have to start again; but the parliamentary process should then be less time-consuming if, before that, we have passed the Bill now before us.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="080618112000218"></a>So it seems to me that the most sensible course is the straightforward one: give the Bill a Third Reading this afternoon, join the ranks of the countries that have ratified the treaty, and give the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary a clear foundation for contributing to the discussions in the forthcoming meeting of the European Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="080618112000220"></a>One of the most remarkable things I have heard in this afternoon&#146;s debate came, to my surprise, from the sagacious lips of the noble Lord, Lord Owen&#151;that we should do everything we could to help the Irish. It does not seem to me that the Irish need any help. It seems to me that they are doing very well on their own, thank you very much. The idea that they need help from us is really quite extraordinary. In my view, it is the rest of us who may need help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="080618112000221"></a>I come now to the next most extraordinary omission. We heard from a former head of the Foreign Office a list of the options that might confront us. It never occurred to him that one of the possibilities is that the Czechs might throw this out. Has it not reached the Foreign Office yet that the Czech constitutional court is sitting on this and that the President of the Czech Republic has said that it is dead? My noble friend Lord Anderson alluded to that, and I am much in debt to him for doing so.</p>

An official statement from Prague this afternoon, from the Prime Minister, Mr Topolanek, said that the Czech ratification has been suspended until the official decision of the constitutional court. He added: &#147;That leaves us time for further debate inside the Czech Republic as well as in the European Union&#148;. That is possibly quite a useful text for our debates this afternoon.</p>

My noble friend Lord Anderson is also the only one I have heard so far this afternoon averting to the position of Poland. I know how far the Polish process has gone. However, it seems that the President of Poland has lost his fountain pen, because he has not signed off on this treaty for several weeks now and there is no sign that he is in a hurry to do so. That deals with those two points.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="080618112000226"></a>I think that our Prime Minister is probably quite happy with what has happened, rather as his predecessor was. We have to recognise that our Prime Minister kept us out of the eurozone, did he not? Yes, he did. Two-speed Europe? We are not at the heart of things, are we? The noble Lord has left the Chamber. We are not in Schengen, are we? How happy are we with the idea of a common corporation tax base? How happy are we with French ideas on competition policy when their frozen yoghurt business is vital to the national interest? What a shower. A common defence policy? Unfortunately, my noble friend Lord Tomlinson is not in his place. The other day he got up and said how all the NATO powers are not pulling their weight in Afghanistan. My noble friend the Minister on the Front Bench did not go so far as to correct him; she merely said that the European powers were not pulling their weight in Afghanistan. We know that the Spaniards, the French and the Germans do not send their troops anywhere very dangerous in Afghanistan&#151;and we are supposed to consider a common defence and security policy with people like that. Frankly, I do not want influence with that crowd; I really do not. I wish that my noble friend would smile a little bit; she looks so unhappy.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="080618112000227"></a>I have no desire whatever to make the European Union more efficient, because the way that it is behaving in its inefficient way is thoroughly distasteful in many directions. I shall not elaborate on those, as my views are well known. One thing that seems absolutely clear is that this treaty is dead. Something else may replace it. I have never been one to whom necrophilia has appealed as a form of activity and I do not intend to engage in an act of political necrophilia this afternoon.</p>

<a name="080618112000228"></a><a name="80618-0006.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80618-0006.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="080618112000449"></a>Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon:</b> My Lords, this has been an exceptional debate and I have been privileged to take part in it. Perhaps in that spirit, I could start off by agreeing with two points made from the Conservative Front Bench, reinforced by my noble friend Lady Williams. The first point is that there must be no question of dealing with the Irish sovereign decision through their referendum other than with respect. It is extremely important that we understand the importance of that vote and that voice. Secondly, it is going to be pretty difficult to decide what to do next. I personally believe that it is difficult to find a way forward now on the basis of the Lisbon treaty. I do not think that there is an appetite in Europe for going back and thinking of institutional reform, although I shall argue in a minute how important that is.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="080618112000229"></a>We are bound to do two things. First, we are bound to consider the present situation carefully. We need time for that consideration and we need some facts that we do not currently have. One of those facts is how the other nations of Europe feel about this treaty. When we come to decide what happens next, we need to know whether others agree with the Irish view that we have heard, because that will have an influence on what happens next. If it is important, as the noble Lord who has just spoken said, to hear and note what the voice of the Czech Government might be&#151;because we do not know that yet&#151;it is equally important to know what the voices of Germany and France will be. Therefore, it is important that we allow the process of parliamentary consideration to continue so that, at the end of that process, we will be able to make a rational judgment, based on who stands where, on what we should do next. That is the rational approach to this, which is why it is so important today that the British Parliament should say what it feels, so that that is part of the consideration. To abandon that process now and say that we are not going to go through the parliamentary process would be to abandon the process of rational reconsideration in favour of pandering to the anti-European prejudices of the Conservative Front Bench.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="080618112000230"></a>I listened with great respect, as I always do, to the noble Lord, Lord King, my neighbour in Somerset. I have always admired him for the position that he has taken, which has been unequivocal and sincere. However&#151;and I hope that he does not mind me saying this&#151;I feel rather sorry for him, because he knows and I know that he and other clear and proud pro-Europeans in the Conservative Party are now living in a party whose centre of gravity has massively changed. This is not anti-Lisbon; it is now becoming anti-Europe. That is where the centre of gravity of the Conservative Party now lies. It will destroy the Conservatives if they get into government as surely in future as it has done in the past. I have heard it in the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, and in the contortions of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, pretending, after some of the things that he has said reiterating the voice of Bill Cash in the other place, that he is somehow a pro-European. Frankly, I feel sorry for the noble Lord. There is no doubt whatever that this amendment has been tabled as a wrecking

Why should we delay? We need to know not only where this country stands but where other countries stand when in due course we consider what to do next. This is  an important procedure and there is no purpose in delaying it.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="080618112000233"></a>I listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Owen, for whom I have great respect. He made the important point, with which I agree, that we need to take a decision based on what we can do to help the Irish. Surely the best people to judge how to help the Irish are the Irish. They have made it perfectly clear to us and other European nations that they wish this ratification process to proceed. That should weigh heavily in our judgments.</p>

<a name="80618-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="080618112000234"></a>Finally, I have heard tonight, and it has been echoed in the words of William Hague in the other place, that somehow we do not need this and that the European Union works perfectly happily as it is. I have been at the other end of a European foreign policy lever as European special representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I was often told that Bosnia was dysfunctional, but I can tell your Lordships that it was far less dysfunctional than Brussels has been. Europe now operates with two heads in places such as Bosnia. We have put into Bosnia and Kosovo more money than the United States, but because we cannot speak with a single voice as between the Council and the Commission, if a Bosnian or a Kosovar wants to get something done, they knock on the door of the United States, which speaks with a single voice, responds quickly and provides the resources needed in the time available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="080618112000235"></a>We cannot do that in Europe. We are wasting our resources and influence even in areas that matter to us gravely. Those who say that we should continue as we have done and that it is all working perfectly okay are saying that we should continue to have a split and divided voice on the key issue of Kosovo, which is so essential to our future, and that we should continue to be content with the idea that we provide differential inputs as Europe within NATO in Afghanistan. I do not think&#151;here I agree so much with the noble Lord, Lord King of Bridgwater&#151;that we have understood the new world in which Europe is now moving. It will be a much chillier world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="080618112000236"></a>Let me give your Lordships some facts. In the early 1990s, Europe had about 35 to 36 per cent of the total global wealth; today, the figure is 20 per cent. At the same time, in the early 1990s, the Far East had 17 per cent of total global wealth; today, the figure is over

We are seeing a massive shift of power and the development of a multipolar world in which it will be no longer good enough for us to have a foreign policy that says that we shall simply hang on to the apron strings of our friendly neighbourhood superpower. We will have to work with much more subtlety and intelligence to get what is best for this country and our citizens in such a world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="080618112000237"></a>We are seeing a retrenching United States, a rising Russia, a rising China and the development of global problems. If anyone in this House believes that we can best serve the interests of our citizens by condemning ourselves to being a series of corks bobbing along in the wake of other people&#146;s ocean liners, they are living in cloud-cuckoo-land. If Europe does not deepen its integration on matters of defence and foreign affairs, we will waste money, influence and time and the decade that we see ahead of us will be much more turbulent, dangerous and difficult.</p>

That process starts in this House and it starts tonight. We should not delay; we must make sure that the voice of this House on this treaty is heard not in five or six months&#146; time but tonight.

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="080618112000243"></a>Ireland last said no to a European treaty, the Nice treaty, in June 2001. The result was 53 per cent no, the same score as this time. In June 2002, the European Council issued the Seville declaration on Irish neutrality. In October 2002, Ireland said yes to the package of the treaty plus the Seville declaration on Irish neutrality by a majority of 63 per cent to 37 per cent. The parliamentary timetable here was as follows. The Irish said no the first time around on 7 June 2001. On 4 July,  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1062"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1062</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the ratification procedures began in the House of Commons. They were completed here on 28 January 2002. In other words, the whole procedure of examining and ratifying the Nice treaty took place after Ireland had said no and before the Irish had identified what they wanted to happen, and before the European Council in March 2002 had heard what they wanted to happen and had agreed what should happen in June 2002.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="080618112000244"></a>I draw two morals from that. First, nobody should be in a great hurry. Nobody should expect anything to happen at the European Council this weekend or by October. The Irish have made a legitimate point. The European Union has to consider it and to think about it. There will be a discussion and it will be for the Irish Government to tell the European Council&#151;and they will not know as of this weekend, as they will not have decided&#151;during the next year or so what they think should be done. This is a wrecking amendment. By October nothing will have become clear in Brussels as to the fate of the treaty.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="080618112000245"></a>Secondly, I shall deal with whether this is an affront to parliamentary procedures. If, in 2001-02, we could start, carry out and complete, both in this place and in the other place, the full process of ratification after Ireland had said no and before the answer was secured for Ireland in Seville that enabled Ireland to say yes, how could it be unprecedented or an affront for us to complete the very last stage of what has been an extremely full analysis now? As for whether it would help the Irish if we did stop&#151;the other argument advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Owen&#151;it would certainly baffle the Irish. It would baffle all our partners in Europe. The noble Lord, Lord Jay, has explained the reasons why he feels that it would be a serious mistake for us to delay. All his reasons were correct. It would baffle the Irish and weaken our ability to assist them in what will be a long, slow, complex and serious debate. So we should complete our job today and give the Bill a Third Reading.</p>

It will signal either that Britain sides with the big battalions against the lone voice of a small country&#151;with the message that the sooner the Irish can be persuaded by some means or other to recant, the better&#151;or that we respect and take full account of the view so clearly expressed by the Irish people. On the basis of both constitutional principle and political pragmatism, it is in the interests of Britain, the Government, my own party and, not least, this House that we should vote for the amendment tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="080618112000248"></a>Europe, however united within the EU, will always be divided in some ways, not least between the so-called Anglo-Saxon model of a vibrant, entrepreneurial, flexible, free-trade Europe and a social Europe that seeks in vain to preserve an unsustainable economic model of subsidy and privilege protected by whatever tariffs or state intervention may be needed to do that. Let us

That threat meant that the Baltic states, along with the majority of those that joined the EU in 2004, decided to follow the Anglo-Saxon model. Britain is the de facto leader of that Anglo-Saxon persuasion in Europe. If we want to remain, as I do, at the heart of Europe, we must maintain that leadership.</p>

One of the many reforms that has not been made, and is not in the treaty of Lisbon, is for the European Parliament to be able to save &#8364;200 million a year by deciding its own seat, which would of course be in Brussels. I had to come back last night because Air France is not very co-operative. However, had I been in Strasbourg, I would have heard my Irish MEP colleague Marian Harkin say:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="080618112000251"></a>At the risk of sounding pedantic, I believe that there is confusion between parliamentary approval through the passing of the Bill and ratification, which is the deposit of the instrument of ratification. We are not ratifying as such but empowering the Government to ratify if that is appropriate in the future. I agree with those who say that it would strengthen the Prime Minister this weekend if we had the certainty of knowing where we stand. I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord King, that we should postpone because of the uncertainty; it is precisely because we do not know what is going to happen that we should hold fast to what we do know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="080618112000252"></a>As has been said on the Benches opposite, this Parliament has had 24 days of debate and has considered hundreds of amendments. The treaty is in the national interest. We all agree that we should respect the voices coming out of Ireland. However, I suggest that we should actually listen to them and to people such as my Irish MEP colleague and the Prime Minister of Ireland, who ask us to continue following our procedures and doing what is in Britain&#146;s national interest. That means passing the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="080618112000254"></a>I support the amendment on the ground of trust. Listening to this debate, I am tempted to think that the expedient way forward for people like me who have opposed the treaty is to support the Government&#151;and,  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1064"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1064</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>indeed, even the noble Lord, Lord Wallace&#151;and vote for the Third Reading because, as the noble Lord, Lord Neill, set out, the Bill refers specifically to the treaty as signed on 13 December 2007. It refers to no other treaty and to no treaty as amended. By passing this Bill, we would effectively put the nails in the coffin of this treaty. One could argue that for people like me, that is a sensible way forward.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="080618112000255"></a>However, there is a question of trust. My noble friend Lord Howell set out very sensible reasons why, given how much uncertainty there is, it would be sensible for this House and, indeed, Parliament to know what the circumstances might be if the treaty were ever to come into force. However, I am afraid that I also have an issue of trust as regards the Government&#151;as I believe have the people of the country&#151;which concerns what they might do if we pass the Bill tonight. Suggestions have been made&#151;we do not know how they will evolve&#151;about protocols being developed for Ireland, implementing parts of the treaty without full ratification and even coming up with a two-speed Europe that puts Ireland in a different position. None of those outcomes ought to be possible without amending this Bill to reflect amendments to the treaty. If we pass this Bill tonight, and the treaty is ratified by the UK, I fear that the Government will argue that they can do those things without coming back to this House. For that reason it is incumbent on us to hold the Government to account and ensure that in the autumn, when we know better what the situation will be, they are able to come back and explain why they want to proceed with the ratification of the treaty, whether there have been changes and whether those need amendments. I might live to regret it if those amendments enabled the Bill and the treaty to survive, but nevertheless it would be the right thing  to do.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="080618112000256"></a>Finally, I say to those who dismiss the voices of the Irish people and of others across Europe that, even if they have not read the fine detail, people understand what lies behind this treaty better than some noble Lords think they do. A democratic Government may be able to defy the will of the people for so long, but eventually the will of the people will prevail.</p>

We have had yet another extraordinarily good and varied debate but I think that we have reached the stage in our deliberations when the House would like to hear from the Lord President and the noble Lord, Lord Howell.

<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1065"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1065</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not a word, but all of them were delivered with great passion, knowledge and experience. I pay tribute to everyone who spoke in this evening&#146;s debate.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="080618112000259"></a>I also pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, for the ingenuity with which he came up with his amendment to the Third Reading procedure. There will probably have been much scratching of heads as those with responsibility for our procedures looked back over precedents. The previous occasion on which such a precedent was used, but with no vote, was in 1984. The previous occasion on which a vote was taken on such a Motion was in 1976. Therefore, we are in territory that is way before my time in the House. But, inevitably, as I reread the speeches in the relevant <I>Hansard</I> of 1976, I recognised some noble Lords&#146; voices.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="080618112000260"></a>I shall be relatively brief because much of what I wanted to say has been said. Having sat through many interesting hours of debate, noble Lords will know where the Government, and I on behalf of the Government, stand on the issues before us. I want to focus on three points. The first is parliamentary sovereignty. Noble Lords have spoken across the House about the importance of parliamentary sovereignty. Indeed, in the Question that the noble Lord, Lord Elton, asked just before we began this debate, that issue was raised again. I stand firm by what I said then and what I have said before: it is important that we act as a sovereign Parliament on behalf of this country and do things which are appropriate for that parliamentary sovereignty, not least in determining the position that this Parliament holds on a treaty of this importance. I recognise the importance that my noble friend Lady Symons attaches to that and the relevance of what the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said about the importance of passing legislation even if it were not to be implemented. It is not that unusual for that to happen. It is completely within the abilities and propriety of your Lordships&#146; House to do so. We are 96 per cent of the way through our deliberations. It is important that we should ratify.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="080618112000261"></a>The Czech Republic is reiterating the position it has been stating since April&#151;that its constitutional court, because of the way it operates, must deliberate. I have now read the entire statement of the Prime Minister and yesterday it was reiterating that position. It will come to a conclusion later in the year, and I respect that. Its constitutional court will make a decision and the Czech Republic will move forward on that basis. It is for each member state to make its decision. Some 18 countries have so far done so. It is our turn to decide what we wish to do.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="080618112000262"></a>The second point has not much featured in this debate. The noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, came closest to covering it. Why are we doing this? What is this treaty about? Why do I think it is a good thing for this country? Noble Lords have touched on issues of, for example, reducing the size of the Commission and making sure that Europe can work more effectively. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and others talked about that. That is important because Europhobe and Europhile alike have said for a long time that Brussels needs to work more effectively, as does the Commission. How much money is spent has featured in discussions, as far as I can remember, over the past 20 to 30 years.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1066"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1066</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80618-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="080618112000263"></a>The treaty also gives national Parliaments a greater say in making European Union laws. That is an important aspect of our deliberations in the past 24 days across your Lordships&#146; House and another place. It is important to recognise that that makes a difference. The treaty also sets out what the European Union can and cannot do&#151;the competences, on which we spent a great deal of time in our earlier discussions. It deals with some of the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, in his life and work in Bosnia-Herzegovina when he dealt with the problems of a European Union with two heads. These are resolved by the treaty. Perhaps more important than anything, it sets overarching priorities for eradicating poverty and introduces children&#146;s rights for the first time into the European Union&#146;s objectives.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="080618112000264"></a>Part of our deliberations&#151;perhaps the most important part of the scrutiny in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;has been looking line by line at what this treaty actually does and agreeing or disagreeing about it. Those who have participated know what it is trying to do. Deliberating on the content of this treaty is important. Making a decision on what we think about the content is important. Whether this treaty ever becomes law across Europe, sending a signal that children&#146;s rights are important or that the eradication of poverty matters makes a difference to our representatives&#151;our Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary&#151;at the discussions. We should not lose sight of what this is all about or what it is for.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="080618112000265"></a>I was also taken by a message in the <I>Evening Standard</I> today from some business leaders who said that this was a &#147;positive step&#148; for Britain, that we should do more to support the treaty and that we in this House should make sure we ratify it. The article says,</p>
<ul><a name="080618112000328"></a>&#147;the European Commission is a force for free markets, and one of the best friends British business could hope for&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000291"></a>That comes not from me, but from eminent business leaders. Noble Lords can look at the <I>Evening Standard</I> website to see what they have said. The content matters and the messages that we send about our views on the content matter hugely when our representatives are in Brussels, deliberating with their colleagues on what should happen next.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="080618112000266"></a>The third and final point is whether a delay would help the process. Does it help the Irish in what they have to do next and will it enable us to amend the treaty? There is no appetite, as has already been said, for trying to find ways to amend treaties or to find new treaties. In the Statement last night, it was made clear that should we want another treaty, it would have to come back to your Lordships&#146; House and to the other place and go through the process again. Would it help the Irish to say, &#147;We will give you four months and then come back to this issue&#148;? I do not think so. Considering everything that noble Lords have said about not wanting to put the Irish in a difficult position and not wanting to bully them, with which I wholeheartedly agree, we should let the Irish have time, but setting some arbitrary four-month timetable does not make any sense. In my view, it sends the opposite signal to the Irish. It says, &#147;You have  only four months and then we shall come back to  the subject&#148;.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="080618112000267"></a>We can look at what has happened on previous occasions. In 1992, it was 17 months before we came back with a solution when the Danish voters rejected  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1067"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1067</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Maastricht treaty; and in 2001, it was 19 months before we came back to the subject when the Irish rejected that in a referendum. The four-month period makes no sense at all, but that is what the noble Lord has proposed. It is inconceivable that in four months&#146; time the Irish Government and colleagues across Europe will have had time to work this through. I do not wish to put any pressure on Ireland that would make the Irish feel that one of their closest friends and allies is insisting that they do so. That would be bullying and that I will not do.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="080618112000268"></a>For those three reasons it is very important that tonight we make our decision. The noble Lord has found a procedure from 1976 which, I presume, he wishes to test in your Lordships' House. This is a very good opportunity for us, once again, to deliberate and to discuss, but we have done that. It is now time to decide that this treaty should receive Royal Assent and that our Prime Minister should go to the European Council tomorrow with our views on what is in the treaty and the ideas behind it in order to participate fully&#151;not in a semi-detached way&#151;in the European Union and be able to ensure that, in doing so, he supports the Irish people who have to think through their next steps.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="080618112000269"></a>I want to end by quoting the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, from a 1976 debate on the same subject. The then Leader of the Opposition said that,</p>
<ul><a name="080618112000329"></a>&#147;what does not seem to me very sensible, if I may say so, is to spend a very long time and a great deal of energy&#151;we on this side, at any rate&#151;in trying to improve and alter the Bill, and then to say that, in spite of all that, we are going to reject it; because if we do that I really do not know what on earth we have been doing all this time&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/11/76; col. 21.]</ul>
<p><a name="080618112000292"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Carrington: a four-month suspension achieves nothing. All it will do is to send the wrong signal to the Irish Government and prevent our Prime Minister going to the European Council with the full knowledge of our views on the content of this treaty. I hope noble Lords will reject the Motion and that we will see this Bill safely on its way.</p>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="080618127000001"></a><a name="80618-0007.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80618-0007.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="080618127000898"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I thank the Lord President for her patience and endurance during recent weeks in coming to this point in the handling of the Bill and in accepting the admitted novelty of  my Motion. On the issue of postponement&#151;it is postponement and not abandonment&#151;until no earlier than 20 October, it is for the Government to decide after that date when it would be sensible to revisit and recommit. That is what the Motion says.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="080618127000002"></a>It would be wrong for me to disguise the fact that I dislike aspects of the Bill. I have made no secret of that throughout our discussions on it and I have made no secret of my view that it is contrary to many people's assertions&#151;what about Maastricht, what about Nice and so on?&#151;that this is a different Bill. First, textually, it obviously is the constitution. We have had long debates on that and people in good faith just disagree. I find it difficult to understand that disagreement because the text is the same. Most people outside this House and in Europe, except one or two, believe that it is the same.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1068"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1068</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80618-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="080618127000003"></a>Secondly, it is of constitutional significance. People may have missed that the reason our Irish friends had a referendum is not because it is in their constitution to do so, but because the High Court judges in Dublin looked at it and ruled that it was a constitution and therefore, a referendum was necessary.</p>

<a name="80618-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="080618127000004"></a>Thirdly, this is a Bill unlike any previous EU Bill before this House, including the European Communities Act 1972. It is more open-ended, with more facilities and provisions for self-expansion and continuation of the expansion of powers than any previous treaty. For all those reasons, I do not disguise my dislike of the Bill. It is full of things that the Government did not want and fought vigorously to reject and failed. Therefore, one has to conclude that the negotiation was not a rip-roaring success. If one reads the details of negotiation, both of the constitutional treaty and the Lisbon treaty, it is fairly clear that Ministers were less deft&#151;or, as one cruel observer said, inexperienced&#151;and as a result did not get the treaty they wanted.</p>

<a name="80618-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="080618127000005"></a>However, our job as an amending Chamber is to improve the Bill and seek to amend it, which, so far in our proceedings, we have not done. We know that we cannot change the treaty; the treaty is now in limbo as the noble Lord, Lord Neill, and others have made clear beyond all doubt. Yet it must be all the more our duty when conditions and facts have changed. A lot of the discussion has been as though we are moving smoothly through a process which we ought now to bring to a conclusion, without accepting that the context has changed radically.</p>

<a name="80618-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="080618127000006"></a>The Irish decision not to ratify means that this treaty is now in a very difficult state. &#147;Almost, not entirely, killed&#148;, says our Foreign Minister and our Prime Minister; &#147;In a coma&#148;, says somebody else; &#147;Asleep&#148;, says somebody else. Certainly, the treaty is not in a state where it is ready to be brought into force. Now that other Parliaments&#151;the Czechs in Prague&#151;have said with authority that they will not proceed and have postponed ratification pending further constitution examinations by their justices, we cannot just say that it does not matter.</p>

<a name="80618-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="080618127000007"></a>I do not carry in my head, but others do, how many more countries have yet to ratify or how many will have second thoughts and have a pause. These are changed conditions. Surely we need to be flexible enough in our approach not to abandon things, not to wipe out any further legislation&#151;that would be absurd&#151;but to pause and reflect and take into account, particularly in the elected Chamber but also in this one, the new conditions which we now face.</p>

<a name="80618-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="080618127000008"></a>It has to be said, too, although I understand the worries about populism and following opinion polls, that what is being done is thoroughly unpopular. We have the guidance of the excellent poll by YouGov, which I know the noble Baroness the Lord President follows very closely, too. This tells us that, in the very latest tests, 54 per cent of those polled want the legislation dropped. They want us to halt the process and think again. Sixty-eight per cent say that the EU is out of touch with normal people. I think that is cruel, but that is what many people throughout Europe believe. That is the sort of attitude that produces the result we have seen in the Republic of Ireland. There is

Of those attempting, the majority choice was Neil Kinnock. That is thoroughly well-deserved. He has most assiduously attended all these debates and I congratulate him.</p>

<a name="80618-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="080618127000009"></a>I fear that, behind all these arguments about the treaty and the worry as to whether we have got the right negotiated bargain over the constitutional treaty&#151;or this one, nearly the same text&#151;lies a legacy of uncertain and often mishandled foreign policy over 10 years or more. We often debated the issues in this House in a very thorough way and pointed to some of the many difficulties we are in today. We have tried, as everyone knows, to please Washington and Brussels. Frankly, we have succeeded with neither. We have greatly weakened ourselves in our position in the world as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="080618127000010"></a>Now we are told by the foreign policy experts that the way to strengthen it is to ratify this treaty, so that we allow the Prime Minister to arrive at the Council of Europe in the next few days in a strong position, enabled to repair things. I find that a very puzzling piece of Foreign Office advice. If the possibility is there to rescue the treaty, as my noble friend Lord Brittan said in a stentorian and tremendous oration&#151;maybe it is; who is to say as there are all sorts of ingenious minds at work?&#151;then far from the Prime Minister arriving with the whole of our legislative process tied up in a bag, finished, concreted over, and settled, he would be in a far more flexible and stronger position if he could say that our legislative process is open and that we have yet to have in the House of Commons, our elected House, the prospect of discussing a new approach and taking on board new developments. Let us at least be wise enough to delay the Bill and ensure that we and the elected Chamber can have a pause for reflection on the new situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="080618127000011"></a>The Irish may say, &#147;Ratify it&#148;, but they also say, &#147;Pause&#148;. They give both messages very loudly indeed. As the noble Lord, Lord Owen, says, the best way to help the Irish would be to pause and reflect, as the Czechs are doing. We ignore at our peril some of the very fine voices of liberty and freedom that come from Prague. That must be the democratic route&#151;not to abandon but to postpone&#151; and we should take that route this evening. Therefore, I seek to test the opinion of the House on that choice.</p>

It was not apparent that it would be opposed by such a great margin, but it was opposed to assert ratification of the reform treaty on Third Reading. The reform treaty stalled on the Irish referendum. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, said that the best approach was to keep the train on the road pending renegotiation, the conduct of which negotiation continues and acknowledges continued membership of the EU. Such is the purpose of this amendment.</p>

The reform treaty, in the wake of the Irish referendum, is unenforceable; no one met or queried the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen. It is as if it were a dead albatross that in some form or other is hanging around the necks of each Government of all member states of the EU unless and until it can be revived by a form of consent acceptable to us in the United Kingdom if it is other than by unanimous consent. We do not have the slightest idea of what is going on and will happen with these negotiations. We cannot rewrite a treaty to accommodate the interests of the political convenience of Governments without the unanimous consent of the Governments who have imposed the treaty&#146;s revision, as before, on the elected&#151;a treaty which is devised to be unintelligible.</p>

Examples are too many to mention, but a particularly good one appeared in a letter dated 30 March 2006 from Mr Barroso to the admirable Daniel Hannan MEP, who had asked what was the legal basis for the new External Action Service. Mr Barroso replied that it was Article III-296(3) of the proposed constitution, which had been killed off by the French and Dutch nine months before. When Mr Hannan pointed that out, Mr Barroso agreed, but the project went ahead anyway in a legal vacuum. When I raised this in an Oral Question on 4 May 2006, the Government supported Mr Barroso. Perhaps the Government have been at their most spineless in their refusal to veto the consistent abuse of Article 308 to extend Brussels&#146; powers in areas that were not covered by the treaties. Your Lordships debated this abuse late in the evening last Monday, 9 June, when I regret I could not be present. I have raised it several times in the past few years in Oral and Written Questions.</p>

<a name="80618-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="080618127000023"></a>By way of a tidying-up exercise, as we are now at Third Reading, I feel I should place the text of the clause on the record in your Lordships&#146; proceedings as the full infamy of its misuse cannot be grasped without knowing what it says. It was Article 235 in the original 1957 Rome treaty and was designed to allow Brussels to make minor tariff adjustments and so on in the then Common Market. It goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="080618127000070"></a>&#147;If action by the Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community, and this Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, take the appropriate measures&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618127000063"></a>One does not have to be a legal genius to see that Brussels can take power under this clause only in the course of the operation of the Common Market, but over the years, and especially since the collapse of the original constitution, Brussels has been put in charge of such initiatives as the grant of food aid to the least developed countries.</p>

Then there is the promotion of urban renewal in Northern Ireland, the provision of assistance to economic reform in Mongolia, a new translation centre for EU bodies, the co-ordination of our social security systems, the prevention and aftercare of terrorism and establishing the EU&#146;s Agency for Fundamental Rights&#151;the agency that will carry out the charter, which will only be made legal by the now-defunct Lisbon treaty. There is also a new &#8364;235 million information campaign, which some of us would call propaganda. That will certainly be needed after the Irish people have spoken and the way they are about to behave. Then there is the regulation of glucose and lactose and the control of civil emergencies inside and outside the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="080618127000031"></a>The House of Commons scrutiny committee&#151;I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that none of what I am saying now was said on 9 June&#151;was overridden in its opposition to several of these initiatives. Indeed, it has produced excellent reports to confirm that. Some of those reports would be really quite funny if they were not so serious. For instance, only two years ago the Government started by agreeing with the committee that Article 308 could not be used to pass the control of civil contingencies to Brussels. The Government replied, in time-honoured fashion, that there was nothing  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1076"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1076</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to worry about because the other member states did not want it either. However, when they discovered that they were alone in COREPER they wrote saying that they did not dare to veto the proposal and wanted to abstain, but they did not dare to do that either because they thought an extension counted as a veto. The Government did not even understand the veto procedure. They believed that unanimity required every country to vote for a proposal, whereas in fact an abstention is just that, and always has been since 1957. The committee wrote back putting the Government straight and pointing out that just because they were alone did not mean that they were wrong. It was too late; the Government had already voted for it.</p>

<a name="80618-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="080618127000032"></a>That is the sort of thing that has been going on, away from public scrutiny of course. It is supported by the judicial activism of the Luxemburg court. As long ago as 1996 the court gave a judgment on the use of Article 308 that simply ignored the requirement that the clause could be used only in the course of the operation of the Common Market. The court did not even mention it but ruled that what mattered was to obtain a Community objective that was not covered elsewhere in the treaties; in other words an illegal Community objective. I might add that that sanctioned the use to which this clause has been put. There is no appeal against such rampant dishonesty in the court. That is why I fear the amendment will not make much difference to the juggernaut&#146;s process, but I support it none the less.</p>

I notice from the two speeches that we have just heard that the Irish referendum is prayed in aid for this amendment. Reference was made to the way that the Irish have spoken and to the idea that their referendum is more democratic than what we do in our two Houses of Parliament. I want to make only one point&#151;I think it is a new one&#151;and then say a sentence or two about the particular amendment.</p>

<a name="80618-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="080618127000034"></a>The point is that the Irish nation was not asked in the referendum question, &#147;Do you agree with the proposal to ratify the treaty of Lisbon?&#148;. That would have been a complicated enough question given the appalling drafting and opaque language of much of the treaty. This is the question they were asked:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="080618127000071"></a>&#147;Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?&#148;;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618127000077"></a>that is, the:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="080618127000072"></a>&#147;Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618127000073"></a>There was then an official press pack which explained the proposal to insert various provisions in Article 29 of the constitution, referring to articles of the Lisbon treaty with a promise to the voters that they could obtain a copy of the Bill in the post office but not a copy of the treaty. It was literally impossible even for a legal genius to understand the question unless they had the Lisbon treaty next to them.</p>

<a name="80618-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="080618127000074"></a>Therefore, when noble Lords say that this is some new event which gives a new opportunity and that our procedures are less democratic, I disagree. So far as this amendment is concerned, it says nothing at all,

Some people have always been in a state of denial and, as far as I can see, always will be in a state of denial. Most people, however, recognise that the Irish vote almost certainly was not a manifestation of Irish eccentricity but an expression of opinion that very likely reflects the opinion of people throughout Europe. Certainly every time that people have been asked to express an opinion in a referendum, they have answered the question in a way that seems to show their concern about the way in which things are going in Europe and about the pace of change. I defy anybody in this House to say that there is not now a serious disconnection between public opinion and the opinions of the elite in Europe. That is a dangerous situation. I am using this amendment to make this simple point. I hope that the elite will show some humility and, as a result of what has happened in Ireland, go away and seriously consider what has gone wrong.</p>

<a name="80618-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="080618127000040"></a>In various debates, noble Lords have stressed their strong views either for or against the Lisbon treaty, but it has always been my view that, although the Lisbon treaty is important and has a lot of useful provisions, if it does not proceed the European Union will still be in a position to make a lot of important day-to-day decisions. One thing that always struck me when I was a Minister in various councils was that for the most part the European Union proceeds by consensus without votes and in a purposeful way. I would like my noble friend the Minister, when she replies to this debate, to confirm that there is absolutely no reason why Governments should not continue to pursue with all the energy that they can muster such issues as tackling climate change or the worrying situation regarding rising food prices in the world, or indeed any of the other challenges that the European Union faces. It is true that the treaty of Lisbon would have improved the decision-making procedures; none the less, if the European Union has the will, it can tackle a lot of these important subjects.</p>

<a name="80618-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="080618127000041"></a>Although it is a blow that, unfortunately, as a result of the Irish vote we are now again thinking of how to improve the European Union&#146;s institutions, I believe that that should not become the sole focus of the European Union, which has a great deal of important business to conduct on a day-to-day basis, as I hope it will do purposefully in the months ahead. For that reason, I think that the amendment is completely unnecessary. The countries of the European Union, whatever their views on the Irish result and on the future institutional framework of the European Union, should get on with tackling the real issues&#151;those issues that are capable of engaging the public&#146;s interest and closing the gap between the elites and the electorates in Europe.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Quin, may be absolutely right that the amendment is completely unnecessary because this is the way in which things will happen. However, we need to hear from the Minister, which is why I warmly welcome the amendment&#151;indeed, I put my name to it&#151;as this is an important opportunity for the Government clearly to set out the position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="080618127000043"></a>I could not agree more with the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, when he described the wording of the treaty as &#147;opaque language&#148; and &#147;appalling drafting&#148;. If he had attended all our debates, that is the message that he would have heard from this side of the House as we sought to improve the way in which this European Union (Amendment) Bill proceeds.</p>

<a name="80618-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="080618127000044"></a>We have heard a lot of versions of why the Irish voted as they did. The answer lies with the Irish people. They have expressed a view. We cannot start surmising why they did it in this particular way. However, I say to the noble Lord that this is not a problem for the Republic of Ireland alone. The plain fact is that this is a problem for the entire European Union and, consequently, any solution must involve the entire European Union.</p>

All I was trying to do, as I am sure the noble Lord understands, was to explain why suggesting that there was more democracy in that referendum than in these Houses of Parliament is completely failing to understand that referendum and what it meant. I do not disagree at all with him about the unsatisfactory drafting, but how can he put his name to an amendment that, as a competent lawyer, he must know perfectly well says something ridiculous? I say that with great respect. It is perfectly plain that this Government can act only according to their lawful powers, so why on earth does one need to table this amendment?</p>

That company is a heady mix. I just feel that the amendment is an ideal opportunity for the Government to reaffirm that they will comply with what he accepts is normal, standard procedure. In some of our debates, we have asked whether this will in fact happen. In the treaty of Lisbon, there is a huge constitutional change: the collapse of the Third Pillar. That dominated the debate in the Irish Republic.</p>

<a name="80618-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="080618127000047"></a>The presence of the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York suggests an analogy to me. When Samson started to collapse the last pillar, he brought the entire edifice crashing down on top of him and wiped out a load of Philistines at the same time. I will not carry the analogy any further. Suffice it to say that, when you collapse a pillar, you have a major impact. That is the message that we have tried to put across.</p>

<a name="80618-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="080618127000048"></a>Finally, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, that of course the Irish referendum has a place in this debate. I did not agree with the noble Baroness when she sought to curtail the debate, because the amendment refers to a situation in which the treaty,</p>
<ul><a name="080618127000078"></a>&#147;has been ratified by all Member States of the European Union&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618127000064"></a>The decision reached by the Irish people is therefore very relevant to this debate. However, the noble Baroness has it in her hands to render any further debate superfluous by saying that she accepts the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="080618127000053"></a>Let me be very clear so that it is on the record and everyone understands exactly what I mean. When I read out the Foreign Secretary&#146;s Statement on Monday night, I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="080618127000075"></a>&#147;The rules of the treaty and the European Union are clear. All 27 member states must ratify the treaty for it to come into force&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 16/6/08; col. 853.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618127000065"></a>That is clearly set out in the treaty. It is unambiguous. For the record, Article 6.2 of the final provisions of the Lisbon treaty is clear on this. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="080618127000076"></a>&#147;This Treaty shall enter into force on 1 January 2009, provided that all the instruments of ratification have been deposited, or, failing that, on the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification by the last signatory State to take this step&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618127000066"></a>Article 48 of the current EU treaty, under which the Lisbon treaty was negotiated, also makes it absolutely clear that amendments to the current treaties can enter into force only,</p>
<ul><a name="080618127000079"></a>&#147;after being ratified by all Member States&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80618-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="080618127000054"></a>The Foreign Secretary and I have already made it clear in our discussions that there is no question whatever of ignoring the vote of the Irish people or of bullying them. The Irish Government have set out clearly their respect for the right of other countries to complete their ratification process. We have discussed that at great length this afternoon in your Lordships&#146; House. The legal position is absolutely clear as a matter of international and EU law and it is not necessary for it to be reflected in an amendment to the Bill. For further clarification, noble Lords will be keen to hear that we understand that treaty preparations will no longer feature on the European Council agenda.</p>

I say that just to clarify the matter. The noble Lord knows this, although I notice that he sprang to his feet rather like a tiger. Therefore, I cannot indicate whether there has been any further discussion. I imagine that there will be discussions on the back of the discussions this weekend on where to go next. I will report back to your Lordships&#146; House, because my right honourable friend the Prime Minister will make a Statement on his return from the European Council. With the leave of the House, I will make a Statement on that, as I am sure noble Lords will wish me to, and ensure that I have an answer to that question, if indeed the matter was discussed. I hope that that will satisfy the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="080618127000057"></a>To make absolutely certain, I checked with parliamentary counsel, which has allowed me to quote it on the question of whether the amendment is necessary.

I hope that I have answered at least what I sense to be the probing part of the amendment in making the current position perfectly clear. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

It is quite apparent that it has served more than one constructive purpose, the last of which was spoken to by the Leader of the House. It is also apparent that we have no idea which way we are going. In those circumstances, it is not prudent or sensible to ratify or to assert that it is right to ratify the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="080618127000059"></a>The amendment was also constructive in that it gave my noble friend Lord Waddington a chance to pick up one of its crucial aspects and the justification for it, which I put to the House: would noble Lords give pride of precedence to the interests of the people and not to the interests of government? My noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral also made an encouraging contribution, which helped the validity of this exercise. The fundamental reason why I seek the opinion of the House&#151;in doing so, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken both for and against&#151;is that I believe that it is fundamentally wrong to assert ratification of something that has to be worked out when one has not the slightest idea how it will be done. For those reasons, I seek the opinion of the House.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="080618143000157"></a> After Clause 6, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="080618143000158"></a>&#147;Parliamentary control of decisions consequent upon any EU member state&#146;s failure to ratify the Treaty</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="080618143000159"></a>(1) The Secretary of State shall report at least quarterly to Parliament on any negotiations in the Council of Ministers or the European Council, or with EU partners, designed to secure ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by all EU member states in the event of any member state failing to ratify the Treaty.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="080618143000160"></a>(2) A Minister of the Crown may not commit the United Kingdom to new obligations, or alter the obligations of the United Kingdom, or agree in the Council of Ministers or the European Council or informally to any non-Treaty proposal, undertaking or document designed to secure ratification of the Treaty by an EU member state that had previously failed to ratify the Treaty, unless Parliamentary approval has been given in accordance with this section.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="080618143000161"></a>(3) Parliamentary approval is given if&#151;</p>
</ul>(a) in each House of Parliament a Minister of the Crown moves a motion that the House approves of Her Majesty&#146;s government&#146;s intention to commit the United Kingdom to new obligations, or to alter the obligation of the United Kingdom, and(b) each House agrees to the motion without amendment.&#148;

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="080618143000003"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have now decided to endorse a leap into the unknown. What do I mean by that? During our debates, the Minister has paid tribute to the extent to which we have probed and have had discussions. But the theme running through many of our debates has been the known unknowns. What is going to happen has been the question dominating so many of our debates. That has reached a crescendo with the decisions that the House has taken today.</p>

<a name="80618-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080618143000004"></a>This amendment standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford seeks to establish parliamentary control over events which will now take place. We have heard from the Minister that the Prime Minister will come to the elected House, the other place&#151;she believes on Monday, but whenever the discussions have concluded&#151;and will report. This amendment seeks to make it clear that Parliament will decide on the future course of action. Subsection (2) of the new clause in Amendment No. 2 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="080618143000162"></a>&#147;A Minister of the Crown may not commit the United Kingdom to new obligations, or alter the obligations of the United Kingdom, or agree&#148;,</p>

<ul><a name="080618143000167"></a>&#147;unless Parliamentary approval has been given&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618143000152"></a>As we do not know what will happen, we should entrench the view, which I think came from all sides of the House, that this is not a problem just for one country. It is a problem for the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="080618143000005"></a>I know that we have a new Prime Minister. We have not heard much about what Tony Blair said when he made a speech following the French referendum result. I recall that he said:</p>

This finally took grip ... The evening of the French result, I remember being

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="080618143000006"></a>In many ways, there is now an opportunity to lift people&#146;s minds above the minutiae, whether it is the collapse of the Third Pillar, or the streamlining or tidying up of certain procedures. Can we not now embark on a debate, for which I argued in one of the amendments that I proposed, to lift the hearts and minds of the people of this country and the peoples of Europe with a new vision, which entrenches for a lifetime to come the vision that we have all held of a peaceful and prosperous Europe? But it must be a Europe with which the people of Europe are comfortable, a Europe where its people are at ease with whatever is proposed.</p>

<a name="80618-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="080618143000007"></a>As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, when I quoted his foreword to that excellent analysis of the negotiations at the start, in many ways ill luck has bedevilled the history of the development of the European Union. It is about time that we got on to the front foot and became much more positive about what Europe means. It means so much to so many of us. It means a great deal to me that my party is the party of Europe and believes in the United Kingdom being at the heart of Europe. That is where I stand. But it can be achieved only if we persuade people.</p>

<a name="80618-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080618143000008"></a>Tony Blair had that very much in mind. He was talking about the need after the constitution to lift the hearts and minds, and it has not happened. I recall that to the European Parliament he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="080618143000164"></a>&#147;It is time to give ourselves a reality check. To receive the wake-up call. The people are blowing the trumpets round the city walls. Are we listening? Have we the political will to go out and meet them so that they regard our leadership as part of the solution not the problem?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618143000153"></a>That went down very well indeed at the European Parliament. Let us try to revive some of that language, listen to the people of Europe and make sure that when the Prime Minister returns with, I hope, the way ahead, it will be up to this House and the other place to debate and approve what further steps are to be taken. I beg to move.</p>

It now is the sheet anchor, the Motion and the first amendment having been rejected. Those do not matter so much so long as this amendment is accepted by the House. It is perfectly plain that no one knows what will happen. It is very much open to question whether, if one merely ratifies, that gives one Government or another Government or all Governments a greater pull. It is all right perhaps as a pull for the Governments but is it a pull for their electorates?</p>

If this institution is going to operate, it has to operate with the approval of the electorate, who have to understand what is going on. Before it can get to the electorate, the member states have to understand what is going on. It is not a question of hurrying the matter.

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="080618143000011"></a>If the whole venture is to hold the approval of the people, then this is a crucial amendment. I know that I have spoken for too long so I shall say no more.</p>

We either ratify or we do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="080618143000013"></a>This proposed new clause is therefore very confusing. I can understand its intention; it is designed to secure ratification of the treaty of Lisbon by all EU member states. But the Irish have rejected it. We have been told by the Benches opposite that it is dead. But if it is dead, what is the reason for this proposed new clause?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="080618143000014"></a>The speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, was really not about the amendment&#151;it was about what we should do to educate all our people to be more positive about Europe. I agree with that, but this amendment is to a Bill which is supposed to be ratifying the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="080618143000015"></a>I suggest that the House rejects the amendment. The noble Lord has made a wonderful speech on what we should do about the positive aspects of Europe; perhaps he will, after hearing a few other speeches, withdraw his amendment.</p>

It would mean that before a British Minister could go to the Council and agree with his Irish colleague and his 25 other colleagues on some,</p>
<ul><a name="080618143000168"></a>&#147;non-Treaty proposal, undertaking or document designed to secure ratification of the Treaty by any EU member state&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080618143000154"></a>he would have had to have votes in both Houses of Parliament. If anybody with any knowledge of Anglo-Irish history believes that the Irish would be more likely to vote &#147;yes&#148; in a referendum if the text that they were being offered had first to be approved by the British Parliament and had then been presented to them as a fait accompli in Brussels, they have not been reading the same history books as me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="080618143000017"></a>I am sure that the intention behind the amendment is entirely benign and helpful. The introduction of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, was full of good will but the consequences would be absolutely disastrous. If we passed the amendment, we would not have to wait 24 hours before the sound of keening from somewhere west of here&#151;around Dublin&#151;would be clearly audible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="080618143000019"></a>In so far as the amendment is concerned, I express my agreement with the two previous speakers. I should like to add one simple point: we have better scrutiny functions of EU matters in this House and indeed in the other place than we do for any other kind of treaty or international agreement. We also have a clear provision that you cannot alter the rights and duties of the people of this country in any way unless authorised to do so under the European Communities Act 1972, as amended. There is therefore no question of the need to obtain prior consent.</p>

<a name="80618-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="080618143000020"></a>This amendment is a kind of super &#147;Bricker&#148; amendment. Those of us with American interests, who remember the effect of Senator Bricker&#146;s amendment in seeking to fetter the ability of the Executive branch in the United States to enter into treaties or other international agreements, and the way in which petty party interests have prevented the United States from, on occasion, being able to negotiate properly, will realise that what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, rightly described as a &#147;cumbersome mechanism&#148; is actually a mechanism for complete stalemate.</p>

It is a great anxiety that many people have&#151;I am one of them&#151;that those who lead the European Union are getting out of touch with the electorate, which is a very bad thing. Everyone knows that for this European Union to move effectively, it has to have people&#146;s backing. Leaders cannot get themselves so divorced from what people think that they operate in a world of their own.</p>

Therefore it is not being allowed. The thinking behind the amendment is, &#147;We have given a certain amount away to Brussels. We cannot give more away without parliamentary approval&#148;. I think that is perfectly reasonable and I hope that the noble Baroness will give it consideration. I am sure that the diktats from on high have said, &#147;On no account must you accept any amendments from the House of Lords&#148;. However, despite that, I hope that the Minister will consider it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="080618143000024"></a>I do not believe that there is anything other than sincerity behind the noble Lord&#146;s attitude in this matter. It is an institutional objection on the part of the Conservative Party to the treaty itself. The party has been utterly consistent from the start. It has rejected, almost in the words of the Book of Common Prayer, the treaty and all its works. It seems to me that the one thing that the Conservative Party, with great respect, is incapable of doing is saying one word that is benign, charitable and laudatory in relation to the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="080618143000025"></a>It reminds one of the story of Napoleon going to a village in the Vend&#233;e in about 1810, when there were doubts as to the loyalty of the people of that locality to his administration. No guns had been fired by way of salute and the mayor ran out and said, &#147;The powder is damp and we would not have been able to fire the guns. Furthermore, the countryside is very dry and had we done so it would have caused fires. Thirdly, Emperor, we have no cannons&#148;. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the Conservative Party in this matter; it has no intention whatever of giving any support to this treaty.</p>

I certainly do not take that view.

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="080618143000029"></a>The simple matter that I would like to test is this. Adverting to the argument made by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, which he put forward with immense articulation, as one would expect, that the treaty is dead and is not resurrectable, I wonder whether in fact that is so. I have been told by eminent Chancery lawyers&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, would agree with this, from his experience over the years&#151;that, if you want to crack a trust or any other disposition of property, you can do so provided that two conditions obtain. The first is that the parties represent the totality of the beneficial interest and the second is that they are all sui generis and have full capacity to act in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="080618143000030"></a>I appreciate that under the treaty of Lisbon it is necessary that there should be total unanimity. However, if a very short treaty was passed by all 27 members, accepting that the treaty of Lisbon should apply only to the 26&#151;or to the 25 if the Czechs dissent&#151;it seems that that would be entirely lawful. It would, of course, be necessary for there to be a referendum in Ireland or, possibly, in the Czech Republic on that account, but if that were so, that second treaty would have amended the treaty of Lisbon in a perfectly valid way. If I am wrong about that, I am glad to be told so. I put the question not only to the Leader of the House but to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, in the hope that there will be a unanimous verdict on the matter.</p>

Already in the Union, including in Ireland, people are beginning to think about just those points, which will emerge later without any transgression at all, to my mind, of the sacred sovereignty of the Irish referendum decision. The decision is their right and entitlement; it was the only country that had to have a referendum and the result is clear, with a margin that was substantial. That has to be honoured, observed and watched with patience, without any rush at all. On these Benches, we support that entirely.</p>

I mention the most reverend Primate not only because of his traditional sacerdotal leadership, for which he is famous&#151;not only in York but elsewhere&#151;but also because he is political. I do not mean that he is party political, but he is political in the wider sense of being logical; indeed, he showed the illogic of the amendment, which was moved very ably by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="080618143000035"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, too, for his remarks. I shall not say who it was but, a while back, I asked a previous ambassador of Ireland in London, now retired, when the note of condescension had disappeared from English or British voices when they were addressing Irish people. He said that it was 15 years ago, when Irish incomes per capita overtook those in the United Kingdom, which I thought was a very practical answer. The idea that we would go back with a textual intervention in Irish affairs, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said, of the nature suggested by this amendment, is unwise.</p>

<a name="80618-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="080618143000036"></a>I also thank my noble friend Lord Lester for his remarks. I would welcome the Minister putting aside the amendment as one to be furthered and pressed, which would be most unwise. However, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for his remarks. There was a lot of support for his thoughts about ensuring that the European Union once again connects strongly with the people. I personally think, and on these Benches the general view is, that the Lisbon treaty actually does that. People complain about the textual complications, but I think that they exaggerate their objections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="080618143000037"></a>I feel strongly that the Lisbon treaty is partly a substantial answer from the European institutions and the sovereign member states, working together to meet the problem, after the Dutch and French referenda results, that the public were, quite rightly, grumbling about being out of touch&#151;and, more important, that the Union was out of touch with the public. But then again, in national politics, many members of the public in Britain and other countries say that they are out of touch with their own Government and that it has all become too complex&#151;or that, in the case of Britain, the political parties are too close together so no one can understand the substantial differences in their programmes, one to another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="080618143000038"></a>There are all sorts of objections like that, but none gainsays the reality of building the European Union as a modern union of 27 sovereign countries&#151;deeply sovereign, with no reduction in any net sovereignty at the margin of any kind whatever; I cannot understand why the Conservative Party continues to fret about that matter&#151;working together to make this a Union of the European peoples. The people themselves, with their diasporas spreading all over Europe and their mobility, with the 10 or now 12 member states coming in, too, with their mobility, and the younger generation, being practical Europeans, find these abstruse arguments about some pretend so-called loss of sovereignty as very much living in the past.</p>

<a name="80618-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="080618143000039"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, moved this amendment not with the intention of seeing it pressed but to leave his little testament, at Third Reading, to remind us again that he is really a genuinely good European and that he feels very embarrassed sitting alongside some of his colleagues, who are not. There is an awkwardness in the Conservative Party, which will come out again and again, particularly if it is aided and abetted by the ministerial reply tonight.</p>

I am very cautious, however, about pre-empting the discussions and debates that will go on, not only in the next two or three days but I believe for some months to come. I think that we are all agreed about allowing the Irish Government the space and time to consider and deliberate properly. Nor should we tie our own hands so completely as not to be able to have those discussions, albeit within the context of what would have to happen should that require a change in the law.</p>

I know that he has made some extraordinarily well received speeches about Europe and that he is not easily taken in on issues when he wants to consider them carefully.

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="080618143000057"></a>Then we discovered that only eight out of the 27 member states support the UK in reforming the common fisheries policy and the common agricultural policy. The reform of the latter is blocked until 2013 anyway, and with that line-up in the Council there does not seem to be any prospect of reform in the foreseeable future. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, promised me a Written Answer on how many of the 25,000 children whom he said are dying every year from malnutrition and associated disease owe their deaths to the CAP, and on the level of other suffering. On the CFP, we are also waiting for an answer on whether any research has been done on the damage to the seabed caused by the 50,000 articulated lorries-worth of dead fish being thrown back every year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="080618143000058"></a>One chink of light in our proceedings was that the Government assured those of us who dared to criticise the EU that we will never become guilty of the European crime of xenophobia, even after the EU becomes a state, with its new legal personality. I fear that over the years, as the EU gets more and more powerful and arrogant, that guarantee will prove worthless, but it will have to do for now.</p>

<a name="80618-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="080618143000059"></a>However, we failed to extract a promise from the Government that the EU&#146;s developing riot police&#151;its gendarmerie force&#151;will not be deployed on British soil. If it ever is, that would cause the people&#146;s disdain for the whole project of European integration to rise and to turn rapidly to hatred. We also failed to get any guarantee that the EU will not intrude further into our direct tax affairs. That will not endear the project to our people either. And, of course, we failed yet again to get the Government to set up an unbiased cost-benefit analysis of our EU membership. Yet again, it was perfectly clear that the Government shied away from such a project because they know that the result would be unacceptable to our people and would lead to our speedy withdrawal.</p>

<a name="80618-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="080618143000060"></a>Perhaps the most surprising and depressing highlight for me was when a former Foreign Secretary, supported by a former High Court judge, moved two amendments that would have given our British courts superiority over the Luxembourg Court of Justice&#146;s jurisdiction in two areas covered by the treaties. I found it difficult to believe my ears that such noble Lords had not understood the most basic legal mechanism by which this project proceeds: that the Luxembourg Court is the final arbiter in all EU matters, and that there is no appeal against it. That was very surprising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="080618143000061"></a>I turn to perhaps the brightest moment for me in our proceedings, which was when the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;my noble friend, if I may refer to him as that&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="080618143000064"></a>I cannot disguise my disappointment that noble Lords in receipt of an EU pension did not, with the notable and honourable exception of the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, see fit to declare that interest in all our debates. I refer your Lordships to our debate on 19 July 2007 when we debated why they should have done so. In summary, the reason why I and my Eurosceptic friends believe that noble EU pensioners should declare that interest in our debates is that EU pensions are perhaps unique in that holders can lose them if they fail to uphold the EU&#146;s interests or bring the EU into disrepute. Our case was unanimously supported by your Lordships&#146; Sub-Committee on Lords&#146; Interests, chaired by no less a personage than the former Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. Then, again I think uniquely, that sub-committee was overruled by our Privileges Committee consisting of party leaders and various prefects of your Lordships&#146; House for largely spurious reasons.</p>

<a name="80618-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080618143000065"></a>It is against that background that no fewer than 12 noble EU pensioners have between them played a leading role in our proceedings.</p>

I was not going to because a number of them are not in their seats, but if I am called to name them I will. We obviously have plenty of time.

That is true for pensions of all Members of the European Parliament. I think that the noble Lord should be a little more circumspect before he throws around allegations. If he is then going to say that there is a supplementary pension scheme, he should also acknowledge that  that supplementary pension scheme is run by a non- profit making organisation, ASBL, which is registered under Luxembourg law. It is not a pension from the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080618143000086"></a>I was concluding with some advice to my former friends in the Conservative Party. Throughout our proceedings they have consistently told us that they want our country to stay at the heart of the project for European integration and that they want it to apply light-touch regulation and to become a dynamic and free country in the wider and richer world beyond. In other words, they want to reform the European Union. They also say that the Lisbon treaty is legally dead because that is what EU law clearly states. As the noble Lord, Lord Neill, points out, that is clearly correct, and they are right about that.</p>

<a name="80618-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080618143000087"></a>By the same token, indeed by the same clauses in the treaties, any reform to change a single comma, let alone to repatriate even the smallest of powers, will require unanimity in the Council of 27 Ministers. If any of Brussels&#146; massive powers are to be repatriated&#151;or, in Euro-speak, if the acquis communautaire is to be reversed&#151;that could be done only on a proposal from the Commission with an agreement from COREPER and, again, unanimity in the Council. Any treaty changes also require unanimity in the Council.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80618-0012.htm"/>


<a name="80618-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080618143000088"></a>I submit to my erstwhile friends that that unanimity will simply not be attainable. Many of them know that truth but dare not confess it. That is why I joined the UK Independence Party, which is the only respectable party telling the truth in this great matter&#151;that the only way out is the door. One word of truth outweighs the whole world; the only question is when.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="080618143000089"></a>Finally, I would like to join with what I am sure other noble Lords are going to say&#151;and if they do not, perhaps I may do it on their behalf&#151;which is to thank the noble Baroness the Lord President for her extraordinarily courteous behaviour throughout our sometimes exhausting procedures and congratulate her on the great stamina she has displayed. I would also include the noble Lord, Lord Bach, in those sentiments. Like the noble Baroness the Lord President, he had to defend the indefensible. But they did it very well. I cannot, on the other hand, congratulate them or the Government on what they have done in passing this fateful Bill. I fear they have made a terrible mistake which will give rise to growing anger among our people and the peoples of other European nations, until eventually the whole project falls apart. By their fruits shall ye know them.</p>

Talking about the future of Europe, he said:</p>

I still find that amazing, having taken two weeks to recover when I went to Peru. That has been remarkable, and the noble Baroness has covered all these vast issues. Bills such as this cover every aspect of our national life, and she has dealt with them in masterly fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080618143000100"></a>As we saw it on these Benches, our job was to amend and improve the Bill, and give Parliament the full opportunity to adjust to the enormous changes that have clearly taken place while we have legislated. In that, we have clearly failed. We tested the view of the House on many occasions and got a number of votes&#151;but not quite enough because there was, to my right, an army whose jovial leader, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has just said some generous things about me. I nearly always enjoyed almost everything he said; there were just one or two jarring observations, and I am still sore from being called a &#147;barrack-room lawyer&#148;. For the rest, he and his party have followed a consistent line; it is not one I like at all, and it has enabled the Government to win and my party to be defeated on almost every occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080618143000101"></a>If there is a message that we have tried to purvey at a higher level than the mere winning of amendments, it is to the Olympians&#151;the Olympians here in this House, in Brussels and elsewhere, who talk about our European destiny, the need for more integration, and so on. These people must face the fact that the world has changed. I do not say that there is arrogance in the super-Europhile line; it is not arrogance at all. It is just that they are completely out of touch with the new realities of an empowered citizenry in an interactive age. That is the message that came bouncing back to us from Ireland, and we will hear more of it. There will presumably be more Bills and statutory orders on the way before this treaty business can be settled, either with a new treaty, which will require new legislation, or with adjustments of some kind to the present arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="080618143000102"></a>Now the Bill goes on to Royal Assent and embraces a treaty which is currently, at best, in limbo and may be altogether deceased. It leaves many knowns and unknowns, and I fear that we will return to this subject often in the future. For the moment, we have done our best. We have soldiered on from all sides. All who have taken part have performed in good faith, and with a determination to put their view in a way consistent with the best and highest standards of your Lordships&#146; House. I thank all noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080618143000104"></a>Noble Lords have conducted themselves with enormous integrity and passion. I have been deeply privileged to be part of the passage of the Bill, and to have led for the Government. I am extremely grateful to everyone who has participated, from whatever side of the argument. I am, of course, especially grateful to my happy band, sitting behind me now, who have participated and brought enormous experience, knowledge and wisdom to our discussions, not to mention the odd joke from a sedentary position from my noble friend Lord Tomlinson.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080618143000105"></a>I am extremely grateful to the Liberal Democrat Party for its support for the Bill; it has a long tradition of support for Europe. I understand that noble Lords on those Benches did so in the knowledge that they were clear about their own position and about pushing the Government to ensure that we do more to promote our role and work in Europe. I take that very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080618143000106"></a>We also had support from the Cross Benches, particularly the noble Lords, Lord Hannay, Lord Kerr and Lord Jay, but many others as well. I pay tribute again to the committee under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and the Constitution Committee under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for their work, which has been quite extraordinary.

All noble Lords who have dealt with my office know that she has been truly magnificent, having arrived 24 hours before we began this process. I fear that, sadly, she will leave me at the end of the week to go on to greater and higher things in the Foreign Office. The Bill team has been magnificent, and has kept me on the straight and narrow.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="080618143000112"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I now turn to the most important item on the Order Paper today. The report that is before your Lordships' House, which is the subject of this debate, was prepared following an inquiry by Sub-Committee F of the European Union Select Committee between July 2007 and February 2008. But between July and October last year the committee received written evidence and heard some of its oral evidence. During that time, the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, was chairman of the sub-committee. I pay tribute to him for his work and wisdom in guiding the sub-committee through not just the first part of the inquiry but many earlier inquiries over which he presided. I also very much wish to thank Michael Collon, our clerk, who was extraordinarily helpful, and our advisers, Anneliese Baldaccini, Dr Valsamis Mitsilegas and Major-General Adrian Freer, who helped us hugely in preparing our report.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080618143000113"></a>I need hardly remind your Lordships that while Select Committee reports are addressed to the House, the majority of the committee&#146;s conclusions and recommendations are addressed to government. The Government&#146;s response to these recommendations is an essential part of the work of the European Union Select Committee and other Select Committees. It enables debates such as this to concentrate on those areas where differences of view between the committee and the Government are known to remain, and to seek the views of the Minister on those matters. I am sure that there will be no dissension whatever in the House on my next point. It is important that the response to these reports should be received within the statutory two months from the date of publication, as laid down in the Cabinet Office guidance. This allows the response to be considered by the Select Committee and its sub-committees, such as the one of which I have the honour to be chairman, well before a debate is arranged.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080618143000114"></a>In this case the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, as chairman of the European Union Select Committee, sent the report we are debating to Mr Liam Byrne MP, the Home Office Minister responsible for borders and immigration, on 5 March, which was the date we published our report. He reminded Mr Byrne at that time that the response was due by 5 May. Despite repeated further reminders, we did not receive the response until last Friday, 13 June. There has been no opportunity to discuss it within the sub-committee. We met only this morning and we had a very full

There was no way that we could possibly discuss this report, which was received, as I say, only last Friday. I hope that the Minister&#151;I am glad to see the Chief Whip is present&#151;will make known to ministerial colleagues how much the whole committee regrets this. I shall return to Mr Byrne&#146;s attitude but I leave it aside for the minute.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="080618143000115"></a>Frontex, which is the European borders agency, is now nearly a year older than when we started our inquiry, but it is still a relatively new agency which has been operational for barely three years. Many of our witnesses agreed that this was a good time for us to conduct our inquiry and give our views on the direction in which we felt it should develop. The regulation setting up Frontex is a measure which builds on the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom, of course, is not part of Schengen, nor I believe is it likely to be in the foreseeable future. The position with regard to our exclusion from Schengen is one which the committee fully supports, but the consequence is that the United Kingdom cannot participate fully in the activities of Frontex. Nevertheless, the Government have always given Frontex their full support&#151;we commend them for that&#151;and have taken part in its activities to the fullest possible extent. The committee welcomed this, and we hope that it will continue.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="080618143000116"></a>It is no part of the duties of Frontex to take over the duties of member states to protect their own external borders, nor should it be. Its task is to co-ordinate member states&#146; efforts in doing so. We believe that Frontex is doing a good job. Its work is, of course, focused on the external borders of the Schengen states which are particularly sensitive to illegal immigration; that is, the eastern land borders of the European Union, and the Mediterranean maritime borders. Protecting them raises very different problems.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="080618143000117"></a>When we started this inquiry I was totally unaware of the huge distances which these frontiers cover. Until the enlargement of the European Union in 2004, the eastern land border was just 4,000 kilometres long. After the 2004 enlargement, this increased to 6,000 kilometres, and the recent addition of Bulgaria and Romania makes a land border currently 8,000 kilometres long&#151;that is 5,000 miles&#151;stretching from the border between Finland and Russia in the north down to the Black Sea and round into the western Balkans. When the committee visited the headquarters of Frontex in Warsaw, we took the opportunity to spend a day at the border between Poland and Ukraine. The border post we saw seemed to us to be well equipped, and we were told that other posts were equally well equipped, but, of course, there are huge spaces in between these border posts which are patrolled barely, if at all. It is not so much that some of these frontiers are leaking sieves; they are more a gaping hole in many cases.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="080618143000118"></a>Frontex can help by organising exercises concentrating larger resources from a number of member states on relatively small parts of the border which are most at risk. The main successes of Frontex so far are, however, on the southern maritime borders of the European Union: that is, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Spain and Portugal. These borders are more than 34,000 kilometres long if one includes the 3,000 Greek islands, and are particularly vulnerable to illegal  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1101"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>immigrants from west and north Africa. However, they are rather easier to police than the land borders, and exercises co-ordinated by Frontex have been conspicuously successful in deterring and detecting illegal immigration.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="080618143000119"></a>We have listed all these exercises in the appendix to our report. The United Kingdom has taken part in a great many of them yet is under no obligation to take part in them since we are not a Frontex state. We can take part in them only by invitation. The United Kingdom has great experience in guarding its maritime borders. The committee was very glad that the Government put this expertise at the disposal of other member states.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="080618143000120"></a>It is particularly the smaller states which benefit from this. One of the smallest, Malta, is in the front line for immigrants crossing the Mediterranean from north Africa. We received very impressive evidence on behalf of the Maltese armed forces. I cannot emphasise how much we were impressed by the quality of the evidence we were given by one particular individual from Malta, which clarified many details of past events and persuaded us that the larger member states ought to do more to assist Malta and other vulnerable, small states.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="080618143000121"></a>Our report did not specifically recommend the redeployment of asylum seekers, believing that this ought to be done during the review of Dublin 2&#151;the regulation determining which state is responsible for the processing of asylum applications. The Government tell us they are opposed to physical burden-sharing, believing that it would merely attract more asylum seekers. However, we recommended that Malta and other small states bearing a disproportionate burden should receive increased financial assistance. The Government have accepted this to a limited extent, but the committee feels it would be good to go further. A contribution from the European Refugee Fund is all very well but we would like to see the Government actively supporting Malta when it seeks financial assistance for the protection of its borders.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="080618143000122"></a>I have already explained that the role of Frontex is to co-ordinate. For these exercises, it relies entirely on the men, ships, helicopters and other equipment of the member states. This has not always worked as well as it might. Some of our witnesses suggested that Frontex should acquire its own operational assets, which would be allowed under the current regulation. There are severe legal and practical difficulties about this. Our view was that, while the position might change over time, it was premature to consider it for the present. I am glad to see in the response which came last Friday that the Government support this view.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="080618143000123"></a>Frontex had its origins in the failure of member states to agree in 2002 on the long-term aim of setting up a European border guard, yet there are already some, including the Commission, who would like to discuss the possibility of Frontex developing in the longer term into a European border guard of the type on which agreement could not be reached six years ago. The committee regarded this suggestion as ill conceived and at best entirely premature. Frontex is still finding its feet. Its workload and budget have doubled every year so far and we believe the quality  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1102"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will suffer if this goes on. We recommend a period of consolidation, allowing it to develop and improve the work it was set up to do. This is an important recommendation, but for some reason the Government have not commented on it in their response. Mr Byrne appears to have ignored it. I ask again whether the Government agree that this is the right way for Frontex to develop in future.</p>

<a name="80618-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="080618143000124"></a>Even though co-ordination of controls at the United Kingdom&#146;s borders is no part of the duties of Frontex, an examination of those controls was certainly part of the committee&#146;s duties. It was this that led to the conclusion, with which the Government appear to have the most difficulty, that the way in which the United Kingdom&#146;s borders are at present safeguarded is inadequate and unacceptable. I repeat and draw particular attention to the words we put in our report, the way they &#147;are at present safeguarded&#148;. That means the situation they were in at the time our report was published. For example, in January the committee visited the Eurotunnel terminal at Coquelles and the ferry port at Calais, both of which have juxtaposed French and British border controls. We were very impressed by what we saw, which included all sorts of state-of-the-art technology which can detect a heartbeat inside a 40-tonne container lorry, carbon-dioxide probes which can detect the increased levels exhaled by human beings, and sniffer dogs.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80618-0013.htm"/>


<a name="80618-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="080618143000125"></a>Yet once the lorries have passed through these highly sophisticated controls and any illegal migrants have been removed, one would hope that the lorries would remain closely guarded so that they are still free of clandestine illegal migrants when they board the ferries. That is not what happens. The lorries are placed in a large area where they wait, often for many hours, before they load on to the ferries and sail. At the time of our visit that area was surrounded by a single perimeter fence of considerable length which would be no great obstacle to a determined person. Indeed it has been no great obstacle since we heard that 1,500 persons a year found their way through it and on to lorries bound for England. They were apprehended when the lorries landed in England. Goodness knows how many more than that were not apprehended at Dover. That was what we found and reported. We recommended that more effective fencing should urgently be put in place.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="080618143000126"></a>The Government told us in their response, three months later, that the Calais port authority has introduced external perimeter foot patrols with dogs &#147;in recent months&#148;. Could it be that these recent months are the three months since the publication of our report? I suspect they are. We were told at the time we were there that come dusk, as night comes on, you can see people walking round the edge of the fence waiting to get over it. The Government also told us that the French authorities have announced that a higher, double layer of fencing is to be erected &#147;within the coming weeks&#148;. Has that been decided since the committee&#146;s report and when is this likely to be completed?</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="080618143000127"></a>Turning from this example to the wider picture of UK border controls, we accept that much has been done over the last two years to improve matters. The Minister for Borders and Immigration lists in his  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1103"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>response to us some of the achievements of 2007: the numbers of illegal immigrants stopped; the creation of the new UK Border Agency and the resources devoted to it; and many other matters which the noble Lord will no doubt expand on in his reply.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="080618143000128"></a>As a committee, we visited Heathrow in December last year to examine the border controls there, and as recently as last week we visited the Joint Border Operations Centre at Heathrow to see the practical use made of passenger name record data, the subject of our most recent inquiry.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="080618143000129"></a>All of these are welcome developments. Yet the fact remains that after the successful trial of Project Semaphore, the e-Borders system is still only in its relatively early stages. By the end of December 2009, it will process only 60 per cent of passenger movements. By the end of 2010, that will have risen to 95 per cent, but the full processing of 100 per cent of all passenger and crew movements is not planned until March 2014.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="080618143000130"></a>When all these plans are in place, I hope it may be safe for the Government to say that our borders are adequately safeguarded, but that is many years away. This was why we strongly recommended that the work on e-Borders should be brought forward as a matter of urgency to protect Britain's territorial integrity. As I said, our report's assessment looks at things as they are now, and for the present it would not have been right for the committee to suggest that the position is acceptable.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="080618143000131"></a>It seems to me that, by listing these improvements in the next few years, Mr Byrne has most successfully shot himself in the foot in trying to refute the committee&#146;s view that &#147;at present&#148; our border controls are inadequate and unacceptable. He tells us all the things that will happen in the future to make them acceptable. Therefore, I insist very strongly on the reservation in the report. The committee is extremely unhappy about the attitude of Mr Byrne to the European Union Select Committee. I remind noble Lords that this is the Minister who was uniquely described by the Leader of the House on 10 June, only two weeks ago, as the culprit in failing until June to reply to a Parliamentary Question of the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, laid on 24 January.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080618143000132"></a>Furthermore, my committee is exceptionally irritated by the attitude of Mr Byrne, who received two letters from the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, the first of which was dated 26 July last year. The noble Lord at last received a reply 10 and a half months after he wrote the letter. I understand the Chief Whip hiding her head in her hands. I know what attitude I would have taken when I was the Government Chief Whip at the other end. The reply to the first letter came 10 and a half months after the letter was sent and overshot an opt-in deadline which expired last September. The second letter sent by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, is still, to this day, awaiting a reply. I do not know what goes on in that department. Is it surprising that the Home Office is described as &#147;unfit for purpose&#148; when a Minister as dilatory as that looks after such affairs and the relations between the department and the European Union Select Committee of your Lordships&#146; House? I commend the report to the House.</p>

We all found the inquiry instructive and enjoyed putting the report together. I concur with his remarks about the way in which the Home Office has responded to a number of the questions asked by the sub-committee.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="080618143000135"></a>What really struck me about this report was the trip, which the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, mentioned, to see Frontex in action in a bureaucratic sense. Having struggled through the usual Schengen barriers to keep United Kingdom citizens out of the rest of Europe, we arrived in Poland. Although I have travelled much in eastern Europe, mainly before the Iron Curtain came down, it was a great privilege, particularly in relation to the Lisbon treaty, which we have talked about today, to be in a state that had so recently entered the European Union and then to go down to a border with Ukraine. I remind the House that that border was previously the Soviet Union border, to the east of the European Union. It was fantastic to see no military installations or hardware of any kind on either side of that border. As a European citizen, I could have walked across the border without a visa to Kiev and beyond. What a fantastic achievement that has been over the past 10 or 20 years since the fall of the Soviet empire.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="080618143000136"></a>Frontex has a big task. There are 34,000 kilometres of southern maritime border and 8,000 kilometres of eastern land border. That is quite a task in terms of controlling people coming in. Since our visit, I think that 10 member states have now become part of the Schengen process. There has been confidence among the existing Schengen states to push that border outwards so that now we have a much broader Schengen area of freedom of movement in Europe. With that freedom of movement comes a need to ensure that borders are secure. We were shown that Frontex is a small organisation at the moment. The expectations of it on the part of the European parliamentarians whom we met, many of its staff and the Commission need to be held back, as almost too much might be expected of it in trying to solve all the difficulties concerned with securing borders against crime, trafficking, illegal immigration and all the other matters that are so important to our territorial integrity.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080618143000137"></a>The other irony that came out in our inquiry related to the fact that Britain, although it wanted to be a complete part of this organisation, effectively became excluded because of our decision not to be part of the Schengen acquis. Although we are an important operator&#151;I congratulate the Government on the extent of the participation that we manage&#151;we are unable to become a full partner of Frontex, which is an important organisation for the future. The United Kingdom, in this important policy area of freedom of movement, is half in and half out of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080618143000138"></a>When Liam Byrne, the Minister, came to the committee, I asked him whether Britain would move towards Schengen. I expected him to say, &#147;No chance&#148;, so I was delighted when he said, &#147;Possibly, but not yet&#148;. I congratulate the Government on that response, because this is an area where one has always felt that the door has been completely closed. One has felt that the Government did not want to risk the <I>Daily Mail</I> and <I>Daily Express</I> headlines saying that opening our borders at some point in the future would be a step too far. We at least had a positive response, which might give some hope that we can participate more fully in Europe in the future.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080618143000139"></a>A practical issue came up concerning the southern maritime border operations. As the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, said, these are important and have worked well, it seems, as joint operations. There are a number of issues to do with sea rescue operations and refugees&#151;how and where refugees are landed and sent back and, in terms of their human rights, consistency in the way in which they are processed. On many occasions, Frontex resources have been completely taken up&#151;quite rightly&#151;by the international law requirement to rescue refugees in peril of losing their lives. That needs to happen. The issue of the migration routes in the southern Mediterranean needs a lot more consideration, to bring all the different strands of rescue, refugees, asylum seeking and border work together. Frontex is adequately starting to approach that, but I think that the issues need to be sorted out at member-state level.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080618143000140"></a>Lastly, I am always intrigued, when we talk about these subjects, about the status of Gibraltar. Gibraltar felt strongly about a number of issues to do with Frontex. It was clearly excluded. The Frontex agreements fudged the issue altogether. I would be interested to hear from the Minister what discussions there have been with the Gibraltar Government about Frontex and whether any of the issues that came up in our correspondence with Gibraltar have yet been resolved.</p>

At last we are talking about something real. Following the hours of debate on the Lisbon treaty and the grandstanding that we have continuously heard from party politicians on the Bill, it is refreshing to discuss the more fundamental issues facing Europe. I have been waiting a long time to say that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080618143000142"></a>On behalf of my noble friend Lord Wright, I also thank the noble Lord for his kind remarks. I note what he said about my noble friend Lord Grenfell&#146;s position. This is a most informative report and I expect that the Minister will express the gratitude and relief of the whole Government for it. It is a tribute to this House. It is also a tribute to the EU&#146;s flexibility. I especially commend it to Eurosceptics, who do not seem to understand the extent of the network of collaboration across Europe today.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080618143000143"></a>One thing that emerges from this forensic account of Frontex is that much still has to be learnt in this country about police operations and border controls in Europe, as they can concern us directly. Frontex is  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1106"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>growing fast but is brand new. The UK, having opted out, is entitled only to very limited representation. Therefore, even our officials are still far from understanding, let alone participating in, the many aspects of its work. I agree with the committee that, as Frontex expands, the UK should extend its relationship with it as far as is possible within the legal framework.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080618143000144"></a>I think that the UKBA is the only UK agency directly linked with Frontex. We have much to gain from it in detecting illegal immigration and, besides its role in tracking criminals, we could use it in a more positive sense to improve our recognition of genuine asylum seekers. As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, just said, at the same time we and European parliamentarians have to be careful not to expect too much of it. We must allow it to develop naturally; my noble friend Lord Listowel, who was on the committee, reminded me of that. I do not share the view of some witnesses that it should become yet another arm of counterterrorism and I am relieved that the committee has come to the same conclusion. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that. The committee also discourages Frontex from dealing with issues such as forced returns, or refoulement, and has asked for safeguards in any agreement with third countries to which asylum seekers are repatriated.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080618143000145"></a>My interest in refugees goes back to 1956, when my sister was an Oxford student helping Hungarians. I have taken part in many discussions in the House and again feel frustrated that in the European debates we have not discussed asylum and international development at all. However, now is not the time for that. I am a member of the Independent Asylum Commission, which is recommending improvements in our present reception and treatment of asylum seekers.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="080618143000146"></a>I am pleased that the committee recommends more co-operation with UNHCR, as High Commissioner António Guterres himself said this week in London when he warned of the slowing down of any common asylum policy as a result of the loss of the Lisbon treaty. We in the UK may have opted for handling our own borders, but we benefit greatly from the activities of UNHCR and the other refugee agencies both here and in Europe. The Refugee Council and its European partner, the ECRE&#151;the European Council on Refugees and Exiles&#151;submitted evidence to the committee and have already generally welcomed the committee&#146;s recommendations on behalf of asylum seekers. However, they are concerned about the present level of training of border guards acting under Frontex. How do those guards now respond to refugees fleeing persecution on the external frontier? Do they have the necessary legal knowledge and back-up to cope with them? In other words, will the RABITs&#151;the rapid border intervention teams&#151;in turn require expert teams that they can call on at short notice? I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on that; the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, also raised the subject.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="080618143000147"></a>As we have heard, tighter border controls and the vastly expanded frontier of Europe mean that there is still no efficient means of distinguishing the genuine asylum seeker from the large numbers of illegal immigrants, including the migrants escaping poverty in Africa. The Iraq conflict is one example. It has  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1107"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>caused the exodus of something like 2.4 million refugees since 2003, thousands of whom pass through Syria and Jordan heading for Europe. According to the ECRE, Frontex is specifically targeting Iraqis, including those fleeing persecution in Iraq for whom there are still no legal routes into European countries.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="080618143000148"></a>The committee&#146;s report recommends that there should be better and more detailed information on people crossing EU borders and the reasons behind their journey. However, the UK&#146;s immediate recognition rates for Iraqis have been as low as 13 per cent in 2006 and 11 per cent in 2005, compared with higher rates in Germany and other countries. Meanwhile, forced returns of Iraqis have continued in five European countries, including our own. The UK potentially has, as a result of pressure from the voluntary organisations, a much better record on resettlement. Can the Minister confirm that, with the new UNHCR quota, the UK has done or intends to do more than other countries to welcome genuine refugees from Iraq?</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080618143000149"></a>I was impressed by the range of work carried out on the external frontiers described in the report. Few British citizens can be aware of major maritime operations such as Hera around the Canaries, Hermes and Minerva, in all of which the UK participated during 2007, though far from home. Having sailed through those seas many times, the Minister is the only one of us who can appreciate the scale of the operations, which 150 years ago might have been our responsibility alone; we can be thankful that they are not now. Malta&#146;s rescue services deserve special mention, covering a vast area of the Mediterranean while coping with an annual migrant population equivalent to half the island&#146;s birth rate. I agree with the committee that the effectiveness of the Dublin II regulations on third-country nationals, which places a disproportionate burden on states such as Malta, should be reviewed by the EU at an early opportunity. I expect that the Minister will also say something about our special legal position and accountability.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="080618143000150"></a>Considering that we are not part of Schengen, we are not doing that badly through Frontex. The committee and its expert adviser in particular need to be congratulated on producing such an excellent report.</p>

I also agree with him in commending the knowledge of the work of Frontex to Eurosceptics who are probably not aware of how much is being done. I provide a sort of personification of links between the European and Westminster Parliaments.

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="0806195000004"></a>It is not inconsistent to want the European Union to be open to the world but to have robust border controls. We are not a fortress Europe: at least 2 million immigrants a year come into the EU, but we have to have well managed borders.

<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1108"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>says that improved co-ordination of border management of Schengen states will be of direct benefit to the UK even if we are not in it.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="0806195000005"></a>I also very much agree with the Committee&#146;s report that this concentration on practical co-operation of national border guards is the way to go, certainly for the foreseeable future, rather than the idea of European border guard that was discussed a few years ago. We are not ready for that and I do not know whether we ever will be, but Frontex is a pragmatic and sensible approach. I agree with my noble friend Lord Teverson that it is possible but not yet, as the UK Government&#146;s position on Schengen is progress, conditional on there being soundly managed external borders. It is not an absolute rejection.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="0806195000006"></a>The European Court of Justice said that we could not legally go into Frontex. There is a view, certainly in the European Parliament, that we cannot just cherry pick what we want out of Schengen because that is not terribly helpful. However, I believe&#151;I am sure that other MEPs do as well&#151;that the case-by-case participation of the UK in Frontex operations is valuable, as it is in RABITS, the Rapid Border Intervention Teams. I recently met Lyn Homer, the director of the UK Border Agency, and learnt that we have set up a video link for Polish border guards for interpretation, because they have not been used to coping with the current volume of migrants. They do not have the language facilities, which we are providing through a video link. As well as all the training, risk analysis and help with forgery detection and mobile freight searching that we are helping with, that is an interesting practical measure.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="0806195000007"></a>In fact, members of Sub-Committee F were at the Joint Borders Operation Centre at Heathrow last week on Wednesday. MEPs were there on Thursday. The Minister, Meg Hillier MP, is keen to come to Brussels to talk to the European Parliament in some forum, and I suggested to Lyn Homer that it might be a good idea if she came as well. The idea of having maximum interchange with the Schengen arrangements is a good way forward.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="0806195000008"></a>I also picked up the fact that the UK is active on returns. The European Parliament was not keen on joint return operations until we had common EU rules on returns. I am glad to say that today, despite my absence from Strasbourg, the European Parliament approved a return directive, after three years of negotiations between the Council and the Parliament. It was very controversial, and there was a lot of lobbying. I support it; its rules are not perfect, but they will raise standards in many member states. Sadly, the UK is not taking part. One has to wonder whether that is because it feels it would be constrained by some of the rules in the return directive, such as the limits on detention.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="0806195000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, made a point about the state of UK border controls. The Government refute the report&#146;s charge of inadequate and unacceptable safeguarding of UK borders. I cannot add to what he said. The state of the fencing at Calais seems rather curious. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s answer to  the question about when it was decided to reinforce those fences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="0806195000010"></a>When we went to the Joint Border Operations Centre and learnt about Project Semaphore and the e-borders system, I remained puzzled by the fact that the air passenger data are not used to pick up serious crime and terrorism. There is no profiling for terrorism in the data. In a parliamentary Answer by the Minister, Liam Byrne, to a Conservative MP, Nigel Evans, on 16 May, there was a breakdown of 1,700 arrests that had taken place in the past three years, roughly. Of those 1,700 arrests, by my calculation, 920&#151;well over half&#151;were for things such as non-payment of fines, bail offences, failure to attend a court, breach of court orders and road traffic offences. I wonder why we are not using the data for the most serious offences, which is often how these data collection systems are justified.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="0806195000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, drew attention to the fact that the report said that the poorer border control is in the UK, the more it undermines the Government&#146;s arguments against Schengen. If we are not doing a good job defending our borders, it suggests that we could do it better if we worked more in common. However, I welcome the openness of the Government to seeing how they can co-operate with, and one day move towards, Schengen.</p>

<a name="80618-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="0806195000012"></a>The operations that Frontex is doing to combat illegal immigration with its reactive approach are only one part of a common EU asylum and migration system. We have to put all the other parts in place, not just a common asylum system. The European Commission made new proposals yesterday. I have not had a chance to read them, but I hope they include ideas about how to improve the working of the Dublin II regulations, to which the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, referred. I hope that at least the ideas in the treaty of Lisbon will not be lost in the area of justice and home affairs. In today&#146;s <I>Financial Times</I>, the commentator Quentin Peel writes,</p>
<ul><a name="0806195000110"></a>&#147;if the treaty is lost, hopes of getting swifter and more coherent EU decisions in vital areas such as asylum policy ... will vanish&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806195000108"></a>He is commenting on the figures from the UNHCR about the number of refugees in the world. He writes that:</p>
<ul><a name="0806195000013"></a>&#147;Mr Guterres would not be impressed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806195000109"></a>It does not help the UNHCR if the EU is not coherent on asylum and immigration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="0806195000014"></a>Turning to resources, I shall supplement what the Committee&#146;s report says about the European Parliament and the budget of Frontex. It was probably too late to be captured in the report, but in the Second Reading of the 2008 Budget, the European Parliament released all the money for Frontex. The reason that we had frozen it in the reserve was that we requested its director to present to the Justice and Home Affairs Committee the work programme for the agency for 2008. That chimes with what is said in the report about greater accountability&#151;indeed, formal accountability&#151;to the European Parliament. The director did come in November 2007 and therefore in the Second Reading of the Budget the Parliament agreed to release the reserve on the operational budget and to increase the administrative budget by more than &#8364;3 million, compared with the Commission&#146;s preliminary draft budget.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1110"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80618-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="0806195000015"></a>The other part of resources is the vessels and equipment which are promised to Frontex. As in other areas of EU work, member states are not carrying out their promises to make boats and equipment available to Frontex. If they do not make them available, that reinforces or makes a case, as the Commission suggested in its recent evaluation of Frontex, that the agency should acquire its own equipment so that it is available at short notice. I am not sure that that is a good idea but if member states persist in not delivering on their promises, the argument for Frontex to have its own facilities will be stronger.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="0806195000016"></a>On the mandate of Frontex, there must be strong co-operation with Europol but I agree with the Committee that it would not be appropriate to extend the mandate of Frontex to cover crime and terrorism. That is Europol&#146;s job. I am also unhappy about the confusion that that might suggest between irregular migration and criminality. Not every unauthorised entrant is a criminal; they are separate issues.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="0806195000017"></a>My last real point is the need for much clearer and stronger rules to ensure humane and dignified treatment of migrants and access to the asylum determination procedure. There was a submission by the European Council on Refugees which highlighted the lack of clarity about mechanisms to deal with wider humanitarian needs, including medical requirements of persons rescued or intercepted during Frontex operations, ensuring adequate reception facilities, and so on. There is also a need to clarify the legal situation when people are refused landing. There do not seem to be specific measures to safeguard the rights of people potentially in need of protection, which would undermine the right to seek asylum. We need much clearer rules, therefore. The Schengen borders code does not cover interception and disembarkation. We need clear rules on disembarkation for all Frontex maritime operations, not ad hoc ones from one operation to another. We need training on the law of the sea&#151;a working party is looking at that. We need training on European and international asylum rules and on human rights and fundamental rights so that these norms are fully respected and we have a consistent approach in search and rescue operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="0806195000018"></a>I mentioned the Dublin II regulations. They may not work well in this context&#151;for instance when Malta receives so many people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="0806195000019"></a>I heard the strong comments of the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, about the lack of responsiveness by the Minister, Mr Byrne. Although I am not a member of Sub-Committee F, Mr Byrne does appear to have worked to a rather lax timetable. The two-month response time has not been respected; that is unfortunate, particularly given the excellent work that is done by the EU Committee as a whole and Sub-Committee F in particular.

It is extremely well written and very readable, so all in all the committee has done more than its job. I do not know whether something else with the word &#147;Europe&#148; on it has exhausted the whole House, but only one member of the committee other than the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, is in his place and has commented on the report tonight&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Teverson.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="0806195000021"></a>The report strikes me as a timely look at the work of Frontex. It contains a number of important insights not only into what Frontex is but into what it has been involved in since its inception three years ago. We have had many debates in this House recently&#151;I am sure there will be many more&#151;on the importance of security. There can be little more that is important to the security of nations than their ability to ensure the safety and integrity of their borders. The extension of the Schengen acquis to all the 27 nations of Europe, as the report points out, means that the external land borders of Europe cover nearly 5,000 miles. The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, also pointed this out. I like kilometres, but I still work in miles. Much of the territory is difficult to police, as we have heard, and is vulnerable to organised illegal migration and criminal activity. As the noble Lord has said, there is also now a staggering 50,000 miles of maritime border, much of it very difficult to patrol even by our wonderful Navy. The pressure on borders and border guards will play on the measures needed to ensure that immigration into Europe is controlled.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="0806195000022"></a>From Britain&#146;s point of view, it is obvious that the final desired destination of many of those crossing borders informally is this country, and that the freedom of movement between and within the countries of Europe under Schengen is of great assistance in that objective. The security of our own borders is the reason why we did not join Schengen at the outset. Despite the suggestion that Mr Byrne is more positive about this, I did not read into what he said that we are likely to contemplate becoming part of the Schengen acquis or ceasing to have our own border controls in the foreseeable future. It is therefore of some concern that the report is still critical of our border controls.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="0806195000023"></a>I realise that it is now some six months since the report was made, but the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, has maintained his view that some areas are still vulnerable. One of those is the inability of our border agency to record entries into and departures from the UK. The Minister may well be able to answer this, but it still looks as though we do not know how many migrants are coming in and out of the country. Mr Liam Byrne is quoted as saying that you had better make sure that the person you are counting in is the same as the one you are counting out. The suggestion is that the names of people coming in are not recorded so that you cannot attach the same name to the person who is leaving. These remarks were made as late as December 2007, which was barely six months ago. I do not know whether the situation has changed in that time, but perhaps the Minister will comment.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="0806195000024"></a>It seems that the problem which is defined is unlikely to be resolved until the full implementation of the EU borders programme. As the noble Lord, Lord Jopling,  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1112"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>points out, the timescale for final implementation remains 2014. That is still six years away. Does the Minister anticipate that this programme could be accelerated? I think he recently suggested that most of it would be implemented by 2010. Could he tell us if that is the programme?</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="0806195000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, has referred to the problems at Calais as another area where we are not safeguarding our borders. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us what the position is in Calais. This, after all, was the answer to the closure of the holding centre there. It was going to be how we ensured that we did not have immigrants climbing fences, walking through the tunnel and hanging on underneath lorries. If there are still shortcomings, who is responsible and who is going to put it right?</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="0806195000026"></a>The fact that the UK is not a participant in the Schengen acquis has so far enabled us to maintain our own border security systems. As we know from many debates in this House, these are not yet sufficiently robust to ensure that illegal migration slows to a trickle, at most, or that there is complete integration of all the agencies involved in the identification of those who are here illegally, as well as those who are trying to enter illegally. It is our contention that this will not truly become possible until the UK Borders Agency is strengthened by the inclusion of the police. It will certainly be our intention, on return to government, to ensure that there is a complete security system.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="0806195000027"></a>It is worth repeating that the UK&#146;s absence as a signatory to the Schengen acquis has resulted in us not being a full member of Frontex. It is also clear that our participation as an observer on the management board and in many of the joint operations organised by Frontex ensures that we appear to be playing a significant part in enabling it to function. What assessment can be made of whether the many operations that have been referred to&#151;although they are, I gather, reasonably small-scale&#151;have had an effect on slowing or preventing uncontrolled migration across the external borders of Europe? I know we have played a major role in a number of these operations. Is the work of Frontex having a beneficial effect on the pressure on UK borders? If Schengen is not working and the control of external borders at the edge of Europe is now not working, there is no chance that we will ever be able to join Schengen and give up our own controls. Without strong evidence that Frontex is able to ensure the measures that will secure our borders as well as those of Europe it seems inconceivable that the UK will be able to forgo its own border control.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="0806195000028"></a>One of the conclusions of the committee which produced the report is that there is a danger of too much being expected of Frontex. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, also referred to this. In the short term, the increase in its staff, resources and objectives should be consolidated before it advances further. The noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, has now said that the money which has been held back has been released. I am not sure whether that is good news or bad news. The release of the money will presumably enable Frontex to do more. It might be helpful if the Minister told us what the Government&#146;s view is on the expansion of Frontex. At the moment, I understand that it is quite a  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1113"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>small organisation. There were 80 people when it started; it has now grown to 146, and is expected to double in the next few years. To look after 50,000 miles of sea borders and 4,000 miles of external borders with 149 people is perhaps going it a bit, although I know that that is not exactly what it is meant to do. It will be interesting to know whether the noble Lord feels that it is going at about the right pace or whether more is being done.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0806195000029"></a>As the report makes clear, Frontex is not designed to be a &#147;doer&#148;. It would therefore be understandable if the resources are perhaps not there to enable it to increase in human terms by too many. Inevitably, once an organisation like this is set up it begins to accrease to itself more responsibilities. As I understand it, it is intended to co-ordinate, risk assess, give guidance on training, undertake research on controls and surveillance of external borders, and generally provide support to the nations of Europe in developing and maintaining security measures. We have heard from the noble Lords, Lord Jopling and Lord Teverson, of the difficulties of that and of the borders, particularly those between the former Soviet Union and Europe, and the territory involved in that and the pressure there will be on that from people trying to get across.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="0806195000030"></a>It is to be hoped that this report is read widely in the Schengen states. It would be an awful pity if it were not. It provides an eye on a new organisation. Perhaps it provides a slightly independent eye in that we are at the moment one step back from it. But we are enormously interested in the work of Frontex, in how it reacts with the Schengen states, and in how, through it and its work, there are greater controls on the borders. The report is extremely well written and thoroughly readable. As I said, I hope it will be highly influential.</p>

Certainly, as I have found in the past, I have learnt a lot from having to read the report and from going into some of these issues. I am very aware that noble Lords have only recently received this response. Although I have been told that there is a complex nature of subjects and constant developments et cetera, that is not good enough and I apologise for that. I do not think that that is satisfactory. I will very clearly take that message back. I assure noble Lords that I will put every effort I can into making sure that this sort of thing does not happen again. It is slack and is not good. I am considering reintroducing keelhauling in the Home Office to sharpen some of that out.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0806195000032"></a>Having said that, I assure noble Lords that the Home Office is definitely fit for purpose and not unfit for purpose. I heard that when I went there and I have been very impressed by the quality of some of the people. Whether that is because their number has been halved or whatever, I do not know; but it is fit for purpose and there are some very good people doing some extremely good work.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="0806195000033"></a>The Government welcome this report, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, mentioned, is extremely well written. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, was correct when he made it very clear that we are talking about the real issues of Europe; that is, the things that Europe is giving us, the important things, rather than a bit of posturing on various bits and pieces. It comes at a time of intense discussion across Europe about the future development of this agency, so it is very timely and a very useful contribution to that debate.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0806195000034"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, also mentioned the scale of growth. The group started with an executive director, 35 staff and a budget of &#8364;6.2 million. Today, it has a 200-strong workforce, commands a budget of &#8364;70.43 million, and plans to mount 24 operations in 2008, including permanent European patrols and a network operation in the Mediterranean. So far this year, it has carried out eight of these operations and the UK has taken part in seven of them. It was good to see credit given for that in the report and we are sending an expert to contribute to the document workshop of the eighth. We are fully involved in all of those things. I will touch on what I think about its growth and the impact of that later.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0806195000035"></a>We have been fully supportive of Frontex since 2005, in spite of our exclusion from full participation in the agency&#146;s work&#151;for reasons we know and which noble Lords have talked about. This includes making financial contributions to all the operations that we are involved in. We are maintaining a strong voice and I thank the committee for recognising that in the report. We have backed the agency through the secondment of UK national experts in risk analysis and operations. We have a seat and a voice on the Frontex management board, which gets a very good hearing, bearing in mind that we are not part of the Schengen accord. It is good to see and it is, of course, because we have expertise in this area, so they wish to listen to us.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="0806195000036"></a>To date, all the UK applications to participate have been approved unanimously, which is a good sign. We have focused our support in three key areas: risk assessment, frontline operational activity and training. We play a major role in Frontex training. Our officials have assisted in the development and delivery of training packages and the operational staff operate to a consistently high standard at, and between, every crossing point on the European border.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="0806195000037"></a>We have also supported newer member states, providing training in dealing with false and forged documentation. Last year, during the second phase of Frontex Operation Poseidon alone, 225 forged or falsified documents were detected. We have shared our technological expertise, which is quite considerable, with member states during operations to detect migrants hidden inside freight and rail vehicles. The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, referred to these marvellous things which can spot people sitting in carriages and pick up movement. There are some very clever bits of kit and we have been very generous in lending it to people to allow them to carry out their role.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="0806195000038"></a>Many speakers raised the issue of our border. As the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, pointed out, it is an unbelievable sight&#151;5,000 miles on the eastern border  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1115"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which he mentioned as a gaping hole. I take some issue with that, because our border is one of the toughest in the world and we are determined to strengthen it further. That does not mean it is perfect, because there are things that we have to get right. We ceased the checking-in and checking-out in 1994. That was probably an error, but it is easy to say that sort of thing in hindsight. So we are now recouping, catching up and getting back to speed.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="0806195000039"></a>We have been running Project Semaphore, as was mentioned. It has been very successful and we are moving towards e-Borders. I think we are doing quite well on that. We would like to speed it up if we could but it is quite difficult and highly complex. We now have foreign national ID cards coming in December 2008, which is not very far away. We will count the majority of foreign nationals travelling into and out of the United Kingdom. By April 2009, less than a year away, we will handle data on 100 million international passenger and crew movements. By December 2009 we will get all the travel document information on 95 per cent of foreign nationals travelling into and out of the UK.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0806195000040"></a>One would like it faster and indeed, one would wish that we had never stopped doing it, but we are where we are and we are moving as quickly as we can, although we would like to do it quicker. We have also established a new UK Border Agency, the creation of which gives a lot of extra opportunities for enhanced co-operation with our EU partners and Frontex, on a case-by-case basis. That is happening.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="0806195000041"></a>A number of noble Lords mentioned Malta. I have operated a lot in the Mediterranean and noble Lords are right to say that the problems they have are amazing. I visited Malta when I was First Sea Lord and as Commander-in-Chief. That great flow of people across the Mediterranean is quite horrifying. The poor people working on the problem in the ships there have this real worry of whether they should let them go on, even though they have a bit of difficulty, because then they will go to Italy where it will be their problem, or whether they should deal with it themselves. There are some big issues there that we need to handle. There is a risk of a loss of life and there are real problems for a nation that size. We are engaged in talks with them, but in terms of them needing more money, these things can sometimes be difficult. However, we must be engaged with these very small countries because this is a real problem and they are often on the front-line of where some of these difficulties occur.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="0806195000042"></a>In an advisory role, the UK Border Agency has introduced new techniques to debrief illegal immigrants encountered in Frontex operations. This has helped border guards across Europe to establish who these people are, which countries they have come from and the routes that they have used to travel to Europe. That is very useful and is part of the package which means that Frontex is achieving a lot to help us with our borders. It helps border guards identify the organised criminal gangs, a lot of whom prey on these migrants, very often putting their lives in jeopardy. We have all seen that in various media reports. They also make huge sums of money, so it is important that we pin them down.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="0806195000043"></a>As a Government we have encouraged Frontex to adopt a risk-based approach to its front-line activities, so much so that the head of Frontex&#146;s risk analysis unit was a seconded national expert from the UK. That was quite an achievement for us. This approach has made a real difference in the operational front line by targeting the exploitation of migrants&#151;for example, from west Africa through the Canary Islands. I think that all of us can remember those dreadful pictures of people in boats heading out to the Canaries, with a huge loss of life and a large number swarming into the European Union. The operation succeeded in reducing the number of migrants reaching Spain by as much as 80 per cent, so it was a huge success&#151;and, of course, those people would very often move on through Europe and come to us. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked whether Frontex has aided us; the answer is that it has&#151;it has been of real value.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0806195000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, mentioned the European border guard being a step too far. I agree absolutely and would confirm that. We must not run before we can walk; we really must not move too quickly in that regard. I reinforce what was said in the response to that. As for physical burden-sharing, I again agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, that it is not right for us to do that at the moment. Again, that would  be moving too quickly, and there would be real problems there.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0806195000045"></a>I would love to know whether the changes that have been made at Calais&#151;and changes have been made&#151;were because of the committee&#146;s visit or because of mine. When I went there I was quite horrified as I saw all the illegals busily having their free evening meal over the other side of the canal before trying to climb over an insubstantial fence in the dark. I said that I thought that dogs were jolly good for that sort of thing, although one has to be a bit careful with them because they may go and eat innocent people. But I said that dogs would be a good idea and that maybe things needed reinforcing. Probably, however, the committee&#146;s visit had more impact than mine, I fear to say. Things have now started being done and we are getting some good results. In northern France, 18,000 people were stopped from entering the UK illegally in the past year, which is quite impressive. So we are getting somewhere. Visits such as the committee&#146;s are useful because they put pressure on&#151;and now we are seeing things like the new double layer of fencing and the dog patrols. All those things are important and, although they will never completely stop people who are desperate to get into the country, they are beginning to have a real impact.</p>

<a name="80618-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0806195000046"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, mentioned that we are not part of Schengen and that my right honourable friend Liam Byrne said that we might join it. I am not sure exactly what his words were; the noble Lord read them out but I cannot remember them. All that I can say is that one never knows what might change one day; certainly there is no intention yet to do that. We do get benefits from not being part of it. There is a real danger, as the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, said, that we could be accused of cherry-picking, and we have to be careful, but the benefits that we get from being able to protect carefully our own border outweigh the disadvantages for this country, because we can look after our border that much more closely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0806195000047"></a>I can confirm that we have discussed the position of Gibraltar with people there and I think that we have written to the committee on that. I may be wrong, but my note tells me that that is the case. If not, a letter is obviously on its way. That will resolve some of the issues there, but we are actually talking with them.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0806195000048"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, referred to this being not only an issue of counter-terrorism. That is absolutely the case; it is certainly not just being focused in that way. He is absolutely right, too, about the linkages with the other groups, such as UNHCR and all the other things in the quota. We need to do a lot more there.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0806195000049"></a>As for the RABIT initiative, I did not know that rabbits were anything other than furry animals until I went through this report, so, again, that is something that I have learnt. It will consist of a team of border guards with particular skills, who can be deployed on request by member states to their territory. But currently there is no intention that they will process asylum claims, to answer the specific question on that.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0806195000050"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, mentioned the issue of people talking to the European Union. I would support that and will encourage Ministers who are directly responsible for this area to do that. I was glad to hear that my honourable friend Meg Hillier spoke in Brussels. She is quite good about going there and has done so a number of times. I have certainly done it in my area of counter-terrorism and security. It is important that we do this. I was interested and delighted to hear what had been going on in Brussels today on the return directive, which was fascinating. I shall be interested to see exactly where it goes.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0806195000051"></a>I have touched on the issue of lending equipment and things. We have done well on that and have offered a whole raft of things that have been used regularly. I hope that I can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, and the noble Lords, Lord Jopling and Lord Teverson, that we are doing our best to get things done.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="0806195000052"></a>Looking ahead, Frontex faces some real challenges. It started out by looking at co-ordinating efforts at external European borders, but it has become clear that it can really become effective only if it sharpens its focus on the source and transit countries of migrants. It has to do more to harness the co-operation and work of these third states to improve their border management and encourage them to accept return of citizens.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0806195000053"></a>Equally, Frontex must continue to work with other European law enforcement agencies&#151;a number of speakers touched on that&#151;but must not duplicate their efforts. For example, where evidence of criminality is encountered&#151;the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, mentioned this&#151;it should be passed directly to the border police and to Europol for further investigation and action. The signing of the agency&#146;s recent working agreements with Europol is a welcome indication of how this is going, and similarly, the work with the United Nations.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0806195000054"></a>Frontex is a great success story, which increases the expectations placed on it. We have to continue to respond to high expectations across Europe and to sustain and strengthen our partnership working with

The UK can meet those expectations. However, the agency must not be encouraged to run before it can walk. Year on year the Frontex staff and budget have doubled, and it is time for the agency to evaluate the lessons learnt. It must consolidate that learning to deliver real benefits and border management across Europe in the next few years. I agree entirely with the committee&#146;s recommendations on that. I am certain that that is what must be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0806195000055"></a>I thank the EU Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, and the team, for their insightful report, which has allowed a valuable debate, and I have certainly learnt a lot.</p>

Members of the Committee and the staff who so ably support us will be delighted that the report on Frontex has had such a warm and broad welcome in your Lordships&#146; House. I am grateful to those who have contributed to the debate, which has been full and helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0806195000057"></a>With regard to the Minister&#146;s wind-up speech, we shall have to share the credit for improving the fence at Calais. We have both done a pretty good job with that. I was particularly grateful for his ready apology for the late arrival of the Government&#146;s response. I shall say no more about that, but I thank the Minister. I am glad that the Chief Whip stayed to hear so much of the debate. I know that she has taken on board a good many of the criticisms that I made, and I am most obliged to her for that.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0806195000060"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a most timely and important debate, and, in the context of recent events concerning the Government&#146;s inadequacies in the protection of their own information, one that is of crucial importance to a significant number of people. In the limited time available to me I should like to focus on the issue of identity theft and the enormous suffering that is caused to a great many people as a consequence of this hideous crime.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0806195000061"></a>Home Office estimates suggest that identity fraud costs the United Kingdom economy more than &#163;1.7 billion each year. This estimate represents an increase of &#163;400 million over the past three years and is in all likelihood a conservative estimate of the trust cost. I welcome the contribution made to tackling this issue by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Identity Fraud, and in particular its report published in October last year. The recommendations in that report were sound and deserve proper action. I hope that the Minister will have some positive news to report to the House on what has been done since its publication.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1119"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80618-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0806195000062"></a>A broad theme in the report was the need to ensure that the police and the law enforcement agencies are provided with the appropriate resources to pursue those who make it their business to enact this most offensive behaviour, in particular by providing the strategic leadership to deliver the priority treatment in tackling this crime. The report made reference to the appointment of an identity fraud tsar and ensuring that sufficient energy and resources are available to identify and punish these fraudsters. Have the Government considered a review of the law and the resources available to law enforcement agencies? Will we see the establishment of dedicated identity fraud officers?</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0806195000063"></a>I would now like to talk about &#147;phishing&#148;. Phishing involves frauds when customers receive fraudulent emails purporting to come from banks, credit companies and other organisations. The intention is to trick people into divulging personal information which is used to commit a fraud. Phishing is one of the biggest identify frauds, and the fraudsters are often based overseas. The Metropolitan Police has set up a fraud alert website, but the police need more resources in view of the international dimension. Can more be done in conjunction with overseas countries?</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0806195000064"></a>Financial institutions and a number of other organisations often ask the prospective customer to produce a passport, and they have a policy of checking the document and obtaining verification through the government passport verification help line. We are pleased that the Government have set up this help line. However, there is no similar arrangement for checking driving licences or other government documents. Can that be looked into, and will the Minister comment on the possibility of checks being introduced for these documents? In regard to fraudulent passports, I am pleased to note that the Identity and Passport Service has deployed a database of lost and stolen passports and that a passport validation service is now available to public and private sector organisations. However, more can be done to encourage all relevant commercial organisations to utilise this service.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0806195000065"></a>I understand that a national UK cybercrime policing unit is to be established which will enable the public to report cybercrime to a central unit. The unit will train officers and provide workshops for businesses across the country and will be staffed by dedicated officers. The problem is funding, to which the Government are not yet committed. I understand that the start-up costs amount to &#163;1.3 million and that the total cost will be &#163;4.5 million annually. Will the Minister comment on this unit and the provision of funding?</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0806195000066"></a>I further understand that the e-crime unit will form part of the emerging national fraud reporting centre which will be run by the national fraud strategic authority. There have been discussions between the Government and ACPO. Perhaps the Minister can clarify the outcome of those discussions.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0806195000067"></a>There needs to be an extensive programme funded by the Government, relevant authorities and financial institutions to undertake the following: first, to make people aware that their credit files are available from credit reference agencies; and, secondly, where to go to report the theft of documents and correspondence  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1120"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and to obtain general advice and information. There must be an active programme to make people aware of precautions that they could take to guard against identity theft, which could include asking people to shred all personal documents, to check their bank statements, to chase the non-receipt of cheque books and cards, to redirect their post and update the electoral roll if they are moving home, and to regularly check their personal credit files. If people are sharing accommodation, they must take extra care over the security of their letters and documents. I am also pleased that national fraud prevention week takes place annually. More organisations could be encouraged to take part in this initiative.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0806195000068"></a>There is also a problem with the impersonation of deceased persons, and I am pleased that there are now provisions to combat this awful practice. Powers are now granted to the General Register Office to supply a deceased person&#146;s details to the police, crime agencies and other bodies for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of offences. Members of the public should, however, be encouraged and advised to register with services that remove the deceased person&#146;s details.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0806195000069"></a>I would now like to talk about businesses and companies where identity frauds are committed, including offences relating to the directors. These frauds include changing details of the company such as the address, false appointment of directors and fraudulent use of information already held. More can be done to urge companies to file information online, sign up to submitting all papers online and subscribe to an alert system. At present a very limited number of companies are doing this.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0806195000070"></a>Financial services organisations should be encouraged to put identity fraud at the forefront of their considerations, and discussions should take place at board level as a regular agenda item. Institutions need to set up risk assessment committees that constantly examine the situation and recommend and implement the necessary protections. The private sector&#146;s deployment of resources to confront these crimes is of the utmost importance and customers must be told of the dangers and the appropriate action to take.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0806195000071"></a>The problem of identity theft is linked to that of cybercrime, which continues to pose an immediate threat. I welcome my party&#146;s proposals, which include the establishment of a new national cybercrime unit within the police force and a similar department within the Crown Prosecution Service. My party&#146;s suggestions are excellent. Has the Minister any comments on our proposals? Those who use encryption as a mechanism to confront the threat of fraud are to be congratulated. What action are the Government taking to increase the use of encryption to protect personal data?</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0806195000072"></a>In conclusion, it is disappointing that the Government have allowed themselves to become so completely focused on the identity card issue that they are not perceived to be as proactive in promoting the prevention of identity theft as I believe they should be. I hope the Minister will reflect on the proposals that I have presented today and on the work of the all-party group that has done much sterling work in this area. I look forward to his response.</p>

However, we must ensure that remedies do not aggravate the situation and take away our cherished liberties, which we on these Benches are particularly concerned about. We must strike a healthy balance. Only last week we discussed the security of databases in a debate initiated by my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I need not say much more from these Benches, as all that I wanted to say was said last week. The noble Lord&#146;s speech tonight reinvigorates our determination to find a proper, liberal way forward. We welcome the initiative. As I say, our views were expressed last week and have not changed since.</p>

The clarion call of this debate is to draw attention to the progress that still needs to be made.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0806195000075"></a>My noble friend rightly drew attention to the serious nature of the problem. As my honourable friend Nigel Evans, the chairman of the All-Party Group on Identity Fraud, has pointed out, the estimated cost of ID fraud is huge&#151;in 2006, it was &#163;1.7 billion, as my noble friend echoed. Nigel Evans has said that everyone is a potential victim of this crime and that an identity, if stolen, can take months to get back, involving the victim in costs of thousands of pounds. Often individuals who are totally unsophisticated in these matters are the innocent victims and in many cases are not in a position to afford these costs. With the increasing sophistication of cybernetics and the increasingly widespread skills possessed by many people, it is essential that the authorities and the Government keep ahead of the game.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0806195000076"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Sheikh, I very much welcome the all-party group&#146;s report on identity fraud, which was published in October 2007. This well researched report was critical of the banking industry&#146;s reluctance in the early stages to admit the seriousness of the situation. I believe that this attitude has now changed. Certainly, the British Bankers&#146; Association gave an assurance that a working group to establish best practice had been set up. What ongoing dialogue are the Government having with the banking industry to address these problems? I hope that the Minister will take note of the recommendation in the report that they should explore the secure sharing of data between government and the private sector.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0806195000077"></a>This is not the occasion to debate the all-party report in detail, but it is worth highlighting one or two constructive suggestions that the group came up with. These have been well covered by my noble friend Lord Sheikh. Some of them are possibly small in themselves but all contribute to a robust response to this ever increasing menace. For instance, there is the suggestion that councils should offer safe and secure disposal facilities for hard drives as part of their recycling  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1122"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>process. The &#147;electronic dustbin&#148; is a fruitful source for cybercriminals. There should be a hotline to enable victims of an ID fraud attack to find out quickly how they should respond&#151;a point again made by my noble friend. An advertising campaign should make people aware of the dangers posed by ID fraud, with dos and don&#146;ts in plain language and simple precautions such as not giving banking details out on blogs and social networking websites&#151;practices that are widespread particularly among young people.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0806195000078"></a>The report was also critical of the Government. It noted that in the two years up to October 2007 there had been three Ministers with responsibility for identity theft. The report recommended the appointment of an identity fraud tsar, although this has been greeted by the banking industry with scepticism. My party has an alternative proposal. I raised the matter in the debate initiated by my noble friend Lady Trumpington on 20 March this year and was grateful for the thoughtful reply that we had from the Minister. My noble friend Lord Sheikh has spoken in some detail about the role of the police. My party has put forward some definitive proposals to deal with the problem.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0806195000079"></a>In the March debate, I voiced my party&#146;s concern that the decision to absorb the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit into the Serious Organised Crime Agency has all the marks of an exercise in cost-cutting and sends the wrong signals at this time, given the urgency of the problem that this debate has highlighted. We would like to see the NHTCU re-established with the Metropolitan Police as the ACPO head of cybercrime promoting a new police central e-crime unit. I look forward to hearing of the progress made in that respect from the Minister, although we felt that the proposal received no support from the Government at that time. I urge the Minister to look again at this sensible initiative. More fundamentally, as I said, we will designate a single Minister for cybercrime when and if we get back into office.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0806195000080"></a>This debate also provides the opportunity to revisit two other points that I made in the March debate. Since April 2007, online financial fraud can no longer be reported to the police directly. It has to be reported first to the financial institution concerned and it is then up to that bank or credit card company to decide whether the matter should be reported to the police. I said then that this is a cumbersome method that distances the victim from the prosecuting authority. It is a fair assumption that this disconnect between victim and prosecutor could have contributed to the regrettably low number of convictions under the Computer Misuse Act 1990&#151;only 89 in the five years between 2001 and 2006. How is this change in procedure working? I also voiced concern that the police database does not distinguish between crimes committed electronically or otherwise. In view of the urgency of the problem, which this debate has highlighted, this research shortcoming needs to be rectified.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0806195000081"></a>We must not sleepwalk into complacency on the subject of cybercrime and, particularly, ID fraud. I hope that we shall have an early opportunity to debate cybercrime in depth. In the mean time, I express my thanks to my noble friend Lord Sheikh for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject and for the

It is not a victimless crime that affects just government departments or financial institutions; it causes social harm to those individuals who have had their identities stolen by criminals to facilitate fraud. We know that some of the proceeds of identity fraud are used to finance wider criminal activity. I have my suspicions that sometimes such matters creep into terrorism as well. I am very concerned about that.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0806195000083"></a>We have been working collectively with the financial community, law enforcement, the private sector and across government for some time to implement effective measures to counter identity fraud. We are not there yet, but I think that we are moving in the right direction. Polls show that the public see identity fraud as more important than terrorism, which is interesting. The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, mentioned that to me; I checked it and he is absolutely right. It just shows how concerned people are.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0806195000084"></a>Through collective working, a variety of activity has been undertaken to tackle identity fraud, focusing not just on investigation and enforcement, but also on raising public awareness by highlighting the dangers of identity theft and what individuals can do to protect themselves. The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, mentioned the National Identity Fraud Prevention Week, which does that.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0806195000085"></a>If I outline some of the things that we have done, that will cover some matters raised by noble Lords. The Identity Fraud Consumer Awareness Group manages an identity fraud awareness campaign, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, which has produced, for example, an identity theft website and an information leaflet. The website and leaflet are very popular. The website receives an average of 16,000 visits per month and there are over 13 million leaflets in circulation. One has to be careful about such numbers, as the outcome depends on what impact and effect these things are having. However, they show that people have an interest and are trying to find out about this matter. The website is currently being redesigned to include specific advice and guidance for businesses, not only on how to protect themselves; businesses also have a duty of care to their customers and to safeguard their customers&#146; records. I think that that is improving.</p>

<a name="80618-0015.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0806195000086"></a>We have supported the National Identity Fraud Prevention Week. We have established a single point of contact in all police forces and a range of government departments and agencies to co-ordinate identity fraud investigations and prosecutions. It is clear that, as more people undertake banking, shopping and a range of other activities online, they need to be aware of the methods that can be used by fraudsters to try to access their online personal details. The noble Lord, Lord

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0806195000087"></a>In the past few weeks, my wife has been a victim. She was phoned by her bank and asked, &#147;Have you been buying things here and there?&#148;. She had not. This can impact on everyone. Some two years ago, a postbag was stolen and someone cashed cheques on my bank account. These things happen to us all and they take time to sort out, as has been pointed out.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="0806195000088"></a>Another worry is social activities on websites such as Facebook, MySpace and Bebo. Young people in particular are disclosing a lot of personal information that can be very useful to fraudsters to facilitate identity fraud. A bank often asks for your mother&#146;s maiden name and you will find that people put that kind of information on Facebook. There is also the nuisance of unsolicited and unwanted spam e-mails and the serious threat that they pose, as they make unwary e-mail users reveal things that would not otherwise be revealed. We have to be alert to such threats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="0806195000089"></a>The Get Safe Online public awareness campaign, a partnership between government, law enforcement and the business sector, has now been running for two years. This campaign aims to increase internet security and to provide authoritative, trustworthy and independent government and law enforcement-generated information and advice to online users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="0806195000090"></a>On the formation of an online e-crime unit, the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, should be aware that, after the debate that we had in this House about cybercrime, I talked with my honourable friend Vernon Coaker in the other place about the issue, saying that we had to start to form an e-crime unit. It is too serious to wait. We have talked to the Home Secretary about it, who has said that she believes that we should move quickly. She has said that she will make the funding available to establish it.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="0806195000091"></a>The debate is about how we take this forward. What is the best overall approach? How does this fit in with the National Fraud Reporting Centre? How exactly will this tie together? As a result of debates in this House, things are moving forward. We need to get going. I will not get into cybercrime, which I see as more of a state issue. We talked about it the other day in the House. I am looking at the e-crime aspect, but cybercrime is also crucial. We are moving forward on that as well.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="0806195000092"></a>It is vital that legislation keeps pace with the changing techniques employed by fraudsters. That is why we have introduced a range of new legislation so that those who commit fraud can be investigated and prosecuted and proper deterrents are in place. The Identity Cards Act 2006 created a new criminal offence of being in possession of or controlling false identity documents. That is useful. The scope of these new offences is wide and covers not just false identity documents but the possession of genuine documents that have been improperly obtained or relate to someone else. These offences provide the police with additional means to disrupt the activities of organised criminals, terrorists and those supporting them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="0806195000093"></a>In the first six months of operation, forces across the country have used the new laws to prosecute more than 500 identity crimes. This will grow and escalate.  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1125"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column 1125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is a timely thing to have done. By updating the law on fraud through the Fraud Act, we have created offences that can be used to prosecute identity fraudsters. To tackle the unauthorised access to or tampering of computer data, we have revised the sentences and offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. We are moving forward there.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="0806195000094"></a>Data protection has been mentioned on a number of occasions in this House. It is a global concern. Both the public sector and the private sector are faced with challenges in keeping the data that they hold safe and in tackling information security breaches. We know how difficult that can be, but that does not mean that we can uninvent and remove it. We have to have firm controls. The Government and the private sector face many challenges in combating these things.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="0806195000095"></a>The Government seek to ensure that data are held securely and used properly. This balance is maintained by a good legislative framework, particularly in the Data Protection and Human Rights Acts. The Information Commissioner is the UK&#146;s independent regulator for data protection. He performs the dual role of promoting good practice, educating data controllers and taking appropriate action. The Data Protection Act provides a robust and responsive framework to protect and enable the sharing of data. That does not mean we have got it right in the past&#151;we have not. It is crucial that we tighten it up because it gives away too much if we do not. However, we have a grip on this now and we are doing better.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="0806195000096"></a>To further underline the Government&#146;s commitment to the protection of personal data, recent changes were made to the Data Protection Act through the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. This introduced new powers for the Information Commissioner to impose a monetary penalty for serious contraventions of the data protection principles, and to increase, by order, the penalty for those found guilty of unlawfully obtaining, procuring or disclosing personal data. So the tools are in place for us to ensure that these things happen. It gives a strong signal that the lucrative and illegal trade in personal data will not be tolerated and there is a much stronger deterrent in place.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="0806195000097"></a>We have also initiated a number of reviews of the areas where we have had problems. They are at various stages of reporting and will give us good guidance for what we should do in future.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="0806195000098"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, mentioned data sharing. We are working to improve that, because it can dramatically help to prevent fraud occurring. The Serious Crime Act 2007 allows for targeted exchange of data on fraud between public and private sector and between different public sector organisations, through anti-fraud organisations, to highlight potentially fraudulent applications. As he said, that is extremely important. Expressions of interest from organisations wishing to become a specified anti-fraud organisation are being sought. The Police and Justice Act 2006 allows for the release of information on the recently deceased to law enforcement and specified organisations to help prevent exactly the sort of crime that the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, was talking about. I hope that that might close that loophole, but we have to watch it carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="0806195000099"></a>The fraud review of the noble and learned Lord the then Attorney-General recommended actions that could be taken by the Government in partnership with law enforcement and the business community to tackle fraud and the harm that it has done. Last year we announced funding of &#163;29 million over three years to develop the fraud review recommendations, which include establishing a national fraud strategic authority, a national fraud strategy, a lead force and a national fraud reporting centre. Those will all be extremely valuable as well.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="0806195000100"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, mentioned the business of the parliamentary group. Meg Hillier has met it and committed to providing quarterly updates. That will be useful and again shows how seriously we take the matter. We have established a national lead force on fraud&#151;it is the City of London Police&#151;as part of the fraud review, to combat fraud and ID fraud more effectively.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="0806195000101"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, raised the question of combating phishing internationally. We have already put in a lot of effort with industry, government and law enforcement to achieve that, have had quite close dealings with the US and Australia, and will continue those efforts. We are getting somewhere on that.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="0806195000102"></a>We are in discussions with the DVLA about driving licence validity. It is absolutely right that more can be done in that area as well, but we are achieving something there.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="0806195000103"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, mentioned an identity tsar. I am not a great believer in tsars, ever since the Romanovs; there seem to be too many tsars everywhere. The idea of a single Minister for cybercrime is interesting; I touched on it when we debated cybercrime the other day. We are still looking at it and trying to come up with the best answer. We have had useful Cabinet meetings on cybercrime and have moved forward dramatically since the middle of last year, when I arrived and was particularly worried that we were not moving on it. We are moving forward much more quickly now, in the right direction.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="0806195000104"></a>We must all use encryption more. We must do it privately ourselves; we are not good at that. It needs to be done better in the public arena and the private arena. There is no doubt about it: if the terrorists can use brilliant encryption, we can as well. It is not that difficult, and we jolly well ought to do it a lot more.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="0806195000105"></a>We have a great dialogue with banks including safe exchange of data with the public sector, as I mentioned, and have gone a long way there.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="0806195000106"></a>Although the national identity scheme may not be that popular, it will make a difference. Its introduction will provide people with a secure means of protecting their identity. Therefore, we are great believers in it. I believe that it will be useful to have one document that can help us. The fact that biometrics are involved makes it much more secure. Can one get round it? Of course clever people can always get round things, but they will find it a lot more difficult than they do today, so it is a useful way forward and I am a great supporter of it.</p>

<a name="80618-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="0806195000107"></a>It is important to emphasise that everyone&#151;members of the public as well as public and private sector organisations&#151;has a role to play in helping to tackle

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618119000133"></a> Clause 194, page 82, line 28, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>&#147;(ca) the Audit Commission for Local Authorities and the National Health Service in England,&#148;
<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000015"></a>The noble Baroness said: I will speak also to Amendments Nos. 110D to 110W. The effect of the amendments is to add the Audit Commission to the list of consultees in three places. First, the regulator will be required to consult the Audit Commission when issuing or changing standards under Clause 194. Secondly, the Secretary of State would have to consult it when issuing directions under Clause 195. Thirdly and lastly, the regulator would have to consult it when issuing guidance about how it uses its powers under Chapters 6 and 7, which relate to standards, monitoring and enforcement, and to Clause 213. When we come to the bigger group in a moment, the significance of the Audit Commission will be self-evident; that will show why it needs to be added to the list of consultees.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000016"></a>The Audit Commission has a wide range of skill and experience, which it can add to what the regulator does. It is important that the two bodies work together to improve services. I am sure the regulator will consult it anyway. However, there are two reasons why this should be mandatory. First, Amendments Nos. 110E to 110R propose changes to the system of inspection within the Bill&#151;I will return to that in a moment&#151;and  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC390"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC390</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>require, in particular, the Audit Commission as an inspector whenever inspection is carried out on the provision of social housing. The Audit Commission will inspect against standards as its key role, so it is only right that it is consulted when they are being developed.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000017"></a>Amendment No. 110W will amend Clause 213. Guidance can be issued on the regulator&#146;s use of its inspection and enforcement powers, which will depend on evidence from an inspection. It is evident therefore that the commission should be consulted on those, too.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000018"></a>Given that we are proposing&#151;we have debated the matter at some length&#151;that the regulator&#146;s scope be extended to local authorities and ALMOs, which are inspected by the Audit Commission for most of their services, it is particularly important that if the regulator is issuing standards and taking other action which affects this burden it has input from the commission. That covers the role of the Audit Commission as a statutory consultee.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000019"></a>I turn to the remaining government amendments in my name, which cover inspections of registered providers. We propose to change the current system of RSL inspections to make it fit the new regulatory regime. The amendments follow lengthy discussions with the Audit Commission and others on precisely how the system should work.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000020"></a>At present, inspection of RSLs is carried out by the Audit Commission, but regulation is carried out by the Housing Corporation. Regulation and inspection based on separate systems and separate standards is confusing. Since the inspection of social housing should play a key role within the regulatory system, the regulator should be assisted in investigating concerns and providing evidence to justify where needed. I therefore want to ensure that inspection is carried out on the basis of risk, as the Cave review proposes, and reflects the way that inspection is by and large now going.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000021"></a>Following the Cave review, we announced in June 2007 that, in future, good performance could expect minimal regulatory interference, including reduced inspections unless tenants raised concerns. That meant no more general inspections of RSLs on the current model, although I stress that there may be spot checks and good-practice checks where appropriate even on good providers. Although we want to lighten the burden on good providers, which is the balance that we are trying to achieve, it is important that it be known that good providers, too, are still within the system and can be checked. In other words, the balance of the inspection burden, which is a major cost and a burden to government and providers, will rightly fall much more on poor performers, whose tenants have concerns, than at present.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000022"></a>As noble Lords will know, the Audit Commission inspects the overall management performance of all large housing associations every few years, which has been very useful in raising standards, but the system is not designed to address specific problems on particular estates. We are therefore seeking to replace it with a system whereby when the regulator finds that there may be serious concerns about a provider&#146;s performance as a result of information it collects or concerns raised  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC391"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC391</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by tenants and others, it can investigate in a number of ways, including by inspection. For example, a group of tenants might identify a serious problem with repairs on their estate and inform the regulator, which would begin an immediate inspection of repairs and closely related issues on that estate. If the inspection showed that standards were not being met, the registered provider can be required to make the improvements.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000023"></a>The Audit Commission has done an excellent job inspecting RSLs since it was appointed five years ago. We expect it to continue to do so under the new regime. However, we do not want to make the regulator an inspectorate in its own right as we are committed, as noble Lords will know, to limiting the number of inspectorates. Therefore, the amendments seek to make sure that the regulator must use the commission as its inspector in most cases, although we accept that it should also be able to use another organisation as inspector in certain cases such as governance and financial viability issues involving private bodies.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000024"></a>Amendment No. 110E defines what may be inspected, who should be the inspector and payment for services. It states that there may be inspections of a provider&#146;s performance on two types of issue: provision of social housing, which is roughly equivalent to standards issued under Clause 191, and its financial and other affairs&#151;that is, standards under Clause 192.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000025"></a>For housing provision, the regulator must use the Audit Commission as an inspector. For financial and other affairs, it may use anyone; for example, one of the big four accountancy firms. That can include the commission, but it may not do inspections itself.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000026"></a>Another key, but less obvious, element in this new clause is that the regulator decides when an inspection needs to be carried out. It could also decide to discontinue an inspection. This is because the purpose of most inspections is to provide evidence to back up a regulatory activity to find out what is wrong and to fix it. There is nothing to stop the regulator commissioning spot checks when there is no breach of standards. We are also making sure that the regulator has a duty to pay the commission&#146;s cost and a power to pay other inspectors.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000027"></a>Let me be clear; in this system the regulator will decide who and what will be inspected. The inspections that have to be performed by the Audit Commission are limited to performance by reference to standards under Clause 191; that is, about whether the registered provider is meeting those standards.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000028"></a>Most of the other amendments in the group are consequential. Amendment No. 110R adds a new definition of &#147;inspector&#148; at the end of Clause 200, who has to be a person authorised in writing by the regulator, the commission or someone else. Amendments Nos. 110F and 110J remove subsections (1) to (5) of Clause 199, because these issues are covered elsewhere. Amendment No. 110G is consequential on the new definitions. There are three minor changes to the system: Amendments Nos. 110K and 110L add the commission to the list of bodies that the regulator must consult on the level of fees paid by providers to the regulator for an inspection; Amendment No. 110H allows the inspector and the regulator to publish an inspection report&#151;either or both may publish. That

These amendments specifically extend those powers to electronic information.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000029"></a>The changes that we are making to the inspection regime will make it more effective and flexible. They will ensure that inspection targets what it needs to target and that it is a vital part of the regulatory system, which balances risks and requirements. These amendments are needed to clarify how the system will work. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080618119000030"></a><a name="80618-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80618-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080618119000172"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I have one amendment in this group, Amendment No. 110FA, which is to add to Clause 199 on inspection a requirement that the persons used to carry out the inspection include tenants of social housing.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000031"></a>I seem to recall that the Minister said previously that this was intended, but I could not pin that down. She is nodding again, but as the National Consumer Council and the Tenant Participation Advisory Service in particular have asked for something along these lines, perhaps I should say a couple of words. Other regulators use service users to assist as lay inspectors, but there is no systematic arrangement; it is left to the regulator. The Chartered Institute of Housing has done some work on this issue and has ideas about an approach whereby tenant scrutiny can contribute to the regulator&#146;s work and, indeed, to national benchmarking. I understand that the Public Administration Select Committee in the Commons has rightly supported user-led work of this kind. It is pretty obvious that tenants will bring a particular perspective and have opportunities to talk to other tenants and managers, and will assist in evaluating what is going on. I was glad to see the Minister nodding. No doubt she will say something in a minute.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000032"></a>I should also say a word about the raft of amendments to which the Minister has spoken. Others may want to say more.</p>

<p><a name="080618119000120"></a>I am aware that there is concern about the use of the Audit Commission on the basis that it is a monopoly service. I would find it a little difficult to argue that point, given that local authorities have to cope with this. There is, however, concern about fees. Although the Audit Commission may well provide value for money, and I am not arguing about the merits of what it does, it is not tested on fees that it charges because there is no competition; there is no tender process. That has struck me from time to time over the years as something that the local government has just shrugged its shoulders about and taken on board without much protest. Sometimes, possibly, we should say, &#147;Hang on a moment. We&#146;d like the Audit Commission to be involved but it could be a very expensive situation for us&#148;. I simply wanted to put that point into the debate.</p>

First, how can the regulator, the inspecting organisation or the sector as a whole be certain that there is value for money when the inspector is a monopoly provider appointed without any tender or selection process? Any of the regulated bodies would quite properly be slated for acting in such a way. Secondly, if the Audit Commission not only is a monopoly provider but also has the ability to stop any other potential provider, where is the quality control? Who can challenge poor performance and do anything about it? Thirdly, and similarly, what incentive does the Audit Commission have to organise its business in an efficient, economical way if it is a monopoly supplier of an essential service? Fourthly, the regulator will be obliged to appoint the Audit Commission even if the inspection relates to a specialised area in which the commission may have no expertise. In such a case the regulator will be able to turn to a more qualified inspector only with the Audit Commission&#146;s consent.</p>

I have a slightly different point. I thought that the regulator was supposed to be strong, independent and capable of looking after his or her own affairs. You would not expect a highly competent regulator not to know how to get relevant inspections when needed. All the points that have been made go together with that. Supposing that our roles were reversed and we had put such a clause into a Bill that we were putting forward, I have a feeling that it would be called unnecessary. That is indeed what I think it is.</p>

I agree wholeheartedly with the comments of my noble friend Lady Hamwee and indeed those of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. The fees issue is particularly pertinent. We talked on the previous day of Committee about the funding of the regulator. We are told that some &#163;20 million will be provided by RSLs, some of which will be quite small, to pay for the regulator&#146;s costs. Now, a monopoly provider will be providing a service that, in effect, will inspect the people who are paying in a rather circuitous way for it to be inspected.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000037"></a>I have had concerns in relation to other clauses&#151;notably Clauses 192 and 193&#151;over the use of the word &#147;may&#148;. I notice that in proposed new subsection (3)(a) of Amendment No. 110E, the regulator,</p>
<ul><a name="080618119000155"></a>&#147;shall invite the Audit Commission to carry out the inspection&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000121"></a>This is one bit of text where I should have preferred to see the words &#147;may invite&#148;, and the amendment should be worded so as to build in the flexibility that we all want to see. On most occasions, the Audit Commission will be the right body to carry out the inspection. That will probably be the de facto position; nevertheless, the word &#147;may&#148; would provide for some leeway where the Audit Commission specifically did not have the

I hope that the Minister will reflect on that point.</p>

I apologise for that. Clause 199 is about inspection and later we come to a number of clauses concerning inquiries. There are specific requirements relating to charities where the scope of their work could be the subject of an inquiry and notification has to be given to the Charity Commission. I imagine that the regulator would be in touch with the Charity Commission on anything other than a very routine inspection, but can the noble Baroness explain what the relationship might be with charities at the start the regulator&#146;s powers&#151;that is, in the foothills of an inspection, rather than at the peaks of an inquiry?</p>

<p><a name="080618119000039"></a><a name="80618-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80618-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="080618119000177"></a>Lord Jones:</b> My intervention will be brief. The words &#147;tenant&#148;, &#147;social housing&#148;, &#147;local government&#148; and &#147;managers&#148; have been mentioned, not least by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I am always grateful to the Minister for her eloquent expositions. In the context of her argument, perhaps I may recommend a book that deals almost entirely with the subject of social housing&#151;or council housing, as it used to be called. It is entitled <I>Estates</I> and is by a very able young woman, Lynsey Hanley. It deals in detail, first, with the origins of the right to buy and then the rise of housing associations, allied to which there are requirements concerning inspections. Miss Hanley writes a memoir of her young life on a Birmingham council estate.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000040"></a>My noble friend may recollect that a Cabinet Minister, Sir Keith Joseph, had the habit of constructing lists of books that might be read by particular divisions in his department. The very able colleagues who advise my noble friend may wish to study in detail this book by Lynsey Hanley, which has been very well reviewed. Indeed, my noble friend may have read it and may even be able to recommend it to the Grand Committee.</p>

I have read Lynsey Hanley&#146;s book but I was not convinced by the entire argument. She was very harsh on some of our present estates but community spirit flourishes even in poor and unpromising circumstances. However, it was an interesting account of what has happened and is relevant to much of what we are about in bringing to life the Homes and Communities Agency and the regulator. The HCA is there to enable us to create better places for people to live by bringing together all the agencies in a positive and quality-conscious way&#151;thanks, not least, to my noble friend Lord Howarth&#151;and to give tenants a better deal. If Lynsey Hanley was sitting in this Committee, I hope she would be encouraged. I am sure that my erudite colleagues behind me have read the book.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000042"></a>Perhaps I may start by dealing with the group of amendments relating to the lay inspectors. On Amendment No. 110FA, I am happy to reassure the noble Baroness that lay inspectors are a valuable resource and an excellent way of ensuring that inspections have active tenant involvement and investigate problems from the  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC395"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC395</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prospective of the service user. For several reasons, the amendment is not necessary because there is nothing to prevent the inspectors from being involved in inspections under either the current or the proposed systems. The current definition of &#147;inspector&#148; in Clause 199 does not exclude them or require them. I take the point that the amendment is to enable us to discuss this issue. As I said when I introduced it, Amendment No. 110R covers a person who is authorised in writing by the Audit Commission where it is the inspector. Any person authorised by the regulator covering social housing, where the commission is not the inspector, would include lay inspectors.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000043"></a>The Audit Commission has an excellent record on lay inspection. Tenant inspection advisers have been used by the commission since housing inspections in the local authority sector started in April 2000. The Housing Corporation recruited tenants to help carry out inspections of housing associations prior to the transfer of the HA inspection function to the commission in April 2003. TIAs are used on all housing management inspections, including inspections of housing associations, ALMOs and other housing services with a customer-user focus. Even some inspections of a local authority&#146;s housing strategy service use TIAs to carry out mystery shopping. That tradition will be carried forward and is enabled by the Bill.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000044"></a>Turning to the lively debate we have just had on the Audit Commission, perhaps I may respond to the issues raised by noble Lords on the main amendment, Amendment No. 110E. I cannot deny that the Audit Commission is a monopoly but it brings consistency of inspection, great efficiency and expertise. We have allowed for cases where it does not have the expertise needed by giving the regulator a choice under Clause 192. On housing management issues, the Audit Commission has what is needed in this complex and large area of work and I am sure that it will be able to carry out its task superbly well. However, if it feels it does not have the necessary expertise, it is a sufficiently confident enough body to say so and to require the regulator to look elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000045"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, made the point that this was unnecessary because a competent regulator should be trusted to decide. He put this argument because we are dealing in notions of trust and transparency. However, it is worth repeating that we are trying to avoid a proliferation of inspections. As I have said, inspections beyond its competence should be and can be declined. We have to have that measure in the Bill for those reasons.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000046"></a>On fees and costs, at the moment, the cost of inspection is about &#163;1.8 million. Because we are removing that heavy-handed routine inspection of everyone every five years, those costs will certainly go down. The fee levels will be a matter for the regulator to work out, in consultation. We are requiring the regulator to pay the Audit Commission&#146;s cost, which, as I said, will be lower, but the Audit Commission is itself accountable to the National Audit Office, so there is value for money and accountability built in to the system. I hope that that will reassure the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. Yes, it is a government body, but it is accountable to the National Audit Office.</p>

<p><a name="080618119000047"></a>On the type of inspection applied to charities, the Charity Commission is the statutory consultee on standards, so it will be well represented. In answer to the question of the noble Baroness, inquiries will always be about mismanagement. It will be proper for the Charity Commission to be notified if there are mismanagement concerns about a particular charity. Inspections are likely to be more routine, but we would expect that if the inspection raised a particular concern in relation to a charity, the regulator would let the Charity Commission know of that concern. As a statutory consultee, we think that there will be quite a lot of traffic between them.</p>

I summed up my position on Amendment No. 96 by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618119000135"></a>&#147;Non-departmental public bodies operate most successfully when they have a high degree of independence within the terms of their Act of Parliament. The more that there is in the Bill that makes their position clear&#151;and does so to everyone who deals with them&#151;the better&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000122"></a>In contrast, I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618119000136"></a>&#147;The more there is an opportunity for the rules of the game to be changed in the middle of play, the less successful the body will be&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/6/08; col. GC 186.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000123"></a>It would be good to hear today that the noble Baroness shares that view and agrees with that conclusion. However, in her response to Amendment No. 96, in what I now read as a hot and cold reply, she said:</p>
<ul><a name="080618119000156"></a>&#147;the power of direction ... is likely to be used sparingly ... for ensuring that the agency delivers effectively against its objects&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000124"></a>She also said that my amendment,</p>
<ul><a name="080618119000157"></a>&#147;would restrict the ability of the Secretary of State to influence the behaviour of the HCA&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000125"></a>and that the power was needed,</p>
<ul><a name="080618119000158"></a>&#147;to restrict or control certain important activities&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/6/08; col. GC 183.]</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000126"></a>There is much else besides which is in conflict with the professed policy that the HCA is to be strong and independent. It is even worse for the regulator in Part 2. All his rules can be changed in the middle of the game if Parliament accepts Clause 195.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC397"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC397</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000057"></a>To reiterate, the power of direction with which public bodies must comply has been used for two purposes. The first is administrative, typically in accounts directions, while the second enables action to be taken to deal with issues that either could not have been foreseen during the passage of a Bill&#151;the Dome, for example&#151;or later, under an Act, when a non-departmental public body or a Secretary of State face a crisis needing urgent action&#151;the Dome again. Therefore the second use is as a backstop or reserve power. This has been frequently agreed by Ministers in recent times as the position of directions.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000058"></a>It is for these reasons that directions are subject to no parliamentary procedure; they come to Parliament for no form of scrutiny. Administration is de minimis&#151;crises demand urgent action. Indeed, Parliament has no established right even to see directions, which is just about all right if they remain administrative or urgent matters of last resort. Of the four directions cited by the noble Baroness at col. 183 on 10 June in Grand Committee, three were related to the Dome and one to Stratford City. These were specific, complex issues outside the normal experience and, I expect, the powers of English Partnerships. They accurately illustrate my point because they were indeed used as backstop or reserve powers.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000059"></a>The second important matter we need to remember about directions is that increasingly they are being included to cover situations that fall between the purely administrative and matters of last resort. We can see this as a steady infiltration into the middle ground of a non-departmental public body&#146;s objects and the way in which it achieves them. Clause 195 is a classic example of direction creep. Thirdly, we need to remember that directions can be a form of secondary legislation to be used, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, told us, instead of orders and capable of being utilised without parliamentary scrutiny. Why is this happening? It is because it is convenient. A clause such as Clause 195 needs little thought. Its breadth means that, combined with no scrutiny either before the event, as with the scrutiny of orders by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee or when the Act is in operation, the discretion of the Secretary of State is unrestrained. However, such untrammelled flexibility comes at a price, and a steep one at that. All pretence of independence is exposed and nobody who deals with the regulation either can or ever should believe that he or she is his or her own man. It is the Secretary of State who calls the tune however and whenever he or she wants.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000060"></a>Let us look at the detail of the clause. The paragraphs set out in subsections (1) and (2) cover just about everything in Clauses 191 and 192; indeed, is anything left out? Subsections (4) and (5) ensure that we have to go back to a zero base. Everything needs to be considered afresh. Indeed, the amendment put forward by the Minister increases the duty to consult. Since the process of consultation is open to manipulation, there is nothing to stop the Secretary of State from coming out exactly where and how he or she went in.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000061"></a>Finally, in Clause 195(8) we have a fig leaf: publication. Publication to whom, and how? On the department&#146;s website, I suppose. How detailed will the responses under Clause 195(8)(b) be? Not very, if experience is  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC398"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC398</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any guide. Then there is the direction itself. Just what can we do with that when we read it on the website? It is a fait accompli. Maybe&#151;no, indeed, not &#147;maybe&#148;; since the Secretary of State started the game again from a zero base and needs must justify the intervention, the rules of the regulator&#146;s game will have been significantly changed. If that were not to be so, the clause would have real sense or meaning.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000062"></a>I return to where I began. The more there is the perceived opportunity for the rules of the game to be changed in the middle of play, the less successful the regulator will be. Whenever directions have been put forward in this way&#151;it has happened with the lottery funds, for example&#151;the point has been taken and the powers brought back more into line with the usual and acceptable uses: administrative and last resort. That should happen again. Clause 195 should be dropped from the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="080618119000063"></a><a name="80618-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80618-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080618119000181"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> My name is also down in support of my noble friend. I need not take as long because he has explained the detail of it far more clearly than I would have attempted to do. I feel a profound sense of disappointment because the Government are displaying all their greater weaknesses. We have 18 pages&#151;from page 29 to page 38&#151;the first nine establishing what I would call the legislative background to the establishment of the regulator and the following nine establishing a freestanding independent regulator who will be empowered to do his job. Then we go on through the Bill with a lot of detail about how things will work, and so on. Finally, 35 pages later, we have this measure, which throws a blockbuster into the whole thing. I accept that it may never be used, but it says, &#147;We don&#146;t actually have any faith in everything we have written up until now. We don&#146;t have any faith that it will work or that the people who have the regulator&#146;s job might do it correctly, and therefore we have to have an absolute reserve power to amend it as and when we think fit&#148;. That is very peculiar, and I cannot say I like it.</p>

<p><a name="080618119000064"></a>It is interesting that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee drew attention to this matter in its eighth report. It says,</p>
<ul><a name="080618119000159"></a>&#147;it is not clear that section 76 of the Housing Associations Act 1985 is a relevant precedent, as suggested by the memorandum&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000127"></a>If that committee says that, we need to pay serious attention to it. It goes on:</p>
<ul><a name="080618119000160"></a>&#147;we would consider that the exercise of a general power of this kind should be exercised by statutory instrument subject to the negative resolution procedure. We invite the Minister to explain more fully to the House why the arrangements in the bill for the setting of standards is appropriate&#148;.</ul>

<ul><a name="080618119000161"></a>&#147;inadequate separation of policy and regulation (leading to the unacknowledged implementation of policy by regulation)&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000129"></a>is not of itself necessarily detrimental in respect of certain regulated items so long as it is done&#151;these are the key words&#151;in a &#147;structured&#148; and &#147;transparent&#148; way. My problem with this clause is that, having tried to build up the structure and to build in the transparency, it now takes all that away through these directions. Cave goes on to say at paragraph 2.60:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618119000137"></a>&#147;It is right that regulation should be used to achieve policy objectives. But current and future social housing providers need to have more regulatory certainty about the extent and cost of policy burdens. The process for introducing and adapting policy requirements needs to be more structured, transparent and equitable. Achieving this will significantly reduce both the policy costs and the administrative costs which regulation imposes on social housing providers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000066"></a>In Clause 195, the powers are so broad that they go against these intentions. I argue that subsection (1) allows the Secretary of State to give direction in relation to any standard whatever. In subsection (2), the Secretary of State needs only to form an opinion that his direction relates to core standards&#151;and we have already observed that core standards are extensive and broad. I recognise that the Secretary of State has a duty to consult several interested parties, and subsection (4) goes so far as to detail a list of those parties, but I hope that the Committee will note that it omits a duty to consult representatives of secured creditors. So far as I am aware, I have no interest here, but I thought that that was rather curious, given the interest that secured creditors may well have in the directions. Finally, subsection (6) allows for the Secretary of State to disapply the requirement to consult in relation to specified matters. In other words, basically the subsection says that there is no need to go beyond the direction that in the Secretary of State&#146;s opinion was the right one.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000067"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, reminded us that directions can take the form of secondary legislation. I rather liked his use of the words &#147;untrammelled flexibility&#148;. That well describes this clause, and I have great sympathy with the view that Clause 195 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

When this debate opened, the position in relation to the independence of registered social landlords was in greater jeopardy than it was with the clause that we have before us now. When this debate started, the intention was that the Secretary of State would have the power to direct the regulator in all respects in relation to every standard that the regulator might, or might not, dream up. That extensive power has now been much curtailed thanks to hard work by the National Housing Federation and particularly by colleagues in Committee in the other place. I pay tribute to Nick Raynsford and Sir George Young&#151;probably the two most distinguished post-war housing Ministers, with the exception of those occupying such posts today. They carefully worked their way through the clause and we have ended up with one in which it is simply the quality of accommodation, the rent and

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000069"></a>In early discussions on this matter, I remember the example used to illustrate the extent to which the Secretary of State&#151;through, no doubt, the wishes of the then Minister of Housing&#151;might reach out with the respect agenda in requiring housing associations to behave in particular ways toward tenants behaving anti-socially, when ASBOs might be issued. That was the concern of the Minister at the start of our discussions. A little later, we had a change of Minister. The successor Minister is, I know, very keen that registered social landlords use some of their powers to help tackle worklessness, but neither of those matters is directly concerned with the provision of housing. The ways in which registered social landlords might go about those tasks, even though they are very important, will vary, and the Government will not always get right the way that they might prescribe activity under those headings. I was extremely pleased that the Government backed down and recognised that, in most respects, the regulator should be left to decide these standards on their own.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000070"></a>Some have gone further and said that the regulator should be confined to the same three core areas of activity as registered social landlords. However, I know from my experience that a Housing Minister is much more likely than a regulator to come up with an exciting, new, innovative policy that is not entirely related to the ways in which housing associations and other social landlords might wish to behave. Regulators are in my experience rather more constrained and are concerned directly with the regulation of the function of the organisation. I feel much less threatened now by the independence of this sector than when the Bill started out.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000071"></a>I went to the annual general meeting reception of the National Council of Voluntary Organisations yesterday. The Minister for the Third Sector, Phil Hope, gave an excellent speech, telling us that the independence of the voluntary sector was its most precious asset. The ability for organisations to run their own affairs, for their own boards to take charge and be independent and autonomous, is the essence of this sector, of which the housing associations, registered social landlords and social housing providers are part.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000072"></a>It is well worth our considering these amendments and seeing how best we can improve and enhance the independence of the organisations to which the regulator&#146;s work refers, but we also need to pay tribute to government for retreating from the opportunity to make much more draconian interventions.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000075"></a>The Government&#146;s considered response to that is the reason for the clauses being the way that they are now. In the original drafting the power was too open-ended&#151;essentially, it permitted the Secretary of State to set standards on any issue&#151;but that was never our intention. There were limitations on the power in any case: the Secretary of State could not give directions requiring the regulator to act contrary to its fundamental objectives, including objective 10, or regulate anything unconnected to social housing. However, it became evident that those conditions were neither clear nor sufficient enough to allay the concern and we agreed to amend the Bill at Report stage so that it better reflected our intentions.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000076"></a>As I have said, that was always our intention. Why would it be otherwise? What is the point of setting up a regulatory system if it is not independent from government? That is the whole point. We have done that and this regulator is far from being just an agent for government directions. This clause covers none of the provisions in Clause 192 and a very limited range of issues in Clause 191. Other than directions on standards and a role in selecting the board, the Government will have virtually no control over the regulator. I invite the Committee to consider how that compares with the Housing Corporation, the costs of which are paid and the targets set by the Government, who also have the power to direct it on any issue. My noble friend Lady Dean paid tribute to that. It is a draconian power which is very different from what we are offering in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000077"></a>We have sought throughout to strike the right balance between the regulator&#146;s independence and the need for the Government to have a say in certain key issues on which standards are set and which are fundamental to how tenants and social housing can be managed in terms of rents, physical housing standards and tenant engagement.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000078"></a>On the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, I refer the Committee to paragraphs 5.12, 5.13 and 5.14 of the Cave review, which states:</p>
<ul><a name="080618119000162"></a>&#147;the regulator should be independent of government with that independence defined by statute. But there are certain defined matters for which the government should have the power to issue directions to the regulator. The first of these areas relates to housing standards&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000130"></a>It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618119000138"></a>&#147;The second key area for government direction relates to rent levels&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618119000131"></a>The Government have a clear interest in setting a strategic rents policy. We have to ensure that rents are not set too high and that they are fair, both for the benefit of tenants and, frankly, because otherwise we end up paying huge amounts in housing benefit.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000079"></a>We also have to acknowledge&#151;Cave certainly did&#151;that some improvements of physical standards have required huge amounts of public money, in particular under the Decent Homes policy, and the regulator should not be able to require them without government approval. I am referring to the &#163;20 billion which has gone into that element of our economy.</p>

When I referred to the powers being rather broad, I was interpreting the words &#147;in the Secretary of State&#146;s opinion&#148; in subsection (2). I do not understand why the word &#147;opinion&#148; is there. If the clause is to address those standards, it should say so; it should not leave it open to a particular Secretary of State&#146;s opinion.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000082"></a>In any case, our amendment ensured that the Secretary of State may direct the regulator only if, in the Secretary of State's opinion, either the standard, or its content, related to one of three things: the quality of accommodation; involvement by tenants; and management by registered providers of accommodation. We added that because that is what the Bill is about: tenant involvement. We thought it sufficiently important to give it that prominence. On other issues, the Secretary of State can set objectives which the regulator must have regard to, but they are not binding and the regulator will consider them along with issues raised by other stakeholders.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000083"></a>We also made two other amendments. We amended subsection (3) so that the Secretary of State must have regard to the regulator&#146;s fundamental objectives when deciding whether to give a direction, so we have tied the hands of the Secretary of State in that way. Although the effect of a direction may be that the regulator has to strike a difficult balance between its objectives than it would otherwise have chosen to do, we think it only right that the regulator&#146;s fundamental objectives should affect the Secretary of State as well as the regulator.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000084"></a>We also introduced at subsection (5) a provision similar to that in Clause 194, requiring the Secretary of State to consult the Charity Commission on any directions that may affect charities to ensure that there is no breach of charitable status. The Secretary of State's powers to give directions in relation to standards was also intended to introduce a greater degree of transparency into the process, to pick up the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. Cave recognised concerns about policy passporting: that obligations or pressures were being placed on registered providers to implement government policies without that being openly discussed or the sources of the obligations being clear. That is why subsection (4) requires the Secretary of State to consult the regulator, the HCA and representatives of registered providers and tenants of social housing before giving the regulator a direction. We will add the Audit Commission to that list.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000085"></a>Through other amendments to subsection (8), we have further reinforced the transparency of the direction process by requiring the Secretary of State to publish not only the directions made but each proposed direction that is the subject of consultation and each response. It is an issue for the website, but it is very accessible and most people these days are very familiar with accessing websites.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000087"></a>Finally, subsection (6) provides for a situation where the Secretary of State issues a direction that is adopted intact by the regulator as a performance standard. Frankly, it will be pointless for both bodies to consult the same consultees on the same issue. Where the final standards differed from the direction they would probably have to be a second consultation.</p>

<p><a name="080618119000088"></a>I hope that I have been able to reassure noble Lords that this has been an iterative and open process which, in its evolution, has changed the balance in the Bill between the regulator and the Secretary of State. It has embedded the independence of the regulator, while giving some residual but very necessary powers to the Secretary of State. That is a proper balance. It has certainly been a proper parliamentary process. On that basis, I hope that noble Lords will agree that the clause should stand part.</p>

<p><a name="080618119000089"></a><a name="80618-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80618-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080618119000187"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I should first apologise to the Grand Committee; I completely forgot to say that I am a member of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, to which the Minister referred, but my views go rather beyond what was in its report. What I have said and will say is my personal view, not the view of the committee. I remain in a difficulty.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000090"></a>The problem is that we are discussing two completely separate things. I come to the practical one first. I quite understand that there will need to be conversations and leverage of some sort&#151;there is plenty about, of course&#151;if things are not going as well with the regulator as the Secretary of State considers that they should or if the Secretary of State identifies improvements that the regulator could make. No one can have any objection to there being a proper dialogue, guidance or whatever. It is the words &#147;must comply&#148; which provide the difficulty. That means that in a state of disagreement, the regulator must comply, because he will have received a direction.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000091"></a>The second issue is completely different. It concerns the relationship between secondary regulation and the power of direction as used by Secretaries of State and the relationship with Parliament. As with orders, Parliament gets the opportunity to scrutinise, not on a website, but in a legal document, what is being proposed. It also has the chance to debate either by prayer to annul or needing an affirmative resolution what is written in that legal document. Everybody then knows that it has really been thought through and that it has been the subject of parliamentary scrutiny so that the opinions and prospective opinions of Parliament have been taken into account before the order was laid. This is not so with directions, and that is why directions, which are subject to no parliamentary scrutiny or procedure, have always been reserved for particular uses, not for general use. While I have the greatest respect for the positive report of the noble Lord, Lord Best&#151;I understand about progress on the practical matters and I welcome it&#151;it does not go to the point of the formality of receiving a direction which must be

<p><a name="080618119000092"></a>I remain of the opinion that what is set out in Clause 195 could be achieved by perfectly acceptable means within the relationship between the regulator and the Secretary of State, but should not be achieved by directions. That is my position and I am certain that in one way or another I shall return to the matter.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618119000139"></a> After Clause 195, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618119000143"></a>(3) The regulator shall, within 12 months of the commencement of this section, undertake a review of safety standards for water heating including the storage and supply of hot water.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000095"></a>The noble Baroness said: This proposed new clause would require the regulator to undertake reviews of safety standards. It is prompted in particular by concerns over water heating systems. I understand from the Minister that the accident&#151;if that is the right way to describe it&#151;that prompted my honourable friend the Member for Taunton and the honourable Member for St Ives to raise this in the Commons took place on the Minister&#146;s first day in office at the Department for Communities and Local Government. I am sure that noble Lords will remember the incident&#151;a word I hate&#151;where the appalling explosion of a water cistern above a cot in which a young child was sleeping resulted in her death.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000096"></a>I have drawn the clause in broader terms because it seemed appropriate. We are so close to the end of the Bill that I am reluctant to raise narrow matters when they ought to be placed in the context of what the regulator will be doing, but in the case of hot water cisterns, the Government are conducting a consultation at the moment and a new British standard is to be introduced. However, it will not be retrospective, which means that water cisterns installed before the 2004 British standard came into effect are not the subject of it.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000097"></a>My honourable friend has asked Questions of the Government, and the Answers deal with prospective work, not the retrospective implementation of the 2004 British standard. The Government obviously will want to await the outcome of the consultation since it is only a month or two away, but I hope that they will not sit on it and will take seriously the need to look at existing cisterns and their installation in order to ensure that they are safe. We would all be appalled if such a thing were to happen again. I beg to move.</p>

We are united in our determination to do everything possible to ensure that such deaths do not happen again. Since the appalling accident and others like it, the Health and Safety Executive produced a comprehensive safety note explaining the symptoms of and remedies for the problem. The safety note also set out best practice for the installation of hot water systems. The Housing Corporation arranged for that alert to be distributed to every housing association, so that they would be fully informed about what they should do and look out for.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000099"></a>The department is updating the Decent Homes guidance which will refer landlords to the HSE safety note to ensure that advice is taken into consideration by landlords when preparing investment plans, so that they can look at what they need to change. The noble Baroness knows that we brought forward proposals to widen the requirements relating to hot water safety in Part G, on hygiene, of the building regulations. Those proposals for consultation were published on 13 May and we will implement any changes early in 2009. I think that that was the review to which the noble Baroness referred. I will write to her about the issue of retrospection, because that raises more complex issues than I can address in the Committee.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000100"></a>Essentially, the proposed changes, if implemented, would seek to ensure that hot water systems, including the cylinder, the cistern and controls, are robust and do not let the system overheat to the extent that it fails, because that is the technical failure that has been causing the problems. As the noble Baroness knows, safety standards for existing dwellings are dealt with by the Housing Act 2004 via the Housing Health and Safety Rating System, the HHSRS; but duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 can also be applied and enforced in respect of the providers of rented housing when the conduct of the undertaking results in risk to tenants. That can help by ensuring that the HSE notice is distributed to all RSLs and that would also set standards for the condition of properties that would encompass compliance with health and safety matters. So the two systems working together can close that information gap. The landlords of existing rented stock have a duty of care to tenants and safety alerts make them aware of possible hazards from water heaters.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000101"></a>That series of actions is very practical and is targeted on RSLs to ensure that they are fully informed. I understand the intention in the amendment to put the issue on the regulator&#146;s agenda in the form of a review. I do not think that that would be the right way forward, because the combination of the scrupulousness of the HSE and the building regulations is focused much more on consequential routes for addressing this. The issue goes much further than the social housing sector, as the noble Baroness knows. The regulator will not have direct authority over compliance with safety standards, because that comes under the HHSRS. Rather than requiring the regulator to carry out such a highly specialised review during its 12 months, we must bear in mind that in order to be fully effective and in order to choose some of these outcomes, he needs to be fully focused on the statutory objectives.  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC406"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC406</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>So, current regulatory practice illustrates the role that the regulator might play. In fact, under Clause 191, one of the objectives of the regulator is to ensure that tenants enjoy an appropriate degree of protection. The clause empowers him to set standards on the quality of accommodation, facilities and services provided by registered providers, so if it is appropriate for the regulator to cover this issue, we need to note that he does have sufficient tools to do so. However, neither we nor he would want to duplicate the arrangements that are in place.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000102"></a>The Housing Corporation also regulates by means of a regulatory code which sets out fundamental obligations on housing associations in order to meet the corporation&#146;s regulatory requirements. Under the code, RSLs are required to comply with the law, including safety standards, to ensure that the homes their residents live in are well maintained and in a lettable condition. The regulator can also help by facilitating and encouraging awareness of problems and legal obligations. I think that we have in place a system of safety and protection, access to information and ongoing work that, it is hoped, will help to ensure that we do not see another tragic accident in the future.</p>

<p><a name="080618119000108"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment briefly addresses a matter of fairness. Under Clause 198 the regulator can require the provider to pay some or all of the costs of the survey and report. I should say as an aside that my introduction may not be long enough to allow the Minister to get to his place in order to respond. However, it seems to me that the registered provider should be required to pay only if the survey upholds the regulator&#146;s suspicions&#151;that is the word used slightly earlier on. It would not be fair for the provider to have to pay if he gets a clean bill of health. I beg to move.</p>

A survey allows the regulator to enter a property to see whether a provider has improved the home or carried out maintenance to the agreed standard. It is an existing Housing Corporation power and is one of the ways in which the regulator can investigate a breach of maintenance standards either in response to tenants&#146; concerns or on its own suspicions. It can check, for example, that a roof has been mended or a boiler installed. A regulator which prioritises accommodation standards for tenants would use this power.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000110"></a>It is not our intention that the Government should pay the regulator&#146;s running costs and it is anticipated that the regulator will raise almost all of its income from fees recovered from registered providers. Clause 177 allows the regulator&#146;s costs to be met largely by fees imposed on the whole provider sector. It is likely, for example, that an annual fee will be paid by all registered providers. Additionally, specific powers in the Bill allow the regulator to charge individual providers on the &#147;polluter pays&#148; principle. If the regulator were not allowed to charge individual providers for a survey, it would have to absorb the cost. That means, in effect, that the other providers would ultimately pay through increased fees.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000111"></a>If the concern is that the regulator will use this power irresponsibly, I can offer some comfort. The regulator cannot charge more than the survey costs and can charge part or none of its costs if it thinks that is appropriate. So the regulator cannot possibly profit from running a survey. It must follow objective 10, which prevents unnecessary regulation, and it can charge none, part or all of the costs to respond to individual circumstances.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000112"></a>We want a proactive regulator, not one that responds at the last minute in cases of serious abuse by a provider. If the regulator cannot charge for a survey unless it can prove its suspicions are justified, we fear, not unreasonably, that it will either be discouraged from carrying out surveys proactively unless it is very certain in its concerns or, more likely, it will charge the costs to all providers in general rather than only the individual provider whose stock it surveyed. A question of fairness is involved in this issue.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080618119000113"></a>In order for the amendment to work, the regulator would have to set out its suspicions publicly before the survey. That would add to bureaucracy. It may not be easy to tell, based on the survey alone, whether its suspicions are justified. I pose the question: what happens if the regulator considers its suspicions are upheld but the provider disagrees? Would there be legal challenges? This could end up costing more than the survey fees. That would benefit no one as all providers have to pay for the regulator to defend such cases in their annual fee. Overall, it would discourage the regulator from charging for surveys whatever the result and place the cost instead on the annual fee. By reasons of equity, that would not be fair. We would rather leave the choice of whether to charge directly to the regulator. I hope that answers the noble Baroness&#146;s points.</p>

Here we have another situation where we are relying on the regulator to be reasonable. There is nothing here to say that the charge should in any way relate to a reasonable assessment of the need for the survey. I hear what the Minister has to say. It is most reassuring that this is not novel. If providers have not experienced problems in the past, commonsense might apply. No doubt providers will read this report&#151;this came out of my own head; I was not asked to raise the issue&#151;and if they have a concern they will seek a way of taking forward a narrow but important point of fairness.</p>

<p><a name="080618142000016"></a>Under Clause 201, the regulator can require a provider to put together certain information and specify the matters to be covered. Clause 202 refers to information that is likely to be useful. The amendments are about what would be useful. They both require the breaking-down of information by local authority area. A number  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC410"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC410</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of us in this Committee have spoken previously about the local authorities&#146; obvious democratic interest and their strategic interest in the performance of providers, who after all would be carrying out what not so very long ago was primarily a local authority function.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000017"></a>RSLs typically report against stock holdings and performance at a national level, so they are assessed at a national level, or there is an aggregation or averaging-out of performance, which means that poor performance in specific localities is not clear. Equally, particularly good performance is not made clear. If the reporting is not specific by area, those who are immediately and directly affected do not have the information which the Bill attempts in various ways to provide.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000018"></a>Information on RSL performance will also allow local authorities to ensure that tenants receive an equal service across the sector. It is clear that London Councils, which has asked me to put forward these amendments, is signed up to the Government&#146;s agenda because it states that information is a,</p>
<ul><a name="080618142000434"></a>&#147;valuable resource for any local authority in place shaping and leading the Sustainable Communities Agenda&#148;.</ul>

These are probing amendments about the purpose and effect of Clauses 201 and 202 about the way information will be provided, collected and published.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000021"></a>I want to focus on Clause 202, which really is the key clause, but the principles I shall set out reflect Clause 201 and Amendment No. 110RB as well. The clause states that the regulator is required to publish performance information at least once a year, but it also stipulates that that must include information likely to be useful to tenants, potential tenants and local authorities. We added that clause to the Bill in the other place because we wanted to clarify what the regulator had to do as a minimum to meet the recommendations of the Cave review regarding information for tenants.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000022"></a>It is true that the regulator has clear statutory objectives to ensure that tenants have chosen the opportunity to be involved in the management of their homes, but it is clear to me that in order for consumers to exercise genuine choice in any sort of market they have to have sufficient information about the alternatives on offer. They can hardly have any form of choice without information that enables them to compare how their landlord performs in their areas against other landlords. Part of the purpose of Clause 202 is to meet that need.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000023"></a>It is not just about information for existing tenants. Potential tenants of social housing also deserve to be able to compare landlord performance in their area when they enter the social housing system. That gives  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC411"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC411</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them some useful information and useful choices. I agree that performance information is going to be of critical use to local authorities. They have an obvious interest in knowing how well landlords in their area are performing.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000024"></a>London Councils has argued that there needs to be a clause requiring this performance information to be broken down by local authority area level. I agree with that. I assure the noble Baroness that Clause 202 in effect requires the performance information published by the regulator to be broken down by local authority area level. If information has to be at that level in order to be useful to local authorities&#151;as I, the noble Baroness and stakeholders believe it does&#151;then that is what the regulator will have to provide in order to meet its duty under this clause.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000025"></a>It is reasonable, given that we are all agreed on this, to ask: &#147;Why don&#146;t we just say in the Bill that the performance information that is published should be broken down by local authority area?&#148;. In addition to the argument I have just put, we have here a clause that allows the right sort of flexibility. Instead of drafting Clause 202 in the way we have done, if we had drawn up a clause that had this sort of detail we would inevitably have ended up with a clause that had to cover every other aspect of the nature of the information&#151;who it should be available to, how it should be provided, how it should be accessed; all sorts of exhaustive requirements. That would have been very difficult and would have left the regulator with little room to respond to changing needs.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000026"></a>I hope the noble Baroness will accept that that is the intention. That is certainly how we want to see the clause being interpreted and implemented. It is not merely limited to requiring that the performance information should be broken down by local authority level; it could cover other types of performance information that is of use to tenants and local authorities as well.</p>

<p><a name="080618142000027"></a>The same principles apply to the first amendment in the group. Amendment No. 110RA would require registered providers, when submitting performance information to the regulator under Clause 201, to break down that information by each local authority. Again, I can provide the assurance that the noble Baroness seeks. I hope that having that on the record will reassure local authorities that they will get the information in the most useful form as they need it.</p>

A point that has just occurred to me is whether deciding what information is likely to be useful would be one of the matters that the regulator has to consult on when he sets standards, as provided for in Clause 194. The Minister will know from our discussion a couple of days ago that I believe that local authorities should appear in the list of consultees. Those representing the interests of tenants are consultees, so there is obviously a fairly close link here.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000039"></a>The noble Lord said: This group contains four amendments to Clause 203. Three are government amendments, Amendments Nos. 110S, 110T and 110U, and one, Amendment No. 110SA, has been tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. The government amendments strengthen the statutory requirements for individuals conducting an inquiry into the affairs of a registered provider to be independent of the regulator. Noble Lords will know that statutory inquiries are undertaken when the regulator has serious concerns about the management of a landlord. The findings of the statutory inquiry can lead to the use of the regulator&#146;s strongest intervention powers, including the transfer of a provider&#146;s land. This power has been used on four occasions in recent years. It is therefore essential that the individuals conducting the inquiry are demonstrably independent of the regulator.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000040"></a>At present, Clause 203 requires that at least one of the team conducting an inquiry is independent of the regulator. Individuals are independent if they and members of their family are not and have not been in the preceding five years members or employees of the regulator. Current Housing Corporation policy is that all members of the inquiry team should be independent of the regulator. Amendments Nos. 110S and 110T will put this policy in the Bill. Amendment No. 110U extends the definition of &#147;independent&#148; so that individuals working for the Housing Corporation on a consultancy basis are also excluded. This reflects a change in working practices since the legislation was drafted. It is now more common for organisations like the regulator to employ individuals on a short-term consultancy basis, and we believe that it is important that any potential conflicts of interest are explicitly ruled out. I am sure noble Lords will agree that this will strengthen the protections already present in the system.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC414"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC414</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tenants; but even the narrower definition of social tenants should be covered in the regulator&#146;s scope in the Bill. I should declare my interest as the chair of the National Consumer Council and its successor body. It is probably the first time in the House of Lords that the new name of the successor body has been mentioned, Consumer Focus. So Members of the Committee can consider that to be a public announcement.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000052"></a>We are in favour of different forms of engagement between tenants, their organisations and the new regulator. There are three dimensions to that. Unfortunately, I was not at the previous session of the Committee, but I would have strongly supported the noble Earl&#146;s amendment to strengthen the duty in the Bill to engage with tenants. I regret that my noble friend the Minister rejected that approach and I hope that she will reconsider that. That is an ongoing framework within which the regulator should continue to engage with tenants&#146; organisations and tenants.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000053"></a>The amendment is more specific. We have just passed without amendment the references to inquiries by the regulator, but how do tenants and their organisations trigger such inquiries or other forms of intervention and action by the regulator? The new clause proposed by the amendment would allow tenants&#146; organisations that are nationally recognised by the Secretary of State&#151;and we know that a number of them exist&#151;and organisations that are locally recognised by the provider, which have standard consultation procedures, to bring to the attention of the regulator situations of general mismanagement which they felt was carried on by a social housing provider in their area, or more generally. The amendment would give the right of initiative, in other words, to tenants and their organisations to bring to the attention of the regulator such alleged or perceived abuse.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000054"></a>The regulator would have to make its own assessment as to whether to do anything about these situations. It would have 60 days to decide on whether to take action and what form of action was necessary. In serious cases, it would probably decide to hold an inquiry, under the clause that we have just passed. This gives more power of initiation to the tenants&#146; organisations. There are some difficulties in defining those tenants&#146; organisations and how they would qualify in certain circumstances. Some of that probably has to be left to the regulator to tidy up, or is for the Government to tidy up in subordinate legislation.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000055"></a>It is important that people who feel that their current provider is mismanaging their property, their relations with the tenants or other services of the provider should be able to trigger action by the regulator. Judgment of the seriousness of the case and what form of action to take is the regulator&#146;s responsibility.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000056"></a>The clause provides a positive a role for tenants and their organisations. I do not see its equivalent in other provisions. Although the Minister may feel that this is not quite the right way to do it, I hope that the Government recognise that we must convince tenants that a serious change is being made, whereby they have some levers in their hands. That would make the credibility of the new regulator more substantial than does the present draft of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

I hope that the Minister will speak positively about the principle if not literally every word of the amendment. I cross-reference what we are seeing in the Minister&#146;s own department. John Healey as Minister for Local Government has called for powers for community calls for action, whereby the community is enabled to initiate change when it thinks that something is wrong. Hazel Blears, the Secretary of State, sees community empowerment as being a fundamentally important part of progressive politics. The amendment is four-square with that thrust of policy. Therefore, I hope that it will be given a warm welcome.</p>

I hope that she will none the less support the principle and thrust of the amendment and perhaps bring back her own.</p>

Tenants need a clear way in which they can make complaints and be listened to, and the amendment provides one of them. That does not necessarily mean that the wording is right&#151;the clarity of subsection (8) is a problem&#151;but I am sure that we could find a way through that. However, it needs to be clear to tenants what they have to do to make a complaint and what has to happen in response. The amendment does not tie the regulator to saying what it will do and when and how; it leaves it with the flexibility that it needs.</p>

I align myself entirely with what the amendment tries to do. It provides a good opportunity to discuss broadly what the Bill means to tenants. We anticipated some of that debate when we addressed the issues raised the other day by my noble friend Lord Filkin.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000063"></a>The noble Lord has put forward one mechanism for doing what he seeks. We, too, have put much thought into addressing how we make effective provision for the issues raised by tenants. It is very much work in progress for us. He will probably agree that designing a classical system for complaints to the regulator is not easy, and I appreciate the work that has gone into crafting the amendment.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC416"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC416</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000064"></a>Perhaps I may just run over the broader argument. There is a whole set of powers and duties in the Bill, and essentially they add up to a new system which for the first time allows for tenants to be more involved in the regulatory process. Essentially, Martin Cave suggested that evidence from tenants should contribute to the regulatory process, and it is that point that the amendment seeks to address. In recommendation 12, he said that the regulator should develop a range of ways of triggering interventions in consultation with providers and National Tenant Voice. That was addressed to the regulator. He also said that triggering mechanisms should ideally be based on a combination of desktop analysis, references from tenants and other bodies, including local authorities, and whistleblowing.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000065"></a>I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment. I agree that the regulator should be responsive to tenants&#146; concerns and use evidence from them to justify its interventions, as Clause 98 permits. However, I think that Cave was proposing that tenants or selected tenant groups should be given a new statutory right to require the regulator to take specific action in relation to tenant concerns. When he talked to us on 2 June, he said quite clearly that his intention was to provide for a &#147;conveyer belt&#148; of information to be sent to the regulator so that it could better decide what to do.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80618-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000066"></a>Let us look at the key features of a duty to address complaints. If the regulator is to be compelled to address them&#151;bound by a specific duty instead of being trusted that it will seek evidence in an inclusive way&#151;then there is immediate pressure for us to define what we expect it to do. What sort of complaints should it handle? We certainly all agree on one issue: a regulator can hardly handle every tenant complaint from 4 million social homes. We have always thought&#151;a belief that I think is common around the Committee&#151;that it should not be the regulator&#146;s job to deal with most tenant complaints. They should be dealt with, first, by the landlord and then, if necessary, by access to the ombudsman. That is the correct route. Therefore, the regulator should be involved only where a tenant concern suggests a systematic failure to deliver. That might be on the basis of very few tenants who have identified a really serious problem, or it might be on a more general set of evidence. However, the whole issue is really about feeding evidence from tenants into the regulatory process.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000067"></a>On the second issue of deciding when to act, Cave was very clear that these choices were especially difficult for any regulator. He said that it was for the regulator to determine how to act. Why would we have a skilled regulator with responsibility to balance its objectives if we did not trust it to make decisions on the process of handling and using evidence? I am absolutely clear that it has to be possible to treat evidence in a transparent, inclusive and fair way, but it is difficult to define an entire complaint procedure in statute. That is partly where the problem lies because inevitably one ends up with an inflexible and bureaucratic set of structures. We have tried to do it. Officials have spent a great deal of time looking at how the necessity for that instinct can be translated into something proper and proportionate.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000068"></a>I turn to the details of the amendment. It requires the regulator to consider any complaint by a &#147;designated body&#148; or &#147;locally recognised representative body&#148; suggesting mismanagement by a provider which is detrimental to tenants. I am not at all clear why the amendment is concerned about a system of designation. The only power that a designated body seems to have is the right to make a complaint, which the regulator has to consider. It shares that right with locally recognised representative bodies. It is not clear here who recognises whom. There are some issues concerning the idea of designation. I am a little concerned about the idea of the centre designating some tenant bodies as conduits for information and not others. Since I have spent a lot of time in this Committee saying that this is not a centralised and bureaucratic structure, I am concerned that this is centralised, bureaucratic and rather burdensome. I want to explore the implications of the issue of designation.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000069"></a>The amendment also says that the regulator should publish a response within 60 days saying what it intends to do and why, and that allowing the regulator to decide what to do requires the regulator to issue guidance to complainants on the presentation of complaints. It is not clear to me how that works, but all that will follow consultation. The amendment would also enable the Secretary of State by order to designate bodies representing the interests of tenants of social housing and would require her to publish criteria on designation. That is where the weight of the bureaucracy falls.</p>

<p><a name="080618142000070"></a>The proposal has many good features. It has sound principles, such as the need to issue and consult on guidance, and the attempt to limit complaints that come to the regulator by filtering them through responsible bodies. I do not want to labour the point that I think the amendment in this form will not work; Members around the Committee have made it clear that they have issues with the content and the detail, but they are in favour of the amendment in principle. We should think hard about whether we want to create something that is inflexible but that also risks confusing tenants about who is responsible for addressing their concerns and sets up an unnecessary and rather divisive system of centrally designated tenant representatives. There would be risks in that, including legal challenge.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000071"></a>This is where we end up. We have to be careful about the detail. We need to be concerned also about the burden on the regulator in terms of the wide range of objectives. Changing the system in any respect would require primary legislation because I do not know of any other regulators or public bodies with complaints systems that are so rigidly defined in law. I remember, when I was a Whip at the Department of Health, having agonising discussions about complaints procedures and how one could arrive at something that was successful but was also proportionate and effective.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000072"></a>We have been considering how we can achieve these shared desired outcomes, giving the regulator more flexibility but also making it clear to the tenants how they can complain, what they can expect and how they will be treated in that process. I am inspired by what Cave said: that the regulator, not the Government or

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000073"></a>I sincerely hope that I can come back on Report with a way forward that will go some way towards meeting the concerns of the noble Lord as reflected in the amendment and ensure that, in a system moderated by the regulator, he is obliged to try hard&#151;and to succeed, but in a flexible way&#151;to establish a system that is generally responsive to the category of complaints that I have set out and will provide proper accountability to all stakeholders. With that commitment, I hope the noble Lord will feel confident that he can await Report stage, where we will continue the debate.</p>

<p><a name="080618142000074"></a><a name="80618-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80618-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080618142000465"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that last point and I certainly look forward to her propositions for what lies behind the amendment. Somewhere in the middle there she lost me, however. Maybe I can help her, or her officials, a little on what I intend here and what I do not. This is not about individual landlord/tenant issues. It is about general mismanagement&#151;she used the term &#147;systemic&#148;&#151;by the social housing provider that needs to be drawn to the attention of the regulator.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000075"></a>The Minister rightly points out that Cave says that all sorts of evidence will be coming in to the regulator and he will have to make up his mind what he does and does not pursue. There will need to be systems for that and how the evidence will be presented, and that will be communicated back down the line to tenants and their organisations. However, that is a somewhat passive way to treat tenants and their organisations. I thought that the regulator and the spirit of Cave wanted to encourage the active engagement of tenants in improving the quality of social housing provision and thus to provide an ability for them to initiate action. Tenants would not simply provide evidence of which the regulator may or may not take account or that would allow it to make up its mind on whether to intervene or not in areas where they perceived bad mismanagement, but there would be a formal system whereby tenants can put the problem on the regulator&#146;s desk. This would not constrain the regulator in what it could do about the situation, but it would have to respond one way or the other and indicate what it was going to do. There would be no constraint on the judgment of the regulator as to what is important or otherwise, or on the remedy or intervention, but it would mean that there would be an active role for tenants in their organisations.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000076"></a>I was trying to help the Government and the regulator in the area of designation. There are many organisations which purport to speak for tenants both locally and nationally, and just because a bit of headed notepaper arrives in the regulator&#146;s office, it does not necessarily mean that it is from an organisation that is any sense representative. There are two criteria: national organisations with which the Government, the regulator and the new agency will engage&#151;a relatively short list that could be regarded as a designated list&#151;and, at the local level, housing providers themselves who recognise serious residents&#146; or tenants&#146; organisations within their estate or management block. There is a relatively easy way of doing this which does not have to be too

I do not regard it as bureaucratic or overly centralised. It is intended to limit the organisations that make use of it to those bodies which are judged to be truly representative.</p>

<p><a name="080618142000077"></a>I thank all noble Lords who have supported the principle of the amendment. I anticipated there would be some drafting problems but the principle has received widespread support. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Best, that people who live on social landlord estates also ought to have rights. Earlier I moved an amendment in rather broader terms to that effect. This is an area in which, without making regulation general in a way to which the noble Baroness objected previously, we could at least enable people to raise issues of management when they live on an estate that is managed by a social provider. You would not necessarily have to give them more general rights or extend the regulator&#146;s remit as far as my earlier amendment sought. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Best, for his suggestion and I hope that my noble friend and the department will take it on board. However, I take heart from the fact that she is going to reconsider the matter and bring something forward. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The first of those amendments inserts into Clause 215, on the exercise of enforcement powers, a specific reference to Objective 10 in Clause 88 regarding the proportionality objective. We may be told&#151;I am sure we will&#151;that that applies throughout Part 2. If that is so, why was it necessary to include paragraphs (b) and (c) in subsection (2) of Clause 215? I would have thought that proportionality would have taken into account in paragraph (b) regarding whether a failure or a problem was serious or trivial and, in paragraph (c) whether the failure or problem was an isolated incident. I hope for assurances as to how Objective 10 will be applied when it comes to the making of hard decisions by the regulator.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000097"></a>Amendment No. 110XB to Clause 217 provides, when the regulator issues an enforcement notice, that the case relates to mismanagement of affairs regarding social housing. I thought that this matter was dealt with somewhere else in the Bill. I could not find it and it is probably simply eluding me, rather than not being there. I seek to ensure that mismanagement is what this Bill is about, rather than anything wider, if I may put it that way. Amendment No. 110XC to Clause 226 on the imposition of fines is similar.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000098"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has tabled Amendment No. 110XD in this group. It relates to Clause 228, which will need amendment in any event as a result of something that happened in the Commons. Clearly, it is incorrect that that amendment relates to Clause 228(3) because it was intended to refer to subsection (2).</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000099"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 111ZZA is an amendment to the definition of mismanagement which, as it stands, includes affairs conducted &#147;improperly or inappropriately&#148;. Mismanagement is a serious matter that can prompt serious actions by the regulator. I have no problem with conducting affairs &#147;improperly&#148;, but what is &#147;inappropriately&#148;? What I think is inappropriate may not be what other noble Lords think is inappropriate, or vice versa. It is too wide and subjective a term to have a place in the definition of a term whose application can have major consequences. I beg to move.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="080618142000305"></a>That would remove the right of the Secretary of State to amend by negative order the amount specified in the Bill, &#163;5,000, as a penalty, and instead make it subject to the affirmative procedure. The Executive should not be able to vary this already substantial amount without parliamentary scrutiny. This kind of order is too important and potentially too controversial to be passed by the negative procedure. The amendment would put in place a recommendation from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on page 4 of its report. The committee points out that a similar unlimited derogation in the Communications Bill 2002

Clause 228 ensures that the penalty fine cannot be raised above &#163;5,000 unless the Secretary of State amends the amount by order. Noble Lords seek to ensure that the order is affirmative. That follows a recommendation made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, and I completely agree. We propose to do the same by way of Amendment No. 116C, which amends Clause 318(3), a general clause on the procedure to be applied to orders. Amendment No. 116C adds orders under Clause 228 to the list of those that must be approved by resolution in each House of Parliament. I am grateful that he, both formally and informally, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, have pointed out that there is an error in the numbering. I thank them for helping us with that.</p>

Perhaps I may assure the noble Baroness that there is no need for the amendment because objective 10 already applies to this clause, as it does to every function of the regulator. However, she asked why we need these subsections in their current form. The clause imposes a very stringent test on the regulator. It is necessary to clarify what &#147;proportionality&#148; means in terms of enforcement, for example, as opposed to standard-setting or information, which is why the clause is there.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000108"></a>Taken together, this clause and objective 10 provide that the regulator must seek to regulate in a manner which minimises interference and is proportionate, and that when the regulator decides to take enforcement action, he must give particular consideration to all the issues mentioned in subsection (2) of this clause.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000109"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 110XB and 110XC, which concern mismanagement in relation to social housing&#151;a very important issue. Perhaps I may briefly describe what &#147;mismanagement&#148; is. It is about how the affairs of the registered provider are conducted. In most cases, it will relate solely to the registered provider&#146;s management of its social housing, but the mismanagement ground could apply, for example, to general financial mismanagement which is not directly linked to social

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000110"></a>It is important that &#147;mismanagement&#148; is considered not just to be mismanagement of social housing&#151;that is, breach of Clause 191 standards&#151;otherwise, the regulator would have to sit on its hands when faced with serious financial problems in an association. We do not want that because there might be a risk of insolvency of the provider, which would not be in the interests of protecting assets or tenants. Moreover, wider governance issues could also ultimately have an impact on tenants, and that is why we want the regulator to catch such issues early. It also needs to be able to challenge mismanagement on other non-social housing issues, such as the failure to submit accounts. As it is important that the regulator tackles issues such as that quickly, probably by an enforcement notice or a penalty, it will rely on accounts to be assured that the provider remains financially stable. Failure to provide correct information may be an early sign of serious governance problems. The amendment would make that harder to challenge. I want the regulator to be able to take proportionate early action to avoid mismanagement of social housing, financial and other affairs.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000111"></a>Amendment No. 111ZZA seeks marginally to change the definition of mismanagement in Clause 274. That definition includes at the moment breaches of standards, breaches of any requirement set out in Part 2, and improper or inappropriate behaviour. Mismanagement and misconduct are existing crimes for action by the Housing Corporation in the Housing Act 1996. The formulation in this Bill is designed to cover the same circumstances as in that Act, but the main difference is that we have included misconduct within the overall definition of mismanagement. That is why the words &#147;conducted improperly or inappropriately&#148; form part of the definition. Misconduct could, for example, include tolerating serious mismanagement of staff and not keeping proper financial records.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000112"></a>There is an important difference between conduct that is improper and that which is inappropriate. &#147;Improperly&#148; means conduct contrary to law, rule, convention or propriety in relation to the conduct of the business, while &#147;inappropriately&#148; means in a manner that, while not necessarily improper, is not appropriate having regard to all the circumstances. An example of this might be poor judgment of risk: making risky investments or failing to carry sufficient insurance. That is behaviour inappropriate to the task in hand&#151;what has to be done in order to safeguard the situation. We need the definition because such actions would not be covered by &#147;improperly&#148;. I agree that &#147;inappropriately&#148; is a fairly general term, but it does have an interpretation. I hope, therefore, that it is proper and appropriate to include both of these expressions.</p>

<p><a name="080618142000125"></a><a name="80618-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80618-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080618142000477"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Clause 219 is part of the group of clauses which relates to the use of enforcement notices. It requires the regulator to give the registered provider a pre-enforcement warning before issuing an enforcement notice. I propose to remove this clause and Clause 220, which deals with provider representations, on the grounds that the requirements are excessively bureaucratic. I am sure that the Committee will warm to that. The regulator should not have to issue a notice warning a provider that it is about to issue a notice. A number of minor consequential amendments remove references to Clauses 219 and 220 from other clauses.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000126"></a>I do not propose to do this with any other enforcement power. It is absolutely necessary that the regulator is required to issue a warning notice and to allow 28 days for representations when it considers the use of a penalty notice or compensation award. Several stakeholders have expressed concern that that is too bureaucratic, but the enforcement notice is a different matter. It does not carry a penalty for its breach. Without a pre-enforcement warning and a period for representations, the enforcement notice will be a useful way of dealing with genuinely urgent cases. I do not wish the regulator to be forced to go through an unnecessarily lengthy process.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000127"></a>The eight amendments in the group are consequential. They remove the requirement that the regulator, before issuing an enforcement notice, issues a warning notice. They allow 28 days for the provider to make representations.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000146"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment brings us to the provisions for compensation and seeks to add a category of persons to whom an award can be made. Clause 237(1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618142000349"></a>&#147;Compensation in respect of a failure may be awarded to one or more persons who have suffered as a result of the failure&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080618142000306"></a>The amendment is the result of a matter that was brought to my attention by the Housing Law Practitioners Association, which does what its title suggests and practises housing law. Other amendments, to which we will come on Monday, also arise out of its practice and experience.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000147"></a>The amendment is designed to allow the regulator to award compensation to anyone who has applied to a registered provider but has been treated unfairly by the provider. The circumstances under which a provider may be required to pay compensation include cases where the provider fails to meet a standard. The one which is most relevant here is the criteria for allocating tenancies. The clause as drafted benefits existing tenants and occupiers and does not extend the possibility of compensation to someone who has applied for housing. I foresee problems with regard to actions taken by tenants as a group; on the other hand, someone who has not been allocated may have suffered as a result of a failure. Existing tenants and occupiers should not have any problem with an extension.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000148"></a>Those who might be affected by such a failure are people on the provider&#146;s waiting list or on the housing register. If the Minister will not accept the amendment, can she explain why someone who has suffered a loss or hardship in such circumstances should not be included in this category? If this is not the way to deal with the issue, is there another way of extending compensation to those who have suffered? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000150"></a>The amendment specifies that the regulator can give compensation not only to current tenants of social housing but to applicants who have applied for housing. The noble Baroness knows from her long  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC425"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC425</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>experience how complex the allocation system is. Local authority allocations are governed by Part VI of the Housing Act 1996 and registered social landlords&#146; allocations are subject to Housing Corporation regulatory guidance, which can cover how they allocate their own stock and how they co-operate with local authorities. It is usual for RSLs to accept 50 per cent or more local authority nominations on the empty units in their own stock. Most allocations are, therefore, for the local authority. That process falls under the statutory homelessness duties, which are always for the local authority. So we already have a complex, interrelated system.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000151"></a>Under the Bill, compensation can be given only where there is a breach of standards or a breach of a voluntary undertaking by a provider to resolve a breach of standards in its own way. Standards in the list at Clause 191 can be set on the allocation of social homes by providers. Therefore, it is perfectly possible for the regulator to set and enforce standards on allocations, including in areas such as how the provider should co-operate with the local authority. Given that that is possible, it may address some of the underlying problems that the noble Baroness has raised in the amendment.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000152"></a>When setting and enforcing standards under Clause 191(3), the regulator must consider the desirability of the provider being free to run his own business, which echoes a recurring theme in our debates in Committee. It will need to be careful that its standards do not prohibit charities making arrangements to house specific groups in order to meet their objects. That is one reason why the regulator must consult the Charities Commission because we would not want to inhibit that. However, when setting allocation standards, the regulator also needs to consider objective 2 to ensure that actual or potential tenants have an appropriate degree of choice and protection, and so the potential tenant is brought into the frame. I agree that it is the role of the regulator to be able to address general or systemic allocation problems but I do not think that a compensation power is the best way to deal with them. Better results will be achieved through enforcement notices, penalties or, frankly, by changing a manager.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000153"></a>I am concerned that the regulator might spend valuable time judging individual cases for compensating people who feel that they should have been, but have not been, offered a home. The notion of the potential applicant is also very wide. There are so many potential applicants for social housing that we run the risk of imposing a major burden on the regulator of having to judge individual cases, and the existence of the power would in itself generate pressure to award compensation to potential tenants who had lost out. I can see that resolving individual cases could become a heavy burden.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000154"></a>I have other practical concerns. As I said, responsibility will normally lie with the local housing authority, not the housing association or other provider. The regulator is not responsible for regulating the allocation functions of local authorities. Indeed, it seems rather unfair on housing associations and other providers if the only potential tenants who can get compensation are those who are rejected by an association. That brings us back to the level playing field argument.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC426"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC426</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000155"></a>I am also, quite reasonably, concerned about public resources. What should a potential tenant who has been denied a home for an indefinite period be paid? It is not as easy as working out the compensation due, for example, for a leaky roof. We could get into an extremely expensive frame of reference because social housing is such a valuable prize that the sums might be so large that the regulator would often not be able to make awards, because under Clause 240 by doing so he would jeopardise the viability of the provider or prevent it providing services to its existing tenants.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000156"></a>I think that the noble Baroness will accept that these are issues that the regulator can and should deal with where a registered provider is at fault, but through means other than compensation awards. However, she has identified a complex situation and so, in order to make clear to noble Lords how the allocation system works at present, I should like to write and explain the background to the sort of judgments that go into the making of allocations and the relationship between local authorities and providers. On that basis, there will be a better understanding of how complicated this challenge to the providers would be.</p>

At this juncture, I want to make a few points. The amendment refers not to an enormous number of potential tenants but to someone who has actually applied. It is not intended to be everyone who, if they thought about it, might have applied and been rejected. To answer a point that was not quite made, I understand the desirability of not having a system that allows someone to make a quick buck by applying where there is no hope of being allocated housing, but I should have thought that the fairly full provisions that come under the heading of compensation&#151;10 full clauses&#151;form an adequate safeguard for how individual claims, including claims of this sort, might be dealt with. I agree absolutely, of course, that enforcement generally is desirable, but it does not assist the individual.

<p><a name="080618142000172"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak to the amendments standing in my name in this group. They are intended to apply some gentle constraints on the powers of the regulator. The Bill already extends the regulator&#146;s powers beyond those that the Housing Corporation currently holds. An inquiry may be called by the regulator at the behest of the residents, if the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, supports that line, at the request of the local authority or on the regulator&#146;s own initiative. If mismanagement is uncovered by that inquiry, the regulator can direct that the management of the provider&#146;s homes be transferred to another manager, or he can directly appoint other managers or new staff&#151;in effect, he can take control.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000173"></a>This is pretty heavy-duty stuff. It would mean that most providers of social housing would be out of business because they would not be managing the homes that they had built or acquired. However, they would have to continue to pay the mortgages on those properties and they would have legal obligations in relation to the premises as the owners of those properties, although they would not be allowed to manage them. Therefore, this is a heavy-duty power and I support this extension to the powers that currently exist for a regulator to intervene in the affairs of providers of social housing. Indeed, I would go further and extend the powers to include profit-making providers who take grants and therefore should accept all the obligations towards tenants and the properties they manage that go with accepting government funds. I think that the noble Baroness agrees with the extension of a number of these provisions to profit-making bodies, and I look forward to hearing her comments in due course.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000174"></a>So far, so good. But the Bill spoils it all by overextending these powerful new measures. It goes further than giving the regulator the power to remove the management or to appoint new staff in cases where mismanagement is unearthed. The powers in the Bill can be applied if the registered provider has breached any one of the standards&#151;and a good many standards could be devised by the regulator&#151;that cover every conceivable aspect of the social landlord&#146;s affairs. Indeed, the powers can kick in if the regulator feels that a transfer,</p>
<ul><a name="080618142000435"></a>&#147;would be likely to improve the management of some or all of its social housing&#148;.</ul>

If we fail in some regard we need to be told to improve, we need to be reprimanded, and if appropriate, we need to be fined, as the Bill enables the regulator to do. We need to compensate our tenants if they have been treated poorly, as the Bill enables the regulator to insist on. I suggest, however, that it is going too far, if no mismanagement is proven as a result of an inquiry, for the regulator to have the power against any failure, not just mismanagement, to bring in new staff or transfer the property to another organisation.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000176"></a>Is the test of mismanagement too strong? Is it too high a hurdle? Would it be difficult for the regulator to prove mismanagement? We have already discussed the definition of the term. I repeat that mismanagement is,</p>
<ul><a name="080618142000436"></a>&#147;managed in contravention of a provision of this Part or of anything done under this Part, or ... otherwise conducted improperly or inappropriately&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618142000307"></a>It does not sound too high a hurdle to prove mismanagement, and if none is proved, I suggest that these draconian powers go too far. A moment ago the Minister gave us an example of something that was inappropriate: failure to have sufficient insurance, which is not perhaps the most heinous of crimes. It should be insisted that that is rectified quite quickly, but it should not trigger the collapse of the organisation and its takeover by new management.</p>

<p><a name="080618142000177"></a>This far and no further. It is our duty to be vigilant in looking at the role of the regulator and to draw some lines where we believe that powers are being extended an inch or two too far. This is one of those cases. I beg to move.</p>

Triggers are an important lever for the regulator when dealing with mismanagement. Most RSLs will accept that that is the case. We recognise the precedent laid out in the Housing Corporation zone rules, which are fairly strong. The amendment leaves in paragraph (b) but takes out (a) and (c), and thus meets the criteria by leaving them broad enough for negotiations to take place. Paragraph (b) allows for the inquiry to be undertaken or, as the noble Lord, Lord Best, has so eloquently argued, to allow for remedies to be put in place. To have triggers of this order of magnitude seems slightly disproportionate, which is why earlier we argued so strongly for the insertion of &#147;proportionate&#148; at the front of the objectives.</p>

The amendments raise issues of principle. I shall set out some technical explanations as to why we are taking this approach, but they are serious issues that affect a range of the regulator&#146;s most serious enforcement powers. I should stress that most of the existing powers are held by the Housing Corporation. The most important of these is the ability to transfer land, which in the past has been used most sparingly in cases where a provider is not viable in order to pass its assets, including social housing, to another provider before winding it up. The amendments would also affect the regulator&#146;s powers to restrict providers&#146; dealings and to suspend or remove the officers of a provider during or following an inquiry. They would also affect some new powers, such as those relating to the transfer of management, appointing managers and amalgamation. These are mainly new powers taken to meet Cave&#146;s recommendations that the regulator should intervene more flexibly and proactively in the interests of tenants. The amalgamation powers were added in another place following a proposal by colleagues of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, for a more flexible approach to the regulated transfer of land of industrial and provident societies.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0006.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000181"></a>The problem I have with the noble Lord&#146;s amendments is that I see them as making these powers rather more difficult to use. His argument is essentially that the regulator should not be able to use its more serious powers, such as those in relation to the transfer of land, on the basis of a trivial breach of standards; nor should it be able to transfer land on the basis that the transfer would be likely to improve the management of the land or that it would be likely to improve the management of some or all of its social housing. The noble Lord also queried how action could be taken on the basis of a breach of standards or improved management when an inquiry under Clause 203 can be held only where the regulator suspects that there has been mismanagement.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000182"></a>First, I need to reassure the noble Lord, just as my colleague in another place sought to reassure housing associations. The power relating to the transfer of land and the other powers here could never be used on the basis of a trivial breach of standards or simply because the regulator felt that it might be a good idea. We have just discussed Clause 215, which requires the regulator, when using enforcement powers such as these, to consider not only the desirability of providers being free to run their own businesses&#151;a very important protection&#151;but also the materiality of any breach. That means whether it is serious, whether it is recurrent and whether it is urgent. It applies not only to whether to intervene but to which power to use and how to use it. The regulator will have to have regard to the fundamental objectives, and objective 10 requires it to minimise interference and be proportionate. There will be a materiality test and a proportionality test to satisfy before the regulator can use these serious enforcement powers. Furthermore, the regulator would have to issue, consult on and have regard to guidance on the use of its enforcement powers. It is simply not possible to use a power as extreme as that relating to the transfer of land on the basis of anything less than the most serious of breaches.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000183"></a>I want specifically to address the point that the regulator should not be able to use a transfer of land power or appoint new management simply on the grounds that the land or management would be improved by the change. Perhaps I may explain why it is necessary that this should remain. Again, this is not a new ground for action; it is part of the current system under the Housing Act 1996. If we removed it, it would make the transfer of land power and other powers much harder to use than at present. Perhaps we would consider removing it if the powers were currently too easy to use or were being abused. However, the reality is that in practice it is very hard to use transfer of land powers. For example, the regulator would be depriving the provider of its property and the Human Rights Act would be engaged. This simply would not permit these powers to be used on non-serious grounds, and I believe that it would be extremely unwise to limit them beyond the overarching safeguards in the Bill. It would undermine the regulator&#146;s power to act in extreme cases and increase the risk of insolvency.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000184"></a>As I have said, the Housing Corporation rarely uses transfer of land and uses it only where all else fails. In fact, in a recent case it spent several years working with an association to improve its capacity and encourage a voluntary solution, but to no avail. This is a last resort, partly because I hardly have to say that the individual cases are time-consuming, extremely expensive and highly contentious, and there must be a watertight case before there is any legal challenge. The Secretary of State must give approval, and that is not given lightly, and it needs to find a stable organisation to transfer to, one that will accept the liabilities which transfer along with the land.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000185"></a>The Housing Corporation and, in future, the regulator, do not act only on the basis of mismanagement, rightly in my view. Mismanagement is retrospective, but what is important here is that the regulator must also be concerned with the future management of homes and the best interests of tenants and the public. In all of the last four transfer of land cases considered by the corporation&#146;s board, it concluded that transfer was justified on both of the acceptable grounds for action: that mismanagement had taken place and that the management of the land would be improved if it were transferred.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000186"></a>The noble Lord made the point that an inquiry may be held only when the regulator suspects that the affairs of a provider may have been mismanaged, so why should action be taken on any other basis? Let me be clear that the test for starting an inquiry is retrospective, but that does not mean that the aims of the inquiry set by the regulator or its findings are restricted to whether there has been mismanagement. Other concerns may be uncovered during the inquiry that the regulator needs to take into account when deciding what action to take. It is possible that it might even conclude that there had been no mismanagement in relation to the matters under investigation, but nevertheless it needs to act. Each case must be decided on its individual characteristics.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000187"></a>The status quo works. It gives the regulator flexibility within the overall framework of checks and balances, and it is fair. Housing associations have strong protections  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC431"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC431</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>both in the Bill and in the courts. An arbitrary reduction in this power might be justified if there had been any unfair or arbitrary exercise of those powers or if they were unconstrained, but there have not been. Transfers so far have shown benefits for tenants and public money. Restricting this power so heavily may instead result in a severe and substantial prejudice which would only be to the advantage of the worst providers, those playing a long game and seeking to wear down the regulator in terms of time and cost.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000188"></a>I hope that I have convinced noble Lords that it would not be advisable to alter or restrict in the way proposed the grounds on which the regulator&#146;s most serious powers may be used, and I hope that putting this explanation on the record will allay the concerns that have been expressed.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000189"></a>However, the amendments are not limited to that because they would also apply many powers that currently are used only for non-profit providers to profit makers. I shall come on to the issue of how to apply the transfer of land powers to profit makers in a moment. We have laid amendments to do this in respect of their social housing, because that is vital. We have already amended the Bill so that in the main it treats non-profit and profit-making registered providers in the same way, but there is no point in applying powers to profit makers in exactly the same way when they cannot apply or are inappropriate. What matters to tenants is that they have similar outcomes, even if the process is slightly different. We should not take unnecessary and disproportionate powers over any private sector provider. For example, there is no point in applying the powers on amalgamation to profit makers. This power applies only to industrial and provident societies and it is extremely unlikely that profit makers will have that organisational structure, and in any case it is simply not possible to merge only a profit-making provider&#146;s social housing because all the provider&#146;s assets would be bound to form part of a merged body. It would not be appropriate for the regulator to measure assets that are not connected to social housing.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000190"></a>I am also reluctant to extend the powers in Clauses 255 to 260 to profit makers. Clauses 255 to 257 prevent an association making poor financial decisions such as selling assets without the regulator&#146;s consent during or immediately after an inquiry. As I have said before, we can restrict the disposal of social housing by a profit maker because consent can be refused. I think it would be excessive to go further and enable the regulator to usurp shareholders&#146; powers by suspending or sacking a profit maker&#146;s directors, especially as social housing is likely to form a small proportion of their business.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000191"></a>We have tried to come to a fair and sensible position in relation to the grounds on which the most serious powers can be used and how they apply to profit makers. I think we have the balance right between protecting tenants and assets and being too intrusive. I have had to go into great detail, but I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080618142000194"></a>I turn to the substantive point incorporated in many of my amendments. The Minister addressed fully the transfer of land, to which Clause 252 relates. I have always known that the Secretary of State&#146;s consent is required under Clause 253(4) before a transfer of land can be imposed, so that is not the most serious of the ways in which the regulator&#146;s powers are being extended beyond cases where mismanagement is proved. I was concentrating more on Clause 248, on management transfer, and Clause 250, which gives powers to appoint the management and staff of the organisation. I was less than entirely satisfied by the Minister&#146;s response on those points. It is likely that that I will return to the matter later.

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000212"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall move a group of amendments, starting with this amendment, which extend the regulated transfers of social homes to include all homes owned by a registered provider. Previously, this power was used only for non-profit-making housing associations. These amendments permit it to be used for profit-making organisations. The power to order a transfer is an existing power of the Housing Corporation, which is rarely used and is a last resort when an association has no viable future and has failed to find a workable solution on its own. The Bill provides that the exercise of a power must be preceded by an inquiry, only if the regulator is satisfied that there has been mismanagement, a breach of standards or if the transfer would improve management of the land.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000213"></a>As with other enforcement powers under Clause 215, the regulator must consider the materiality of any breach and the desirability of providers to manage their own affairs. The Secretary of State&#146;s approval is needed. The decision of the regulator and the Secretary of State could be judicially reviewed. After consideration, we decided that applying this power to profit-making bodies was necessary to ensure that the social homes that they owned were completely secure. This power is not needed when a profit-making provider becomes insolvent, because the insolvency powers in the Bill can be used to secure the homes. However, we decided that the power was necessary if there was a serious risk that the profit-making provider would become insolvent or was running the homes so poorly that there was no other recourse than for the regulator to be able to take them away.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000214"></a>Most of the amendments simply remove &#147;non-profit&#148; and apply Clauses 252 and 253 to profit-makers. The key amendment is Amendment No. 110AM. It specifies, first, that only social housing and associated land held by a profit-making provider can be transferred, whereas all of a non-profit-making provider&#146;s assets and liabilities can be transferred. Secondly, the amendment states that land cannot be transferred from a non-profit to a profit-making provider, although the reverse is possible.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000215"></a>I shall explain why we arrived at that position, which superficially may not seem fair. After all, if the regulator can transfer non-social housing assets owned by a non-profit-making provider, why not allow the same for a profit-maker? Why not level the playing field?</p>
<h5><a name="080618142000443"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80618-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000216"></a>The reason is that there are several principles in play; it is not only a matter of having a level playing field. It is important to recognise that the Housing Corporation does not use the transfer of land power as a punishment but to preserve assets that have received some public funding and which are used for the benefit of social tenants and the community. Most housing associations own assets that may at some point in the past have been partly publicly funded but are not strictly social housing, so it is right that the regulator should be able to save these. By contrast, the profit-making sector has no historical legacy of social housing assets. The regulator has no interest in seeking  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC434"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC434</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to transfer its market homes or other assets to a registered provider. In fact, it would be unnecessary and inappropriate to seek such powers. With housing associations, the regulator has a general duty of care; with the profit-making sector, its main care is to ensure that social homes are not lost.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000264"></a>The noble Lord said: Home information packs were introduced under the Government&#146;s Housing Act 2004 and came into operation last autumn. The Government had run pilot schemes, but they were somewhat reluctant to publish the results. We finally got those results published in March this year. The main findings of that research, undertaken by Ipsos MORI, on the area trials was not very encouraging on the effect of the information packs. After sales, eight out of 10 sellers did not think that the HIP had helped to sell the property; more than 70 per cent of sellers did not think that HIPs made the selling process more efficient; 55 per cent of buyers did not think that the HIP had speeded up the homebuying process; and one-third of the sellers said that it was taking too long&#151;more than three weeks&#151;to get their home information pack. That is hardly an enviable record and I suspect that if that information had been published before the information packs were introduced, there might have been considerably more hesitation about the introduction.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000265"></a>Following the introduction of HIPs, the National Association of Estate Agents conducted a survey of its members in August 2007 to see what was happening. Interestingly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of four-bedroom properties, which was the first category of home to be affected, on the market was dramatically reduced: 63 per cent of agents reported decreases in the number of larger properties on the books. That was greater than the normal reduction at that time of year. On average, agents reported drops of 37 per cent. Homeowners staying out of the market to avoid home information packs was cited as the main reason for the decrease.That survey revealed that the average price being paid for a home information pack was around the &#163;350 mark. Although the information in the pack  


<notus-date day="18" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC437"></a><b>18 Jun 2008 : Column GC437</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is somewhat circumscribed compared to what was originally intended, the cost has not dropped commensurately.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000266"></a>The killer blow has occurred with the report published only a couple of days ago by Sir Bryan Carsberg who, in July last year, was commissioned by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, the National Association of Estate Agents and the Association of Residential Letting Agents to carry out a review of the residential property sector. His specific comments on the home information pack were that it has been watered down and now appears to consist of very little information, yet there has been no commensurate reduction in the price of the document. He concluded that the usefulness of the pack is demonstrated by the fact that few buyers have shown any interest in it, and a substantial number of conveyancers ignore its existence and recommission searches on reading instructions from their buying clients. That suggests that the home information pack is not fulfilling the role for which it was intended.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000267"></a>In Sir Bryan&#146;s opinion, the cost of the home information pack seems to be greater than its benefit. He summarised the position by saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="080618142000437"></a>&#147;the HIP provides the worst of all worlds&#151;it omits much of the most useful information but still imposes significant costs on the property transaction&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080618142000308"></a>He raised a more fundamental objection, saying that consumer well-being, in matters like property transactions, is best secured by operation of the market. The imposition of constraints by central decision makers is not likely to serve consumers while because it cannot take account of consumers&#146; wishes in the way that the market does. The market is better at producing customer satisfaction than legislation can be.</p>
<h5><a name="080618142000444"></a>7.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000268"></a>His recommendation was that the Government should amend legislation and make home information packs voluntary. That would be the end of home information packs and a clean kill is perhaps better than a slow death by starvation. The Bill gives us an opportunity to make a clean kill. We recognise that we will have to keep the energy performance certificate, which has a useful function. Given that the ultimate requirement is that all homes will require an energy performance certificate, tying it to the home information pack is the slowest possible way of getting it round the housing circuit. Moving home is expensive and stressful&#151;I am in the process of doing so and I declare an interest&#151;but this particular red tape makes it worse, not better; it increases costs without producing a commensurate benefit.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000269"></a>We would not wish to prevent home sellers from paying for a home condition report if they genuinely believe it would help, but that should be a matter for them and not for legislation and compulsion. That is the gist of what Sir Bryan Carsberg has been saying. The present regime is unwanted by most people and is unproductive in the market. This is an appropriate time to say goodbye to it. I beg to move.</p>

I declare an interest as a consultant to an estate agency in London, an interest I have declared on many occasions.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000271"></a>My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith referred to the Sir Bryan Carsberg report which has recently been published. It confirms what many of us said when the legislation was being rammed through Parliament against better judgment. The result of the HIP legislation has been to delay property coming on to the market in some parts of the country; there is absolutely no doubt about that. I agree that that has not happened as much in central London, but in less expensive areas of the country, where people do not have the same capital value in the house and, in many cases, have less income, the extra cost of a HIP obviously defers property from coming onto the market. That in turn restricts the free flow and operation of the market. I said at the time of the housing boom that that was going to happen.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000272"></a>In times of boom one does not think that things can go bad, but we have seen housing declines in the past and we are facing another one at the moment. Any extra expense such as this will delay property coming on to the market because many people are not prepared to pay for the cost of the home information pack. The Minister may reply that many agents are absorbing the cost&#151;which is true in some parts of the country&#151;but the corollary is that they are not negotiating on fees. So what the vendor might win on the swings, he is losing on the roundabouts.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000273"></a>There is clear evidence from all the investigations I have done, and from talking to the various purchasers and vendors that we deal with, that the home information pack is not providing any useful service to either the vendor or the purchaser. There is evidence that it is delaying the whole property procedure, as my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith said, and it is not actually reducing the costs.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000274"></a>Let us take the question of searches. I remember the Minister trumpeting how nice it was that we were going to get searches up front. A lot of us agents had been doing that before, because it seemed to be a sensible way to market property. In a declining and difficult market, however, property can stay on the books for a long time. Let us say that you are a solicitor acting for a purchaser. If the search is more than three months old, you will require the purchaser to get their own new search. The purchaser&#146;s solicitor has a liability and a duty of care towards the lender, and no bank or building society is going to lend unless the searches are more recent than three months. So the great idea that it will be a wonderful thing to get searches up front is not proving at all effective because more and more, as the housing market becomes more difficult, the purchasers are having to fund their own searches, just as they always did in the past.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000275"></a>If I were to summarise the reaction from all the vendors and purchasers, it would be, &#147;This is just another government tax on property. It&#146;s one of the things we have to put up with, but it&#146;s really not helping the procedure at all&#148;.</p>

What I will say is very simple. There can be no doubt that the current home-buying and selling process needed to change. I think we would all agree on that.

<p><a name="080618142000278"></a>I hear what the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, says about the way they are affecting the market. We have commissioned substantial research on this, and we have no such evidence. Given what else is happening in the housing market in terms of ability to borrow and buy, I would be very surprised if HIPs made any difference, but I will send the noble Earl the current research we have.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000279"></a>To maintain confidence among all those involved and to make the benefits of HIPs evident and useful, we should ensure that we build on what is working. That is what we intend to do, and we are doing it with the industry. We have a much closer and better relationship with stakeholders, and we are working with consumers. We are doing our best to make a real benefit of this. We recognise from the area trials and our early operations that more needs to be done to facilitate and support the take-up, and we are working with the industry to ensure that consumers can benefit fully from HIPs.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000280"></a>We are reflecting on the recommendations in the Carsberg report, but in the mean time we will continue to work with the industry to improve information for the consumer in this process. Given where we are with the energy companies, we are also making the most of EPCs. The committee will know that we are phasing in EPCs across all sectors of buildings. All homes marketed for sale in England and Wales since December 2007 have required an EPC to be available to prospective buyers.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000281"></a>HIPs are an important issue that we have addressed many times in this House. Frankly, however, I cannot add a great deal to what I have just said. I hope the Committee will understand that I listen to noble Lords, and I appreciate the opportunity once again to update the Committee on where we are.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618142000387"></a> Clause 280, page 117, line 8, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080618142000388"></a>&#147;( ) The regulations must make provision for a competitive process for the selection of an accreditation scheme or schemes.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000287"></a>The noble Earl said: We move on to Part 3 proper of the Bill and the subject of certificates for new homes. The mandatory rating of homes against the code for sustainable homes is already being introduced via secondary legislation relating to the home information packs, which we have just discussed and which, sadly, will continue for a bit longer. Although homes have to be rated, they do not have to be assessed. Where an assessment does not occur, the new home receives a zero rating. The Bill allows for a more comprehensive legislative framework for these arrangements. It also allows for the code to be extended to existing properties and non-residential properties.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000288"></a>Under the current arrangements for accreditation schemes, the Building Research Establishment trust, a non-governmental body, is given the sole right to sub-license accreditation schemes for assessors of homes against the code. It is granted a licence to provide accreditation of code assessors itself. In effect, therefore, the BRE has a monopolistic position in regard to the accreditation of code assessors. This resulted from the arrangements made by the Department for Communities and Local Government to utilise the intellectual property of the BRE within the technical requirements of the code.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000289"></a>My amendment would remove any potential for the furthering of the monopolistic position of a single body, the BRE, in regard to the accreditation of assessors for the code for sustainable homes. However, since tabling the amendment, I have had a very nice letter from the Minister saying that she understands the point that I made, and for that I am extremely grateful. However, perhaps I may ask her the following questions. How long is the current arrangement with the BRE? Are the Government going to publish the contract with the BRE? What further safeguards are there that this will not become a monopolistic position in the future? Finally, what is the current level of fees that the BRE charges? There has been considerable complaint about the level of fees because the BRE is in this very strong position. Indeed, an article in <I>Building</I> magazine, which I am sure the Minister has read, referred to this very problem. I am sure that it has been on her desk and that she has read it with great interest.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000290"></a>There is one point in the Minister&#146;s letter that I must raise because she needs to kick her department very hard. On the last amendment, she said that she has a better relationship with the stakeholders, yet in her letter she refers to the &#147;Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors&#148;. I belong to an institution, not an institute. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080618142000291"></a><a name="80618-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80618-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080618142000504"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> Obviously we welcome the competitive sentiment behind the noble Earl&#146;s amendment, but ultimately we disagree and part company with him in what it seeks to achieve.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000292"></a>For the benefit of noble Lords who are not familiar with the area, I ought to begin by explaining what an accreditation scheme is. It provides for assessor certification by the training and licensing of people who will carry out assessments. We currently have schemes in place through contractual arrangements but in due course we will replace them with schemes set up under the powers conferred by the Bill. We are committed to ensuring that there are transparent and open processes for the selection of any accreditation scheme or schemes and for the establishment of a competitive market for accreditation schemes and assessor services. However, as I am sure the noble Earl will agree, it would be highly unusual to have this level of detail set out in primary legislation. It could fetter the Secretary of State in acting in the best interests of the public.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000293"></a>More pragmatically, we are also considering a number of different models for setting up accreditation schemes and may want to adopt the approach used in energy assessor schemes for issuing energy performance certificates. The approach adopted in this instance does not limit the number of such schemes and therefore there is no competition between organisations to set up accreditation schemes. Such competition as there is will be in the marketplace for accreditation services, to the ultimate benefit of the consumer. Accordingly, we believe that the amendment, well intentioned as it is, would not have the desired effect of ensuring that the Secretary of State&#146;s discretion is exercised in the public interest. Moreover, it would be undesirable to stipulate how the Secretary of State is to exercise discretion in this matter. I can assure the Committee that the principles of transparency and openness, and the harnessing of competition for the public good will remain the basis for any selection process when it is taken forward. As a result, the amendment is not the right way to proceed. Having accepted our commitment to introducing transparent and open selection processes, and to promoting competition, I hope the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="80618-gc0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080618142000294"></a>He asked for some precise information. With regard to the publication of the contract, it is in the public domain and I shall send him a copy. The contract expires in 2013. I apologise for getting the institution name wrong but these things do happen, as I am sure they did when the noble Earl was in government. As to the value of the contract, I am more than happy to write to the noble Earl about that.</p>

He seems to agree that it is in the interests of the environment, home buyers and the housing industry that there should be competition for both the provision of assessors and their accreditation. It is a pity that we have to wait five years but it is perhaps better to continue with the Bill than to upset the process in the mean time because the Government seem to have their heart in the right place on this issue. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08061896000012"></a>Today I am publishing a revised draft version of the charter for the bereaved for comment. The charter describes the services bereaved people can expect to receive from a reformed coroner system, and sets out the rights of redress if services are not delivered. It additionally explains appeal rights against particular decisions taken by coroners in individual cases. The charter makes it clear that the needs of bereaved people will be at the centre of the reformed system.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08061896000013"></a>Public consultation on the charter was previously undertaken in 2006 when it was published alongside the draft Coroners Bill. There were further informal consultations with those who work within the current system, and several voluntary sector groups which interact with it, during 2007. Changes were made as a result and are reflected in this new draft, together with the changes made as a result of consultation on the Bill, which I announced in March. I am publishing the charter now to provide a further opportunity for comments in advance of the planned introduction of a coroners and death certification Bill in the next session of Parliament. As with the draft Bill, it is my intention to publish an updated version when the Bill proper is introduced.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08061896000021"></a>A meeting of the Education, Youth and Culture Council was held on 21 and 22 May. The Welsh Assembly Government Minister for Heritage, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, represented the UK for the cultural and audiovisual agenda items taken on 21 May.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08061896000023"></a>The council adopted the conclusions on media literacy, noting the forthcoming Commission study to develop indicators in this area.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08061896000024"></a>A general approach was reached on the programme protecting children using the internet, a five-year funding programme with a &#8364;55 million budget aimed at tackling illegal and harmful internet content.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08061896000025"></a>The council also discussed creative content online in advance of a Commission recommendation of the Parliament and the council in the autumn. A number of member states shared the UK view that new business models should be allowed to develop naturally through the market, and that new EU legislation risked stifling innovation. However, there was broad support for EU action to address piracy and illegal downloads. A number of smaller member states were keen to prevent the loss of cultural diversity which they felt resulted from monopoly distributors. Member states also welcomed the Commission&#146;s new content online platform: a forum for further discussion.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08061896000026"></a>The presidency updated the council on telecoms networks and services. They had produced a compromise proposal but some difficult issues remained, including on spectrum trading.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08061896000029"></a>The Belgian delegation raised anti-Semitic broadcasting originating outside the EU and therefore not covered by EU legislation.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08061896000032"></a>Council conclusions on the 3rd work plan for culture 2008-10 were also agreed by the council. This followed on from discussion at the November 2007 Culture Council that established the priorities for 2008-10. The presidency reported back on the establishment of an open method of co-ordination for culture and proposed a timetable for future work. This was unanimously agreed: only Cyprus and Greece called for greater emphasis on the return of stolen goods.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08061896000036"></a>The Telecommunications Council took place on the 12 June 2008 under the chair of the Slovenian presidency where I represented the United Kingdom. As expected, the Commission review of the electronic telecommunications framework was the main focus and the discussion was based around three questions, set by the presidency, on next generation networks (NGN), institutional arrangements and spectrum.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08061896000037"></a>After an introduction from Commissioner Reding, there was a full exchange of views on the review with nearly all member states participating. There was a general acceptance on a need to embrace market mechanisms on spectrum, and also that functional separation is a useful remedy of last resort to encourage competition. There were, however, some negative views being expressed about Commission powers and the need for a single European Electronic Communications Market Authority. On next generation networks there was general support for a predictable regulatory framework; that would encourage investments by operators.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08061896000038"></a>I intervened to support the Commissioner's aim of reaching early agreement on the review among member states and with the European Parliament. I noted the importance of NGN, and stressed the importance of competition in ensuring successful introduction. I emphasised that the UK did not support regulatory holidays to promote the introduction of new services, and that there was clear evidence of the success of functional separation in the UK. I supported the Commission having new powers of last resort to veto decisions made by national regulators where these have not followed best practice. On spectrum I said that we do not want enforced harmonisation and that a market-led approach is the best way to ensure both that spectrum is used and also to encourage the development of innovative services.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08061896000039"></a>Council conclusions on the digital dividend were adopted with very little discussion. These conclusions were endorsed by Commissioner Reding who believes that there is a win-win situation for both broadcasters and for new players providing innovative products.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08061896000040"></a>Over lunch, I and other Ministers in attendance discussed the proposed European Electronic Communications Market Authority. The majority supported either an enhanced European regulators'

I supported the enhanced ERG provided it was an independent advisory body as part of the revised legal framework with a scope limited to giving economic market advice to the Commission. The consensus was for a simple body that would be accountable to stakeholders. It would not be involved with information security or spectrum matters, but rather concentrate of advising on matters of economic regulation.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08061896000041"></a>The council conclusions on i2010 were adopted with very little discussion. Commissioner Reding spoke of the need to raise the targets for broadband deployment across member states and to utilise public/private partnerships to this aim.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08061896000042"></a>The general approach for a proposal for extending the mandate of ENISA was introduced and the importance of this was stressed. The Commission is supportive of a three-year extension, and this was approved with very little discussion.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08061896000043"></a>The Commission provided information on its communication regarding advancing the internet action plan for the deployment of internet protocol version 6. It was claimed that the existing pool of internet addresses would run out in three years unless this upgrade took place. Member states, stakeholders and content providers were called upon to act. There is a target for 25 per cent of users to be IPv6 by 2010.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08061896000044"></a>Portugal produced a paper on broadband indicators stating the importance of mobile technologies when compiling statistics for broadband availability. Commissioner Reding was supportive, and said that her proposals took this into account.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08061896000045"></a>The presidency gave an update on the procedure for the selection of mobile satellite services (MSS) operators. Some states are unhappy with the proposed procedure as it could result in 50 per cent of the EU not being provided with coverage. The proposed MSS decision will, however, be agreed at a council in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08061896000046"></a>The final item was a request by the Netherlands for SMS roaming prices to be reduced at the earliest opportunity. There was no substantive discussion on this item.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="08061896000051"></a><a name="80618-wms0001.htm_spmin10"></a><b><a name="80618-wms0001.htm_spmin11"></a><a name="08061896000067"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> On 18 June, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Legal Services Commission (LSC) published a consultation document containing proposals for changes to the family graduated fees scheme (FGFS), which governs payments to barristers for family legal aid work. This is a full consultation which will run for 12 weeks, until 10 September 2008.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08061896000052"></a>Currently, there is a significant difference between the rates for advocacy paid to solicitors and those paid to barristers under the FGFS. The Government seek to ensure value for money in the legal services they purchase by moving to a system where the same fee is paid for the same service to the client, regardless of the type of advocate who delivers it. To that end, the LSC had planned to introduce a single harmonised family advocacy scheme for solicitors and barristers in April 2008. However, the implementation of the new scheme has been deferred until April 2010, as a condition of the agreement between the MoJ, the LSC and the Law Society, following judgment on the unified contract dispute. The LSC will instead be conducting a consultation from September 2008 on proposals for family advocacy payments to both solicitors and barristers from April 2010. These proposals are likely to suggest the restructuring or removal of the FGFS, and removal of some or all of the differentials in payments between solicitors and barristers conducting family advocacy.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08061896000053"></a>In the interim, the proposals set out in today&#146;s consultation paper will pave the way for the April 2010 changes by narrowing the gap between payments to barristers and solicitors. The Government consider that if reductions are in fact made to the family graduated fees scheme following this consultation, barristers will still continue to be remunerated fairly.</p>

The consultation proposals set out different options for reducing FGFS expenditure in order to live within budget, while ensuring the provision of services by sufficient numbers of competent advocates. Controlling family advocacy costs is essential so that services to people needing help with civil and family problems are not threatened.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08061896000057"></a>The Legal Services Act 2007 establishes a new regime for handling complaints about the provision of legal services with the creation of the Legal Services Board (LSB) and the Office for Legal Complaints (OLC).  The LSB will be an overarching regulator and the OLC will deal with all complaints about regulated legal service providers.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08061896000058"></a>The OLC will be a new organisation that is completely independent of the legal profession.  Therefore, once the OLC becomes fully operational, the professional bodies&#146; own arrangements for handling complaints will cease and the government bodies with oversight of these&#151;the Office of the Legal Services Ombudsman (OLSO) and the Office of the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner (OLSCC)&#151;will no longer be required.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08061896000059"></a>Based on current planning assumptions, the LSB will become fully operational in early 2010 and the OLC will become fully operational in late 2010. Therefore, in line with the current timetable the OLSCC will close in March 2010 and the OLSO will close no earlier than December 2010.</p>

<a name="80618-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08061896000060"></a>Both offices have provided a very valuable service to consumers and I am sure they will continue to do so until the new arrangements become operational.</p>

The UK was a driving force behind the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325, which placed these issues firmly on the UN's agenda.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a><a name="080618120000100"></a>We promote the implementation of UNSCR 1325 throughout Sudan. In 2007, the UK contributed 60 per cent (US$590,701) of the total budget of the UN Common Humanitarian Fund, which includes support for civil society projects to prevent gender-based violence and to promote women's leadership in society.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a><a name="080618120000101"></a>Through the Department for International Development's governance programme, we provide training for the police, judiciary and prison officers  to enable them to tackle gender-based violence  more effectively and support local non-governmental organisations to run workshops and media campaigns on HIV/AIDS, reproductive health and gender-based violence. Our embassy in Khartoum has supported conflict mitigation and peacebuilding initiatives which have encouraged women to lead on reconciliation efforts.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_26"></a><a name="080618120000102"></a>In the UN, the UK supported the inclusion of language on UNSCR 1325 in Security Council resolutions relating to the UN peacekeeping missions in Sudan. For example, the following language was included in the most recent mandate for the UN mission in Sudan:</p>
<ul><a name="080618120000115"></a>&#147;emphasising in particular the role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding, as recognised in resolution 1325&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_27"></a><a name="080618120000103"></a>The UK also supports the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations' work to incorporate gender issues into all peacekeeping missions. Additionally, we raise gender-related issues through the EU-Sudan Dialogue on Human Rights.</p>

This work will include: what the criteria for the award should be, how far it should go back and who will receive it. An implementation team is now working on these details and will include consideration of the points raised in their deliberations.
