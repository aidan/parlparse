The Government are determined to tackle this. Patient safety should be at the heart of everything the NHS does. The Care Quality Commission will be conducting unannounced inspections of NHS trusts. We are also seeking to strengthen accountability in the NHS and ensure that patients and their families have a stronger voice.</p>

<p><a name="st_29"></a>

Is she aware that, over the past five or six years, I have raised in this House scores of cases of patients receiving appalling treatment in our hospitals? Although every case was properly authenticated, no hospital ever took action, no wrong-doings ever stopped, no culpability was ever admitted and no apology was ever made. Will she ensure that cases raised in this House by your Lordships will be acted upon without waiting years and years for an ombudsman's report to arrive?</p>

Many of these patients have been very vulnerable and often voiceless. The first thing we have to do, therefore, is to ensure that the systems that are in place are working properly. The first duty falls to the individual NHS organisation to investigate such an incident and take action. It is for the Care Quality Commission to intervene where there are serious concerns, but the ombudsman, in her recent report, makes it very clear that we all have a responsibility here, and it must be our responsibility to make sure that patients are treated with care and compassion at every level of the service.</p>

The Minister said that the Care Quality Commission is making unannounced visits to hospitals. My own hospital had two visits-one to Chase Farm and one to Barnet-just last week. Fortunately, they each received a very good report. That is the only way to ensure that there are no opportunities to hide away any maltreatment that may be going on.</p>

She is indeed quite right that unannounced inspections should surely help, though if you read the ombudsman's reports, what is so striking is the lack of empathy for patients. Clearly, a culture change is required among those who are meting out poor care where that is the case. There is much very good care, but there is clearly a lot of poor care, and we must do everything we can at every level to try to change that.</p>

How many elderly and disabled people are languishing in hospital beds because there is no alternative-an alternative either in good residential care with or without nursing or in their own homes with a care package? I understand from a report I heard recently that there are hundreds of old people who could be moved on. It is when they languish in those beds that this kind of poor care develops, and I, like the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, have anecdotally heard of people who say, "Just don't get old these days".</p>

It is clearly in everyone's interests, especially in this House, to make sure that older people are treated with care and consideration. One thing that comes through from the ombudsman's report is that this does not apply simply to people who are stuck in hospital, although that is greatly to be regretted and we want to ensure that that does not happen. People in the hospital setting for routine care also are not treated very well. We have to ensure that for whatever reason a person is in hospital they are treated with care and compassion.</p>

However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, said, this sort of maltreatment has been going on for many years in the NHS. Is not fundamental change needed in terms of quality, standards, culture, complaints, inspection and reporting? Can the Minister explain how the new NHS reforms will address these?</p>

I would point out that the cases highlighted in that report occurred under the previous Administration. But I would not make a party political point here. It is something which we all have to address and we have to ensure that, as we change the NHS, we build in far better ways to ensure that the voices of patients and their families are heard.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="110316107000038"></a>There will be the new healthwatch organisations at the local level and the national level. Those organisations will report their concerns to the national board, which will talk to the CQC and advise the Secretary of State. We are hoping to put in place far greater accountability and there will be more local accountability. This is something which we all have to tackle. I note that the Royal College of Nursing has responded positively to this. But the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons have not yet responded.</p>

We have a very special position in the United Kingdom because of our expertise and history on the rule of law.

Of course, we are active in offering legal assistance and legal training help in all those countries in the region that wish to accept it, which is most of them. In addition, we have the Arab Partnership Fund, which highlights priority areas for action, including the rule of law and anti-corruption work, throughout the Middle East and north African region.

The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, mentioned Bahrain, which has very repressive anti-terrorism laws. Are we working with these countries to help moderate their attitude towards terrorism and to provide a little more scope for peaceful dissent without dissenters being entrapped by those laws?</p>

My noble friend is completely realistic in pointing out that there were some undesirable practices and programmes in the past. Our view is best encapsulated by a quotation from the Prime Minister when he said in Kuwait the other day:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="110316107000249"></a>"It is not for ... governments outside the region to pontificate about how each country meets the aspirations of its people. It is not for us to tell you how to do it, or precisely what shape your future should take",</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="110316107000250"></a>"But we cannot remain silent in our belief that freedom and the rule of law are what best guarantee human progress and economic success",</p>

In so far as that is concerned, will the Government particularly direct their attention to encouraging the countries of the Middle East to sign up to the protocols against the death penalty and the use of torture, and the protocol for joining the International Criminal Court, as Tunisia has done since the revolution?</p>

There is also the Justice Assistance Network, a cross-governmental network that draws on UK expertise to provide coaching, mentoring and twinning support for judges, prosecutors and court staff.

In that connection, perhaps I may underline the contribution being made by many law firms in the Middle East. Does the noble Lord agree that what will happen is that those countries will look at the way we observe the rule of law in this country?

Does he agree that while the world focuses on Japan and North Africa, we must also respond to the growing humanitarian and security emergency in Côte d'Ivoire? Some 400,000 people have been displaced, and 75,000 of them have already moved into Liberia, one of the poorest countries in the world. How will the UK respond to urgent appeals for aid for Côte d'Ivoire and, indeed, for other countries in the region that are affected such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ghana?</p>

What is happening in Côte d'Ivoire raises broad concerns that affect the global community, not just this country. I have particularly in mind the horrific murder of several women who only the other day were shot down in cold blood in Abidjan. I have been asked how we support these matters. We do it chiefly through the UN and the European Union. Our own Department for International Development is monitoring the situation and provides direct help, particularly to refugees, to whom the noble Baroness specifically referred. So, frankly, our support is not mainly bilateral but through international institutions and the EU, working in support of France which tends to take the lead in these matters. However, the situation is a worry for all those concerned with civil rights and the promotion of peace and stability in Africa. What is happening at the moment is extremely worrying.</p>

In principle we support the proposals made by ECOWAS, but we think that the authority of the United Nations is needed before they are taken forward. If there is to be that kind of pressure backing up the views of the African Union High Level Panel, of which I am afraid Mr Gbagbo took not the slightest notice, any such firm intervention should be made through the ECOWAS system.</p>

That followed an invitation to which I responded positively to conduct an inquiry led and asked for by the Labour Administration in the Scottish Executive into the cost overrun of the Scottish Parliament. I am delighted to say that a Labour Lord Chancellor had the generosity of spirit to say to me that that was exactly the way to write a report. Subsequent to that, not a single member of the deposed president's Cabinet responded to me. They were clearly gagged. It seems to me that I was getting dangerously close to the truth that there was widespread corruption in that Administration, and that is why they do not wish to relinquish office. Do I take it from my noble friend's previous answers that he is telling me that I should just say silent until democracy is restored to that benighted country?</p>

His experience and his skill and expertise in this area and many others in the legal and other fields are very considerable, as we all recognise. He describes an interesting bit of history. Indeed, modern developments confirm that in the matter of Mr Gbagbo we are dealing with a very unsavoury character who is clinging on to power illegally and no doubt using extremely dubious means to do so.

Of course, under the 2009 Bill, the Royal Mail would have been in public ownership, so when we said we would allow for employee shares, we were able to do so without a specific clause in the Bill at that time.

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="110316107000067"></a>The government position is that at least 10 per cent of the shares of Royal Mail should be put into an employee share scheme. That is why our amendment proposes that 20 per cent of the company be made available for such a scheme. We know that any privatisation of Royal Mail will inevitably entail a lot of change and upheaval. Its success will rely heavily on the good will of the workforce and on improved industrial relations-and on those relations remaining improved. It would therefore be appropriate to give a greater proportion of the company's shares to the workforce. Since this Bill is designed to achieve complete privatisation, with the Government having no direct say after the date of transfer, it is important to pin down in legislation how things are going to work. We accept the principle of employee shares, but employees need to know a lot more about exactly how the scheme would work.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="110316107000068"></a>First, we would like to clarify things by our suggestion that the proportion should be larger than 10 per cent. I will listen with interest to the proposal from my noble friend Lord Clarke about 25 per cent and to the Minister's response to that-there may be complexities about 25 per cent that we will have to consider. However, we certainly urge the Government to provide for a 20 per cent share. We need to understand whether employees would really have to wait until the last Crown share is sold before being able to apply for any employee shares. We need to know what mechanism is going to be there to prevent shares going to employees one day and being sold within a year or two. If the purpose were to have employees feeling that they have a stake in the company, what long-term purpose would be served by passing shares swiftly through the hands of employees and back out to private institutions or hedge funds, even if the employees make a casual profit from the transactions?</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="110316107000069"></a>We need to be clear that shares would be held on an equal basis with equal voting rights for each shareholder and an equal distribution of dividend. Would some shareholders be more equal than others? Will employees be able to act cohesively to influence the strategic direction of the company to some extent, albeit from a minority position? We would like to have greater certainty about eligibility criteria: who would be entitled to shares or share options and what would it mean in practice? Last, but not least, what proportion of costs would be borne by whom?</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="110316107000070"></a>There is still much we would like to know about the scheme. Over the past 20 years in the industrialised world, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of employees who own shares in their own firms. This has happened in the UK, other European Union countries and the USA. By 2004, one-fifth of British workplaces had share ownership schemes, covering one-third of all private sector employees, encouraged by tax allowances. In evidence to the Public Bill Committee in another place, Carole Leslie, policy director of the Employee Ownership Association, said:</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000266"></a>"I am a bit disappointed at 10%, because 10% to me is small, which means that you have to put more effort into giving employees that real voice in the company so that they do feel that it is

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="110316107000071"></a>George Thomson, general secretary of the National Federation of SubPostmasters, said to the same committee that,</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000267"></a>"if Royal Mail Group is privatised, I think there is a case for the postmen and the staff to own 20% of Royal Mail Group; for that to be mutualised as a concept so you do not sell your shares when you leave the company but leave them behind; and for the CWU to be on the board of the new Royal Mail Group. So I see it not just for Post Office Ltd. I see it as let's do it right within Royal Mail Group. If it is going to be privatised to bring in private capital, there is a case for making it 20% of the shares, which are not sold on".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Postal Services Bill Committee, 09/11/10; col. 29.]</ul>
<p><a name="110316107000237"></a>An employee share scheme can take many different forms. We believe that it is best if we look at the possibilities now rather than leave it until the Bill becomes an Act, while there is time to design a scheme that will work best for Royal Mail.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="110316107000072"></a>The Bill implies some form of trust. However, it is unclear whether these shares would be held in trust, with a percentage of the dividend being paid out annually to each employee, or whether there would be a pot of shares to be handed out to individual employees as shareholders. If there is an offer of shares to employees of Royal Mail, how will this be made most attractive to employees? Will there be an offering along the lines of two or three for the price of one? Perhaps there should be multiple pots of shares for employee benefits, with one pot in the form of a share incentive programme or save-as-you-earn scheme to take advantage of the tax incentives. A further pot of shares could be set up for training, bursaries and so on, which could be held in trust. These rewards could also be linked to transformational targets.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="110316107000073"></a>It goes without saying that any structure proposed for the future Royal Mail must be stable, if it is to be genuinely for the good of its customers and its employees. Any change in the status of the ownership of Royal Mail should provide an ideal opportunity for setting up a scheme. I beg to move.</p>

Speaking for these Benches and, I think, for the Government as well, I think there is no harm in the Postal Services Bill emphasising the importance of shared ownership. The issue has already been rehearsed, but I welcome the fact that it is being raised again. However, it is not necessary to say that 20 per cent or 25 per cent share ownership should be required. We on these Benches, and I think the Government as a whole, are determined to ensure that as many shares as possible are distributed.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="110316107000075"></a>Another issue that I feel strongly about, which I am glad is being rehearsed again-and on which I am sure the Minister will respond, as she has done previously-is that share ownership and the input of the employees into postal services are very important. I know that the Minister has accepted that already, and we on these Benches also think that it is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="110316107000076"></a>There is no harm in having a discussion on these issues, but being specific about more than 10 per cent could be counterproductive. Much as we would hope that share ownership will be quite high, we want to

I would urge the Government to provide as many shares as possible for the postal services employees. In that sense I welcome the amendment, but we should not be prescriptive beyond the 10 per cent that we have said already. I look forward to the Minister's response on the various questions when the time comes.</p>

As all Members of this House will know, I am bitterly opposed to the whole idea of selling off Royal Mail in part or whole. I have a dream; I live in hope that the Deputy Prime Minister will wake up one day, have a fit of conscience and resign from the Government, the coalition will fall and we will not have the Bill at all. However, being a realist, I suppose I have to accept that we have got past that stage and we now have to look at share ownership and the protection of employee shareholders. That is my interest.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="110316107000078"></a>If the Bill is to proceed, the shares have to be subject to a reasonable code of conduct that does not permit what happened to some members of my union when BT was privatised. I will come back to the vast quantities of shares and share options that were given to the people at the top of BT.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="110316107000079"></a>Issuing shares could be a beneficial move-notwithstanding my reservations about the whole thing-but it could have unintended consequences. Workers at Royal Mail will want to know that their shares are not allocated at the expense of their pay and conditions. Receiving shares does not constitute much of a choice if you cannot get a reasonable cost of living increase when circumstances allow. Employees will want to know that their shares will not cut across their other chosen and established means of engagement within the company. They will also want to know that the company is being put on a sound footing for the future. That depends on the regulatory and other frameworks that this Bill and the Government set for Royal Mail in the future. Employee shares would hold little attraction if they turned out to be merely an anvil around the neck of employees as the ship sinks slowly under the water. I hope that during these debates we will receive genuine assurances on these points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="110316107000080"></a>In speaking in favour of Amendment 18, I put my noble friend's mind at rest in that he will not hear me waxing on about the 25 per cent figure as I do not intend to move the relevant amendment. I will try very hard to convince the Committee that 20 per cent is the right figure. I support most of the points made by my noble friend who moved Amendment 18.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="110316107000081"></a>First, if there are to be employee shares, I support the case for employee shareholdings to be held in trust. That is very important. I hope that the Government will not dogmatically reject that idea. If the pattern of the past is followed, employee shares will disappear like ice in a Turkish bath-they will go. They will no longer be owned by employees but will be available on the market for people to buy up. If you have your basic pay and some shares and you are under pressure to pay a domestic bill, you are tempted to dispose of the shares. If that happens, I believe that they should be  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_245"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disposed of back into the employee shareholding trust. I hope that the Government will take that matter into account.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="110316107000082"></a>Secondly, I agree that it is quite wrong for the Bill to propose issuing the first employee share only when every single Crown share has been disposed of. That would be unfair and illogical. I understand that 10 per cent is not the maximum proportion of employee shares that have been permitted in a privatisation. A whole string of bus companies were sold 100 per cent to employees. I do not suggest that the 100 per cent figure should apply in this case, but why restrict it to 10 per cent? I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Cotter, talked about the widest possible issuing of shares to staff, or allowing them to purchase them. That is very important. Unfortunately, most of the companies to which I have referred went the same way as the other privatisations, with 10 per cent or fewer employee shares, and they tended to dwindle away over time. What is the case for a bigger share? I do not pretend to be an expert on anything, but we should listen to people such as Carole Leslie, policy director at the Employee Ownership Association, who told the Public Bill Committee in the other place:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="110316107000254"></a>"I am a bit disappointed at 10%, because 10% to me is small, which means that you have to put more effort into giving employees that real voice in the company".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Postal Services Bill Committee, 9/11/2010; col. 71.]</p>

<p><a name="110316107000083"></a>We have not yet dealt with the representation of employee shareholders, although I am sure we will do so later in our consideration of the Bill.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="110316107000084"></a>The general secretary of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters told the same committee that if Royal Mail Group was privatised, there was a case for its employees to own 20 per cent of the group. That assertion supports the amendment of my noble friend.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="110316107000085"></a>Peter Stocks, managing director of the Baxi Partnership, which grew out of a manufacturing company and now advises on employee ownership, also gave evidence to the same Committee. He stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="110316107000255"></a>"I think that 10% is quite low and I think that there is a danger that if it is just shares and there isn't a participation culture that goes with it, it won't change a lot. We see real results in companies where the whole of the company feel that they have a sense of ownership. They feel that they participate in decisions. They discuss decisions and when they make a decision they stick with it. It was interesting watching some of our members through the recession. Employee-owned companies are affected the same as everybody else. They would have gone through an awful lot of agony about how you manage through different times but, because those decisions were made in a very participative way"-</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="110316107000088"></a>Immediate employment is not the only issue at stake for Royal Mail staff; they also need a final guarantee that they will be able to pay their rent or mortgage. They have a big stake. Working for Royal Mail is the means whereby their children can be educated and have better prospects in life, and they use their hard-earned income for a better life. As I said on Monday, postal workers may not always see eye to eye with management, but they are always acutely aware that a viable and successful Royal Mail is in their own interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="110316107000089"></a>Employee shareholdings have been encouraged by tax allowances; £900 million a year is spent on tax relief for employee share schemes, according to the Employee Ownership Association. However, 50 per cent of that tax relief is on discretionary rather than all-employee schemes. Therefore, 50 per cent of the tax relief is going to 3 per cent of employee shareholders. The EOA says that this is poorly directed tax relief. I should add that it is grossly unfair.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="110316107000090"></a>When British Telecom was sold, and it was promised that a golden share would be retained by the Government, those at the top of BT held thousands of share options, although I do not know the exact figure. Any examination of BT's annual accounts will show how many share options were given to them.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="110316107000091"></a>We should be very careful how we treat this exercise, and there is a good case for equality. A 20 per cent shareholding should be distributed on an equal basis to all employees. This would turn the Government's plan from a progressive proposal to a truly radical one. It would give employees a real sense that they had a say in the direction of the company and a stake in its success. It would stand a better chance of realising the worthy aspirations that Ministers have expressed in stating the case for employee shares. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply. In the mean time, I support the amendment.</p>

I very much support the employee ownership proposed in this Bill, which is a great improvement on the Bill that did not complete its progress through the previous Parliament, because it includes employee ownership and because the amount of ownership proposed is very substantial. The Government have more details on that than I do. For people working in Royal Mail, there are two issues of great concern. One is that they should be part-owners in a way that this share ownership will allow them to be, in order both to have a voice and to benefit from the profits that will flow from their efforts and from the future success of the company. It is also very important that there should be the maximum possible investment in the future of Royal Mail. Those two issues have to be balanced.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_247"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110316-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="110316107000093"></a>By expanding the number of shares that will be distributed to employees, the ownership potential for a private partner is reduced, which will reduce his, her or their willingness to put additional money into Royal Mail. I caution that there is a balance to be achieved here. Ten per cent is enough to provide a real voice and real reward, but potentially up to 90 per cent going out in some form to the private market is a real guarantee that the purchaser, whoever they are, will have to put in serious and large investment to make sure that this the company is very successful in future. That is surely what employees want, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="110316107000094"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Clarke and Lord Tunnicliffe, raised many issues that underscored the complexities of trying to set up share ownership for employees in an effective way. The more I heard about all those complexities, such as how shares should be distributed between employees, the more it struck me that the Bill is not the place to set up a structure such as that. It is good to have a discussion in this House, but with so many tax and legal issues there is a need for consultation and much greater involvement by many parties, including potential private partners as well as employees. We would be trying to make the Bill do too much by accepting these amendments, as well as some of those that we will debate later.</p>

I should perhaps declare an interest; my wife owns and jointly runs a web-based mail order company that uses Royal Mail to deliver its products.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="110316107000096"></a>I am delighted that the noble Lords, Lord Tunnicliffe and Lord Clarke, agree with the Government about the attractions of the establishment of an employee share scheme. I say that in the most welcoming and genuine sense. We all agree that this key feature of the Bill will help to improve employee engagement and the culture of the company. We should not lose sight of the fact that the overriding purpose of the Bill is to safeguard the universal service and to secure the future of Royal Mail. A key means of doing that will be by introducing private capital. In deciding on the size of the stake that should go to employees, as my noble friend Lady Kramer said, the Government have had to balance giving a meaningful stake to employees with the imperative of ensuring the private sector investment that the company needs. This is a matter of judgment.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="110316107000097"></a>I will put in context the commitment that we are making through Clause 3. The minimum 10 per cent share requirement in the Bill is the largest statutory employee share scheme of any major privatisation. The share is unprecedented, and there is no doubt that it is meaningful. Most major privatisations did not even refer to employee shares in their respective Bills. Furthermore, the share schemes that eventuated offered smaller stakes: 5 per cent in the case of BT and British Gas, and less than that for the other utilities of electricity and water. Only Rolls Royce and BA came close, at 10 per cent and 9.5 per cent respectively. However, we are committed to at least 10 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="110316107000098"></a>I share with my noble friend Lady Kramer experience of advising companies in similar situations. I did that for nearly 20 years, and my experience convinced me that a requirement that employees should own at least 20 per cent, or even 25 per cent, of the shares in the company, as the amendments suggest, would jeopardise getting the investment that the company needs simply by virtue of the substantial size of that stake. We therefore unfortunately cannot accept the increases to the size of the employee share scheme proposed by these amendments. I hope that noble Lords will accept that what is offered is offered in good faith, and that to commit to more would prejudice our ability to achieve a sale.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="110316107000099"></a>The requirement to pay equal dividends to all participants of the scheme certainly has attractions. However, Clause 3 is designed to maintain as much flexibility as possible to design the right scheme. We would be ill advised to set in stone the form of an employee share scheme until we have more certainty on the form of the private sector investment. Furthermore, there are other equally sensible methods for determining the allocation of shares and therefore dividend payments. An example of another equally sensible method is length of service, for example. I therefore urge noble Lords not to restrict options at this stage.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="110316107000100"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Tunnicliffe and Lord Clarke, asked about the specific route to be followed. The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, helpfully compared, for example, share trusts against individual ownership. This subject will come up again in subsequent debates on amendments. In brief, some of the benefits of share trusts are that they can be structured to last indefinitely. Depending on their design, they would always keep the capital value of the shares within the trust. Against that, this may not be the appropriate form of scheme to motivate individuals, and we will assess the merits of a share trust and other designs at the appropriate time. Individual ownership clearly offers individuals the opportunity to build up a share pot while they are employed in the business, which they can benefit from when they retire or move on. Individual shares can also be better for employees, in that they offer a greater sense of ownership and can be more tax efficient. The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, suggested other options, which I found very helpful. This emphasises why it is important at this stage that we keep our options open.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="110316107000101"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, specifically pointed out some risks of going down the route of issuing shares to employees. As I have said, the exact form of the scheme is still being developed and will be likely to be dependent on the form of the private sector investment. If the share scheme allows for individual ownership of shares by employees, we will obviously explore the most appropriate way of encouraging employees to keep their shares for the long term. Many of the tax efficiencies associated with those schemes relate to a certain holding period, which could be incorporated into the scheme rules. Noble Lords should not assume that employees will automatically sell their shares.

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="110316107000102"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, was concerned that there is no guarantee in the Bill that employees will get any shares until the Government have sold their entire holding. Employee shares are an integral part of our policy for Royal Mail, and we have committed to ensuring that there are shares within the scheme at the same time as private capital is introduced. This is the strongest legislative commitment of any major privatisation. The exact sequence of events in such a large and complex sale is difficult to predict at this stage. This means that we need to maintain a degree of flexibility about precisely when during the process the scheme is set up, so as not to complicate that process even further.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="110316107000103"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, quoted Employee Ownership Association evidence to the Commons Public Bill Committee, saying that 10 per cent was not enough. I might give another quote from evidence to that committee. Alexy Armitage of ifs ProShare said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="110316107000256"></a>"Although they might not hold as much as 10 per cent, or more than that, they like the fact that they own shares in their company and they see that as a benefit and a worthwhile thing to do".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Postal Services Bill Committee; 9/11/10; col. 71.]</p>

<p><a name="110316107000239"></a>That is at all levels, not just executives; it goes right through those organisations.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="110316107000104"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clarke, was concerned about how to ensure that management does not get all the shares. I think that was the nub of his concern. He makes a very important point. As I have said, it is too early to get into the specifics, but we imagine that management will be able to benefit from the share scheme as well as other employees. However, the point is to incentivise employees and to give most of the shares to management would simply destroy that purpose; that is absolutely not the intent.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="110316107000105"></a>The future ownership of Royal Mail, by both private investors and its employees, will be inextricably linked. Within the important boundaries set by Clause 3, the exact size and form of the scheme will, therefore, be informed by the type and detail of the transaction. It is very important that we keep our options open, for the reasons mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, among other things. I assure noble Lords who have taken part in this debate that their suggestions will be taken into account. I, therefore, ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I hope that his influence will be, as I think I heard him say, that as many shares as possible go to employees. I accept that this debate is about balance and we are obviously putting our finger on a particular balance. I certainly hope that the eventual situation is closer to our position than the minimum.</p>

His other point, which supplements my own point, is important: that this must not be seen as in place of a proper

He referred to the trust solution, and the closer we are to a trust solution than an individual-ownership solution the more comfortable we would be. We hope that the Government are thinking in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="110316107000108"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, said that this was a great improvement on the previous Government's contribution. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, is not here to assure me that my recollection and research are correct, but my understanding of our debate is that we took the point on employee share ownership but because our Bill did not have a 100 per cent sale, it left within our discretion an ability to award shares-fairly late in the Bill we were persuaded of that situation-and therefore our advice was that we could bring that forward without the need for a specific clause.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="110316107000109"></a>The noble Baroness made the point that there must be a balance between the new owners and the employees, which I take on board-I think it is the same point as the Minister made. However, she said that it would be wrong to introduce too much complexity into the Bill. My reading of the situation is that this will be quite a lengthy process, and we are seeking as much clarity as possible in this area, because we want to create confidence in the workforce. The more that can be done to create that confidence, the better the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="110316107000110"></a>I welcome the Minister's general agreement with the direction. We seem to be at one on this. He made the point about it being a sufficient proportion to attract private capital. I recognise the weight of his argument but we take a different judgment in this amendment: that 80 per cent is sufficient. It is interesting that he mentioned as the two largest cases Rolls-Royce and British Airways. I should declare an interest in claiming that BA was a success, as I spent 20 years of my life preparing it. I was not there when it happened but still, never mind-you cannot win them all. Rolls-Royce is probably one of the most brilliantly successful companies in the world and it had one of the largest, so I hope that this will come out at more than 10 per cent in the end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="110316107000111"></a>Finally, I sincerely thank the Minister for and congratulate him on his response to our specific questions. Having been, in the memorable and not too distant past, in his position and trying to summon up bits of paper from the Box, I admire his performance but recognise the limitations of such a situation. We asked a number of specific questions. I would be grateful if he could reflect on those in <I>Hansard</I>, just as we will reflect on his response, to see whether it would be sensible to write a fairly comprehensive letter for the record on this whole issue-since we are about to come on to another couple of its areas-of how far the Government are able to go in creating the atmosphere for employees to feel confident about this as we go through the Bill.</p>

We previously debated the merits of there being an employee representative directly appointed to the board of Royal Mail. That, too, garnered some support around your Lordships' House-I particularly recall the powerful speech by the noble Lord, Lord Cotter. However, despite warm words for the principle by the Minister, on that occasion at least, she refused to incorporate any provision in the Bill on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="110316107000240"></a>That person might be an employee or an agent or expert or other representative chosen by the employee share scheme to represent its interests appropriately on the board of Royal Mail. As we have heard, one of the main purposes of an employee share scheme is to secure a greater identification and involvement of the workforce with the company. Given that the employee share scheme, most probably constituted under a trust deed, is the embodiment of this, it would seem a very sensible proposition to cement the relationship by affording the trust representation at the highest level of decision making in the company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="110316107000116"></a>Postal workers already have a major stake in the company, as their livelihoods depend upon its viability. They are what my noble friend Lord Myners called "high-conviction" stakeholders-the sort of people who should make up the shareholder representation on the board-because, as well as being employees of the company, they have a cash stake in its success. I understand that where these schemes have worked successfully, an example being a Norwegian airline, employees go around switching lights off in offices and storerooms where they are not needed. That is the sort of personal involvement we would want to see.</p>

Postal workers have over many decades secured comprehensive negotiating rights on matters of national and local significance. This has meant that people in the workforce have some influence over their own working lives. They have made the workplace a better, safer, more amenable and rewarding place. Royal Mail management, for its part, fully accepts that the workforce has a say in workplace

Sometimes there are conflicts but in most cases these are resolved by the usual pattern of industrial relations that has been established in the industry. The modernisation agreement in March last year has improved relations and allowed the company to go forward positively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="110316107000118"></a>If there is to be an employee share scheme-and undoubtedly there will be one with the enthusiasm for it in all parts of the House-it is only right that it should be introduced with employee involvement and an employee voice. Placing a member on the board to represent the employee share scheme would be a benefit to both the workforce and the employer. Of course, one representative on the board would not be able to outvote the rest of the board, but that representative could ensure that he represents the viewpoint of the employee share scheme and the employees when a decision is debated and voted on in the new company. The workforce would see that there was someone who reflected the experiences and concerns at the highest level and the employer could have an immediate expression of the wider, long-term concerns of the workforce. I beg to move.</p>

I got the impression then that there was general agreement on all sides of the House that staff representation is a good thing that everyone could support. Everybody seems to agree that the involvement and commitment of the staff are very necessary, indeed essential, for the new company to make progress and for the future of Royal Mail. For that reason, it is necessary to state clearly in the Bill that staff representation is essential. Indeed, rather than just "at least one representative", I would suggest that it will probably be necessary to have more than one representative, but staff representation will certainly be necessary for the success of the scheme and of the company. Therefore, I hope very much that the general agreement around this idea commends it to the Government. If they do not accept this wording, I hope that they will accept something very similar before the Bill leaves this House.</p>

However, I am back with my noble friend Lady Kramer in questioning whether it would be sensible to include such a provision in the Bill. The problem is that we are faced with an enormous quantum of uncertainty about what will happen to Royal Mail and the Post Office when the Bill is enacted. If we were to accept the amendment, we would be piling one uncertainty on top of another. There may well be a share scheme and an entirely separate agreement between the board and the principal shareholder-which is quite likely to be the outcome-as to what the representation on the board should be. That might indeed include employees. Whether they should be people who are also on a trust holding shares on behalf of the employees, if such a trust were formed, is a matter for speculation. While nobody can quarrel with some of the thinking behind this amendment,

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="110316107000122"></a>Making Royal Mail into a private company is bound to cause anxiety and create disruption for employees and management alike. In those circumstances, measures to improve the atmosphere of co-operation and cohesion are to be welcomed. The proposal for employee shares, if gone about in the right way, could help that process. Assurance on the issue of pension rights, continuity of employment and recognition rights would also be helpful. The proposal for employee shareholders to have representation on the company board is interesting and enlightened. I hope that the Government will consider it seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="110316107000123"></a>Deutsche Post has been held up as a shining example of a postal service company. Richard Hooper showered the company with praise for its modern attitude, heavy investment in up-to-date technology and overall efficiency. I readily acknowledge that Deutsche Post, although 20 per cent of the company is owned by a state-owned bank, has been passed from public ownership to private control, but it has a statutory duty to maintain a certain number of post offices. My point is that Deutsche Post has not one, two or three but 10 employee representatives on its supervisory board. If it is good enough for Deutsche Post-a shining example of a modern, go-getting privatised post operator-and for Post Danmark and many other European companies, to have employee representation on the board, why would it be so bad to cater for employee representation on the board in the Government's plans to privatise Royal Mail?</p>

Building trust is an important element in this process. Positive statements from the Government at this stage would give an indication of their intent. Keeping all options open, as has been urged from the government Benches, will not give the reassurance required. I very much support Amendment 20.</p>

In my experience, where employees have a stake in the business-such as being shareholders-the greater the influence they have in that business, the bigger the responsibility they take. It is a win-win situation. The presence of employees on the board means that they react differently. The evidence from when that has happened where I have been involved as a trade union official is that their ownership of the business and its success has been reinforced. The whole workforce engages in the business as a result of that recognition.</p>

I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, hit the problem on the head. I am sure that she states accurately that Deutsche Post employees are on the advisory board. Under a European structure, that is exactly where you want them because that board influences policy, but it is not the board that we would recognise under British law. There are so many complexities that I do not know how we could possibly write an appropriate clause that could sit in this Bill and yet work under the six or eight potential structures and options that may arise. Therefore, although this discussion may be crucial for expressing the intention of this House, and, hopefully, of the Government, I cannot see any way that we could encode it so that it would make any sense on the face of the Bill.

Representatives, for instance from London as in my own experience, were a conduit in decision making on very important issues like modification or improvement of services and the early days of mechanisation. That gave comfort to people. At regional level the situation was even better, but at national level not only were there two representatives-I will not name them now-on the board, but they were accountable to the rest of the workforce. The point I am making is that those people gave their time as board members-and they included women-without any share ownership. They were pleased to be part of the decision making and the understanding of why certain decisions had to be made. This was introduced in 1975, and that is why I am advising my friends on the other side to look at the history. It was only a matter of weeks after the change of Government in 1979 that the then Prime Minister-the noble Baroness who is a member of this House-decided that the scheme should be abandoned. We got the feeling then that boards were not the place for working people. I think what we have heard today shows that there are places for working people on boards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="110316107000130"></a>I see no great difficulty in drafting words to that effect, which should be considered in the light of previous experience.

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="110316107000131"></a>The success or failure of this venture, whoever buys it, is going to depend primarily on the employees' contribution to the way the company will operate-and, yes, on capital too. That means that the new owners will have to manage the company in a way that, up to the last two years, we have not seen for a good many years within the Royal Mail. They will know broadly what they are taking on board, and I am sure that they would be very anxious to motivate and involve the employees as far as they can. Therefore, I do not see any great problem in finding a form of words to ensure that we have at least one representative.</p>

We have a recently commissioned report from my noble friend Lord Davies of Abersoch about the desperate need for more women non-executive directors on boards. There is also a desperate need to have the workforce better represented in many companies than we currently have, particularly people who are low paid by comparison with those on the board with substantial incomes accruing from companies. These changes will come as night follows day, so I hope that the Government will be bold and will be prepared to look at this proposal very favourably.</p>

While the idea of an employee share scheme representative on the board may well have merits, it is for Royal Mail and its shareholders to decide how it will structure its board, just like any other company would. Thanks to this Bill, Royal Mail's shareholders will include its employees in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="110316107000135"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clarke, spoke from his experience of the vital importance of effective employee engagement and communication. The Government wholeheartedly agree with him on that. The employee's shareholding is not the only way to create that engagement. I understand that there are a number of initiatives that Royal Mail is following at the moment which also contribute helpfully to that-for example, the world class mail initiative.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="110316107000136"></a>As we have already discussed, in the debate on Amendment 4 on Monday, we ask noble Lords to accept that it is not appropriate to impose the composition of a company's board through legislation. In fact, I am not aware of a single precedent where such an imposition has been made by statute. Furthermore, if this amendment were passed, it would mean that in the future a fully independent Royal Mail, which had no government shareholding, would be obliged to request new legislation if the company or the employee share scheme were ever to want to change the way its views were represented to the board.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="110316107000137"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, for her recognition that the scheme will enhance the modernisation agreement concepts regarding fostering better relations between the company and its employees. She raised the fact of employee representation on the boards of some European companies. Of course, my noble friend Lady Kramer is absolutely right that their corporate structures are very different to the typical United Kingdom board structure. The noble Baroness also gently questioned the Government's commitment to the concept. Perhaps I may tactfully say to her that, as the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, admitted in the debate on the previous amendment, the previous Government had to be pushed quite hard even to agree to contemplate an employee share scheme in the 2009 Bill; we are embracing this concept wholeheartedly.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="110316107000138"></a>Richard Hooper's reports for both this and the previous Government stated clearly that Royal Mail must be freed of the "spectre of political intervention". I ask noble Lords to accept that specifying the composition of the board in statute will not help with achieving this objective. I would therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="110316107000140"></a>As so often happens, the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, probably lighted upon the essence of the debate, which is the extent to which such a provision should be on the face of the Bill. It is about whether there is uncertainty for the new owner or not. We disagree on that point. We want the new owner to know that there is going to be at least one employee representative on the board-I have to admit that we want to discourage an owner who would have difficulty with that. We want to take away the uncertainty so that, when Government are negotiating for either a trade sale or some other form of disposal, the new owner cannot resile from this provision. We believe that any owner who would have difficulty with it would not be good for the interests of the Royal Mail in the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="110316107000141"></a>My noble friend Lady Donaghy, whose chairmanship of ACAS was so important to a period of change in that direction, pointed out that, while the European structures are different, nevertheless the acceptance of significant board-level presence is part of their legal structure. There is significant employee representation, and large, successful European companies manage with that. Under the structure of our company law, the only way we can sensibly introduce such a requirement into the new structure is by including a provision about who should be on the board. It is a change of attitude, but we are living in a changing world.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="110316107000142"></a>I concur with my noble friend Lord Clarke of Hampstead that there was an important initiative in the 1970s on moving towards industrial democracy. I was involved in that on one side of the fence, many of my noble friends were on the other side, and we were starting to make some progress. In many ways I wish we had built on this so that we might not be having this debate now. We would probably be taking the involvement of the workforce for granted in the management of major companies, whether in the private or public sector, because we would have had years of experience of it working. I think that this is the time to set this down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="110316107000143"></a>When I was on the government Benches, I always got a sense from my civil servants that, when they had run out of ideas, they scribbled on a piece of paper "Not appropriate". Another one that they would come up with was, "It is unprecedented". Of course, all law is about setting precedents, and we think that this is an occasion when this chance should be seized.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="110316107000144"></a>Clearly, I am not going to press the amendment today. We will read the Minister's words with great care, but we may come back to the issue because I think it is an important marker of the style and the character of company that we hope Royal Mail will become. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The current draft gives rise to concerns that the employee share scheme could be designed for people other than employees of Royal Mail. Do that on a wide scale and all the benefits of introducing such a scheme, which we have been through in previous discussions, will be dissipated. Of course we accept the narrow definition in the Bill of the employees of Royal Mail only, which could exclude former employees, but who else do the Government have in mind by the use of the term "or

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="110316107000146"></a>The fault-line here, as in so many issues raised by this side of the Committee-some with the support of other Benches-is that the answer is, "It will be all right on the night. Royal Mail is going to be sold to a wonderful company with all the virtues and none of the faults of big business". I hope I will be forgiven for saying that, at the end of the day, it will be an average company because in the long term we are all average. We feel that this is the time for the Government to give a more specific response to this probing amendment in order to allay our fears. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and I beg to move.</p>

The words "or include", which through his amendment he seeks to remove, allow the employee share scheme to encompass those employees of Royal Mail who work for its subsidiaries, even if those subsidiaries do not fall strictly within the definition of a Royal Mail company in Clause 2. Royal Mail has a number of subsidiaries that do not themselves directly provide the universal service, but would nevertheless be considered to be part of the overall company infrastructure and play an essential role. An example would be Royal Mail Estates Ltd, which oversees Royal Mail's property portfolio. It is clearly our intent that those who work for any Royal Mail company be able to be part of the employee share scheme, but without the words "or include" in subsection (4), there would be significant legal doubt over whether the Government could extend employee shares to the employees of other group companies not strictly falling within the definition of a Royal Mail company.</p>

They are tabled in the name of my noble friend Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, who regrettably and unavoidably cannot be here today. She sends her apologies. My noble friend is currently a partnership director of National Air Traffic Services. Had she been here, she would have been able to give us the benefit of her current experience and no doubt update us on the prospects facing NATS employees, who may be moving towards 100 per cent privatisation in due course. As many noble Lords know, I was previously a partnership director of NATS, so both of us have some experience of a reasonably successfully scheme for handling employee share ownership.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="110316107000151"></a>There are a variety of ways in which shares can end up in the hands of employees when privatisations take place. Since the first in 1982, when 90 per cent of the shares in British Aerospace eventually went to employees, there has been a range of offerings-nine or 10 privatisations. The majority were done through institutional public offerings in which employees picked up individual shares and as owners of shares were no different from people in the market. In 2001, when the public/private partnership for NATS was formed, we saw a novel approach adopted. It involved only 5 per cent of the shares. As is often the case when we come to legislation, there is an untold story. It is that had the unions been more willing to participate in planning for the change in 2001, they would have ended up with 10 per cent of the shares rather than the 5 per cent that was eventually the case. When reference is made to the Labour Government not offering shares in the Bill introduced by my noble friend Lord Mandelson, I suspect that had it had a different reception in the other place there is a distinct possibility that shares would have been on offer to the employees, probably in excess of the 10 per cent currently being considered by the Government. I hope that when we look at the 10 per cent and the way the offering is structured we use those untold stories usefully.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="110316107000152"></a>These amendments are, to a degree, based on the experience that the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, and I have had in running the trust scheme within NATS. A direct offering to employees could happen with an IPO, so that the shares disappear all over the place afterwards. It is difficult to conclude that employees have been greatly motivated by what has happened with previous share offerings, although I would not deny that entirely. This amendment seeks to engage the employees more with the company. Paragraph (a) proposes that all shares should be held for the benefit of employees in a trust. I know that this may not be entirely acceptable to all the employees. Some of them might want to get their hands on the shares and to dispose of them at the appropriate point. However, I believe that in the best interests of the company and its employees it would be far better if they are retained in a trust holding, so that while employees are working with Royal Mail they get a return on the investment of those shares during the period they hold them.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="110316107000153"></a>Paragraph (b) states that,</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000270"></a>"a dividend of equal amount shall be paid in respect of each share held by or for the benefit of any employee".</ul>
<p><a name="110316107000241"></a>The argument behind this is that all employees should be treated the same whether they are a postman or the  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_260"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>CEO. There should not be differentiation in the way that shares are allocated. An equal dividend should be paid out in equal shares on an equal footing.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="110316107000154"></a>We then move on to Paragraph (d). In the NATS scheme, the shares are evaluated each year by an independent company because they are not on the market. The shares have changed in value over the years while they are being held by an individual. When employees then come up to retirement, they know what the value of their share is at the end point, and they then get the money in lieu of their shares, which then go back into the trust. The 5 per cent stake that the employees have within NATS is maintained at 5 per cent on a continuing basis, and the employees maintain their continuing interest in the company. Similarly, this amendment is seeking to establish an arrangement whereby they would not cash them in and sell them to other people but the shares would be retained within the company. When they left the company, the shares would then go back into the trust and be reallocated to new employees who would be joining the company in subsequent years.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="110316107000155"></a>The Government already have plenty of experience with such a model in the light of what has happened since 2001 with NATS. I hope, as I mentioned earlier, that we might reach a better arrangement, whereby a representative or representatives of those employees with the shares would find their way to have more influence in the company than they might under the present arrangement with NATS, but that is not covered in this part of the amendment. I hope that the Government are going to be prepared-in the light of the experience with NATS-to look at this very favourably indeed. The amendments are intended to be constructive, not destructive. I hope we might find ways in which we could put more in the Bill than we did when we dealt with the NATS PPP float, where it would have given greater confidence to the employees about the way in which it was going. I believe it would be helpful to anybody who is prospectively looking to purchase the company.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="110316107000156"></a>As an aside, for those people concerned-and I am one of them-that Royal Mail may eventually end up in foreign ownership, in the way that so many of our privatised utilities have over the years, this in a sense could be seen as a form of a golden share in retaining a significant British interest in it too, as the employees would be based in Britain. I see the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, is going to respond-he responded with great comforts on Amendments 18 and 19, although a little less so on Amendment 20. I hope when he comes to respond to Amendments 21ZA and 21ZB he will revert back to what he did previously and be very comforting.</p>

However, time after time, the shares held initially by employees found their way into the hands of institutional or speculative shareholders. They may have started out as employee shares but they did not stay as employee shares for long. What can be done about this? I do not intend to reiterate the very cogent points made by my noble friend Lord Brooke in relation to the experience of the National Air Traffic Services scheme. However, I will respond to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, about being too prescriptive. If there are viable alternatives, no doubt the Minister will deal with that in his reply, and I await it with interest.</p>

I will not go into the details of that, but certainly a lot of cashing in went on at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="110316107000163"></a>The amendment proposes that no employee eligible to receive shares under the scheme would be permitted under the rules of the scheme to dispose of those shares to any other person. If we are serious about a stake in the company being held by employees, that is an important point. To prevent seepage turning into a flood of shares out of the scheme, as we have seen in the past, it is important to ring-fence the shares in the proposed scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="110316107000164"></a>The amendment proposes that, on leaving employment, shares held by employees could be disposed of only by way of a transfer for consideration to the trust.

To maintain the integrity of the scheme, though, they should dispose of the share back into the scheme.</p>

In a wistful diversion down memory lane last week he reminded us of the "Tell Sid" campaign, conducted to boost interest in the privatisation of British Gas. We were told that Sid was the name of an uncle of the late Lord Walker of Worcester, who was the Secretary of State responsible for the sale. It is a bit ironic that the British Gas share advertisements featured a series of people so anxious to alert Sid to the share flotation that one of them was a postman who got knocked off his bike in the excitement. The mind boggles. If the postmen or postwomen of Britain are to be induced to fall over in the excitement at 100 per cent privatisation of Royal Mail-somehow I doubt it-perhaps the Government should address some of the questions raised in this amendment. They are serious; they make a constructive contribution and improvements so that a good idea becomes a very good scheme. I support the amendment.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="110316107000168"></a>I may have missed the point on the other issue. Assuming that something like the amendment goes through, we have an employee share scheme of this nature and shares are sold back, will we reach a position where all the shares are in the hands of this trust, or whatever it may be called? How will we deal with that situation?</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, explained, their broad thrust would be to ensure that shares are placed within an employee share trust. His proposal is helpful and constructive. I thank him and, in her absence, the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, for raising the issue. I know that they both have a wealth of experience in this area.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="110316107000171"></a>As the noble Lord explained, an employee share trust certainly has attractions, particularly for its ability to deliver the Government's objective to ensure a long-standing employee stake in Royal Mail. The Minister for Postal Services has been clear in the other place that he sees these attractions; certainly, he does not discount the matter. However, like my noble friend  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_263"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Razzall, we believe that it is important to keep options open on the design of the scheme until we have reached a firm decision on the form of the transaction. After all, individual share ownership has its own merits, giving the employees a very real sense of ownership.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="110316107000172"></a>As I have said, the design of the scheme will in part depend on the type of sale we undertake. For example, individual share ownership could be more appropriate if Royal Mail were floated. In that case, the question of the noble Lord, Lord Christopher, is answered because there would be a public market in the shares. It could also make sense-I think that the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, touched on this earlier-to have some combination of a trust and individually held shares. I spoke about this area more generally at some length in the debate on Amendments 18 and 19, as I did about the risks of recipients cashing in their shares early, and I am sure that noble Lords would prefer me not to repeat myself.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="110316107000173"></a>As I said when we discussed Amendments 18 and 19, paying equal dividends to each employee is a laudable objective. However, there are other sensible methods of allocating shares, and therefore dividends, to employees. I mentioned that in some schemes shares are allocated depending on length of service.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="110316107000174"></a>As regards restricting the sale of shares to anyone but an employee share trust, I can again understand the noble Lord's concerns to ensure that the employees' stake cannot be diluted by shares being sold to third parties. However, again this would place an undesirable restriction on the design of the scheme and would prevent us allocating shares to individual employees, if we thought that was appropriate at the time.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="110316107000175"></a>As I said earlier, it is in fact very unusual for a Government to commit themselves to an employee share scheme on the face of legislation. For example, I believe that-the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, will correct me if I am wrong-there is no similar commitment in the Transport Act 2000 to create the NATS employee share trust. I hope that all noble Lords welcome this upfront commitment to employee shares at Royal Mail but accept that it would not make sense to go even further and prescribe the particular detail of the scheme in legislation. For these reasons, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Christopher, and the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, that I accept the Minister's view that in many respects the form of the transaction will determine the structure of the offering to employees. However, as I said, I do not think that we will get an IPO. I believe that in earlier debates, the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, said that he would be very surprised if we did, in which case we are talking about a different kind of structure whereby we sell direct to a company or group of companies, which in turn could create the trust advocated in these amendments. In the event that no market could be used as the yardstick for determining what the dividend or the annual growth in the value of

It would also be better for prospective purchasers to know what they are buying into and plan accordingly. However, the Minister's response has provided more comfort than I perhaps anticipated, given his earlier response to Amendment 19. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We move on to the future of Post Office Ltd. After debating the potential conditions for a minority mutual share in Royal Mail, we are now talking about the possibility of the complete mutualisation of Post Office Ltd, or sub-companies thereof.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="110316107000179"></a>In many respects, that is an entirely different proposition, because more than 90 per cent of the outlets of the post office network are already owned by small businesses. It is not clear how the Government intend to mutualise the overall arrangements. I take for my text the useful publication, <I>Securing the Post Office Network in the Digital Age, </I>produced by the noble Baroness's department. It refers in general terms to the Government's belief that,</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000271"></a>"a mutually-owned Post Office Ltd could be ideally suited for the economic and social role that the Post Office network provides".</ul>
<p><a name="110316107000242"></a>The report also talks about the possibility of basing the mutual on a combination of employees, communities and franchisees-sub-postmistresses and sub-postmasters.

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="110316107000180"></a>Given the premise of the Bill-as noble Lords will know, my basic instincts are in roughly the same territory as that of my noble friend Lord Clarke of Hampstead-and given that Royal Mail is to be privatised, and Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail are to be separated, we should explore the prospect of potential mutualisation in that area. However, in order to achieve a mutualised Post Office Ltd, we need to ensure that there is a viable, sustainable and profitable post office network. Although the Government in this document and in other pronouncements have indicated their commitment to that, it is built on somewhat feeble ground.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="110316107000181"></a>I quote from the final paragraph of the report, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="110316107000263"></a>"We are committed to the future of the Post Office network. It is uniquely important to communities across the country but is on a worrying trajectory of decline. As we have set out in this policy statement, we are dedicated to turning the Post Office around. This will involve a major refresh of the network and its products, and the Post Office turning the size of its network to its advantage".</p>

<p><a name="110316107000272"></a>That, as an introduction to a prospectus, is not hugely upbeat. It suggests that there are a number of question marks over the future of the network, some of which we have touched on in earlier debates, and some of which arise from other aspects of government policy.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="110316107000182"></a>The Government claim that they are committed to preserving the current network, more or less. However, there are at least four aspects of government policy that undermine that commitment. The Post Office potentially has a fantastic national network and is a very good front office of government in almost every community. It can provide a range of financial and other services and can be a major part of the logistical network for post, parcels and digital services. However, at the moment there are a number of question marks over it. Only last week, for example, we saw a continuation of the regrettable trend, admittedly started under the previous Government, of taking away government business from the Post Office network; I refer to the decision of the DWP to take a major benefits contract away from the Post Office. That is another blow to the sustainability of the network resulting directly from a government decision.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="110316107000183"></a>As we heard in the debate the other night, there is an almost incomprehensible reluctance on the part of the Government to commit themselves to a long-term inter-business agreement between Royal Mail and the Post Office network within the new structure. As I said then, I am not committed to the IBA being in exactly the form it is now. Clearly there are legal difficulties, to which the Government have referred. However, unless there is a stable relationship between Royal Mail and the Post Office network, another substantial part of the potential income of the network will begin to look extraordinarily uncertain.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="110316107000184"></a>In addition, we have had the rather lukewarm response of the Government to proposals for the Post Office to extend its services. In particular, I am surprised that the Government so precipitously rejected what we were working towards under the previous Government-and which was greatly supported by my former  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_266"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 266</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>organisation, Consumer Focus-namely, the extension of Post Office financial services, and in particular the provision of those services to people who are outside the main banking system. We have seen positive moves towards being able to use the Post Office in the mainstream banking system: RBS recently signed up to that. Now one can access the majority of major high street banks via the Post Office. The problem with the financial services market is that roughly 20 per cent of the population are excluded from it; they do not have basic banking facilities and do not have access, physically and in terms of credit, to those financial services. The Post Office could very simply bridge that gap at a point that would be close to most families.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="110316107000185"></a>I am surprised that the Government have abandoned that proposition. There have been more encouraging words about providing additional services, but it is very strange that they have closed the door on the provision of a banking service. Another Commonwealth country, New Zealand, has made a recent and spectacular success of using the Post Office as a banking system throughout the country. We should look at such examples for this country.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="110316107000186"></a>Therefore, there are dark clouds over the future of the network. Noble Lords will recognise that that means there is some uncertainty as to whether we could successfully mutualise the network and Post Office Ltd. In the same document, the Government indicated that for a mutualised Post Office Ltd to be successful, it must be able to build on solid foundations, and that mutualisation will be an option only if the network is financially viable. It is not specified how it can be made viable, how the assessment will be made or how the conditions of financial viability will be determined.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="110316107000187"></a>The amendment proposes an independent assessment of the financial position of Post Office Ltd, including its future commercial viability. It proposes also that, before we moved to mutualisation, whatever that may mean, we would need to have seen two years of profitable operation of Post Office Ltd prior to the decision in principle being taken. That is exclusive of the subsidy which the Government have for the next few years committed to the Post Office network. There is no commitment beyond that, and therefore any assessment of financial viability would have to be on the basis of excluding the government subsidy. Both the assessment of the network's viability and of the proven profitability of that network would have to be established before mutualisation could go ahead.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="110316107000188"></a>I am not opposed to the mutualisation of Post Office Ltd. I can see many major advantages, not least to consumers and vulnerable consumers, particularly in rural areas and the outer suburbs. I am not at all opposed to the Government's concept, given the premise of the Bill. However, in order for it to work we need to have established, effectively and robustly, that there is a viable company and a viable network.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="110316107000189"></a>I hope that the amendment would provide the means whereby we made that assessment, and would make it clear in the Bill that such an assessment needed to be made before we took the next step. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="110316107000191"></a>I have a guilt complex about mutualisation because in the 1990s I was a non-executive director of the Woolwich Building Society, a splendid body with advertisements which many people remember to this day; "I'm with the Woolwich", they said. I am afraid that I was one of those who followed the lead given by the executive directors, who I of course realise were going to benefit directly as a result. The building society gave up its position as a building society and became a limited company. Not long after that, it was taken over by one of the four leading banks. So, as I said, I have a guilt complex, which has led me-I hope not too far in the opposite direction-to be generally in favour of the idea of mutuality.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="110316107000192"></a>I was unable to take part at Second Reading, but I notice that, in principle, there were several voices favouring the creation of a mutual to run the post office network, including the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, from the Conservative Benches, who is not in her seat today, and others. We all know that the Secretary of State, Dr Vince Cable, had indicated even before our Second Reading that the Post Office was "ideally suited" to the co-operative style of structure, where employees-sub-postmasters, sub-postmistresses -and individuals in communities would all have a greater say in how post offices are run.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="110316107000193"></a>When the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters spokesman, Mr George Thomson, addressed the Public Bill Committee in another place on 9 November last, he was "very supportive" of the concept of mutualisation of the post office network and particularly attracted, he said, by the John Lewis model. "However", he added, expressing it rather more strongly than my noble friend Lord Whitty, the Post Office,</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000273"></a>"has to be worth mutualising".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Postal Services Bill Committee, 9/11/10; col. 29.]</ul>
<p><a name="110316107000243"></a>He then expressed great doubt that it was because it was, he said, a "basket case" at the moment.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="110316107000194"></a>At Second Reading, Peers who favoured mutualisation were just as doubtful, although their language about the immediate prospects might have been less extreme. My noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, who had another meeting this afternoon but who hoped to be in the Chamber for these discussions, said that mutualisation would not now make "economic sense".</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="110316107000195"></a>As my noble friend Lord Whitty has said, Co-operatives UK has been asked by the Government to consider the options. Will they go for a producer co-operative along the lines of John Lewis, which I have already mentioned, or a consumer co-operative like the Co-op shops, or will it be some form of hybrid? The intention behind this amendment is to unravel that over a period of time and come up with a suitable solution, but I am sure, like the many who spoke on this subject at Second Reading, that my noble friend Lord Whitty is just as much in favour, in principle, of a mutual set up as they were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="110316107000197"></a>Generally, this Bill pumps questions on issues of accountability, considering the enormous step that it proposes for one of our most cherished institutions and the number of vague answers that we have to questions about the sale of Royal Mail and the future of the post office network. With proposals relating to the disposal of shares in Royal Mail, to the nationalisation of the pension scheme, to the regulatory regime and to the mutualisation of Post Office Ltd, greater accountability to Parliament should be built into the Bill before it receives Royal Assent.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="110316107000198"></a>The Bill instructs the Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament once he has taken a final decision on the transfer of the Post Office Counters business to a mutual body. Once again, there is no promise of an oral Statement, no debate, no chance to amend and no vote. These amendments offer the House an opportunity to scrutinise the Government's later proposals in detail, including their plans for mutualisation. Several years may elapse between the Bill receiving Royal Assent and the transfer to a mutual organisation, but it is important that Parliament is able to scrutinise and approve the proposal when it comes into effect. Are we being denied the opportunity to scrutinise fully because to do so might cause real difficulties for the Government, or will the cold forensic light of parliamentary scrutiny undermine the foundations on which this Bill was laid?</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="110316107000199"></a>We will not know the answer to that unless Parliament is able to consider future important actions and their implications more fully. So many questions remain unanswered. We are asked to take a leap in the dark about how Royal Mail will be sold, about what sort of Royal Mail will emerge in the private sector, and about what obligation a privatised Royal Mail will be under to utilise the post office network. A great deal of concern has already been expressed about the nature and continuity of an inter-business agreement. In the case before us, of Post Office Ltd, we are also asked to take a leap in the dark about the type of mutual body or range of mutual bodies that might end up owning our post office network.</p>

Are all to be equal or will some be more equal than others? How will the board be constituted? Could the mutual sell off assets? Could the owner sell on to another mutual, such as a building society, store group or a mutual set up for that purpose? Could mutualisation end in disintegration? How will a mutually owned Post Office ensure that it is on a sound commercial footing? What tests would a potential owner have to pass?</p>

Will any mutualisation plan include a detailed business plan for the long-term relationship between Post Office Ltd and the Government in respect of the services that it provides for various departments, including the DfT and the DWP? I must admit that the recent decision on awarding the green girocheques contract leaves us more concerned rather than less, despite the Government's protestations that they are committed to future government services being provided by the Post Office. Does Royal Assent for the Bill mean that Parliament has no further role in scrutinising the proposal, even if it is delayed for some years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="110316107000203"></a>These amendments seek to ensure that if the Bill goes on to receive Royal Assent, the Minister will at least be required to return to the House to seek approval for the next step that he wishes to take on the Government's plans for mutualisation. That is very important, as the Bill is significant. Its provisions will have a major impact on users of the postal service, and even more so for the employees and agents of Post Office Ltd. It will also have a significant impact on the Exchequer. Such a proposal surely deserves closer scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="110316107000204"></a>We accept that the process of establishing a mutual will take time and that an appropriate mutualisation structure will need to be agreed. An external organisation might operate that structure or the employees, managers and agents of Post Office Ltd might run the mutual. Then there is the process of negotiation with the employees and managers, who will be asked to agree the terms of the transfer to a new status. The Government cannot possibly be in a position to share with Parliament the mechanics of that arrangement now, so it is essential that Parliament is able to look at this once again and approve the final arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="110316107000205"></a>A transfer to mutual ownership of this kind is extremely rare. It is possible, for example, that the new mutual organisation will be entirely new to the Post Office. It may be in the form of a mutual structure yet know little about postal service matters. That in itself would not necessarily debar such an organisation from owning the Post Office as a mutual, but Parliament will want to be assured that the right organisation has been appointed to run that body and that those who are affected by the outcome have been consulted. Equally, both Houses will want to be assured that the new entity has a robust business plan. As my noble friend Lord Borrie pointed out, the finances of Post

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="110316107000206"></a>The business is reliant on subsidy to maintain its network of post offices. From the outside, the prognosis is not good. My noble friend Lord Borrie has already quoted from the evidence that George Thomson, the general secretary of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, gave to the Public Bill Committee on 9 November. He pointed out that the federation has been working on the mutualisation concept for over two years, saying,</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000274"></a>"we are very supportive of the Post Office eventually becoming a mutual company".</ul>
<p><a name="110316107000244"></a>He went on to describe its financial status, which I will not repeat as my noble friend Lord Borrie has already detailed his rather graphic language. The general secretary went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000275"></a>"there is a lot of work to be done before the funding package really kicks in in April 2012"-</ul>
<p><a name="110316107000245"></a>that is, the Government's funding package-</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000276"></a>"because we have 18 months of sub-postmasters being up against very strong headwinds to survive and keep their office alive in the community".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Postal Services Bill Committee, 9/11/10; col. 29.]</ul>
<p><a name="110316107000207"></a>That was the evidence of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters: in favour of mutual ownership but really fearful of the financial stability of the Post Office going forward.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="110316107000208"></a>In those circumstances, a robust business plan, as proposed in Amendment 22ZD, is an essential aspect of any organisation seeking a change of ownership. Parliament must be able to consider the non-confidential aspects of that plan. Amendment 22, in the name of my noble friend Lord Kennedy, asks that the report be made after a period of no more than two years, which is surely a reasonable request. Amendment 22ZA requests that the approval be sought,</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000277"></a>"before any transfer is made",</ul>
<p><a name="110316107000246"></a>not after the horse has bolted, while Amendment 22ZB specifies that the "preferred purchasers", if any, should be identified. The latter also calls for the report to be supplemented by an oral statement and an order,</p>
<ul><a name="110316107000278"></a>"subject to the affirmative resolution procedure".</ul>
<p><a name="110316107000247"></a>Amendment 22ZC would require that the report is subject to a vote in both Houses of Parliament, and Amendment 22ZD would require a sustainable business plan for the Post Office company to be set out to secure a viable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="110316107000209"></a>I particularly commend the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Whitty because it would require an independent assessment of the current financial position and projected position of the Post Office company. It would also require that the Post Office company had been profitable for two successive years, excluding payments from government for services of general, social and economic interest. In other words, it needs to walk before it can run.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="110316107000210"></a>This wide range of amendments would insert a greater degree of accountability at the point when the Government decide to hand over the Crown's interest in a Post Office company to a mutual of some sort.

That does not mean that there is opposition to the proposal, which we support in principle. This is about the magnitude of the decision and the importance of the post office network and the affection with which it is held throughout this country, and the Bill does not provide enough detail. We acknowledge that it is difficult for the Government to set out at this point exactly how mutualisation will work. Nevertheless, the amendments would ensure that if the Bill receives Royal Assent, at least the Minister will be required to return to the House and seek approval for the next step that the Government wish to take in respect of plans for Post Office mutualisation.</p>

It will come as no surprise that I come at this from the perspective of rural post offices, and it is here that I wish to probe the Government's plans. Amendment 22ZD, on a sustainable business plan, seems to me the best place to raise all my questions. Although I considered spattering them into a whole series of amendments that we have yet to come to, I hope that your Lordships will allow me to put them all under this one umbrella.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="110316107000212"></a>Rural post offices are a key thread in the web of rural communities. If you can imagine a web on an old barn door, you cut a key thread and the web collapses. It is the village shop that is the key, but the post office represents the cornerstone of viability to that shop as it can greatly increase the footfall in these shops. Research shows that it can increase the footfall by 15 per cent or more. Quite apart from the invaluable services that local shops provide-particularly to those in rural areas without transport, which includes the very old, the young and the poor-it is the footfall in those shops that is the key benefit to the community. It is a place where old Mrs Jones can meet up with the young Master Smith. That seems a strange request, but the old and the young have different groupings in rural villages and it is really important for the sustainability of that community that there is a cross-fertilisation between the groups within it. That can only happen in a village shop.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="110316107000213"></a>I am keen to probe the Government on how they intend to keep the current network of rural post offices profitable and the sort of sustainable business plan they have to ensure that they can keep to the promise that they made in the November document, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="110316107000264"></a>"We will maintain the network at around its current size".</p>

<p><a name="110316107000248"></a>That document sets out how the new flexible service will attract new customers, and claims that it has already done under the new post office local programme. I have my doubts that this will be enough in the long run to give the much needed boost of confidence to potential sub-postmasters to pick up the gauntlet to invest in a new business in a rural area that will probably give a very limited return, that requires a huge degree of skill in accounting, stocktaking and people skills and that involves very long hours. Somehow this vital job needs to be made more attractive. A post bank, as mentioned by noble Lord, Lord Whitty,  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_272"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be a sure way to give that confidence. I endorse all his words on the subject, especially with reference to the huge success of such a scheme in New Zealand. A firm commitment in this area would give confidence to potential sub-postmasters.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="110316107000214"></a>How are the Government going to ensure, in that crucial plank of their sustainability plan, that government departments will deliver their services through post offices? There is no way in which that will happen if there is a cheaper route. Once the £1.34 billion that the Government are putting in has run out, in four years' time post offices will once again start to close. I suspect that most of those closures will be in rural areas. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has already referred to the DWP's reluctance to use post offices and to its closing down the contract on the green giros, which brought about £15 million per annum into the post office chain.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="110316107000215"></a>The trouble is that the DWP and other departments will always follow the cheapest route. Of course, the cheapest route might be the internet. It is not necessarily cheaper for a lot of people, because it ignores the cost of owning a computer and accessing the training if you happen not to be part of the computer age. Some people in remote rural villages find that difficult. As an aside, I put in a plea, vis-à-vis long-term sustainability, that the Government use part of the £1.34 billion to equip post offices, where necessary, as mini-internet cafes and to pay sub-postmasters to help the digitally excluded in rural areas to access government services via the internet. That would be a helpful service for the Government to invest in.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="110316107000216"></a>It is typical that where post offices are most threatened-in remote rural areas-internet broadband connections are all too often non-existent. To put it the other way around, post offices are essential in the delivery of services where no broadband exists.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="110316107000217"></a>My question remains: how will the Government persuade their departments to use the Post Office? Local government services are another possibility, but under the current cuts and financial stringency how can the Government twist enough arms to make local authorities deliver through post offices as opposed to the cheaper option of using their sparse and increasingly rare local authority offices? I say that that is the cheaper option, but it is not really cheaper; it is certainly not cheaper to the consumer, who has to pay increased transport costs to get to the outlet. We should bear in mind that all too often the consumers who want to access those facilities are those who can least afford such costs.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="110316107000218"></a>All the recent trends in this area seem to be for the Government to reduce their use of post offices for the delivery of government services. What are the Government going to do to reverse that trend? How will they maintain the network at its current size? Do they have a sustainable business plan? I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to answer me.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="110316107000219"></a>While we are discussing Clause 4 and the possible mutualisation of the Post Office, do the Government intend in the near future to introduce a majority of sub-postmasters on to the board of Post Office Ltd as a trial run to see whether sub-postmasters running the Post Office company helps? I think it would. I realise

The Government gave a reassurance in an earlier debate that there would be no programme of closures. We all know that you do not need a programme to have a continuing and worrying number of post office closures. The Government may well succeed in being hard-headed-and, dare I say, hard-hearted-about the role of employees and in their business-first approach to Royal Mail. However, when it comes to the Post Office, the potential fallout is another matter. There was a huge loss of good will for the previous Government, my Government, because of the number of post office closures. As noble Lords know, 900 post offices are up for sale, and a significant proportion would not be considered financially viable unless there was an inter-business agreement with teeth. It might sound strange coming from me, but I would like to praise the <I>Daily Mail's </I>post office campaign<I>, </I>which has been one of the most effective for any political party in its dedication and coverage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="110316107000221"></a>I do not think we should underestimate the amount of political capital which will be used up by any Government who fail to ensure a successful future for the Post Office. It may be more valued by the older person, but it is the older person who votes. So in supporting these amendments, we are looking for an assurance from the Government that whatever pattern falls out-whether it is a mutualisation or whatever-a very strong effort will be made to have an inter-business agreement which protects the future for sub-postmasters and for as many post offices as possible.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, confined his remarks primarily to Amendment 21A, and I find that difficult to accept as somebody who, as the noble Baroness will be aware, has argued strongly for the mutualisation of the Post Office. I am concerned that we should put in the Bill-it is exactly the same argument we had on the previous provisions-restrictions that would be likely to slow down the mutualisation of the Post Office. I am sure the noble Baroness will deal with that in her remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="110316107000223"></a>Everything that the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, says is entirely correct. I know, as does the noble Baroness, that the Ministers in her department are convinced that they will have a package that will provide financial security for the Post Office. Whether there is a constraint of coming out with detail before the Budget or before it is finalised I do not know, but I think that before this Bill is passed, it would be extremely helpful if noble Lords could be made aware in more detail of the exact package that the Minister's colleagues in the department are confident could secure the future of the Post Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="110316107000224"></a>I hope that the Minister will reflect on the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Young, because these are extremely important issues. Having made the point endlessly in debates on Bills in opposition about the importance of Parliament sanctioning important decisions, I think the principle is important that, before any significant mutualisation of the Post Office takes place, Parliament needs to have a final say. I hope the noble Baroness will take that point back for consideration.</p>

They reflect a number of concerns that those of us who spoke at Second Reading raised. I was certainly one of those as far as mutualisation was concerned. I had a great deal of sympathy, too, for the concept of banking in local post offices, but that has clearly been firmly ruled out by the Government. That does not mean, however, that they should not be thinking of ways in which they could satisfy the concerns. There should be some return to Parliament for an assurance that the route down which the Government are going will be in the best interests of those concerned. I thought the comments made by my noble friend Lord Cameron about rural areas were extremely important. The post offices are important for the sustainability of those local areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="110316107000226"></a>I hope that when the Minister replies she will feel able to give more assurance than we have had so far on this issue. I commend the amount of money available and the way in which the Government have thought through this Bill in order for it to be sustainable for the future. However, despite all the money-we will no doubt hear details after the Budget of other ways in which the Post Office and postal services will be helped-it would be in everyone's interest if the Minister could say that there will be a hard look at reassurance on some of the many important points that have been made in this group of amendments.</p>

If we look at steel, coal-mining and our car manufacturing bases, public interest in those companies was disposed of in the hope that the people who took them on would make them more viable, but when they took them over they explained that these businesses were not viable. Before we knew where we were our car manufacturing base and our steel industry were not about any more.</p>

It would be very easy for whoever takes these organisations on to say "By the way, when we looked at the books, they were not what we thought they were". Then someone else buys it and takes it on, and before you know where you are the Royal Mail and those other places are not about.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, raised a number on the future of the post office network, as did the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the most reverend Primate. These will be covered by a number of amendments that follow and I ask noble Lords if I may respond to those points in those debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="110316107000231"></a>On the future relationship between the Royal Mail and the Post Office, I hope that my commitment to the noble Lord on Monday to consider his amendment to include information on that relationship in the Clause 2 report provides him with some comfort. This group of amendments relates to the circumstances in which the Secretary of State can transfer his interest in the Post Office to a relevant mutual and the information which should be furnished to Parliament in connection with that transfer. This Government believe that mutualisation of the Post Office could be ideally suited to the particular economic and social role it plays up and down the country. We understand that sub-postmasters, sub-postmistresses and other stakeholders would highly value the opportunity to have more of a say in how this well loved institution is run.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="110316107000232"></a>We envisage that a mutual Post Office Ltd could allow communities to tailor services to their needs and give those who know the Post Office best a greater stake in the future of the institution that they value so dearly. Indeed, the many community-run post offices across the country demonstrate that this can work. Clause 7, which we will discuss in due course, ensures that any mutual must act for the public benefit. No Post Office mutual will exist solely for the financial benefit of its members.</p>

<a name="110316-0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="110316116000001"></a>Clauses 4 and 7 work together to set clear parameters within which a transfer to mutual ownership could be made, but they do not oblige such a transfer to be made. That is because developing the appropriate model for a mutual Post Office must not come from the top down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="110316116000002"></a>Amendments 21A and 22ZD seek to ensure that Post Office Ltd is on a secure financial footing before any move to a mutual model may be made. The network must of course be on a secure financial footing before any move to a mutual model is made. Indeed, it would not be in the interest of any Post Office Ltd stakeholders to take on the running of a company that was not in a suitable position to sustain itself. Nor indeed would the Government consider handing over control of the Post Office if they were not satisfied that the company could flourish in the absence of the levels of subsidy that are currently provided.</p>

We believe that the Post Office could be in a financial position that would allow for the possibility of mutualisation by the end of this Parliament. I hope that goes some way to answering the question put by the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy. This funding will ensure that the Post Office services across the United Kingdom on which so many people rely, particularly the most vulnerable in our communities, are protected exactly as the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, so eloquently explained is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="110316116000005"></a>However, it is important that there is transparency about improvement in the financial position of the Post Office, as, for example, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, seeks under his amendment. That is why this Bill introduces, at paragraph 17 of Schedule 12, a new requirement that the annual accounts of the Post Office be laid before Parliament every year.</p>

The markets in which the Post Office operates are highly competitive. It would not be in the interests of the Post Office, the future members of the mutual or the Government if the business plan being relied on to continue fostering that vibrant and flourishing Post Office were published, as envisaged by Amendment 22ZD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="110316116000007"></a>I turn to Amendments 21C, 22ZA, 22ZB and 22ZC. These amendments all seek to require a further parliamentary approval process prior to any transfer of the Secretary of State's interest in the Post Office to a relevant mutual. Amendments 21C and 22ZB do this as stand-alone amendments, while Amendments 22ZA and 22ZC combine to the same effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="110316116000008"></a>Clause 5 introduces an important means by which Parliament can hold the Secretary of State to account for a decision to move towards a mutual ownership model for the Post Office. However, we do not believe it would be appropriate for Parliament to have a veto right over any subsequent move to mutual ownership that is within the statutory parameters being debated today. The reason is that developing the appropriate model for a mutual Post Office must not come from the top down. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, for his observations. He may be interested to know that, subject of course to the strict statutory parameters set out in Clause 7, the interests of all of the Post Office's stakeholders-for example, sub-postmasters, staff, business partners and customers-must come first.</p>

But since, at the conclusion of that process, the ultimate decision to transfer the Post Office to a relevant mutual will rest with the Secretary of State, Parliament must be informed swiftly and in appropriate detail of the decision. Clause 5 sets out those requirements. It specifies the details that must be included in the report and also requires the Secretary of State to lay it before Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after he has made the relevant direction or authorisation.</p>

The Government's position is that it would not be acceptable for a report to be laid before Parliament as late as two years after the Secretary of State has made the relevant direction or approval, as Amendment 22 envisages. It is important that there is sufficient flexibility in the legislation to provide time for the report to be compiled or to deal with parliamentary recess timings, but the Government envisage that "as soon as reasonably practicable" would certainly be no more than a few weeks after the Secretary of State's direction or approval. We would expect it to be perfectly possible in practice for a report to be laid on the same day as the direction or approval is made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="110316116000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Young, asked a number of detailed questions about the operation of a mutual Post Office. As I have said, the mutual needs to develop from the ground up, and therefore we will not determine all the answers today. The Government have made it clear throughout that there will be a full public consultation before any move to a mutual. I also take on board the comments of my noble friend Lord Razzall, who has encouraged me to take as seriously as I would have done the important questions put by the noble Lord, Lord Young. I can answer some of those questions now, if that would be helpful.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="110316116000012"></a>The noble Lord asked whether mutualisation is the first step towards the privatisation of the Post Office. Mutualisation is absolutely not that first step. Our legislation makes it clear that the Post Office will not be for sale and can be owned only by the Government or a mutual that fulfils strict criteria. A mutual will be unable to sell its shares in the Post Office and there will be restrictions on disposals of Post Office assets. It is worth remembering that the vast majority of post offices-97 per cent-are already privately owned businesses being run by sub-postmasters. Our legislation could allow this group of people to be part of a mutual Post Office Ltd, giving them a greater say in how the national business is run. As I have said, we believe that a mutually owned Post Office could be ideally suited to the particular commercial and social functions that the post office network provides up and down the country.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="110316116000013"></a>In answer to the noble Lord's question about who will monitor whether the Post Office continues to be run for the public benefit, the Secretary of State will have to be satisfied that the mutual is set up to act for the public benefit both now and in the future by promoting the use by the public of post office services.  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_278"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>He must also be satisfied that disposals of property or rights that would be inconsistent with the purpose will be prevented. Safeguards will be built into the mutual's governance structures to ensure that this is the case, and under Clause 11 Post Office Ltd will be obliged to provide a detailed annual network report to Parliament, irrespective of whether it is owned by the Government or by a mutual.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="110316116000014"></a>The noble Lord also asked how we will ensure in practice that a mutual structure represents the public interest in the post office network and is accountable to Parliament. The Government will ensure that a mutually owned Post Office represents the public interest in the network and acts for the benefit of the public. Clause 7 ensures this, and before making any move to a mutual structure, we would conduct consultations so that the public can have their say, both as customers and as taxpayers, about how this should best be done. The Bill also imposes clear requirements for the structure of any mutualised Post Office, including on the ownership and disposal of shares. It requires a post office network report to be laid in Parliament each year, detailing the number and location of post offices, the services offered and the accessibility of the network. This will be the case whether the Post Office is mutualised or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="110316116000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Young, put other questions to me which, as I have said, may be answered as we go through later amendments. However, I will write to him and, if he feels it appropriate, I will make sure that those answers are placed in the Library. I am sorry to have spoken for so long on this major group of amendments, but it comes right at the beginning of our talks about the Post Office. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken to these amendments. I ask them to be patient and listen to the responses that we will make to other amendments that are to follow. I hope that I have provided sufficient reassurances for the noble Lord to feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I am also grateful to all noble Lords who have indicated that they too need some reassurance to the effect that mutualisation will not be pursued until there is a clear and robust Post Office Ltd or Post Office network if not absolutely in place, at least in prospect. I thank particularly my noble friend Lord Young for the complementary amendments which, in addition to the assessments that I have proposed, would require a report to Parliament and a parliamentary process. I shall come back to that in a moment.</p>

I think that it will take time to get to a position whereby we are able to mutualise, and some of what she said indicates that. Nor am I am not trying to restrict flexibility because I recognise that a range of different options is available, some of which may not be a single option because different parts of the network may be dealt with differently. As I say, I am not trying to be restrictive in this respect. However, there are some deep worries. As the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, indicated, there are particular worries in rural areas. The other areas that are particularly an

There are substantial parts of the country where the post office is a major institution, and there are anxieties. That has been demonstrated through reactions to the reduction in the number of post offices over the past few years. As my noble friend Lady Donaghy indicated, it has become a social and political issue.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="110316116000018"></a>The Minister said that we do not want to institute a parliamentary veto here. I think that when the Bill is considered in another place, she will find that Members of Parliament from all political parties may not want to regard it as a veto, but they will want a pretty strong reassurance that the time is right for mutualisation to take place, and therefore a report to Parliament along the lines proposed in the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Young is necessary.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="110316116000019"></a>Obviously I will not press the amendment tonight, but the problem is that the noble Baroness has to be completely convincing. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, slightly mysteriously referred to a package that he hopes Ministers will come forward with. I have some inkling about that in relation to the Ministers in the noble Baroness's department, Ed Davey and Vince Cable, and, indeed, the noble Baroness herself. I am not attempting to split the coalition-not tonight anyway-but there is a different sort of split between Ministers in BIS, who I think are genuinely committed to the future of the Royal Mail and the post office network, and other departments which are not prepared to make any sacrifices in relation to the network. As the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, and other noble Lords said, we have just had yet another example-we had some significant ones under the previous Government-of a department taking a silo view of what is in its most cost-effective interest helping to destroy the interests of government and society as a whole, particularly in rural and underprivileged areas. I think the split is not between Ministers or parties but between different Whitehall departments. We need to get some coherence there in parallel with setting up the terms of the mutualisation. We need greater clarity that the Government as a whole are behind the objective of making the post office network work. Only at that point can we clearly be reassured that this mutualisation is likely to work.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="110316116000020"></a>I think the main points have registered with Ministers, and I suspect these debates will go on in another place. Ministers in the noble Baroness's department will need to ensure that the network that they envisage over the next few years will be robust, will be sustainable for a long period of time and will meet the social and economic needs of a large proportion of our population. If they can do that, God speed to mutualisation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Particular concern has been expressed over the recent loss of the green giro account to PayPoint, which took away another source of business from the post office.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="110316128000002"></a>The post office network is a unique national resource. It has as many social and community functions as it has business activities. It is woven into the fabric of all our lives. Communities, businesses and individuals all depend on it, and I believe it should be protected and grown. I welcome the Government's commitment that there will be no closure programme for post offices, but we are seeing the loss of many hundreds of post offices across the country. It is therefore paramount that we take action to ensure that there are no further closures of post offices by looking to build and strengthen the business.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="110316128000003"></a>We suggest "a cunning plan". A post bank based on the post office is in many people's view one of the best ways of strengthening the post office by building up and extending its current financial services and thus securing the future of the network. As both bank and post office branches have closed in many local communities, particularly the poorest, many people and small businesses have seen their direct access to postal services and essential financial services disappear. Establishing a post bank would ensure the provision of financial services based on a return to basic banking principles under which bankers are situated in and understand their local community and its needs. With its network of branches throughout the country and the high levels of trust that it enjoys, the post office is ideally placed to house a post bank. The proposal also builds on the central idea that post offices are there in great numbers, and it seems sensible to build on what we have rather than to think of other ways to use the service.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="110316128000004"></a>A post bank would hugely increase post office custom and would enable the Government to increase the work they pass to the post office. It would enable the post office to build up its business profitably. It would also enable the Post Office card account to be embedded in a trusted bank and would thus remove the threat that it could again be put out to tender. The post bank would be an economic driver, lending at small margins and supporting local enterprise in local communities. The current banking crisis surely provides an opportunity for a radical redesign of retail banking, including combating financial exclusion and creating an accessible and trusted banking system.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="110316128000005"></a>One way of doing this would be to put in place a universal banking obligation, similar to the universal service obligation placed on Royal Mail, to create a post bank in the model of the post office with statutory obligations to provide a service. A post bank would allow every local post office to offer current accounts, access to credit and direct debit facilities and to expand its present savings capacity. It would not be shareholder driven and would be able to act in the best interests of local communities and local businesses. It would be localism in action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="110316128000006"></a>As I alluded to a moment ago, the new post bank could address the problem of financial exclusion. Commercial banks have physically retreated from large tracts of the country, leaving people badly served. There are 3 million people in the UK without a bank account, and that figure is still rising as the banking crisis has increased the number of those who have difficulty accessing banking services, especially if they need mortgages, loans or overdrafts. People without access to financial services effectively pay an unfair premium for basic services. I declare an interest as chair of the Foundation for Credit Counselling, which helps nearly 350,000 people a year deal with problems from their credit card use. Many of them are paying high rates of interest for basic services. The establishment of a post bank would be an essential safeguard for the future of the post office network and would hugely increase post office custom. It would enable the Government to increase the work they pass to the post office.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="110316128000007"></a>I shall talk a little about the role a post bank could play with small businesses. As many noble Lords have argued, the UK economy relies on small businesses which, in turn, rely on the post office and its efficient, affordable and local service. A post bank would safeguard the post office network and offer more extensive services for small businesses. A recent Federation of Small Businesses survey, which received responses from about 5,500 small businesses, revealed that 38 per cent thought that a post bank based on the post office network was a good idea and that they would consider banking with such a bank. Many respondents also said that they wholeheartedly support the idea, regardless of whether they would use it as a banking service. Clearly, measures that will prevent future post office closures are welcomed by the small business community, as many small businesses rely on local post offices for mail services. The survey showed that 79 per cent of respondents use the post office for their mail services and 88 per cent use stamped mail rather than metered mail. They make the journey to the post office regularly to purchase stamps, and they have parcels weighed and franked. It is an important part of what they do. If small businesses could also access a wider range of financial services at the post office, they could deal with many more errands in one visit, saving them valuable time.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="110316128000008"></a>A post bank would reconnect banking with local economies and would liaise with other financial bodies, including credit unions and community development financial institutions. There is growing expertise in the credit union and CDFI sector about how best to service the needs of financially excluded households. Credit unions and CDFIs have been evolving sensitive responses to the financial needs of lower-income households. These sectors of the market involve higher credit risks, higher transaction costs and a high level of professional skill in budgeting and money-management service. A post bank would support these initiatives very well.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="110316128000009"></a>There are many international examples of successful post banks. Many of Post Office Ltd's overseas equivalents have developed comprehensive banking services to

These have made substantial contributions to the viability of those national post office networks. Even if they are not exactly like-for-like comparisons, they are useful examples of what could happen. The French postal service, La Poste, launched its bank in January 2006, and by 2007 it had over 11 million postal banking accounts and accounted for nearly a quarter of La Poste's turnover. The Italian postal service, Poste Italiane, launched BancoPosta in 2000, and by 2002 Poste Italiane showed a net profit for the first time in 50 years. This turnaround is largely attributable to the business generated by BancoPosta and has led to an expansion of the Italian post office network, which now stands at over 14,000 post offices in a country of very similar size to the UK. In Germany, Deutsche Post's Postbank, although it has recently suffered problems, remains the largest German retail bank by customer numbers, with 14.5 million users, and Germany's largest issuer of credit and debit cards. Banking transactions account for 39 per cent of business over German post office counters.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="110316128000010"></a>I remind the House that the Liberal Democrats 2010 manifesto states, on page 54, that they will,</p>
<ul><a name="110316128000141"></a>"Improve access to banking for all with a PostBank, revenues from which will also help to secure the future of the Post Office".</ul>
<p><a name="110316128000114"></a>On page 83, it states that they will:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="110316128000121"></a>"End the post office closure programme to keep post offices open in rural areas where they're the lynchpin of community life, improve access to banking and help secure the future of the Post Office through a PostBank".</p>

<p><a name="110316128000115"></a>To conclude, I have outlined how a successful post bank would offer real, long-term financial security to individuals and businesses and provide a vital role for the post office in accordance with the high esteem in which it continues to be held by the British people. At a time when the Government are creating a green investment bank to deliver funds for clean energy and low-carbon projects and a big society bank to help social enterprise, why not complete the hat trick and create a post bank that will help safeguard the post office network while also delivering a reliable banking service to people who need it most? I beg to move.</p>

It is very important to accept that post offices have an important social role. One of the social roles they perform is that they are a point of access for-often not very well paid-people, including elderly people, who do not use banks because they do not know how to use them, are too concerned about them or are anyway not interested in speculative investment. Some people simply want somewhere safe to put their savings so that the savings are readily available when they need them, and they know that the savings are going to be safe because they trust the Post Office.</p>

However, I notice that the three names down on this amendment are those of the noble Lords, Lord Young, Lord Stevenson and Lord Tunnicliffe, and-I am sorry if I get their histories slightly wrong-I think it must have been on their watch that the contract with the Bank of Ireland was signed. That contract hidebounds the Post Office and makes it virtually impossible for it to provide the kind of comprehensive service and range of financial services without buying out that contract. Without breaching any confidentiality, perhaps they could tell us how many hundreds of millions of pounds would have to be paid to Bank of Ireland to buy out the contract so that a post bank could be put in place. I do not have access to that information, but perhaps, having been on the watch when that contract was originally put in place, they could give us a sensible estimate of what that amount of money could be. I am rather afraid it is such a large sum that it would have been difficult even in a time of prosperity and exceedingly difficult in a time of deficit. I greatly regret that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="110316128000015"></a>I am glad that we had some discussion-there will be other opportunities-about bringing on board the credit unions. This House will be well aware that the Minister, Ed Davey, and others are committed to financing the technical platform that would make it possible for the post office to be used as the face of the credit unions. Credit unions are far more fragmented than a coherent bank would be, but they at least that would open up the opportunity. I will also have a few words later to say about at least providing access to current accounts in the various high street banks. I wonder if they would give us an indication of what they think the cost would be for the Government to buy out that Bank of Ireland contract to make this very attractive proposition possible.</p>

Well, I wish it was cunning-it is not original. In fact, it was the Conservative Government of the 1970s that abandoned National Girobank. I was one of those who agitated for many years for the creation of Girobank. By

I mention National Girobank because one day, when I get enough money, I am going to ask a student or someone to do the proper research on what happened to our people's bank, as it was in those days.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="110316128000017"></a>As I said in the debates on the previous Postal Services Bill a couple of years ago, that only one paper in this country covered the story of what I considered the give-away of a national asset. Reference has been made to the shock that you get when you find you have got to buy out a contract, but if you had the figures on what happened at Girobank, you would start to worry even more. I know this because when it was announced that it was going to be abolished-and it was really abolished because it was so successful-Co-operative Bank, Unity Trust and a consortium of trade unions got together to try to buy the bank when it was put up for sale. First, they were told, "You need £200 million to buy Girobank". That was the easy bit, because that was gathered together. Then the rules were changed, and Girobank was to be sold only to an established finance house-which the consortium was not-but the consortium established itself as a finance house. Then they were told, "You cannot buy it unless you have an alternative computer system that will be there if this system goes down". So the dice were quite loaded from the start. The £200 million that was mentioned at the time of the sale of Girobank actually paled into insignificance, because the actual figure-I am quoting from memory as I have no notes here-was £118 million when it was sold to the Alliance &amp; Leicester. The Alliance &amp; Leicester obviously grabbed it because, at the time, there were thousands of people waiting to open an account with National Girobank. Political dogma said, "This has got to stop. It's too successful and we're going to do away with it".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="110316128000018"></a>What has happened since? Alliance &amp; Leicester of course has been swallowed up by Santander. If anybody thinks that the service they are getting from Santander is anything like what they got from National Giro in the beginning, and to some extent with the Alliance &amp; Leicester, they are dreaming, because the rapacious way in which these banks work frightens me.</p>

I ought to declare another interest: I am a member of the St Albans District Credit Union. During my years as a councillor in Camden, I saw what happened when people were at the mercy of loan-sharks, when people were threatened on their doorsteps with an extortionate amount of interest week on week. Of course there is a chance to get a link between the growth of credit unions and a people's bank-or post bank, post office bank or Royal Mail or whatever-but the important thing to is to have a simple banking system, which allows people to have confidence in where they are putting their money. At the back of it all, despite all my criticism of what has gone on in the last few years, I still believe in the brand name of the Post Office. The Post Office has a good reputation and I hope that the Minister and her colleagues will go into one of those

It was a substantial sum. I am not saying that to be evasive; I cannot remember the precise amount. The only thing that I would say about our arrangement with the Bank of Ireland was that it enabled a large amount of business to be generated. We should not forget that aspect of it. As an original member of Girobank when it was first formed, I concur absolutely with the regretful history of its sad demise that my noble friend Lord Clarke has recounted. For a period we had a successful people's bank, which unfortunately disappeared as the result of another privatisation.</p>

The Government are clear that the wide range of financial services that the Post Office offers-personal loans, credit cards and savings products, for example-are an important part of its total product suite. The Government made clear in the coalition agreement that we would look at the case for developing new sources of revenue for the Post Office, including the creation of a post office bank. We have looked at the different options and arguments for such a bank very carefully and have come to the conclusion that, particularly in the financial climate that we are experiencing, it is just not a viable option. My noble friend Lady Kramer spoke further on this and gave us her views, and I think that she felt the same.</p>

Instead, we are committed to ensuring that the Post Office continues to offer wide access to existing banking facilities. For that reason, we were extremely pleased that in November last year the Royal Bank of Scotland reached agreement with the Post Office to allow RBS customers, including NatWest customers, access to their current and business accounts at the post office. That will mean that almost 80 per cent of all current account holders will be able to withdraw money free of charge at the post office, while many can also pay money in and check their balances.</p>

While in practice we would expect only one relevant mutual to own the Post Office at any one time, we believe this amendment to be unnecessarily restrictive. For example, there may be circumstances in which different stakeholder groups form separate corporate bodies, each taking an interest in the Post Office.

Those conditions ensure that the Post Office mutual must continue to act for the public benefit by promoting the use by the public of Post Office services, that its members have a clear interest in it so doing, and that disposals that might jeopardise that will be prevented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="110316128000045"></a>Mutualisation is not a new concept; its origins date back to the establishment of the Co-operative movement in the 19th century, which has many facets and is still going strong today. We on these Benches all support the Co-operative endeavour and can trace the roots of the Labour Party to it, but surprisingly, and somewhat disappointingly, mutuality is still not a particularly common concept today. The John Lewis Partnership is considered to be an outstanding example of how a mutualised business can operate. In that respect, the John Lewis Partnership is admirable, but there are very few other mutualised entities of a similar size to the one which the Government propose in this Bill. Indeed, in the financial services sector, where there is a history of mutualisation, the tide has rather been flowing the other way and only a few building societies have survived as mutuals. I understand that the Government's mutuals task force is looking at how government can stimulate the transfer of assets of NHS bodies and local government to mutual status.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="110316128000046"></a>Understandably, public sector workers have been hesitant to jump into new and untested structures. Recently, the Trades Union Congress claimed that a ballot at a south-east Sussex PCT showed that 90 per cent of staff were opposed to being "spun out" as a mutual-those are their words. The TUC stated with regard to that case:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="110316128000124"></a>"The moves towards mutuals are being driven by management rather than bottom-up. That makes a nonsense of the model because it relies on a buy-in from staff. You can't force mutuals".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="110316128000047"></a>Now there is potentially a new kid on the block-the Post Office. It is indeed an interesting idea and there is clearly an opportunity to establish that business as a thriving mutual. All of us want the Post Office network to prosper, and, we hope, one day be free of subsidy, but at a level that provides coverage for the whole of the UK. I understand that the Minister has said that the minimum number of Post Office branches required to sustain a universal obligation is 11,500; indeed, she said that only a few minutes ago. We welcome that and look forward to receiving more detail about how that number is to be sustained. That is an important point to make in respect of this amendment. While we welcome the mutualisation of the Post Office network, we want to understand in more detail how this might work in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="110316128000048"></a>In one respect mutualisation might be a straightforward share of any profits made among the members of the mutual, primarily its workforce. That is a common form of mutualisation, particularly in the Co-op, but given that the Post Office network relies on a significant subsidy that far exceeds its profits at present, such concepts as profit share might not appeal to the workforce if it means sacrificing their collective bargaining rights. Perhaps in this case a more attractive mutualisation model will be one that extends the participation of the workforce in the day-to-day running of the business beyond simply being the passive recipients of profit

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="110316128000049"></a>The logic is equally strong for the participation of a sub-postmaster representative on the board. After all, sub-postmasters run their own businesses. They know what works and what does not. There is disquiet among members of the postmasters' federation about this Bill-a disquiet reinforced by the decision by the DWP to announce the cancellation of the green giro contract during the passage of this Bill.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="110316128000050"></a>As I have suggested, mutualisation can take a number of forms. My own party when in government looked at industrial democracy concepts for the Post Office way back in the 1970s and the party opposite did the same in the 1980s. Both those schemes ultimately came to nothing because quite simply employees in such businesses are always loath to give up their collective bargaining rights. Who can blame them? Therefore, in order to make the offer of mutualisation more attractive we would expect to see the Government bring through a package of measures that give the employees, managers and agents of the Post Office a real and genuine say in how the business is run. That should include direct participation on the board of Post Office Ltd.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="110316128000051"></a>The amendment is not prescriptive; it would leave the decision on who is elected or appointed, and how they are elected or appointed, to the employees and sub-postmasters to decide. The employees, for example, might decide to nominate an outside expert or elect one of their own trade union officials. That is a matter for them to decide. The board would benefit significantly from the input of two people directly representing the interests of the core of the workforce, and that would make the prospect of mutualisation more attractive to those who may be hesitant to embrace the concept of democratic ownership. I beg to move.</p>

The Government are very keen to see sub-postmasters, sub-postmistresses and staff of Post Office Ltd-the very people who know the network best-involved in the running of the business. That is why this Bill contains provisions that enable the mutualisation of Post Office Ltd.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="110316128000053"></a>We believe that mutualisation could help to ensure that sub-postmasters, sub-postmistresses, staff and communities could in the future all have a say in how the Post Office is run. Co-operatives UK is seeking the views of the Post Office's major stakeholders and will soon report back to my department on proposals for a mutual Post Office. The work that Co-operatives UK is carrying out seeks to address questions such as who the members of a mutual might be and which stakeholders should play key roles in how the Post Office is run in the future. A mutual Post Office must be established with the best interests of the company, the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and the wider public, who are its customers at heart. It must be allowed to develop organically, with the willingness and participation of its members. We believe that it simply would not work if government imposed a rigid top-down structure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="110316128000054"></a>Indeed, it is by no means clear at this stage that the selection of sub-postmaster and sub-postmistress and employee representatives to the board by election would necessarily be the best option for the Post Office network. There is an obvious reason for this; the mutual has not been designed yet, so we cannot know its governance structure. Enshrining its governance in legislation now and then trying to develop the mutual within these requirements goes completely against our commitment to ensuring that the mutual is developed by the people who know it best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="110316128000055"></a>The Government strongly believe that the Post Office and its key stakeholders should be allowed to form their own mutual governance structure as appropriate. In the light of this, and in view of the work that is being carried out on the mutualisation of the Post Office, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Although the amendment looks complicated, it is, in essence, an amendment to probe how the Government intend to fulfil the commitment made in the paper to which I previously referred-and to which the noble Baroness referred twice-that they will maintain a network of approximately the present size. The noble Baroness stated that even more precisely in her reply to my noble friend Lord Lea.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="110316128000058"></a>I have tabled the amendment from the perspective that my previous organisation, Consumer Focus, and its predecessor, Postwatch, have been through two alleged rationalisations of the post office network, the first of which was based on no objective criteria at all. It worked from where sub-postmasters were finding it difficult to maintain a post office, were retiring, or had some other reason for not wanting to continue. The second round of rationalisation worked on substantial and clear issues of access that were specified in crude distance terms, but nevertheless gave rationality to the assessment of whether one post office or another should change.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="110316128000059"></a>I must say, having inherited this situation at three-quarters of the way through, that I found it difficult for a consumer organisation to be forced to choose between the post offices in any particular town. Nevertheless, the criteria against which we operated-  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_293"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>access to post offices among different populations, distance to travel to a post office, and so on-are reproduced in the paper from which I quoted earlier, but which I unfortunately gave to <I>Hansard</I> for verification. However, the document includes a table that sets out the current criteria.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="110316128000060"></a>My concerns are twofold. Those criteria would arithmetically allow for a network that is significantly smaller, particularly in towns and suburbs, than the current network, and I therefore need to square the assurance given by the Government that they are looking for, and are in effect subsidising for the next few years a network at its current size, with the fact that theoretically, using the same criteria, they could reduce it to a size of between 7,000 and 8,000. I hope that the Government reaffirm their commitment to retaining a network of the current size.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="110316128000061"></a>The calculations in proposed new subsection (1) in the amendment, according to my former colleagues in Consumer Focus-I did not do the arithmetic-would sustain a network of roughly the present size. In other words, the first four criteria are considerably more stringent than those used in the previous round of rationalisation and specified in the Government's document on the future of the network. This would not mean that every post office would need to remain open. There would obviously be temporary closures and what the Post Office somewhat euphemistically calls business-as-usual closures. There would also be movements of sites within particular areas. However, one would arrive at roughly the same number of post offices, were these criteria to be followed.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="110316128000062"></a>It would be interesting to know whether the Government intend to tighten up the criteria or to add different criteria that would produce figures similar to those in the amendment, or whether their commitment to the current size of the network is irrespective of particular criteria because they envisage that the moves they claim to be making to improve the volume of post offices' business-to sustain and inculcate a different sense of purpose through mutualisation-will mean that we will end up with a network of roughly the current size.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="110316128000063"></a>I see that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is once more in his place. When we were discussing the IBA, he raised a pertinent question as to whether any failure to commit to the IBA-and, I would add, to direct other government work to the post office network; an earlier debate today demonstrated that we were moving away from that-threatens the Government's commitment to the size of the network. There is a circle to be squared, and I am not entirely clear how the Government intend to square it.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="110316128000064"></a>One option would be to reassure consumers, sub-postmasters and the staff of the post office network that the criteria would be tighter. Another option would be a more detailed way of reassessing those criteria. In fact, proposed new subsections (3) to (6) in the amendment would allow the Government systematically to assess the criteria of access and the nature of services provided.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="110316128000065"></a>Another dimension that has been mentioned is that part of Post Office Ltd's plan is to reduce the range of services provided in some post offices. There was the  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_294"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>experiment of Post Office essentials outlets that provided a reduced range of services. Some have worked and some have not. That is not necessarily entirely consistent with the government commitment to maintain the network broadly as it is, but it may mean that different gradations of post office outlets appear within the total. It would also be useful to know about that.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="110316128000066"></a>Although I do not expect the Government to accept the amendment, it gives them options in adopting criteria that would sustain more or less the present network or having a process whereby they redefined the criteria for access and the services provided. It would be useful to know what the Government's strategy was in this respect. Obviously, we take great heart from the reassurance that the present network will remain in place, but the question of how that will happen and how we square that with certain other developments that were referred to earlier remains. I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="110316128000069"></a>Amendment 22A writes into the Bill the current level of access to post offices in the UK. As part of the 2007 changes to the Post Office network that included an investment of £1.7 billion and incorporated the Network Change Programme, resulting in the closure of 2,500 post offices, the Government introduced a series of distance-based access criteria. These remain applicable but are not included in Royal Mail's licence and are not set out in law. The minimum access criteria introduced by the previous Government state that 99 per cent of the total UK population should be within three miles of their nearest post office; 90 per cent of the population should be within one mile; 99 per cent of the total population in deprived urban areas across the UK should be within one mile; 95 per cent of the total urban population across the UK should be within one mile; 95 per cent of the total rural population across the UK should be within three miles; and 95 per cent of the population of the postcode district should be within six miles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="110316128000070"></a>The current post office network of 11,905 offices exceeds the Government's minimum access criteria. Post Office Ltd has stated that a network of 7,500 post offices would be consistent with these criteria. We believe that the criteria are insufficient on two counts. First, they do not guarantee to keep the network at its current size. The Government have stated that they wish to retain their network of 11,500 post offices. In his evidence to the Postal Services Bill Committee late last year, the Minister, Ed Davey, stated that,</p>

<p><a name="110316128000116"></a>This commitment would be better strengthened by introducing minimum access criteria that guarantee the network at its current size, rather than maintaining the current access criteria that could allow for a further 4,000 closures.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="110316128000071"></a>As a result of the current distribution, 99.7 per cent of the total UK population is within three miles of their nearest post office; 93.2 per cent of the population is within one mile; 99.8 per cent of the total population in deprived urban areas across the UK is within one mile; 99.1 per cent of the total urban population across the UK is within one mile; 99.2 per cent of the total rural population across the UK is within three miles; and 95 per cent of the population of the postcode district is within six miles. Amendment 22A calls for this level of access to be enshrined in the Bill. The amendment goes further in strengthening access requirements that have their origins in the 2007 Network Change Programme measures by putting them into law for the first time.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="110316128000072"></a>The amendment goes on to strengthen the Bill by ensuring minimum levels of service provision at post offices. These will require not just the provision of postal services but access to social benefit and tax credit processing, national identity and licensing schemes processing, payment for essential utility bills, cash and banking services and access to government savings products. This does not constitute a requirement for all post offices to provide all post office services, but it does mean that a core range of services must be available at all post offices. This is important for the viability of those offices and to ensure universal access to the core government and postal services that are so important to communities across the country, particularly those in urban deprived and rural communities.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="110316128000073"></a>The amendment requires the Government to establish the number of post offices that is consistent with the minimum access requirements and to decide on the frequency with which this shall be reviewed. They must undertake this work in consultation with the Post Office and with representatives of relevant consumer groups. These access criteria can be reviewed by the Secretary of State and changes can be recommended, but ultimately it is for Parliament to decide through a super-affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="110316128000074"></a>Amendment 22C calls for further strengthening of the access criteria to reflect the Government's proposed new model for the post office network. In November, the Government announced a funding package of £1.34 billion: a combination of investment and subsidy for the network until 2015. This includes just under £500 million that has been designated for "network modernisation". The November BIS paper on the post office network states that the funding will allow Post Office Ltd to do more than simply ensure the status quo: indeed, it is envisaged that there will be a fundamental change to this. The paper proposes two key strands of the network. The Government have asked Post Office Ltd to have, by the end of the current Parliament, about 4,000 main post offices in town and city centres, and to have converted about 2,000 sub-post offices to the "local" model. This last commitment gives cause for concern. The local model is also referred to as "Post Office Essentials" because it offers a slimmed-down  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_296"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provision of services. These are likely to be offered over the counter of other shops, not necessarily through dedicated post offices.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="110316128000075"></a>While the Government have provided little detail on the model, David Smith, the managing director of the Post Office, wrote to the MP for St Austell and Newquay on 13 July 2010. The letter is available in the House of Commons Library. He stated that products not offered as part of the essentials package are,</p>
<ul><a name="110316128000143"></a>"cheque deposits, Moneygram, non-automated bill payments, manual cash deposits and withdrawals, travel insurance, European Health Insurance, philatelic items, Post Office financial services, some NS&amp;I products and phonecards".</ul>
<p><a name="110316128000117"></a>Alongside this, it is already the case that a range of products and services is available only in specified post offices. These include motor vehicle licence renewals, passport check-and-send services and the online lottery. The new identity and passport machines are also limited to certain branches, and it is likely that any expansion of government or financial services will be restricted to certain branches. The Government have claimed that the remaining branches will provide 86 per cent of post office services, though there is no way to verify how this has been determined. Crucially, no figure has been given for the percentage of revenue or business that sub-post offices currently have. This model sees a loss of core payment and sub-postmasters estimate that a conversion to the essentials model will reduce their revenue by around 60 per cent. Surely that figure is worrying for the future of sub-post offices.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="110316128000076"></a>The local model has the clear potential to impact on the terms on which sub-postmasters operate sub-post offices and on the terms and working arrangements of their staff. The changed physical working arrangements in the open-plan office envisaged by the pilot also carry implications for the safety and well-being of staff members. These must be taken fully into consideration. The range of services on offer under the pilot is restricted to core services, which means that customers needing to access more time-consuming or complex transactions will need to go to a main post office.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="110316128000077"></a>The report does not envisage restrictions being imposed on which services may be regarded as core by a local post office, and which may be dispensed with. Therefore, the local model has the potential to threaten the existence of the universal postal service by concentrating an increasing number of services in main post offices. Over time, this would mean that a higher percentage of the population would have to travel further to access the full range of post office services. The problem is likely to be particularly acute in rural areas where the distance to a main post office is likely to be greater.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="110316128000078"></a>It is also clear that a network of 4,000 main post offices and 2,000 new locals would leave more than 5,500 branches untouched. However, the BIS paper states that under POL's commercial strategy the local model,</p>
<ul><a name="110316128000144"></a>"will become the mainstay of the smaller post offices over time".</ul>
<p><a name="110316128000118"></a>This would mean a fundamental change to the current network; I hope that the Minister will address this key point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="110316128000079"></a>Amendment 22C calls for the development of access criteria to ensure an even distribution of main post offices across the country in order to maintain fair access and to ensure that communities are not disadvantaged by the network changes planned by the Government. Amendment 22E inserts another new clause that calls on the Secretary of State to review the range of services that will be offered by post offices, including services for the collection of vehicle excise duty and facilities for purchasing television licences. It also calls on the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament, at least once a year, a report on what services should be provided by post offices.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="110316128000080"></a>In conclusion, I urge support for Amendments 22A, 22C and 22E in order to prevent any further erosion in the post office network, in terms of both size and levels of service provision.</p>

<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="110316128000081"></a><b><a name="110316-0002.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="110316128000175"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> My Lords, these amendments seek to strengthen the current access criteria so that they match current post office network coverage, and to enshrine them in legislation, as well as to provide mechanisms to review these criteria. They also seek to specify the services which should be provided across the network and in which locations a full range of services is to be provided.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="110316128000082"></a>On Amendment 22A in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, the Government are committed to maintaining a nationwide post office network. The Post Office is required to provide a network of at least 11,500 branches. This is a legally binding commitment to a minimum number of post offices. The Government have made a commitment that there will be no programme of post office closures.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="110316128000083"></a>Post Office Ltd is also legally obliged to ensure that precisely the same access criteria introduced by the previous Government are maintained. The previous Government, of course, had the opportunity to put these criteria into legislation in their 2009 Postal Services Bill, but they did not see the need to do so. Indeed, during debate on the 2009 Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, observed that the access criteria were "very stringent". By legally obliging the Post Office to maintain these criteria in return for the £1.34 billon of funding over the duration of the spending review period, this Government have introduced another safeguard to ensure that these stringent access criteria will still be met. In fact, Post Office Ltd continues to exceed these criteria. Last year's report by Postcomm on the post office network, from which I believe the criteria in this amendment are derived, demonstrates this fact.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="110316128000084"></a>The amendment seeks to press the metaphorical pause button, to prevent any changes in the post office network from today's position. However, this is unrealistic; 97 per cent of post offices are privately owned and operated, and there will always be changes in the network where, for example, sub-postmasters retire or move on to pastures new. It is not through regulation that we will save the post office network. To ensure that the Post Office has a vibrant future, it must be allowed to develop, to modernise and to evolve. It must focus on its customers, reaching out to new customers and winning back those who have drifted  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_298"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>away. Major modernisation is needed in order to address the underlying economics of the network. That is what our £1.34 billion funding package will achieve.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="110316128000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Young, raised the issue of the new Post Office local model. I will come back to that in detail later this evening during the debate on Amendment 24EA in the name of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, which will be moved by the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="110316128000086"></a>The Post Office's access criteria are the strongest that we know of in Europe, when you consider our safeguards for rural, urban and urban deprived areas. In Germany, for example, the requirement is for a post office every 80 square kilometres, whereas we mandate that 95 per cent of the rural population must be within three miles of the nearest post office. The £1.34 billion that we are providing will ensure that our network continues to thrive in the future.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="110316128000087"></a>Subsection (2) of the proposed new clause in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, seeks to ensure that certain services are provided across the network. Let me reassure the noble Lord that the Government are absolutely committed to maintaining the network, and supporting Post Office Ltd as it seeks to win new business from government and other sources. The Post Office is determined to become a front office for government, by developing and applying services in a number of ways. There is continued progress on this agenda. For example, the Department for Work and Pensions has recently announced plans for three new pilots, opportunities to support the universal credit reforms, and funding set aside for credit unions that will increase opportunities for the Post Office to deliver credit union services to many more people.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="110316128000088"></a>An important part of restructuring the network will be for the Post Office to ensure that services are tailored to meet the needs of its customers up and down the country. We cannot, and should not, expect the Post Office to provide all its 170 services at all branches across the entire network, as this amendment seeks to achieve. In smaller branches, for example, it makes far better commercial sense for sub-postmasters and sub-postmisstresses to focus on the key services that most people need to use, most of the time. Of course, the services offered by the Post Office on behalf of local authorities may differ from area to area. Amendment 22C, in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Young, Lord Stevenson and Lord Tunnicliffe, does indeed take this fact into account. That amendment seeks a register of access criteria to be issued by the Secretary of State setting out the minimum location and geographical distribution of post offices which provide the full range of services provided by post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="110316128000089"></a>As I have just pointed out, Post Office Ltd must ensure that services are tailored to meet the demands of its customers. It must also negotiate its contracts on a commercial basis with a range of different clients. We want the Post Office to be able to provide the best possible service to the widest possible range of customers. We do not think that fettering its ability to agree the appropriate level of network coverage to the service would best serve that goal.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_299"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="110316128000090"></a>The best people to develop new services, or improvements to existing ones, are the staff and management of Post Office Ltd. That applies whether we are talking about mail services, telephony, financial services or services on behalf of a range of central and local government institutions. They are the people with the appropriate commercial expertise and experience, and who know the Post Office's customers best. That is why the Post Office is set up to be at arm's length from government rather than run from an office in Whitehall.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="110316128000091"></a>The Post Office is run by a management team with extensive commercial experience under the effective leadership of Paula Vennells, the Post Office's managing director. Paula became managing director in April 2010, before which she spent three years as the Post Office's network director and chief operating officer, having previously been commercial director of Whitbread plc. Her blend of skills and experience give her a powerful focus on the Post Office's unique social purpose and the commercial challenges it faces. On separation from Royal Mail, Paula Vennells will be the chief executive of a Post Office board bolstered by the appointment of a new chairman, a process which is under way. These reasons are why it is also appropriate for the Post Office itself to report annually on the range of services provided at its post offices, as required by Clause 11, rather than a report being produced by the Secretary of State, as would be required by Amendment 22E.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="110316128000092"></a>One particular example of where Post Office Ltd has been flexible in negotiating contracts is through its relationship with the DVLA for car licensing services. Post Office Ltd works with the DVLA to decide the broad national distribution of branches which should offer this service in order to ensure that there is good national accessibility for a customer group which, by definition, is mobile. The DVLA limits the number of post office branches which provide its services to ensure that delivery of the service is cost-effective. Were the service to be extended to all branches, there would be a significant loss of income to those branches currently offering the service and this could adversely affect their viability.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="110316128000093"></a>I reassure your Lordships again that the Government are committed to being a responsible owner of Post Office Ltd. We are fully aware of the value of the post office network, of the social and economic role it plays, and of its key importance to communities up and down the country. That is why we have made a commitment that there will be no programme of closures on our watch. There will continue to be at least 11,500 post offices across the network and our funding will enable the Post Office to do much more than simply maintain the status quo.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="110316128000094"></a>However, the Post Office must be allowed to be flexible and to respond to the needs of both its clients and its customers, or we will see the network wither rather than thrive. With these reassurances, I ask the noble Lord to consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

I think she overcharacterised this amendment  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_300"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as too rigid. It does not say that every post office should have the whole range of services, nor does it say that the access criteria can never be altered. By this amendment, I was trying to establish whether the commitment to the 11,500 post offices is an absolute commitment or whether there is some headroom in the criteria. The noble Baroness has made it absolutely clear on several occasions tonight that the commitment is to a network of 11,500, although that is not to say that one or two might change location and quite a few might change the services that they offer and the sub-postmaster or mistress who runs them might change. You need that flexibility.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="110316128000096"></a>My remaining anxiety is that, although I recognise that different levels of post office would have different gradations of services, we have to allow some flexibility and some change over time as the market develops, particularly in the growth businesses. It is also important that there is some criterion for the distance to main post offices which cover the whole range of services. I think the noble Baroness said that in addition to the general criteria in relation to post office outlets, there would be some criteria about the maximum distance that people were from a main post office, or a post office-different terms are used-which offered pretty much the whole range of services. If she said that, that is more reassurance.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="110316128000097"></a>We have a number of things on the record, including the Government's very clear commitment to the size of the network. I hope that within that there is not a serious diminution in the range of services which a large part of the network offers, and I certainly hope that the distance to main post offices is taken up. Subject to that, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment at this stage.</p>

It also provides for a longer consultation process for potential closures in rural and urban deprived areas. Rural and urban deprived areas clearly suffer disproportionately when a post office closes. Post offices have closed in vast numbers in recent years, both through formal closure programmes and through natural wastage when sub-postmasters close their businesses and post offices are not replaced.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="110316128000100"></a>Over the past 10 years, the post office network has declined from 17,845 in 2000-01 to 11,905 in 2009-10. This is, in large part, due to two major closure programmes, the Urban Network Reinvention programme from 2003 to 2005 and the Network Change programme from 2007 to 2009. Between them, these programmes resulted in the closure of 4,854 post offices. That means that more than 1,000 post offices have closed outside of those programmes as sub-postmasters leave, often because their post offices have ceased to be viable, and the Post Office is unable or unwilling to provide a replacement.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="110316128000101"></a>Approximately 11 per cent of the post office network is in urban-deprived areas. As Consumer Focus clearly states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="110316128000138"></a>"Urban offices play an even more important role in urban deprived areas, particularly as they provide free access to cash, plus pensions and benefit payments".</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="110316128000102"></a>The 2003-04 Urban Network Reinvention programme was an attempt by Post Office Ltd to reduce the size of the network with a view to developing a more commercially viable network. It further hoped to manage the so far unplanned decline in network size that was arising from sub-postmasters' decisions to close their businesses. At the time of the programme, there were serious concerns over the fate of post offices in urban deprived areas. The Government stated that they would not close post offices in urban deprived areas unless there was another branch within half a mile or unless there were exceptional circumstances to justify the closure.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="110316128000103"></a>The Post Office was heavily criticised at the time due to its lack of adequate consultation. As the then Trade and Industry Committee concluded in its report on the programme:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="110316128000139"></a>"Post Office Ltd and Postwatch paid insufficient attention to the need to ensure that adequate consultation procedures were in place before the network reinvention programme began. Although improvements have subsequently been made, and while we understand that sub-postmasters could appreciate a speedy conclusion to consultations over the future of their branches, we think that it is vital that all stakeholders should be given the time and opportunity to present their views on closure proposals. A twelve week consultation period would have satisfied this requirement. It was inconsistent of the Government to allow a company of which it is the sole shareholder to ignore guidelines for consultation which it encourages other organisations to follow".</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="110316128000104"></a>Equally, the 2007-09 Network Change programme was an attempt to reduce the size of the network with a view to making it economically viable. Over an 18-month period, more than 2,500 post offices were closed and a further 500 were replaced by outreach services. Outreach services provide postal services to communities where a post office is not deemed to be  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_302"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 302</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>viable. These are often in the form of a mobile post office, a van which visits communities at certain designated times each week and provides a core range of post office services. There are now 772 outreach services in the UK, making up 6 per cent of the post office network.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="110316128000105"></a>The Network Change programme was also heavily criticised due to the difficulty stakeholders had in influencing closure decisions. Research into the programme by Consumer Focus found that,</p>
<ul><a name="110316128000145"></a>"consumers were not convinced by the UK Government's reasons for the closure programme. Furthermore, they were very unhappy with the nature of area consultations on closures, as there was little scope to alter decisions and Post Office Ltd had not been seen to respond to concerns raised".</ul>
<a name="110316-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="110316128000106"></a>The Post Office's code of practice for the Network Change programme closure consultations included a six-week consultation process. Many stakeholders felt that the consultation processes were inadequate. This was, in large part, because the criteria for closures and the decision to close 2,500 post offices had already been made prior to the consultation process. This meant that opportunities for preventing individual closures were very limited.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="110316128000107"></a>Post offices are still closing every week. More than 150 post offices closed on a long-term temporary basis in 2010 alone. There is no guarantee that they will reopen and many are likely to stay closed indefinitely. As Consumer Focus has said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="110316128000140"></a>"Since the last programme of post office closures finished we have continued to see a dwindling in the overall number of branches".</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="110316128000108"></a>According to the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, 900 post offices, an unusually high number, are currently up for sale. Many sub-postmasters are retiring or leaving the business because of the low levels of revenue generated in sub-post offices and the Post Office is struggling to find alternative premises and service providers.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="110316128000109"></a>It is vital that adequate protections are in place to protect rural and urban deprived communities from these closures. I urge support for Amendment 22B which ensures consultation ahead of any post office closure, planned or unplanned, and provides additional protection to rural and urban deprived post offices. I beg to move.</p>

An annual report on the Post Office network laid before Parliament is an important means of achieving transparency around the Post Office network. The statutory requirement in Clause 11 to lay such a report before Parliament already goes further than the current requirement in the Postal Services Act 2000, which requires only information about the number and location of post offices and their accessibility. Neither Government nor Post Office Ltd can ensure that no post offices close during the reporting period, nor can they ensure that there is always time to carry out a consultation before an office closes. For example, a sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress may retire or move away, or the premises may be damaged by fire or flooding. After all, 97 per cent of post offices are privately owned and privately operated businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="110316128000111"></a>Other than in exceptional circumstances, Post Office Ltd will always seek to maintain service provision including outreach or community options. If permanent closure without any replacement is proposed, the Post Office must undertake a local consultation in line with the code of practice agreed with Consumer Focus. Indeed, that code has recently been updated and now includes a number of significant benefits for consumers with specific protections which will require Post Office Ltd to keep local representatives better informed in cases where the branch does not reopen for a significant period. It will, for example, allow consumers to use a telephone helpline to find out about temporary breaks in service and, for the first time, see Post Office Ltd notifying those customers who respond to consultations with substantive comments of the relevant decisions made following the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="110316128000112"></a>Post Office Ltd will now, as a matter of fact, also contact local and parish councillors about proposed service changes to provision in the area. That will be an important means of putting local communities in the driving seat, empowering them to work more closely with the Post Office to develop services which respond to local needs and priorities. In view of these reassurances regarding the number of post offices that must be maintained and the information included in the report, as well as the revised code of practice, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Young, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="110316132000001"></a><b><a name="110316-0002.htm_spnew31"></a><a name="110316132000161"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> My Lords, this is an important debate. I start by declaring my own interest as a director of the Wise Group in Glasgow. I have no pecuniary interest but the purpose that I am afforded by being a director of the Wise Group is that, four times a year, I get to go on a wet Friday to Glasgow after a six-hour train journey. Nevertheless, it is very fulfilling and important work. The group does an excellent job for the communities that it serves in Glasgow and I am pleased to be associated with it. That explains my interest in this important subject.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="110316132000002"></a>The background to this debate is, quite simply, that after considerable consultation the disability organisations-most of which colleagues will know well, as we have been working with them for many years-have concluded through the Disability Benefits Consortium that these regulations imperfectly achieve their policy objective. That is a clear steer that the disability community would like the House to consider annulling these regulations and we owe them nothing less than to do that.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="110316132000003"></a>I start by acknowledging the work of the Minister, who has brought drive and commitment to this policy area since he wrote his original report those few years ago. I am absolutely at one with him in trying to discourage inactivity and encourage sustaining work. I think we both understand that Carol Black's work changed the game of active labour markets and I stand four-square with him in trying to make sure that we can develop and deliver schemes that enable people to get out of inactivity and into work. That work has to be productive and sustainable, but if they can do that then the well-being of the client group that we are seeking to serve will improve.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="110316132000004"></a>I am founding the evidence for this evening's debate on the excellent work that has been done, as I say every time we talk about the subject, both by the Social Security Advisory Committee and by the Merits Committee, which looked at this in very great detail in its 23rd report. These are complicated regulations but if any colleagues are looking for a quick summary of exactly where this subject's importance lies and of its importance to the individuals concerned, they should look at appendix 1 of that report and the evidence that was laid out there compellingly. The Social Security Advisory Committee report that was produced, which was done with formal reference to these regulations, also repays careful study and is worth reading.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="110316132000005"></a>I start with a concern that is new to me and disturbing if true. I would like to hear the Minister's view on it. The SSAC says, in its conclusions at paragraph 19:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="110316132000134"></a>"The Committee is concerned that there is a disagreement of substance between the Department and the external stakeholders who participated in the review as to whether the",</p>

<p><a name="110316132000122"></a>work capability assessment,</p>
<ul><a name="110316132000143"></a>"in its present form could be said to be working satisfactorily".</ul>
<p><a name="110316132000123"></a>If that is true and the stakeholder community is talking past the department and neither party tries to get back into some sort of meaningful communication, it is in no one's interests. I do not know what happened in the past but that is the first time I have ever seen an SSAC report saying anything so stark. I do not know whether it is true but I would like an assurance that the Minister will redouble any of the efforts which I know  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_305"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he has been making to ensure that that gap is expeditiously closed. It would be inimical to the interests of the client group that we are trying to help if the pressure group community does not have confidence in its channels of communication with the department. I hope that he can give us that reassurance.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="110316132000006"></a>The other evidence which is the core of the debate is the Social Security Advisory Committee's view at paragraph 4.3. I will quote another sentence which encapsulates a whole load of evidence that I do not have time to go into. Perhaps other colleagues might pursue that, particularly on mental health, learning disability and fluctuating conditions. After a very big consultation-I think it had 400 responses-the committee noted that the department is undertaking an ongoing programme of review but concluded, among other things:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="110316132000135"></a>"There appears to be a widespread perception that, overall, rather than simplifying, streamlining and refining the test, these amendments",</p>

<p><a name="110316132000124"></a>in these regulations,</p>
<ul><a name="110316132000144"></a>"will make it harder in practice for claimants to demonstrate that they are incapable of work or that they have limited capacity for work or work-related activity".</ul>
<p><a name="110316132000007"></a>That is the core of my concern, which the department now has to address. As I say, I am absolutely indebted to the Social Security Advisory Committee and the Merits Committee, as we all are. Indeed, Richard Tilt, the chairman of the former committee, is an extremely wise man and his experience will, I hope, be available to us for some time to come.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="110316132000008"></a>Briefly stated, this is one of the biggest changes that I have ever seen in social security since I started studying this policy area when I was elected to another place in 1983. Why? Because in April we will open the door to a national reassessment of 2.6 million people. We have a model which arguably does not work for employment and support allowance claimants yet. It is a work in progress, but I am absolutely persuaded that Parliament is trying its best to get on top of it. However if in April we are really considering taking on an extra 10,000 or 11,000 new cases each week-it might be each month, but whichever-it is a very big increase and raises questions about capacity. We have to consider the capacity of the Atos Healthcare medical professionals who do these functional capability assessments for work capability assessments, and it raises questions about capacity for jobseeker's allowance as well.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="110316132000009"></a>There is a huge difference between a customer making an application de novo for employment and support allowance and somebody in Glasgow who has been unemployed for 10 years, who has been on incapacity benefit, and who gets a letter asking him to call at the Atos Healthcare professional centre to have his benefit assessed. He will know that if he does not get the continuing levels of support that he currently enjoys he could be £30 per week worse off at a stroke.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="110316132000010"></a>I go back to where I came in. I am absolutely in favour of ensuring that everybody who can contribute to the world of work should do so. There is no doubt in anybody's mind that there are people who need a wake-up call, to use the expression of my American  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_306"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>friends. Indeed, there are people who swing the lead, do not play the game and act in bad faith. I know all these things. However, to take 2.6 million over three years and put them through a process where the model has not been absolutely rigorously road-tested to everybody's satisfaction is not safe. That is the case that the disability organisations have been making to me.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="110316132000011"></a>If that is not hard enough we have the deficit reduction programme, which I also support. We cannot ignore the fact that this country is now poorer than it was a while ago. There are also regional and spatial dimensions because labour markets vary. The labour market in Reading is very different from that in downtown Glasgow, which must be borne in mind. On top of that, the work programme, which again I support, is still in gestation. We do not know the detail of how the work programme will serve the client group that we are seeking to help. I think that the identified concerns about the functional capability assessment-it is not a medical assessment-are well founded. If anybody has any doubt that there are problems around it, I point out that the successful appeal rate against decisions on the current scheme is high, suggesting that attention must be paid to these provisions, particularly for mental health and fluctuating condition clients.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="110316132000012"></a>There are advantages in the regulations. I certainly welcome the chemotherapy and residential drug changes. They are not to be diminished in any way because they will help substantially the group that they are designed to serve. The biggest complaint comes from the disability stakeholder pressure group community. Professor Harrington has published his phase 1 report, which is truly an excellent piece of work. It offers a series of recommendations which really deal in a much more real-world way with the kind of problems that people face. The complaint is that we are not waiting for the totality of the Harrington work to be put in place. He is already starting on the second annual independent assessment, where he will look at the descriptors for fluctuating circumstances and the like. The results of that will be available probably in late 2011. We should not be opening the gate to the national reassessment of incapacity benefit claimants until we see what Professor Harrington can come up with. That is what the disability organisations say and it is a prima facie valid claim.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="110316132000013"></a>Colleagues will know this because we spent a lot of time on the Welfare Reform Act 2007, when the previous Government sensibly required a five-year annual set of reviews. Some of the complaints that the disability groups make is that this will be a piecemeal change, which is the legislators' fault. We rightly felt that it was not safe to do it without getting independent reviews. The previous Government were right to do that and this Government were right to get Professor Harrington on the case. He brings hope to the whole situation-he certainly does to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="110316132000014"></a>I have three questions for my noble friend before I sit down. They are all about Harrington phase 1. First, if that report were in place in its totality before the April rollout of the national reassessment-all of it, including its tone-that would be of signal reassurance to me, if to no one else. I am speaking this evening for  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_307"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>no one but myself. Secondly, the key recommendation that leapt out of the page of the Harrington phase 1 report was the fact that decision-makers were not properly shouldering the responsibility that the scheme was designed to give them. They were rubber-stamping Atos Healthcare professional decisions because they had not seen the client. The functional assessments were allegedly done by healthcare professionals, so why would you want to change anything? The system was never designed to do that. Can my noble friend give me a clear understanding that Harrington phase 1 will be available by 1 April? Decision-makers should have much more discretion, which would take them back to the position of the old adjudication officers whom we abandoned in 1998 and who were much more independent of the department than arguably some of these decision-makers. Can we get them to use a little grey-cell common sense on what is in front of them? That would be of considerable assistance.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="110316132000015"></a>Communication between the system and the clients is essential. Harrington again fundamentally points out that communication is not yet adequate. Nobody going through the process should have to do it without direct access to the recommendations of the Atos Healthcare professional after the work capability assessment. I do not think that that happens properly now but that information should be shared, and shared with the decision-maker as well. If the results were communicated to people, it would improve things enormously.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="110316132000016"></a>Finally, the client should be encouraged not just to bring his own medical evidence to the work capability assessment but to make it available to the decision-maker. If the decision-maker has, say, a GP report, he is taking more responsibility and discretion for the decision and he is communicating that clearly to the client. We still have fluctuating circumstances and conditions to deal with, which has not been addressed yet, so that would not be dealt with in my suggestions. Speaking for myself, I hope that my noble friend can give assurances that the seriousness of the situation is being fully comprehended and accommodated in departmental thinking and that Harrington phase 1 will be in place without peradventure before the reassessment starts. If some of the Harrington recommendations are highlighted in the way I have suggested, I certainly think that there would be some reassurance in the disability community that the situation is not as unsafe as it suspects. I hope that the Minister can help by explaining the situation later in the debate this evening. I beg to move.</p>

Like me, and other noble Lords I see present, he has been involved in issues concerning the employment and support allowance and the WCA for a long period. The noble Lord congratulated the former Government on insisting on the annual reviews. If memory serves, that may have been an amendment that he pressed on us at the time.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="110316132000018"></a>I start by explaining my understanding of the rationale of why the work capability assessment and the employment and support allowance were introduced.  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_308"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It was part of the journey which recognised the importance of work for people's route out of poverty, their self-esteem, well-being and health. The concept was that, for the vast majority, work, or good work, is good for you and that, as a society, we should support people to get into or closer to the labour market. I think that that is common ground between the previous Government and the current one.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="110316132000019"></a>As we know, the work capability assessment was designed to focus on a person's capability, rather than their incapacity, as a building block to help them progress, where appropriate, towards work. The switch from incapacity benefit to employment and support allowance was more than just semantics. Although support via Pathways was available before, the introduction of the WCA signalled a determined change to support those who could towards the labour market.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="110316132000020"></a>The approach seeks to identify three groups of people: those considered capable of work; those who could work at some point with the right support-the work-related activity group; and those who cannot or should not be expected to work. The concept is to make those determinations by reference to application and a range of descriptors with the objective of determining an individual's functional capability.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="110316132000021"></a>There is nothing in the documents that we have received from the stakeholders that calls into question that fundamental approach; and I doubt whether we will hear it called into question by noble Lords this evening. Indeed, the first independent review of the WCA by Professor Malcolm Harrington concluded that the principles underpinning the new assessment remain valid. He stated his belief that the system is not broken or beyond repair; that, at least, is reassuring.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="110316132000022"></a>We should acknowledge and welcome the fact that the introduction of WCA has been subject to review-the internal DWP review began in March 2009-and it is the recommendations from that review which, I understand, are reflected in the regulations. Professor Harrington's independent review, the first required under the Welfare Reform Act 2007, was responded to by the Government in November 2010. It was accepted as a vital contribution to the continuing development of the WCA, and the recommendations were accepted in full.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="110316132000023"></a>Although most of the recommendations were to do with process and covered customer experience, the Atos assessment, the decision-making process and the appeals process, there were important recommendations concerning descriptors-in particular, the need for further work to review the mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors and how they are working for those with fluctuating conditions-issues which were raised at the start of the process and which have continued as the ESA has progressed. We support the recommendations, but that raises the question of how they sit alongside the outcome of the internal review, which has caused some of the challenges about which we will hear tonight.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="110316132000024"></a>The Government's response to Professor Harrington's report indicated that they would await a further report on mental health descriptors in late December and early January. Where does that report rest? Why is it  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_309"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considered appropriate to proceed with the current changes to the descriptors without the benefit of that report?</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="110316132000025"></a>The criticism of the regulations has come from a range of sources, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. They variously cover the points that the review has been carried out too early with limited evidence; that recommendations from the statutory review-Professor Harrington's review-are still being worked on; and that changes to descriptors will make it more difficult to identify those with limited capability for work, those who should be in the work-related activity component.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="110316132000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee. It recommended that certain changes be postponed, stating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="110316132000136"></a>"The Committee recommends that the Department does not proceed with the remaining proposed changes to the descriptors until these have been reconsidered in the light of the findings of the independent review of the WCA and the experience of the trial of the migration of IB customers to ESA".</p>

<p><a name="110316132000125"></a>Why has the department not taken that path?</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="110316132000027"></a>Mind, and others, has raised concerns about the regulations regarding mental health descriptors. They extend to the simplification of the assessment, reducing the mental function descriptors by a third, from 10 to seven questions. Is that at the expense of comprehensiveness rather than in unison with it? There are deep concerns about how well the WCA descriptors record the impact of mental health issues. The simplification of the descriptors will exacerbate the problem.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="110316132000028"></a>Assessment of an individual's awareness of hazards will now simply focus on the need for supervision, rather than the significance and frequency of the risk posed. Ability to get about and cope with change will no longer be assessed in terms of frequency, which will impact negatively on people with variable or fluctuating conditions. The loss of the propriety behaviour descriptor means that the assessment fails to capture the significant distress caused to people with depression, anxiety and paranoia by misinterpreting or overreacting to the behaviour of others.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="110316132000029"></a>The National Autistic Society has expressed similar concerns about reducing the 10 mental health descriptors to seven. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="110316132000137"></a>"This reduces opportunities for people to score sufficient points to receive the benefit. Five descriptors which specifically address the needs of people with autism have been reduced to 2. The lower-scoring elements of several descriptors have been removed, and many have been simplified. This makes it much harder to represent the complexity of needs many people with autism experience, and barriers to employment they face, through the assessment".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="110316132000030"></a>Doubtless, noble Lords will also have read the brief from the Disability Benefits Consortium, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. It asserts:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="110316132000138"></a>"An individual who 'cannot mount or descend two steps even with the support of a handrail' could now be classed 'fit for work' ... Someone unable to stand at a workstation for more than ten minutes could now be deemed 'fit for work'... The descriptors for turning star headed sink tap have been removed, consequently there is no functional assessment for the ability to turn or rotate

The changes remove all lower-level descriptors in some categories, for example, there are now no six point descriptors within manual dexterity, making it hard for people with multiple impairments to qualify".</p>

<p><a name="110316132000127"></a>The noble Lord may not be able to deal with each of those points tonight, but those are genuine, practical, real issues raised by people who know. If they are right, that clearly undermines the thrust of the assessment, which we agree that we should be making.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="110316132000031"></a>We should have common cause in getting the descriptors and the process right. The Government must convince us that they have not jumped the gun on these changes and answer the searching questions raised by the various lobby groups, which will doubtless be raised further tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="110316132000032"></a>We look forward to receiving the Minister's reply on these issues. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, has initiated a very important debate, because these issues have run with the WCA and the employment and support allowance from day one. I believe progress is being made and certainly can be made, but there is some way to go yet.</p>

I also associate myself with the words of my noble friend Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope. I concur both with his concerns and with his support for the need to enable as many people with a disability as possible who have not worked or have not worked for a long time to be assisted into appropriate work through an appropriate process that takes account not just of what they cannot do but of what they can do.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="110316132000034"></a>Among the many disability charities which consider this statutory instrument to be premature due to the as yet incomplete recommendations of the Harrington report is, as the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, has mentioned, the National Autistic Society, of which I am a vice-president. I would like to focus on the concerns for people on the autistic spectrum. In order to qualify for the ESA in a work-related activity group, people have to be assessed to have gained more than 15 points. The way in which it is currently proposed to change the descriptors, as we have already heard, has a detrimental impact on people on the autistic spectrum. I remind the Minister that it was only last Thursday at Oral Questions that I asked him to confirm that the Government accept that autism is a communication disorder.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="110316132000035"></a>The descriptors take no account of communication difficulties, verbal or non-verbal, due to mental impairment. This is a major omission. Communication and comprehension are essential in the workplace, and it is a critical area of impairment for people with autism. Making oneself understood is covered only by a physical descriptor, descriptor 6. Unless guidance clearly states that this covers people who find it difficult to communicate due to a non-physical disability such as autism or a learning disability, these needs will not be recognised in the assessment. Noble Lords will understand my concern that already I am looking at areas where autistic people should be given a point on  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_311"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that descriptor scale, but getting them to reach the 15 points, if appropriate, is already excluding those areas where they will be in some considerable difficulty. Understanding and comprehension impairments are covered only due to a sensory impairment under descriptor 7, where the emphasis is on aids used by those with hearing or visual impairment.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="110316132000036"></a>The wording of the descriptor itself is vague; it is based on an ability to complete "two sequential personal actions" in the context of planning, organisation, and problem-solving. People on the autistic spectrum-even those with honours degrees and high IQs-always struggle with planning, organisation and problem-solving. It is too broad to be meaningful and leaves too much scope for interpretation to accompanying guidance. For people with autism, this may vary from turning on the tap and wetting their hands within the process of washing their hands, or getting ready for work and then making their own way to the workplace. For many, doing that unassisted will be a major challenge.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="110316132000037"></a>The National Autistic Society is also very concerned about changes to descriptor 17. It has been simplified to make the wording clearer, but it has become overly simplistic. Someone who frequently has uncontrollable episodes of aggressive or disinhibited behaviour, particularly when under pressure or in an environment with which they are really not familiar-that sort of behaviour would be unreasonable in any workplace due to cognitive impairment or mental disorder-cannot realistically be assessed as not having limited capability for work. As the proposals stand, we do not believe that employers would accept as employees people who the descriptors would deem as capable for work, but showed those sorts of behavioural problems in the workplace.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="110316132000038"></a>People with autism may exhibit behaviour which does not meet the minimum criteria set out in this new descriptor 17, but which would cause disruption in the workplace. For example, people will flap, hum or spin. I know of one person who, in a stressful situation in the workplace, would make cat noises as a sort of comforter in order to exclude the distress going around him. There is a limit to how long those working with people like that will put up with somebody making cat noises on a continuous basis in a busy office. These are all regarded as individual or rather quirky, but they are very real parts of their disability.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="110316132000039"></a>I say to my noble friend that there is genuine concern about the speed with which these changes are being brought in, ahead of what Professor Harrington is saying.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="110316132000040"></a>I mentioned that I am the named carer for a person on severe disablement allowance. This allowance, which comes within this legislation, is a very old disability benefit; it was something often given to young adults and adolescents who, having come out of full-time education, were at that time assessed and deemed not able to apply for paid employment. I would not even want to exclude them from the new opportunities for employment as disabled people, but-and I particularly refer to learning disability, mental health and autism-many of them are now getting on a bit because they were awarded this some years ago. Some of them will be in their 30s and 40s or even older and for many of

It has been a long journey and there has been a lot of input to get these people where they are today. But their situation is always going to be fragile, and there is nothing that I can see in the way these assessments are made to take account of what is at the moment a sustainable situation, as far as independent living is concerned. We must not put too many demands on them, however, and ensure that the process associated with it does not give them some form of detriment as a result. As my noble friend Lord Kirkwood mentioned, they might lose money, which is a very important part of their life and allows them to be able to plan and be secure with their finances.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="110316132000041"></a>There is another form of detriment. People may find that their self-confidence is shattered after it has taken years to build up; they may find that they can no longer cope with independent living of one sort of another as a result of being put through a process which undermines that stability. You cannot put a price on that detriment. I say cautiously to my noble friend who I know is sympathetic to these issues, please do not let this Government cause detriment to those vulnerable people.</p>

<a name="110316132000042"></a><b><a name="110316-0002.htm_spnew34"></a><a name="110316132000164"></a>Baroness Hollins:</b> My Lords, I am very pleased to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Browning. I, too, will begin by declaring a personal interest. My 38 year-old son, who has a learning disability, was well described by the noble Baroness towards the end of her speech. He is always being assessed for what he cannot do and not for what he can do, which is incredibly demoralising for him. We his family spend our time trying to help him succeed and he would really like a job.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="110316132000043"></a>Some years ago, when I was consulted as president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists on the development of a work capability test, I suggested that the focus should be on capability, not lack of capability, from the point of view of the person being assessed. Although this is called a work capability assessment, it is an assessment of incapability.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="110316132000044"></a>I understand that, as my son is in receipt of severe disablement allowance, he may be required to undergo a work capability assessment. I tried out the online work capability self-assessment to see how he would fare. I will not go into the details but, of the three possible outcomes that we have heard about, he fell into the third category and would not be required, according to my assessment, to undertake any work-related activity. Perhaps that is a relief to me, in that his finances might not change, but I am sure that it would be a huge disappointment to him if that was the case.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="110316132000045"></a>So far that might be fine, except that the assessor may come to a different decision, in part perhaps because of my son's lack of insight or understanding of his difficulties. He might then have to undergo an appeal and not everyone has the stomach for, or the capability for, an appeal. My reaction to trying out the test was that there is some sensitivity in the mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors but probably insufficient sensitivity in the questions which relate to the type of complex difficulties that my son faces in his wish to be part of the workforce. They are difficulties  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_313"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which would require focused and sustained support to enable him to obtain work-related activity. The last thing that I or any parent in my position wants is for my son to fail yet another assessment, especially one which emphasises what he cannot do.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="110316132000046"></a>Another concern is that, if the assessment finds that he is capable, he is then given insufficient support, which would do terrible things to his self-worth and self-esteem. I question whether this assessment has been adequately road-tested and would want to avoid even one disabled person and his or her family having to face unnecessary appeals or loss of income through being unwilling to face yet another appeal. Even participating in the process of this assessment could be detrimental to the person's mental heath.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="110316132000047"></a>My noble friend Lord Rix shares my concerns and has asked me to express his support to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, today and to give his apologies as he is unable to contribute to this debate owing to family illness. He believes that many people with a learning disability will be denied vital support to help get them into work if they are not found eligible for employment and support allowance. That mirrors my concern. My noble friend believes that the crude indicators used in the regulations must be changed to more accurately reflect an individual's capabilities.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="110316132000048"></a>For example, my noble friend is deeply concerned about the merging of the three descriptors-"memory and concentration", "execution of tasks" and "initiating and sustaining personal action"-into one. They have been replaced with just one descriptor, "Initiating and completing personal action". According to the regulations, this,</p>
<ul><a name="110316132000145"></a>"means planning, organisation, problem solving, prioritising or switching tasks.</ul>
<p><a name="110316132000128"></a>The removal of the descriptor titled "execution of tasks" means that the time taken to complete a task will not be included as part of the assessment. This is particularly relevant to people with a learning disability and is likely to be a significant barrier to employment.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="110316132000049"></a>The current system already fails to meet the needs of people with a learning disability. My noble friend Lord Rix suggests that these regulations do not effectively assess limited capability for work, which means that the additional barriers and support needs of people with a learning disability are not being fully recognised in the assessment.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="110316132000050"></a>With less than 7 per cent of people with a learning disability who are known to social services being in any form of paid employment, the barriers to finding a job, combined with deep-rooted prejudice and discrimination, are already significant. Is it too much to ask that a coalition Government who claim to put fairness at the heart of their decisions should seek to tackle some of these barriers instead of perhaps making them even more difficult to overcome? For this reason alone, I and my noble friend Lord Rix, call for these regulations to be annulled.</p>

In one corner older people are still going out to work, and in another corner people with disabilities are going about their business with the replacement DLA. But at the moment the pieces of the jig-saw are all jumbled up on the table, perhaps with the Minister frantically trying to find the straight edges. Are these regulations the pieces with the straight edges or not? I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Kirkwood for giving us the opportunity to discuss these regulations because there are some disturbingly divergent views, as we have heard most movingly this evening.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="110316132000052"></a>The Merits Committee has said that the regulations may imperfectly achieve their policy objective, which is not something that it says at all frequently. In particular, it encourages the House to seek further information from the DWP on the rationale for putting these regulations forward now. It will not be disappointed, as all noble Lords have raised this matter. This is a recurring theme in all the evidence that we have been sent, from the CAB to the disability benefits consortium.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="110316132000053"></a>There is puzzlement that the DWP wants to bring in these changes now for several reasons. The principal reasons are: that the data from the migration trials from incapacity benefit in Aberdeen and Burnley have not yet been evaluated; that we are expecting more changes to the descriptors and to the work capability assessment as a whole once Professor Harrington has published his second-year review; and that the bar is thought by some groups to have been raised so high that there is now hardly any difference between those in the employment group of ESA, which comprises the limited capability for work people, and the support group, which is the limited capability for work-related activity people.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="110316132000054"></a>The Social Security Advisory Committee is more forthright because looking at DWP regulations and commenting on them is its job. It says, as we have heard, that apart from a few changes which it welcomes, the department should not proceed with the remaining proposed changes to the descriptors in the WCA until they have been reconsidered in the light of the findings of the Harrington report into the WCA and the migration trial of IB claimants. Why is it that the DWP believes that the changes to many of the descriptors are improvements, when the disability and other lobby groups say, as we have heard this evening, the exact opposite; namely, that the changes represent a tightening of the screw, making it harder for claimants to claim ESA?</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="110316132000055"></a>I believe that the answer may lie in the different interpretations of the purpose of the work capability assessment. It was set up to replace the personal capability assessment as a test of a person's capability for work rather than their incapacity. As Professor Harrington says in his review,</p>
<ul><a name="110316132000146"></a>"the WCA was designed to be a first positive step towards work for most people".</ul>
<p><a name="110316132000129"></a>However, he also says that it is not working as well as it should, which is borne out by the fact that 40 per cent of appeals against a decision that an individual is capable of work are currently upheld. This surely shows that something is seriously wrong with the assessment. In particular, Professor Harrington says  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_315"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that there are clear and consistent criticisms of the whole system and much negativity surrounding the process.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="110316132000056"></a>The wider interpretation of the purpose of the WCA is not just whether it looks at someone's theoretical capability of work but whether it works in the real world of work. This is where the Social Security Advisory Committee report and the lobby groups diverge quite strongly from the DWP. The SSAC tries to be fair. I think that it is worth quoting two sentences from the report in full, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="110316132000139"></a>"The Committee recognises that the assessment of capability for work is a contentious and emotive issue and has always advocated a positive approach to the assessment of capability that looks at what the individual is able to do and their adaptation to their health condition or disability, rather than focusing solely on what a health condition or disability prevents the individual from doing. However, the Committee also recognises the complexity of many individual cases and the significance of the factors that may determine capability in the real world but which cannot be easily measured by a test that scores functional capability".</p>

<p><a name="110316132000057"></a>I would contend that this is why there are such divergent views between the SSAC, the Merits Committee and the lobby groups on one side and the DWP on the other. The DWP is obviously not prepared to wait until the migration trials have been evaluated to change the descriptors or for Professor Harrington's task group to report on the mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors, which will report to the Minister later this year.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="110316132000058"></a>However, there is a way forward, bearing in mind that the recommendations from Professor Harrington's first report have been accepted in full by the Minister-here I echo my noble friend Lord Kirkwood. There are five recommendations, which can be summarised as follows: that more empathy should be built into the process, with JCP managing and supporting the claimant; that the transparency of the Atos assessment should be improved; that there should be better understanding by Atos of mental disabilities; that decision-makers should be better empowered; and that there should be better communication of feedback between Jobcentre Plus, Atos and the First-tier Tribunal to improve the quality of decision-making on all sides.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para149"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="110316132000059"></a>Professor Harrington's full report is very instructive on all these matters. For example, he says that the language and logic used in the LiMA computer system,</p>
<ul><a name="110316132000147"></a>"is not very intuitive or accessible to claimants who receive their final report".</ul>
<p><a name="110316132000130"></a>He goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="110316132000140"></a>"The Atos Training and Development handbook encourages",</p>

<p><a name="110316132000131"></a>healthcare professionals,</p>
<ul><a name="110316132000148"></a>"to use open questioning and not to rely on the LiMA system".</ul>
<p><a name="110316132000132"></a>However, in practice this hardly ever happens. He also sheds light on the fact that claimants are expecting a medical examination, which looks at their illness or impairment, rather than an assessment of their functional capability. It does not help when the Atos healthcare professional conducting the assessment does not look at the claimant at all, but rather at the screen, nor does it help when the healthcare professional has poor knowledge of some of the less common health conditions, such as Parkinson's disease. Another key part of Professor Harrington's report was that the Jobcentre Plus decision-makers rarely make a decision that disagrees with the  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_316"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 316</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>evidence provided by the Atos assessment because they lack the confidence to do so. In other words, the decision-makers are often just decision stampers.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="110316132000060"></a>The DWP says it is working to implement these recommendations as quickly as possible. I think the whole House would like to know how the department is getting on with this implementation, because this is not just an extremely important matter but, I believe, the key to the whole reputation of the work capability assessment when the migration from incapacity benefit is rolled out nationwide. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Minister would tell us what steps are being taken to implement the current Harrington proposals.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para151"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="110316132000061"></a>The Merits Committee report is, as usual, an absolute model of clarity. It states, as has been stated already today, why it is so important that the work capability assessment is got right. Those who are deemed to be fit for work and are on JSA will receive £65.45 a week, those who are found to have limited capability for work, and therefore on the work-related activity group of ESA, will receive up to £91.40, while those in the support group of ESA will receive up to £96.85. The difference in the levels is substantial.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para152"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="110316132000062"></a>Before I finish, I unequivocally welcome the change in Regulation 35 which allows claimants awaiting chemotherapy to be placed in the support group. However, in general, it is difficult not to agree with the SSAC's view that, in removing some of the subtleties in the descriptors, about which we have heard so graphically today,</p>
<ul><a name="110316132000149"></a>"the test's relevance to the real world has not been enhanced".</ul>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="110316132000064"></a>There has always been a problem with the descriptors for the work capability assessment, particularly for people with mental illnesses and for those with what are termed "fluctuating conditions". During the progress of the Welfare Reform Bill four years ago, I raised concerns about the ability of Atos medical staff to discern the difficulties encountered by people with ME/CFS when, on the day of the assessment-which is not, as some claimants think, a medical examination-those being assessed might have been able to perform a number of tasks on a one-off basis but they were frequently unable to repeat the tasks on a consistent basis. There seemed to be no room for detailing pain, muscle weakness, fatigue and other disabling symptoms that occur intermittently and often severely. As a result, the assessor has awarded very few points and the decision-maker has then considered them fit for work. In every case that I have encountered, people with ME/CFS who have appealed to the medical tribunal have succeeded in their appeals and their benefits have been reinstated.</p>

Under "A programme for work for year two" in that report, Professor Harrington wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="110316132000141"></a>"This programme focuses on: the descriptors, particularly in assessing fluctuating conditions".</p>

In the new year the task group to review the descriptors for fluctuating conditions started work. They are due to report to Professor Harrington in April this year. I understand that the mental conditions report will be published in the summer and that for fluctuating conditions in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="110316132000066"></a>I am aware that the internal review of the operation of the regulations was required by statute. I am also aware that all of the disability organisations involved disowned the report, which they say was flawed. They rejected the recommendations because of, among other things, the negative effect that they would have on disabled people and their families. As other noble Lords have mentioned, the Social Security Advisory Committee was unhappy with the part of the regulations that relate to the descriptors. It recommended that they be deferred until Professor Harrington's independent review of the WCA was complete and the evidence of the outcome of the trial of migration of incapacity benefit claimants to employment support allowance or jobseeker's allowance was available. As we have heard, the House of Lords Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee accepted that the internal review found that the performance of the WCA was not working satisfactorily and it commended the DWP for wanting to revise it. However, the committee also highlighted some of the flaws in the current statutory instrument. These have already been discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="110316132000067"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, I am pleased that the regulation that applies to claimants undergoing or likely to undergo chemotherapy is to be amended, as well as that which applies to drug or alcohol rehabilitation claimants. However, in the light of the conclusions of several reports and the views of a great many experts in mental health and fluctuating illnesses, and the fact that Professor Harrington has been asked to review the descriptors for both these conditions and will be reporting on both by the autumn, I cannot understand why the Government insist on making changes which all the experts, except the DWP, regard as draconian and premature.</p>

Has the Minister measured the happiness of the thousands of claimants who are terrified that their benefits are going to be severely reduced, who will go through months filled with anxiety and apprehension as they wait in an ever-lengthening queue to appeal to a first-tier tribunal, or who become totally demoralised because they are forced to apply for jobs knowing that no employer will take them on?

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="110316132000069"></a>In order to improve the fairness and effectiveness of the WCA, Professor Harrington recommended building empathy into the process, better training for decision makers, accounting for the particular difficulties in assessing mental, intellectual and cognitive impairments, and empowering and investing in decision makers so that they are able to take the right decision.

Are they free to ignore the Atos report if the claimant's statement and any accompanying medical evidence conflicts directly with the findings of the Atos doctor? I am particularly concerned about people with ME/CFS who have frequently been denigrated and who feel defeated by a system that refuses to recognise their illness. The additional stress these regulations will impose on them will not help to improve their condition. Like many others, I am deeply unhappy about these changes. They are going to prove hugely costly, both financially and emotionally, to claimants and I suspect to the DCA, but then that is another department, is it not? Why can the DWP not wait until Professor Harrington reports later this year? Why the urgency?</p>

I propose just to talk about the impact of the new regulations on blind and partially sighted people, which is likely to be quite serious and which illustrates that the regulations as we have them at the moment are not fit for purpose. I think that other speakers have been unduly kind about the regulations. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, said that he was in favour of them. I have to say that I am not in favour of them as they stand. I am more with the Social Security Advisory Committee, which has said that they are not yet fit for purpose in a number of respects, that they were being rushed through prematurely, and that the department should take them back to await the second phase of Professor Harrington's review. There should be more mature reflection on some of the points that have been made about the regulations and further consultation with the stakeholders who have been so critical of them, about which we have heard.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para160"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="110316132000072"></a>As has been stated by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, these regulations fundamentally underline the structure of the employment and support allowance where claimants with limited capability for work are put into either the work-related activity group or the support group. The new descriptors make the limited capability for work test, the gateway to the benefit, unreasonably difficult to pass for many disabled people, certainly for blind and partially sighted people. By

This in effect erodes the distinction between the two tests, undermining the intention of the Welfare Reform Act 2007 that there should be two distinct groups of claimants, one moving towards work-the work-related activity group-and the other with no conditionality-the support group. Under these regulations, the number of disabled people able to qualify for the work-related activity group will drop dramatically, as whole groups are largely excluded by the eligibility threshold.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para161"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="110316132000073"></a>The Merits Committee, in its first report of this Session, stated that the department itself estimates that 23 per cent will be found fit for work and will be required to make a new claim for jobseeker's allowance, with its obligation to participate in activities to improve job prospects. The Social Security Advisory Committee believes that the DWP has underestimated the support required by this vulnerable group of claimants. It has also said a number of other things: first, that the current descriptors are also inadequate for measuring the capacity of those with mental health conditions, sensory disabilities or fluctuating conditions; and, secondly, that there needs to be a closer correlation between the tests and normal work situations. For example, someone who needs to be accompanied to familiar places by a helper is not sufficiently adapted to their condition to be capable of work, yet this would score only nine points under the proposed new descriptors and would therefore not enable that person to get through the gateway and qualify for the benefit.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para162"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="110316132000074"></a>The disability organisations that have made submissions to the Merits Committee have also made a number of other points. The perspective on work skills needs to be wider. Someone might be able to pack boxes all day, but not be able competently to find their way to the factory canteen: or again, people with a limited capability for work-blind people are actually instanced for this-may be able to work, but in a very circumscribed set of jobs. There is an insufficient supply of those jobs in a depressed job market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="110316132000075"></a>I wish to concentrate on the impact of the regulations on the situation of blind and partially sighted people, and in doing so I declare my interest, although at my time of life I am not likely to be applying for employment and support allowance. However, I am a vice-president of the RNIB, which has had a certain amount to say about these regulations. Those who know about these things are clear that the new regulations will have a disastrous impact on blind and partially sighted people, who will in all likelihood fail to qualify for the ESA if the regulations come into force. This is deeply concerning, they say, considering that many blind and partially sighted people have limited capability for work and so should be able to qualify for the ESA, where limited capability for work can be demonstrated-which, I repeat, will be very difficult to do under the new regulations.</p>

It is not appropriate to require someone in this position to end up claiming jobseeker's allowance, yet that will be the impact of these regulations. Under the proposed limited capability for work test, a blind person's difficulties in performing most work-related activities would be ignored and only extreme difficulties in navigation and maintaining safety would be assessed. A visually impaired person would be considered to have a limited capability for work only if they were unable to navigate around unfamiliar surroundings without being accompanied by another person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="110316132000077"></a>The RNIB says that it does not believe that Atos has the specialist knowledge and expertise in a medical test centre environment to carry out functional assessments of the mobility of people with sight loss. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="110316132000142"></a>"For example, we are unclear how they would determine whether or not a person is unable, due to sight loss, to navigate a familiar route without support, when they will be assessed in an unfamiliar environment at the test centre, under conditions of limited time for the assessment to be completed".</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para166"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="110316132000078"></a>The department's internal review stated that it was the department's intention to continue to work with experts and specialist disability organisations to refine the descriptions related to sight loss. However, this has not happened, despite requests to meet officials. For that reason, the department really ought to look further at the regulations before it has these discussions with interested organisations that it says in its internal review it is its firm intention to have.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para167"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="110316132000079"></a>For many blind and partially sighted people, the regulations, if brought into force, could see them denied the ESA. This is due to the high qualifying threshold being put in place around limited capability for work and the failure properly to assess the effects of sight loss. The regulations will seriously undermine the distinction between the work-related activity group and the support group, and force people who should be eligible for the ESA on to the JSA, which is not the appropriate benefit for people with limited capability for work. I do not believe that this is either appropriate or that it was the intention behind the Welfare Reform Act 2007.</p>

The development of those descriptors and an assessment tool is going to take more than the time allowed.</p>

That seems perfectly legitimate, so I am not entirely in support of withdrawing these regulations, because unless we continually try to improve them, we will never get to the point at which they are adequate. However, I return finally to what the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, has said, because it is not the descriptors or the work capacity assessment that are the real problem. The real problem, which I think Professor Harrington described so beautifully, is that the process is,</p>

That is the fundamental problem. We could work on these descriptors. I know that the Government are doing so with extra help from specialists in the mental health field. I ought to declare an interest here as a psychiatrist. The work that is going on is essential, but unless we can change the culture of these assessments to make them more user-friendly we will not get people back into the work that would help them to lead better fulfilled lives.</p>

All the difficulties around the assessments have been clearly laid out and I will not repeat them, but there is a real problem for people who have an assessment and then, possibly a week later, dramatically deteriorate. It is the fluctuating nature of conditions such as MS that is causing a lot of anxiety to people out there. The provision for those on chemotherapy is greatly welcomed, but I ask the Minister to explain how the second part of Professor Harrington's review, which he is doing in conjunction with the MS Society, will be incorporated. How will the Government handle the possibility of quite a lot of appeals or even challenges when the next phase is rolled out?</p>

I emphasise the serious concerns that have been expressed by disability organisations, most particularly that these changes are premature. As we have heard, the second phase of the independent review led by Professor Harrington is still under way, and the advice on refining the mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors has not yet been seen by Ministers, so in all likelihood we will be faced with two major, costly and confusing changes to the WCA to be made in a single year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="110316132000086"></a>I emphasise that the cost of these changes has not been covered. The cost of people having to go to tribunals when their assessment needs to be overturned is enormous in terms of stress, worry and consequent ill health, but it is also a waste of time and money for the country. As the CAB has pointed out, the current WCA assessment routinely fails to identify disabled people's genuine needs and inappropriately allocates them to jobseeker's allowance, only to have that decision

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="110316132000087"></a>According to the Welfare Reform Bill documents, almost £20 million was spent in 2009-10 on appeals to the tribunal service and, according to figures from the Disability Alliance, that means that roughly £8 million was spent on appeals to rectify the failings in the current WCA. There is now a nine-month backlog for appeals in some areas. If the new descriptors go ahead as planned, these changes could lead to even greater pressure on the system, especially since, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, pointed out, new ESA claimants will be joined by an estimated 10,000 people per week being migrated off incapacity benefits from April 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="110316132000090"></a>There is great concern from many disability groups, as has been said, as well as the national AIDS group, which has not been mentioned.

The first point to make is that these regulations seek to take the first step in improving the work capability assessment. They were developed in conjunction with technical experts and with considerable input from specialist disability groups. As noble Lords have acknowledged, they will ensure that individuals awaiting, or between courses of, certain chemotherapy will be placed in the support group without face-to-face assessment. They will expand the support group to cover people with severe disability due to mental health problems and communication problems-that includes people with autistic spectrum disorder, about whom the noble Baroness, Lady Browning, was concerned-and

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para176"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="110316132000094"></a>Before proceeding to debate the finer points of the regulations, I would like to put the reform into a context. The legislation before us today is part of a far broader commitment by the Government to tackle worklessness and intergenerational poverty. This is a very real and very urgent problem for us all, especially given that there are now 2.6 million working-age people claiming incapacity benefits, of whom some 850,000 have been claiming for a decade. This is a massive brake on the economy, costing the taxpayer billions of pounds every year, but that is not the most important point. The true cost of this level of inactivity is paid for by individuals left languishing on long-term benefits without hope or opportunity for a better life. I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said about the scourge of inactivity. If we abandon these people, we fail in our duty as Members of this House. For too long, too many people have had to pay for our failure to act.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para177"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="110316132000095"></a>Before the recession, there were 63 consecutive quarters of economic growth-that is the longest growth period the economy has enjoyed, as historians can best work it out-and the economy created 4 million additional jobs. Yet under the previous Government-I am not being political-just over half those jobs went to foreign nationals. The result was that, even before the recession hit, we still had 4 million inactive people. Millions of people were without jobs in a growing economy, yet the system was trapping them. That is why we were sucking labour from abroad. The system offered too few people the opportunity to escape and to make a better life for themselves. We must not fail them again, because the country cannot afford it, and neither can the individuals, their families or our society.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para178"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="110316132000096"></a>Studies have shown that welfare dependency, social isolation and lack of purpose in life have a debilitating affect on individuals. Decades ago, the late Aaron Antonovsky argued that the purpose in life-what he called coherence-was crucial to understanding human health and well-being. More recently, Waddell and Burton's excellent review of the issue, written four and a half years ago, reinforced the evidence that showed that work is generally good for you. There is ample evidence that prolonged periods of inactivity and unemployment contribute to declining mental health. That is why the welfare reforms that we are introducing are so important, and that is why the regulations are such an essential element in transforming the lives of millions of people at risk of being abandoned to welfare dependency.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para179"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="110316132000097"></a>These reforms are the key to providing the lost with a path out of the cycle of dependency and poverty, and helping them on to the path to new opportunities. That is why we are embarking on a large-scale re-evaluation of those on incapacity benefits through the work capability assessment that will take in some 1.5 million people-not the 2.6 million on incapacity benefit who the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, mentioned -over the next three years. It is also why we are introducing the universal credit to make sure that work pays, and why we are introducing the largest welfare-to-work programme that this country has even witnessed.</p>

Many noble Lords will know how difficult it is to wrestle with the issue of child poverty without this kind of route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="110316132000099"></a>Those who cannot work will of course continue to get the support they need. However, for those who can make the journey back towards the workplace, we will offer them structured support to become work-ready. This will provide real help for many of those who have previously been abandoned by the system-those who were simply labelled as incapacitated and largely ignored, whether they wanted to work or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="110316132000100"></a>The work capability assessment was introduced in October 2008 as a key part of the assessment process to determine entitlement to employment and support allowance. It replaced the personal capability assessment and represented a significant and overdue change in assessing an individual's ability to work. It was developed in conjunction with technical experts, along with considerable input from specialist disability groups.</p>

<a name="110316-0002.htm_para183"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="110316132000101"></a>However, it was clear from the outset that, unlike the PCA, the WCA should be subject to an ongoing process of review, evaluation and refinement. Indeed, it was this House that passed the amendment that introduced the requirement for an independent review of the WCA for the first five years after its introduction-a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. It was the only amendment from this House that made its way into the original legislation for the work capability assessment, and it received support from all sides. That was slightly before my time, but I know many noble Lords will remember it well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="110316132000102"></a>It was this House that called for, supported and enacted the requirement for continuous review and refinement of the work capability assessment. Through these regulations, we are doing exactly what the House asked for. Therefore, perhaps it is counterintuitive for some noble Lords today to suggest that we should wait until the whole process of continuous improvement has been completed. That was not the intention of the House, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, effectively pointed out-if I may paraphrase her point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="110316132000103"></a>The internal review of the work capability assessment, which led to the amendments to the regulations that we are considering today, was undertaken with significant input from technical experts and specialist disability groups, in the same inclusive way that we used for the original work capability assessment. We recognised the concerns of disability groups and undertook significant work with them to refine the assessment. The outcome of this layer of work was published as an addendum to the report, and the regulations before us today fully reflect those refinements.</p>

I also reassure the noble Lord, Lord Low, who made the same point. The regulations that we are debating today are the first step on that continuous journey.</p>

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="110316132000105"></a><b><a name="110316-0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="110316132000174"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> The noble Lord said that the department worked with disability groups. Why have those groups unanimously dissociated themselves from the internal report?</p>

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="110316132000106"></a><b><a name="110316-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="110316132000175"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, I am pleased to answer that question. I am rather surprised by the actions of the groups. I have seen a lot of correspondence and a lot of internal work. There was very full engagement by both sides, and a lot of correspondence about fine-tuning the regulations. At the end of the process there seemed to be real agreement. Therefore I am genuinely surprised that, after the passage of some months, the consensus seems to have been significantly eroded. Income elements may have come to the fore, whereas the technical analysis that was the subject of the interplay between the department and the groups was perhaps easier to get to grips with.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="110316132000107"></a>I will go back to describing the system. The wider system that we inherited, after the measures that the internal reviews described, contained flaws that we as a new Government have looked to put right as quickly as possible. In June we launched the first of the five annual independent reviews of the work capability assessment-the first of the reviews that this House legislated for. It was carried out by Professor Malcolm Harrington, a highly respected occupational physician. He reported last November. He did not consider that the work capability assessment was broken but felt that it was not working as well as it should and made a series of recommendations to improve its fairness and effectiveness. We have fully endorsed his review, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, pointed out, and we have committed to implementing his recommendations as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="110316132000108"></a>The first key element of those recommendations-I am borrowing, again, from the description of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas-is that we empower Jobcentre Plus decision-makers to make the right decision. They will have clear responsibility for the decisions they make and will be given the support that they need to ensure that those decisions are independent and considered. I hope that that is one of the reassurances for which the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, was looking.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="110316132000109"></a>The second recommendation is to ensure that individuals are treated with compassion by clearly explaining everything to them, helping them to fully understand the process they will go through and ensuring that they know that they can provide additional evidence, including medical evidence, for consideration at any time. I hope that that is the second of the reassurances for which the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, was looking.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="110316132000110"></a>The third major change is to improve the transparency of the Atos assessment by ensuring the audio recording of assessments in the Atos pilot. The other element involving the Atos process is that we will account for the particular difficulties in assessing mental health conditions by ensuring that Atos employs "mental health champions" at every centre.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_326"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 326</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110316-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="110316132000111"></a>Nearly all these changes will be in place for the start of the reassessment, with the remainder completed in time for the summer. We have also appointed Professor Harrington to conduct the second independent review. He will now examine the assessment in more detail, particularly focusing on mental health descriptors and fluctuating conditions.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="110316132000112"></a>I shall now respond to the questions of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, on fluctuating conditions. The fact that conditions fluctuate is now embedded in the descriptors. We just want to make sure in this next piece of work that we get that absolutely right. We look forward to Professor Harrington's recommendations following the second review in due course.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="110316132000113"></a>The regulations before us today are part of this improvement process. They come from the internal review undertaken and fully supported by the previous Government. That review suggested a number of changes to clarify and improve the technical descriptors; noble Lords have made these points so I will go through them quickly. The changes include placing individuals awaiting or between courses of chemotherapy in the support group; expanding the support group to cover people with certain communication problems and severe disability due to mental health conditions; greater provision for individuals who are in residential rehabilitation due to drug or alcohol misuse; ensuring the descriptors take account of someone's adaptation to a condition or disability; and simplifying the language of the descriptors to ensure fair, consistent and transparent applications. These changes will improve the work capability assessment. They will increase the number of people with severe disabilities who are provided with unconditional support in the support group. They will ensure that we do not deny employment support to individuals who, with our help, can get back to work.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="110316132000114"></a>The internal review consulted a range of experts and groups and, as I described just now, tried to reach consensus. Significant concerns were expressed by the groups around the descriptors. I will not go into those because I am short of time, but I can respond to the noble Countess, Lady Mar, on fluctuating conditions. It must be possible for all the descriptors to be completed reliably, repeatedly and safely, otherwise the individual is considered unable to complete the activity.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="110316132000115"></a>The Department for Work and Pensions has undertaken rigorous testing of these changes to understand their effects. The department modelled the impact of the changes on data from almost 60,000 assessments, and a panel of experts was brought together to examine the changes in significant detail. Where any issues were identified during this process, further refinements were made to the descriptors. From this analysis we expect the changes to increase the number of new claimants who are put in the support group, specifically, those who are awaiting or are between courses of chemotherapy, and some whose limited capability relates to certain mental functions and communication difficulties.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="110316132000116"></a>I have run out of time, but I hope that the House will indulge me for two more minutes as this is really important. We are committed to the principle of continuous review and refinement of the work capability assessment. As part of that principle, we have reviewed in detail the working of the work capability assessment and consulted in depth with specialist disability groups

The addendum to the original report shows how far such concerns were taken on board in these regulations. We are committed to taking Professor Harrington's review to improve the sensitivity of the process. Of the 17 recommendations that he made, we will have 15 in place in time for April and the other two in a couple of months. I hope that that is a final reassurance for the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and the noble Countess, Lady Mar.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="110316132000117"></a>The changes that we are making in the regulations will improve the work capability assessment. They will expand the support group to cover people with severe disability due to mental health conditions and communication problems. They will ensure that the descriptors take account of someone's adaptation to a condition or disability and accepting these regulations means that we can make these important improvements now. We remain committed to the principle of continuous improvement to the work capability assessment. I trust that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, will feel able to withdraw his Prayer to Annul these important regulations.</p>

The Post Office card account was launched in April 2003 as an alternative for those who could not or did not want to open a basic bank account when the direct payment of benefits was introduced. The contract for that account is extremely important to the post office network, being worth around £1 billion to post offices between 2003 and 2010.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="110316134000002"></a>There were, it is fair to say, some issues around the Post Office card account contract. Suffice it to say that the matter was resolved in November 2008, not least because of the intervention by my noble friend Lord Mandelson. He was able to announce then that the Post Office card account had been saved for the Post Office. On 13 November 2008, Richard Bates, head of community services at Consumer Focus, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="110316134000103"></a>"Post Office card account users will be delighted that they can continue to access their money in an environment they trust and that is within easy reach. The decision is good news for consumers and provides a bedrock for the viability of the post office network".</p>

<p><a name="110316134000095"></a>He went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="110316134000104"></a>"Consumer Focus thinks the Post Office Limited is in a strong position to play a much more expanded role in financial services. ... Today's decision is a good step in the right direction. People tell us they need the option to deposit money, pay bills and make savings in their Post Office card account. The Government must now provide and promote these services".</p>

<p><a name="110316134000003"></a>It is interesting, given some of our recent debates, that there was a particular cheer at the news in Northern Ireland, where 190,000 people have their pensions and benefits paid into a Post Office card account using nearly 500 Post Office outlets.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="110316134000004"></a>In many ways, the Post Office card account has been a major success. Around 4.3 million people now receive benefits via such accounts, of whom approximately 40 per cent are pensioners. The account plays a central role in service provision in a whole host of areas, providing great benefit to communities across the country. Each week, 6.5 million visits are made to the post office network with a view to withdrawing funds from the Post Office card account, and it has been calculated that those under 65 who hold such an account are 28 times more likely to be "unbanked". These same people-those in receipt of state benefits and tax credits-are also the most likely to use high-cost credit, while those without bank accounts are the least likely to hold any other financial product.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="110316134000005"></a>We have heard already today that the Government are looking for ways to extend appropriate, inclusive and functional services to Post Office customers. We welcome that commitment. The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, in its <I>Six Steps to a </I><I>S</I><I>ustainable Post Office </I><I>N</I><I>etwork</I>, emphasised that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="110316134000105"></a>"The Post Office card account ... reminds vital for the post office network and"-</p>

<p><a name="110316134000096"></a>I stress these words-</p>
<ul><a name="110316134000115"></a>"its functionality should be increased".</ul>
<p><a name="110316134000097"></a>That is what this amendment is about.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="110316134000006"></a>Post Office card account customers are some of the least well served by financial services in society. They make up 20 per cent of visits to Post Office branches  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_329"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>each week and spend as much as £2 billion in the network each year. It should be a priority for the Government, in seeking to protect and grow the network, to find ways to develop that account. A robust Post Office card account must be an essential part of the portfolio of financial services that the Government are now proposing for the Post Office, not least because it will provide valuable bridges to financial inclusion and much needed committee support. Before the Government transfer the Post Office to a mutual, we think it sensible to require the Secretary of State to give full consideration to how more use can be made of the Post Office card accounts and to extend the services available in respect of them. I beg to move.</p>

My decision to put forward this amendment came through a conversation with Age UK, which was careful to point out to me that in 2006, when it did its survey of older people,</p>
<ul><a name="110316134000116"></a>"44% ... used the post office to collect their pension, 43% for access to cash and 56% used it to pay their bills".</ul>
<p><a name="110316134000098"></a>That demonstrates what an important role the Post Office played in the financial life of older people.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="110316134000008"></a>Age UK welcomed the Government's announcement, as did I, last November that their ambition is for all UK current accounts to be accessible through the post office network. Of course, the significant majority of high street banks are now going along with providing that service, but there are two major exceptions. Here is my opportunity to name them: HSBC and Santander. They do not make their standard current accounts accessible at post offices. Age UK has pointed out that older people could say, "This is very inconvenient". Perhaps they are in deprived areas or in rural communities where there are no easily accessible bank branches. They could transfer their accounts to one of the banks that use the Post Office, but the reality is that switching accounts is complex and difficult. There are endless forms to fill out and I know from experience that it frequently goes wrong. To put that additional burden on older people is unacceptable.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="110316134000009"></a>We had a good discussion not long ago when in every part of this House there was real concern for the post office network, but even more for the communities to see more financial services available through the Post Office with its trusted name and accessibility and to keep people out of the hands of loan sharks. There were endless reasons, and it is important to provide the Secretary of State with the little reminder that there is a mechanism that can be used to name and shame. I hope that it will not be needed and that the banks will have fallen into line, but if they have not they ought to hear themselves declared on at least one of the Floors of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="110316134000011"></a>I thank noble Lords for tabling the amendments. As I said earlier, the Government are clear that the wide range of financial services offered by the Post Office-for example, personal loans, credit cards and savings products-are an important part of its total product suite.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="110316134000012"></a>I shall begin with Amendment 22D, and attempt to ease the noble Lord's concerns about access to and use of Post Office accounts such as the Post Office card account, which can be used by people to collect their benefits through the Post Office. The Government are absolutely serious about protecting the post office network, and we fully support the Post Office as it seeks to develop the services that it offers. The Post Office card account is currently available across the network and will remain accessible at all post offices, including the new post office local model. The Post Office is a valued partner of the Department for Work and Pensions to deliver benefits through this account. One of the things that people most like about the Post Office card account is its simplicity. The Post Office card account remains a simple product, aimed at those who are unable or unwilling to open a basic bank account. Those who want additional features have a very wide choice of basic bank accounts, and many current accounts, which are readily accessible at post office counters.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="110316134000013"></a>That brings us to Amendment 23A in the name of my noble friend Lady Kramer. I know that my noble friend has a great deal of experience in the banking industry and I always value her contribution to our debates. The Government have been absolutely clear in their ambition for all UK current accounts to be accessible through the post office network, making post offices the convenient place for everyone to access their cash. In November last year the Royal Bank of Scotland reached agreement with the Post Office to allow RBS customers, including NatWest customers, access to their current and business accounts at post offices. As I mentioned in the debate on Amendment 21B in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Young, this will mean that almost 80 per cent of all UK current account holders will be able to withdraw money free of charge at post offices, and many can also pay money in and check their balances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="110316134000014"></a>Of course, this is excellent progress, but I agree with my noble friend that we must continue to strive to ensure that all the UK's major banks provide access to their current accounts through post offices. All the UK's major banks, as well as the Nationwide Building Society, provide at least one basic bank account that is accessible at post offices, but we would encourage HSBC and Santander also to offer access to their current accounts through the Post Office. With a network larger than all of the high street banks combined, and 20 million customer visits each week, the Post Office offers unparalleled access to their customers.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="110316134000015"></a>We therefore continue to support the Post Office's ambition to ensure access to 100 per cent of UK current accounts. However, it is not necessary to include that stipulation in the Bill. Clause 11(2)(b) already requires the Post Office to provide details of the services provided at post offices, and we would fully expect that to encompass the financial services that it

Although the decision to allow customers access at the post office is ultimately a commercial one for the banks to make, the Government have made clear our commitment to encourage those arrangements to be put in place.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="110316134000016"></a>Amendment 24, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, who is not here, is about credit unions. Let us remember that co-operation between the Post Office and credit unions is already strong, and the Government support it becoming even stronger. The Department for Work and Pensions recently announced a significant package of support for the credit union sector, which includes funding set aside for a shared credit union and banking platform, subject to a feasibility study. That would open up opportunities for the Post Office to provide credit union services such as banking transactions, bill payments and low-cost credit services to many more people.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="110316134000017"></a>We made clear in our policy statement, published last November, that we support an even stronger link between the Post Office and credit unions, and we have demonstrated clear progress against that aim. I fully recognise the worthy intentions behind the amendments, and I hope that noble Lords and the noble Baroness will be reassured about the good work that is already under way in those areas. Placing those obligations or reporting requirements in legislation would simply increase bureaucracy. We will continue to encourage co-operation between credit unions and Post Office Ltd, and to support the Post Office in its provision of financial services. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment tonight.</p>

<a name="110316134000020"></a><b><a name="110316-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="110316134000130"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> I shall also speak to Amendments 24C and 24D. All the amendments are an attempt to strengthen Clause 11, which relates to an annual report on the postal network being produced.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="110316134000021"></a>Clause 11 requires the Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament and to give copies to Scottish Ministers, Welsh Ministers and the offices of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland. Amendment 24A requires the report to contain information on locations where post offices services are not being provided at the time of the report but which are identified in the Post Office plan as outlet locations. This form of reporting would be an important development; it would enable stakeholders to distinguish between the Post Office's intended network and that which they are actually able to achieve.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="110316134000022"></a>A major concern has been the number of sub-postmasters leaving the business, as they are unable to make a sufficient living from their post offices. We have heard that more than 900 post offices, which is believed to be an unusually high number, are up for sale. Likewise, we know that more than 160 post offices closed on a long-term temporary basis in 2010. Many more will have closed on a short-term basis. It is important that these changes in the network are clearly reported and that an accurate picture of service levels around the country is reported.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="110316134000023"></a>Amendment 24C requires the report to include the number and locations where post office services have ceased to be delivered since the last report and the reasons for this service reduction. As things currently stand, post offices close and services are reduced without explanation or justification to the public. Closures as part of a national closure programme went through a form of public consultation, which allowed for some degree of accountability and understanding of the criteria for closure. However, when individual post offices close, no such indication is given.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="110316134000024"></a>Not only are post offices continuing to close but the Post Office is preparing to undergo another significant round of change through its new model for the network. Under current proposals, 4,000 main offices will be identified that will continue to provide the full range of services, and 2,000 sub-post offices will be transformed into what is known as "local" or "essential" post offices. These will provide a reduced service; the remainder of the post office network is expected eventually to be developed along this "essentials" model. I would welcome a clarification of that aspect.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="110316134000025"></a>It is important that the impact of these changes is properly monitored. The amendment seeks not to change the Post Office's plans but to ensure that a clear understanding of the shape of the network is achieved. While these changes are not closures, they constitute a major change in service provision. Likewise, the introduction of outreach services as replacements for post offices-often in the form of a van servicing a community a number of set times a week-constitutes a significant reduction in service levels in most areas. It is important that we monitor these changes. At the time of the network change programme between 2007 and 2009, it was envisaged that 500 post offices would

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="110316134000026"></a>It is on these grounds-the importance of understanding what is happening to the post office network during closure programmes and understanding programmes where the models are changing-that we seek to strengthen the terms of this Bill. I trust that the House will support the amendment.</p>

An annual report on the post office network laid before Parliament is an important means of achieving transparency around the post office network. The statutory requirement in Clause 11 to lay such a report before Parliament already goes further than the current requirement in the Postal Services Act 2000, which requires only information about the number and location of post offices and their accessibility. This Government have made a commitment that there will be no further programme of post office closures. We are committed to creating a sustainable future for the Post Office, and Post Office Ltd is legally obliged to maintain a network of at least 11,500 branches over the spending period and to ensure that they uphold the access criteria. These commitments should mean that noble Lords have far less reason to worry about post office closures than in previous years. While we agree that there should be an annual report on the post office network, an annual report on its own is only an annual report.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="110316134000030"></a>Other means of monitoring the post office network are already in place and have already been put before Parliament. For example, a comprehensive list of all post offices in the country, which is broken down by parliamentary constituency, is placed in parliamentary Libraries each summer. Equally, Schedule 12 ensures that Post Office Ltd's annual accounts must also be laid before each House of Parliament on an annual basis.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="110316134000031"></a>My department monitors Post Office Ltd's compliance with the access criteria on a monthly basis, and Post Office Ltd also publishes details of the monthly changes in the network currently subject to local consultation on its website. On a quarterly basis, the Post Office sends reports on the number of post offices and their geographical distribution to the parliamentary Libraries. Data is also provided to Consumer Focus on a quarterly basis to enable it to scrutinise the results independently. All these measures ensure that the information that Parliament receives on the post office network is as thorough and as up to date as possible. Finally, should the Secretary of State feel that it is necessary to obtain further information from Post Office Ltd, Clause 11(4) allows this to happen.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="110316134000032"></a>This provision ensures that the Post Office's report must include such other information as the Secretary of State requires. I believe that this obviates the need  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_334"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for any separate report from the Secretary of State as would be required under Amendment 24EZA. A further report would be an unnecessary duplication. For all those reasons, I believe that including in the Bill the various requirements set out in Amendments 24A, 24C and 24D would simply add unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="110316134000033"></a>The Post Office plays a vital social role in communities up and down the country and the reporting procedures in the Bill reflect that, but we should not forget that these are requirements not faced by any of the Post Office's competitors. There is an importance balance to be struck here, as the greater the reporting requirements imposed on the Post Office, the greater the cost and therefore impact on the Post Office's competitiveness. I hope that, with those reassurances, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

Once again, Clause 11 requires the Post Office to send a report to the Secretary of State each year about its network of post offices. As I have previously said, the network must give details of the number and location of post offices in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It must also give details of the postal services, the services provided under arrangements with a government department and other services provided by the Post Office. It must further give details of the accessibility.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="110316134000036"></a>I will not repeat what I said on the previous amendment, but the reporting arrangements in Clause 11 are important and wide ranging. However, they can be helpfully strengthened by Amendment 24B to reflect the challenges that the Post Office will face following separation from Royal Mail. It is vital that due consideration is given as to how the universal service provider-currently Royal Mail but following the successful passage of this Bill potentially one or more alternative postal operators-will use the post office network when it ceases to be part of an integrated company.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="110316134000037"></a>Many stakeholders have grave concerns regarding the risk to the post office network from the proposals in the Bill to separate Post Office Ltd from Royal Mail. The Post Office is dependent on Royal Mail business for its survival. One-third of its revenue and one-third of sub-postmasters' pay is generated from selling Royal Mail products and services. If the two

There is no guarantee it will use post offices to the same extent.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="110316134000038"></a>The Bill does not safeguard the inter-business agreement through which Royal Mail guarantees use of the Post Office as its retail arm. When it comes to be renegotiated a privatised Royal Mail will look to reduce costs, possibly by using other outlets such as supermarkets or high street chains instead of post offices. The Government will not undertake to extend the current five-year IBA to 10 years. It is on those grounds that we believe that Clause 11 needs strengthening as per the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

On that basis, I rather hope that the Minister will to a great extent repeat the answer that she gave to the last group of amendments and in particular her reference to Clause 11(4), which gives the Secretary of State the power to ask the reporters preparing the Post Office report to produce information on any subject relating to the post office network that he believes is necessary at a particular time. This is likely to vary from year to year. I therefore do not think that it is particularly suitable to put this in primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="110316134000042"></a>As we have discussed, the annual report is an important means of achieving transparency around the Post Office network. It is, of course, also right that an annual report on the Post Office network should give details of the postal services that the Post Office provides. That is why we have included this requirement specifically in Clause 11(2)(b). This section requires the annual report to contain details of,</p>
<ul><a name="110316134000117"></a>"the postal services ... that are provided at ... post offices".</ul>
<p><a name="110316134000099"></a>We would expect this to include any postal services that the Post Office provides on behalf of the universal service provider. The income that the Post Office receives from mail and the services that it provides for Royal Mail are, of course, vital and sub-postmasters highly value the footfall generated by mails customers. Indeed, Royal Mail and the Post Office are natural partners and we envisage their relationship continuing for years to come. There is an overwhelming commercial imperative for the two businesses to work together. Indeed, the chief executive of Royal Mail, Moya Greene, commented on the strength of the network and said that it would be "unthinkable" that there would not always be a strong relationship between Royal Mail and the Post Office.</p>

That is why the Post Office is developing new revenue streams, as detailed in our policy statement. We should all be clear that the majority of the Post Office's income already comes from other sources, in particular financial services, government services and telephony.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="110316134000044"></a>The latest Postcomm report on the network of post offices in the UK contains a breakdown of the percentage of Post Office Ltd's revenue derived from mails, including postal services, as well as financial services, government services and telephony. This information is shown on an annual basis from 2003-04, which allows you to see the change not only since the preceding year but over several years. This information, currently included in the Postcomm report, is exactly the type of information that we would wish to be included when the responsibility for the report transfers to a Post Office company. However, I understand that the continuing relationship between the Post Office and Royal Mail is an important issue for noble Lords and, as such, I would be happy to take this suggestion away to consider. For the time being, therefore, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="110316134000048"></a>Amendment 24E aims to strengthen reporting requirements for the Post Office to ensure that the level of access to post offices and post office services for both small and medium-sized businesses is monitored. Given the importance of that relationship, which has been recognised by all sides of the Committee, we are focusing on this particular aspect. The amendment seeks to strengthen Clause 11 by recognising that medium-sized businesses as well as small ones are highly dependent on post office services and therefore should be included. Small and medium-sized enterprises account for 99 per cent of all businesses in the UK. They provide 59.8 per cent of private sector employment and 49 per cent of private sector turnover. SMEs are indeed the backbone of the UK economy, and hence it is our view that this amendment would make an

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="110316134000054"></a>We know that businesses value the post office network. According to research by the Federation of Small Businesses, almost 20 per cent of small businesses visit the post office every day and nearly half visit twice a week. So I share the concern and I agree with the intention of the amendment. But, as was pointed out by my colleague the Minister for Postal Affairs in the other place, Clause 11 already encompasses what I think noble Lords want it to cover.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="110316134000055"></a>First, we should be clear that there is no universally recognised definition of what constitutes a small or medium-sized business. In the United States, the term "small businesses" generally refers to businesses with fewer than 100 employees, while "medium businesses" refers to those with fewer than 500 employees. In the United Kingdom, SME statistics define a small business as one with 10 to 49 employees and a medium business as one with 50 to 250. If we are going to be very technical here, and one can often be very technical when it comes to legislation, it could even be argued that since the UK SME statistics define a "small business" as a business with between 10 and 49 employees and a "micro business" as one with between one and nine employees, both micro businesses and sole traders could be excluded from the definition in Clause 11(3), but that is not the Government's intention. After all, 95 per cent of SMEs have fewer than 10 employees and we know that post offices play a particularly valuable role for this group.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="110316134000056"></a>We therefore intend the term "small business" here to include all businesses with fewer than 250 employees in line with the broader UK statistical definition of an SME. I am quite happy to make that commitment to your Lordships, and of course if the Secretary of State

We believe there is feeling among sub-postmasters that Post Office Ltd will now have too free a hand to implement changes in what are now styled as post office locals, which may result in them losing a significant amount of revenue. That would throw into question the whole viability of many such sub-post offices and their associated shops.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="110316134000059"></a>This amendment is in three proposed subsections. The first subsection sets out the relationship between the second and the third, which concludes that there has to be consultation with representatives of the employees affected by the proposed changes and any sub-postmaster affected as well as with relevant consumer groups. Under subsection (3)(b) of the proposed new clause, the company would have to submit to the Secretary of State a report proposing the changes, including the proposed timetable for the introduction of the changes. The matters concerned are: first, the terms under which the sub-postmaster operates the post office; secondly, the required opening hours of any post office; thirdly, the services offered by any post

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="110316134000060"></a>It is apparent that there are worries about the contract to be negotiated so far as sub-postmasters are concerned. We understand that the payment of commission rather than a guaranteed annual sum is one of the features that is likely to lead to a substantial loss of income-perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="110316134000061"></a>I have of course looked at the BIS booklet about the pilots, which is very well set out but neatly sidesteps the question of what happens if the sub-post districts are fewer and further apart. Individual examination of the pilots does not quite reveal what is a plausible scenario: that they would be much further apart. For example-this is simple arithmetic from school-doubling the radius of a catchment area from three miles to six miles will not just double the area concerned, because r<sup>2</sup> means that you are going from nine square miles to 36 square miles.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="110316134000062"></a>Finally, page 16 of the booklet-this is in connection with the pilots-says this is a way in which you can implement the Government's big society reforms at the local level. It is too late at night to play around with the concept of the big society, but surely that is particularly grotesquely inappropriate when the number of sub-postmasters is likely to fall. I am reminded of George Orwell's <I>Nineteen Eighty-Four</I>, which after all has some similarities of concept to the big society, with Big Brother and so on. In that book he introduced "doublethink", whereby words often mean precisely the opposite-this is a mixture of George Orwell and Lewis Carroll, I guess-of their natural meaning. So the big society now has big wide spaces with fewer services. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="110316134000064"></a>The Government have stated that they will not add to the 5,000 or so closures to the network so sadly seen in recent years, but I suggest that they are being a little disingenuous. There is more than one way to skin a cat. Let me explain. Conditions can be created that may make it difficult for some sub-postmasters to continue to trade profitably. For example, there may be the withdrawal of the ability to offer road tax renewals, as the Minister referred to earlier, or to facilitate the postage of packages over a certain weight. It has just been announced, for good measure, that the contract in respect of pension and benefit cheques has been awarded to Citibank, which is to subcontract to Paypoint, a company that works through newsagents and garages. This is a decision that has been described as "bitterly disappointing" by the National Federation of SubPostmasters, while the spokesman for Consumer Focus has been quoted as saying that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="110316134000114"></a>"Government has committed to making the Post Office the 'front office' for public services. The decision ... seems out of step with that".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="110316134000065"></a>Most of these sub-post offices combine retail outlets with postal counter services, certainly in the suburbs but mainly in rural communities. They provide a lifeline for the increasingly large element in our population of the elderly and often infirm. It is no good talking to such citizens about electronic gadgetry and the like. They want to be able to access the outlets without recourse to a car, and to experience tried and trusted procedures when they get there. The lifeline that the retailer needs to maintain is a viable business. What is additionally important from their point of view is that, arising from these services, these shoppers also buy the often-quoted packet of cornflakes and more besides. These sub-post offices are the very outlets that the Post Office should be seeking to support with the introduction of new products and services. They are indeed the jewel in the crown, and this amendment seeks to protect that jewel properly.</p>

During the course of today, your Lordships have understood that many of these amendments are interrelated and we have seen much repetition. I am greatly relieved to have heard the Government's response to many of the amendments. My concern at Second Reading was that I wanted a definition of "programme of closure"-"programme" being the operative word-and what that means. Now we know that we are talking about a network of 11,500; the Government have made themselves clear, and the Minister has repeated that on a number of occasions.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="110316134000067"></a>The amendment tries, as many have done previously, to provide a safeguard. I am convinced that the government commitment is there, but we are talking about a few years from now. What safeguards do we require? Subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b) of the amendment suggest that there should be consultation, which always goes back into the Secretary of State's report-we know all that. We are not trying to take away a commercial responsibility from the company running the Post Office; rather, we seek to mix the commercial responsibility with preserving the intention of the Bill, particularly this part of it.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="110316134000068"></a>The amendment concerns-this has been said very eloquently by noble Lords all round the Committee-the importance of our post office network in terms not only of the business itself but of its great social importance to the community. That is where the many amendments to the Bill are headed. They all seek some form of safeguard while realising that a Government cannot safeguard something which will make the business-be it Royal Mail or Post Office Ltd-a commercially unviable proposition. I support the amendment, specifically subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b). I hope that the Minister will understand these concerns. This is a common theme; that is all I can say. I have listened very carefully to the speeches made today and their common theme is that of seeking safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="110316134000070"></a>Separation and mutualisation are provided for in the Bill, as has been discussed. While there is markedly little detail provided on how mutualisation is to take place or the form of mutual the Post Office may become, the transformation of the network-this is just as significant as the closure programmes which have been seen in recent years-to prepare for this is not covered at all in the Bill. There are no safeguards or parliamentary scrutiny of the proposals which will fundamentally alter the post office network, and it is unclear how Post Office Ltd plans to proceed. Furthermore, Consumer Focus, which has previously monitored closure programmes, is now to be abolished and it is highly uncertain that Citizens Advice, which is to take over its responsibilities, will have the expertise or resources properly to monitor the wide range of changes being planned for the Post Office.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="110316134000071"></a>Alongside this, the Bill also means that annual reports on the post office network will be compiled no longer by Postcomm, or Ofcom under the new regulatory regime, but by Post Office Ltd. It is not clear what impact this will have on the extent or quality of information produced. It should also be noted-other amendments deal with this point-that there is no requirement for this annual report actually to be published. In light of these changes, there is clearly cause for concern that the transformation will take place under the radar and without proper scrutiny. Yet it is clear that a fundamental programme of change is planned.</p>

The paper comments on the transformation of the network. The reduction in the number of main post offices gives the greatest cause for concern, with about 2,000 sub-post offices being converted to the local model. That latter commitment worries us. The local model is also referred to as Post Office essentials. As we have said, "essentials" is used because it offers a slimmed down provision of services. These are likely to be offered on the counter of other shops, not through dedicated post offices.</p>

The very good news is that, unlike in the past few years, during which there have been post office closures all over the country, this Government have made an absolute commitment that there will be no programme of closures for post offices, that 11,500 post

We should say that loud and clear. Royal Mail is one thing, but the post offices around our country are completely different.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="110316134000075"></a>The amendment seeks to restrict Post Office Ltd's ability to make changes to post office branches. It is an attempt to protect sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses from having change imposed upon them by Post Office Ltd-the parent company that contracts with sub-postmasters. In particular, the amendment reflects concerns held by some noble Lords regarding the post office local model. The noble and gallant Lord who originally tabled the amendment has been to see me and my team at least three times to obtain clarification and understand what is actually going on here. That is what this is about. In order to ensure that I address these concerns and communicate the position fully, I apologise to your Lordships in advance for the length of my answer at this late hour.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="110316134000076"></a>For those noble Lords who are not familiar with this local model, let me explain. It is a new sub-post office model which Post Office Ltd has been testing over the past two years in more than 50 locations across the country. The model involves the establishment, at little cost, of a post office counter in an existing and viable outlet. It differs from what we might consider to be a typical sub-post office, because it does away with the impersonal, screened-off-in our case-"fortress" counter at the back of the post office, which requires separate staff and always has a long queue. Instead, it provides open-plan access to post office services alongside the retail till. That will mean that instead of staff having to close the shop for the few hours that the post office opens, the model that we are considering means that the hours when the shop is open are those during which you will be able to use the post office counter.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="110316134000077"></a>These changes provide a much more flexible lower-cost operating model for the retailer. The cost of setting up the office is limited to the inclusion of a new counter that is not required to be manned by separate staff. We envisage that this model is particularly suitable for the many smaller post offices across the country where sub-postmasters are struggling to make a living. We do not deny that this process will involve changes, but moving to more flexible models that focus on the customer is the only way to enable the post office network to thrive across the country.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="110316134000078"></a>Noble Lords on the opposite Benches may remember that this model was in fact first piloted under the previous Government in September 2008 under the name Post Office essentials. This amendment seeks to hamper the introduction of post office locals by placing an obligation on Post Office Ltd to consult employees, sub-postmasters, sub-postmistresses and consumer groups, and then report to the Secretary of State before any changes, including relatively minor ones, are made to private businesses. The amendment would result in Post Office Ltd having to consult and report before changes were made to increase opening hours, take on new services, or even change a post office till-let alone change the model. The amendment would also limit the Post Office's ability to react quickly to developments in its highly competitive markets, and would subject even minor decision-making to government scrutiny.</p>

She said that this was right for sub-postmasters, but is there not a price to be paid? At the moment, they have a guaranteed income. Changing to the local model would mean that they would work on a commission-only basis. That is a significant factor, which is why a great deal of concern has been expressed by sub-postmasters. Because of the lateness of the hour, I will not go into the argument about the quality and types of service. With due respect to the Minister, who always addresses things fairly, she gave the worst-case scenario for a sub-post office. I would welcome some acknowledgement of the change in income stream for sub-post offices, and of the fact that we are talking about a commission-only basis for the essential/local model.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="110316134000083"></a>Some noble Lords may be concerned that the model will not create real post offices or offer enough services. However, the model is not designed to replicate a main post office, or a Crown post office, where the entire suite of Post Office products is available. Just as a local or express supermarket offers only the essentials that you use on a day-to-day basis, so a local post office will offer a range of services that one frequently needs.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="110316134000084"></a>The local model that is being tested through pilot branches offers the vast majority of existing post office services, and 97 per cent of transactions by volume. One can post letters, pick up one's pension and deposit and withdraw cash. Post Office Ltd is studying the results of the pilots to see how the model can be improved further and to determine on the locations where it will be most viable before it is introduced more widely. The noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, expressed concern that changes in future would not be appropriately thought through. I reassure him that piloting will continue for the next two years, with the major rollout not starting until 2014. We expect that by 2015, around 2,000 out of the network of around 11,500 branches will have converted to the Post Office local model. This change will not be rushed through, but I believe that it is the best way of securing the future of the network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="110316134000085"></a>I recently visited a Post Office local pilot and was very impressed. Mr and Mrs Patel in Dagenham told me that although the inclusion of a post office counter in their convenience store had taken a bit of getting used to, they were now delighted with it. As a result of the post office services they now offer, they receive an extra 30 to 50 customers a day, who often purchase  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_344"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column 344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other items from their shop. Mr and Mrs Patel pointed out that one of the best features of the local model is that the opening hours are vastly extended compared with a typical post office. Their post office is open seven days a week, for 10.5 hours a day, except on Sundays when it is open for three and a half hours. Many customers come in on their way to or from work, when a typical sub-post office would not be open. In all that time, the increased footfall boosts the sales of the other items they offer.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="110316134000086"></a>It is envisaged that the local model will play an important role primarily in urban areas. However, there is nothing to prevent a local model being established in an existing and viable rural retail outlet, should Post Office Ltd decide that this is the best way of serving its customers. Remote rural areas will continue to be served by traditional post offices or by outreach services, which will ensure that communities will still be able to access post office products and services where a traditional post office is not viable.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="110316134000087"></a>I hope that noble Lords will understand this Government's commitment to a vibrant future for the Post Office network, and will appreciate that subjecting to consultation even the most minor decisions that the Post Office has to make will simply prevent post offices from being free to operate on a competitive and commercial basis. I fear that the added bureaucracy of consultation and reporting obligations may achieve little except to distract Post Office Ltd and the sub-postmasters and sub-mistresses from the work that they need to do.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="110316134000088"></a>I therefore thank the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, and now the noble Lord, Lord Lea, for tabling and moving the amendment and giving me the opportunity to try to assuage some of the concerns around Post Office local. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Lea, to reflect on what I have said today and withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="110316134000090"></a>One of the problems of the relationship in the new model between the Post Office and what are currently called sub-postmasters is that there is currently little transparency over what that relationship is. My noble friend Lord Young put a question to which I may have missed the answer. Is it not the case that there is widespread talk that it will be based on a straight commission basis rather than a minimum for the year, which is a sort of salary? The sub-postmasters in thinly populated areas are not dinosaurs. Generally, their surname probably is Patel and they are fairly sharp businesspeople, but they do have these problems. They are the heart and soul of the community, along with the school, the church, the cricket ground and whatever. That is life.</p>

Well, of course we are not talking about a programme of closures of sub-post offices; it is not the Government

Let me put it as kindly as I can: that is not the answer to the question. We are trying to see the circumstances in which there could be any protection, against any criteria, when a community sees a post office about to close.</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="110316134000092"></a>There are generalisations about the model, and how it will be wonderfully sparkling and new. There is a broadly continuous counter in the post office in the shop I go into. Two out of the four staff have the necessary "competences" to deal with the post office side, and will also sell you a lettuce or half a dozen eggs. I may sound like a dinosaur for a minute, but in what sense does that need to be modernised?</p>

<a name="110316-0003.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="110316134000093"></a>I am very grateful for the support that we have received from the Cross Benches, which suggests to me that the next step should be to see whether there can be something to reassure the many sub-postmasters. I know that they are a disparate group. Having been a trade union official for 35 years, I am not unfamiliar with that. We are trying to look at it from a local perspective, in the spirit of the big society; how about that as a conciliatory way to end?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="110316134000094"></a>On this occasion, therefore, I hope that there can be further consideration before Report.

It is worth noting that all the changes covered by these two instruments were announced as part of a Written Ministerial Statement in December last year. As both the regulations and order deal with national insurance contributions, it seems only sensible that they should be debated together. As a matter of course, I can confirm that the provisions in the regulations and the order are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000004"></a>I shall begin with the social security regulations. The previous Government's 2008 Pre-Budget Report announced an increase in class 1 and class 4 national insurance contribution rates of 0.5 per cent. These rate rises were due to come into force from the start of the 2011-12 tax year, but 12 months later the former Chancellor of the Exchequer declared his intention to double the increases. This would have placed additional burdens on businesses at a time when they are most in need of our support. While this Government confirmed that these rate rises would be implemented, we are implementing them as part of a wider package of reforms that will reduce the overall cost of employment and will support people on lower incomes. We will achieve this by increasing the income tax personal  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allowance, the primary threshold and the secondary threshold. The social security regulations before the Committee today are a vital part of this process.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000005"></a>To start with, the point at which employers will have to start paying national insurance will increase from £110 per week to £136 per week from April of this year. This is a weekly rise of £21 above indexation, which means that employers will not pay any national insurance on the first £7,072 of any worker's earnings.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000006"></a>From April of this year, the class 1 primary threshold, which is the point at which employees start to pay class 1 national insurance contributions, will increase from £110 per week to £139 per week. This is an increase of £24 a week above indexation, which will help to mitigate the effects that a 1 per cent increase in the employee's rate of national insurance contributions will have on the lower-paid.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000007"></a>As a result of the increases in thresholds included in today's regulations, around 950,000 low earners will no longer pay national insurance contributions, while their contributory benefit entitlements will be protected. Employees earning under £35,000 a year will pay less both in terms of income tax and NICs. Employers will pay less in NICs on all workers earning less than £20,000 a year. In relation to NICs thresholds, employers will be better off by £150 for every employee earning above the secondary threshold.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000008"></a>Compared with the plans that this Government inherited, more than £3 billion a year is being returned to employers through the secondary threshold rise. Even more money will be going straight into the pockets of hard-working families due to the changes in the primary threshold.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000009"></a>Today's regulations also set the level of the lower earnings limit. This takes into account changes that we are making to the way in which the basic state pension will be uprated. As part of last year's June Budget, my right honourable friend the Chancellor announced that the basic state pension will be linked to earnings from April 2011. Not only that, we included the added guarantee that it would rise in line with either earnings, prices or 2.5 per cent, depending on which is greatest.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000010"></a>Now that the earnings link has been restored, the lower earnings limit is no longer legislatively linked to the basic state pension. This means that the Treasury can set its level independently of the basic state pension through affirmative resolution. As a result, large rises in the basic state pension will not result in lower earners being taken out of contributory benefit entitlement. This is fair and progressive and it will support the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. For the upcoming tax year, the lower earnings limit will increase by RPI to £102 per week, while the upper earnings limit will go down from £844 per week to £817 per week. This is to maintain the alignment with the point at which the higher rate of income tax is paid. It is also worth noting that the regulations will increase the main rate primary contributions paid by women who married before 6 April 1977, taking them up to 5.85 per cent from this April.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000011"></a>The social security order sets out the NICs rates and thresholds for the self-employed and those paying voluntary contributions. In the case of the self-employed,  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC61"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it raises the small earnings exception for paying class 2 contributions. The exception will rise in April from £5,075 to £5,315 a year, which is broadly in line with prices. The rate of class 2 contributions will increase from £2.40 to £2.50 a week. The rate of voluntary class 3 contributions will also increase from £12.05 a week to £12.60 a week. Again, this is similar to the general increase in prices.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000012"></a>Today's order sets the profit limits for which main rate class 4 contributions are paid. The lower limit at which these contributions are due will increase from £5,715 to £7,225 a year, in the same fashion as the class 1 primary threshold. At the other end of the scale, the upper profits limit will be reduced from £43,875 to £42,475. This maintains alignment with the upper earnings limit for employees, which, as I said, is being reduced to reflect the changes made to the higher rate of income tax. The changes to the class 4 limits will ensure that the self-employed pay contributions on a similar range of earnings to employees paying class 1 contributions. The increase in the lower profits limit will guarantee that the 1 per cent increase in the class 4 NICs main rate is offset for the self-employed. This is in much the same way as the increase in the primary threshold offsets the 1 per cent increase for employees.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000013"></a>The legislation included as part of today's order and regulations is an important part of the Government's plans to reduce the taxation of labour. It will encourage employers to take on more workers, help those on the lowest incomes and support private enterprise and employment across the country. This is important for the economy and important for the recovery.  I commend the regulations and the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000014"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="110316114000100"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for the explicit way in which he outlined the contents of the regulations and the order. He will forgive me if I do not spend a great deal of time responding to them. First, it seems that the main principles adumbrated in his contribution were debated pretty thoroughly at the general election and largely resolved by crucial decisions then. Secondly, we have had the opportunity to debate national insurance contributions with some degree of intensity over the past few weeks. These issues have also already been considered by the other place. Therefore, the noble Lord will forgive me if I am not able to match the strength, force and length of his opening contribution. However, I have two specific questions to ask, to which I would like him to address his mind and respond.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000015"></a>The Government-or the more senior party of the coalition-made much of this in their rhetoric during the general election. Afterwards, there was in the coalition agreement this commitment-indeed, a pledge-to stop the rise in employer national insurance contributions from April 2011. However, there seems to be a difference between the expectations to which this might give rise and the reality that we see in the SI before us. What is given back to the employer through the threshold changes to class 1 secondary contributions? The threshold goes up from 12.8 to   


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>13.8 per cent but this appears to be somewhat less than employers might have thought they were getting following the pledge to stop the rise entirely as far as employers are concerned. It looks as though the Government are giving back with a degree of generosity that does not quite fulfil their commitment. The noble Lord mentioned that he thought that as much as £3 billion was being returned. Can he confirm that figure and say whether it is consistent with employers' expectations of what they would get back?</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000016"></a>Secondly, I want to comment on what I am sure the noble Lord will indicate is a minor issue, although it is not minor to many of us. I refer to the contribution of married women and widows. I know that they form a limited group but I see that the increase in their contributions will be from 4.8 to 5.8 per cent. What are they getting for that increase? We know that they get no retirement pension, that they cannot get jobseeker's allowance if they become unemployed and that they receive no sickness benefits. Yet, in all the Government's bravado about the restrictions that they would place on increasing national insurance contributions, they could not exempt this group. That seems to be at one with an awful lot of the dispositions made by the Chancellor and by Ministers responsible for Treasury matters over the past few months. I think particularly of child benefit for women who earn more than £40,000 a year. Whether intended or not, the legislation seems to discriminate pretty heavily against women when we would have thought that, if the Government were true to the principle that the noble Lord adumbrated in his concluding remarks, which reflected some fairness, this group would have been treated more generously. Will the Minister comment on that? In more general terms, the Opposition are supportive of the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000017"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="110316114000101"></a>Lord German:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may add a few words of welcome for these regulations. They give effect to a significant commitment that this Government made to try to reduce the costs to business of employment, to try to make sure that those who are in employment at lower levels of income receive a boost and to give effect to that commonly held and often-referred-to statement that work will always pay. Taken in the round, we cannot omit the other part of this package-the Welfare Reform Bill-which will ensure that those on lower earnings always benefit by being in work and that they do not lose their pensions.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000018"></a>Primarily, these regulations give help to support people on lower incomes. They help those at the lower end of the pay scale but, as the Minister said, they are part of a package to lift people-many tens of thousands and nearly a million in this case-out of national insurance contributions altogether and to reduce the tax burden as a whole for a substantial number of working people throughout the country. That is a crucial change, which, taken with the Welfare Reform Bill, will support the poorest and ensure that it will always pay for people to be in work, to seek work and to find work. It is progressive and as such should be encouraged.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000019"></a>We were told by the opposition party during the last general election that it would be better not to raise VAT but to raise national insurance contributions. We  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC63"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have increased VAT to 20 per cent. To what level would national insurance contributions have to rise to match that switch? Is it not far better to ensure that people who are on the lowest earnings can keep more of their income and that the poorest in our society benefit most from these changes? Is not the progressive nature of these changes crucial to fairness in our society?</p>
<h5><a name="110316114000083"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="110316114000020"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="110316114000102"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, for his characteristically short, to-the-point and putting-me-on-the-spot remarks. Without getting into unnecessary detail, he extracted one or two big points, which it was very reasonable to raise. I thank also my noble friend Lord German, who succinctly pointed to the significance of the changes that the coalition Government have made to the plans that they received from the previous Government. I have not seen any specific numbers that might answer his very interesting question, but I shall go away and see whether a comparison has been made between the effect of a rise in VAT and the effect of a rise in national insurance. However, he made absolutely the right point, supported by all the economists' evidence, that a rise in national insurance is a direct tax on jobs. Regrettable though the rise in VAT was, it was necessitated by the dire predicament that the Government inherited and in line with all the economic evidence that a rise in national insurance contributions as proposed by the previous Government would have been much more damaging. The VAT increase raises about £13 billion. That would have required a huge rise of almost 3 per cent in the employer NI rate. Without taking it any further, one can see how just how burdensome that would have been on employers.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000021"></a>I should address the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Davies. He asked, first, whether we had met the expectations set out in the coalition agreement. I certainly believe that we have delivered on what could reasonably be expected of the Government. Compared with what would have happened under the plans of the previous Government, employers will be more than £3 billion better off next year, rising in future years. Indeed, although £3 billion is correct in the round, the figure is slightly more. It is exactly what employers would have expected, as it matches not only the Conservative manifesto but the coalition agreement. Yes, as a result of the coalition agreement, some of the benefit is switched from national insurance contributions to income tax. It is a point that has been made and answered before. Indeed, there will be a net rise in national insurance contribution payments, compensated by a larger fall in income tax payments. Just to underline the point, employers will be better off in respect of employees earning up to £20,000, while employers who have among the highest-earning staff will pay more national insurance contributions. We believe that that is the right and appropriate way to do it.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000022"></a>On the question of women, as a general point I would note that, in terms of the effects based on gender or whether someone is disabled, as well as in terms of those in other groups, the coalition Government took their responsibilities in the overall spending package  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC64"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>last year more seriously than has ever been done before. We are certainly not in any way trying to dodge our important responsibilities to consider the effects of all our measures on different groups in society, including, of course, women.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000023"></a>Married women who paid national insurance contributions at the reduced rate are a unique group. They elected to pay reduced rate contributions in return for reduced benefit entitlement; these women can revoke their reduced rate election and pay contributions at the standard rate at any time they choose. It is not the case that women who opted to pay reduced rate contributions have received nothing in the way of benefits, in case there is any suggestion of that. Before 1975, such women who were employed were eligible for a full range of industrial injury benefits and, later, they became eligible for statutory sick pay and maternity pay. They can also receive a pension of up to 60 per cent of basic state pension based on their husband's contributions when he reaches pension age. There have also been three major publicity campaigns about the married women's option-the first in the late 1970s, the second in the late 1980s and the third in October 2000-to advise them of changes that may affect them. They also benefit from the increase in the primary threshold that is now coming in. There are around 5,000 to 10,000 married women who still have in place a reduced rate election; the numbers are falling because only women married or widowed before 1977 are entitled to pay at the reduced rate. I hope that I shall not be accused again by the noble Lord of piling Pelion on Ossa, but I thought it worth going through the position as it is and confirming that in the generality the Government take their responsibilities very seriously.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000024"></a>Without rehearsing again any of the important points in the regulations and the order, I am grateful for the focused and brief debate. I reiterate as a last point that more than £3 billion a year is being returned to employers through the employer threshold rise and even more to individuals through the increase in the primary threshold. I commend the regulations and the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><I>Relevant document: </I><I>15th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I><I>.</I></p>
</ul>

<p><a name="110316114000025"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="110316114000105"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> My Lords, I am pleased to introduce the Road Vehicles (Powers to Stop) Regulations. The purpose of these regulations is to provide examiners from the Department for Transport's Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, or VOSA, with direct powers to stop commercial vehicles at the roadside throughout Great Britain in order to enable them to conduct compliance checks.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000026"></a>These compliance checks are to ensure that commercial vehicles and drivers of commercial vehicles comply with the requirements of EU legislation relevant to vehicle roadworthiness and driving requirements. For example, EU legislation prescribes minimum standards of technical compliance for vehicles circulating on our roads. There are rules that prescribe maximum weight limits for commercial vehicles. There are also very detailed rules about maximum driving time and rest periods and about the recording equipment and records that are needed to verify compliance with these rules.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000027"></a>Of course, all these requirements and rules are there to help to keep our roads safe, but they are effective only if there is adequate enforcement. Consequently, the legislation also stipulates that member states must put in place appropriate systems and checks for compliance, which is something that we would want to do in any event, regardless of the country of origin of the vehicle and driver.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000028"></a>As things stand, VOSA already has a limited power to stop vehicles for checking in England and Wales. It has the power to do so under provisions in the Police Reform Act 2002-or, more precisely, the law allows chief officers of police to accredit individual VOSA examiners with the power to stop vehicles in order to carry out roadworthiness checks. Although this is a rather cumbersome administrative process, the general arrangements for enabling VOSA to stop vehicles for inspection work well in practice, since they save time in overall terms both for the police and for VOSA. They also release police officers for front-line duties when they would otherwise have had to stop vehicles for VOSA, as they used to do in the past.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000029"></a>The main problem is that these arrangements do not apply in Scotland, which currently commits the police to having to support VOSA at roadside enforcement checks. The draft regulations before the Committee today will resolve that problem. Under the provisions of the draft regulations, VOSA officers appointed by the Secretary of State will be able to stop commercial vehicles for checking throughout Britain without having to have a police officer present. The main benefit that  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC66"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this will bring is that it will release a significant amount of police resources in Scotland that are currently taken up in assisting VOSA with this task.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000030"></a>The regulations will also simplify the process of accrediting VOSA stopping officers. The proposal is that VOSA stopping officers will, in future, be appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport-in practice, that would be done by the chief executive of VOSA-rather than by individual chief officers of police. Of course, no one will be authorised as a stopping officer until they have successfully completed all the necessary training, which will be equivalent to the training that stopping officers in England and Wales currently have to undertake. The benefit of simplifying the process of appointing stopping officers will be in reducing the administrative burden on both the police and VOSA.</p>
<h5><a name="110316114000086"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000031"></a>The regulations will also extend the scope of VOSA's stopping powers. At present, its stopping powers are specifically linked to vehicle roadworthiness checks, but its remit is much wider than that, extending to things such as checking compliance with maximum weight limits, drivers' hours, operator licensing and driver training rules. I alluded to some of these matters earlier.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000032"></a>Noble Lords may have noticed that the provisions under which these regulations are being made include Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. Section 2(2) of the 1972 Act provides the Secretary of State with powers to implement EU law via a statutory instrument where no such power already exists in primary legislation. In this case, Section 2(2) of the 1972 Act is required to ensure that we are fully compliant with EU law obligations in respect of these enforcement matters.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000033"></a>While we are taking this procedural route to amend the law as it relates to Britain, we are also taking the opportunity to clarify the law as it relates to the whole of the UK, which is why the draft regulations also extend to Northern Ireland. As noble Lords will see, the regulations will also make some minor changes to the existing law in Northern Ireland, where examiners in the Driver and Vehicle Agency, which is Northern Ireland's equivalent to VOSA in this respect, already have the ability to stop vehicles for compliance checks. The minor changes will simply confirm that DVA examiners can also stop vehicles in order to check compliance with goods vehicles authorisations and driver training rules, which are EU-wide provisions. Northern Ireland Ministers are content with these provisions, which will save them from having to take through separate, similar legislation for these very simple changes.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000034"></a>To deter offending, these regulations also include offence provisions. They will make it an offence to impersonate a VOSA stopping officer or an examiner from DVA. They will also make it an offence to obstruct a VOSA stopping officer while he is carrying out his duties, although this offence does not extend to DVA examiners because equivalent provisions are already in force in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000035"></a>Noble Lords may have noticed that I have made reference throughout to commercial vehicles. That is because EU law and, indeed, these regulations apply  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC67"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only to commercial vehicles. In England and Wales, the provisions of the Police Reform Act 2002 will remain in force, in order to allow VOSA to continue to make use of the option allowed under those provisions to stop other types of vehicles for roadworthiness checks-for example, light goods vehicles. I commend the draft regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000036"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="110316114000106"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> My Lords, I have some experience of what is proposed in the regulations because for six years I worked in Northern Ireland, where VOSA's equivalent had to use stopping officers; if policemen had been used, they would have become targets for terrorists. What is proposed in these regulations worked in Northern Ireland and I believe that it is sensible to extend the provisions here. Indeed, I have been surprised that it has taken successive Governments so long to wake up to this.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000037"></a>If, like me, you have experience of roadside checks, you will know that some of them are extremely expensive to mount. They are not just a matter of one man pulling a lorry off the road. Often 10 agencies are involved in checks, which might cover drugs, ill treatment of animals, customs fraud or immigration fraud-a whole range of things is covered by these checks. They are very expensive to organise and at the moment, if a check is mounted and the policeman is called away to other duties or does not show up, the whole process is frustrated because nobody can stop a lorry or a coach to send it to the inspection centre. I very much welcome these regulations and can only wish them well. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, made it clear in his remarks that it would be possible for VOSA officers to stop other vehicles.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000038"></a>I suggest that traffic censuses might also be considered. They do not need a policeman; they just need somebody with a yellow jacket on to organise the thing. I presume that even when the police have stopping officers there is an occasional person who offends and does not stop, but there are plenty of means of identifying those people and bringing them to justice. I fully support the proposed changes.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000039"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="110316114000107"></a>Viscount Simon:</b> My Lords, in these times of policing budgets, I wonder whether chief constables will be persuaded to let VOSA work completely independently of roads policing officers and rely on it to make routine checks on vehicles, thereby releasing their officers from such requirements. I acknowledge the fact that the regulations refer only to commercial vehicles, but could they be extended to all vehicles in time? I do not know. Will this be used by chief officers to obtain large savings being targeted at policing?</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000040"></a>It is well known that some commercial vehicles are used for criminal activities. If VOSA is the only body inspecting such vehicles to examine their roadworthiness and the police are not there, criminals will get away with all kinds of things. A trained police officer can examine the vehicles and their drivers in more detail while there are still road policing officers qualified so to do, but their expertise may well be hit if chief officers rely on VOSA and VOSA alone. What will happen if a VOSA stopping officer comes across a driver who is obviously drunk or wanted for a criminal offence?</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000041"></a>I wonder, also, how VOSA stopping officers will be trained in appropriate driving and related techniques. Will they be trained by the police? Even with such advanced training, am I correct in assuming that, other than using their powers to stop a commercial vehicle, they will comply with the law and that they will not be able to use exemptions in relation to exceeding speed limits or other matters enforced by police officers? I assume that they will not be permitted to have blue lights. What will be their method of stopping a vehicle?</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000042"></a>Does VOSA have a budget within the spending review to meet the expectations of providing, training and equipping the stopping officers to provide the required services every day of the year and at all hours? I hope so, because there are already problems with VOSA setting targets and, when those are met, simply stopping the work that it does. That could result in VOSA weighing a number of vehicles and then not weighing any others for the rest of the month because that target had been met. Currently, VOSA officers are not there at night or weekends unless on a special operation. That must not be a reason for the police to remove resources and to leave it to VOSA, as VOSA does not have the continuous responsibility throughout every day of the year that the police have.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000043"></a>Relying on VOSA to take over some of the roads policing operations-I declare that I am an honorary member of the Police Federation of England and Wales roads policing central committee-is fraught with problems. It used to be so simple: a police officer only. But now it seems that it could be anyone-a Highways Agency traffic officer, VOSA, who next? I do not expect the Minister to reply to my concerns today, but I would be grateful if he would write to me in due course and I hope that he will forgive me for raising these matters, some of which are not strictly related to this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000044"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="110316114000108"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, the two noble Lords who have spoken have raised some exceedingly pertinent questions. I knew that we would benefit from the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. He has carried out what has often looked like a one-noble-Lord campaign on certain aspects of the entry of foreign lorries into this country and the difficulties that have arisen from their compliance with the law. I was interested to hear about his experience in Northern Ireland. Such is one's preoccupation with the legislation that obtains generally across the United Kingdom that it comes as a bit of a shock when one realises that part of it relating to traffic is not UK-wide legislation at all but, because of the police dimension, applies only to England and Wales. I therefore very much support this instrument, which extends the issues to Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000045"></a>My noble friend Lord Simon has addressed a number of the questions that I would otherwise have articulated at some, no doubt boring, length. It is incumbent on the Minister not to write to my noble friend but to answer, so far as he is equipped to do so today, the very important point about who exercises the powers to stop and for what offences. I very much approve of the extension of the offences in the regulations, but they are all traffic offences. My noble friend Lord  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC69"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Simon probably picked up the reference made by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, to what might have obtained in Northern Ireland and he asked about other illegalities that the driver or others responsible for the lorry might be guilty of and be likely to be charged for. I presume that powers are not to be given in relation to those offences. If they are, that should have been stated in the regulations. However, I take it that the instrument is about traffic regulations and the regulation of trucks and lorries-that is, big vehicles. We know that the road haulage industry is pleased to see a tightening up of these issues, because it does not want to be besmirched by road hauliers who give the others a bad name when accidents occur in circumstances where it is clear that the law has been infringed.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000046"></a>However, what greatly exercises the British road haulage industry and all of us who take an interest in road transport in the United Kingdom is the enormous increase under the single market in the number of foreign trucks coming to the United Kingdom. It has been predictable but nevertheless it has carried on apace in the past decade with the significant economic growth across Europe. The minor grievance that we have is that these trucks have large tanks that are loaded with less expensive fuel on the other side of the Channel and are then able to travel huge distances on British roads without contributing to taxation because the fuel has been bought elsewhere. Of more concern to us all is that some of these trucks do not meet European standards on maintenance and equipment. Any accident involving a heavy lorry will cause concern in a locality, but it is bound to exercise people a great deal more when it involves a truck that comes from a considerable distance beyond these shores.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000047"></a>Of course, we very much support these regulations. In fact, they are overdue. However, I hope that the Minister will give reassurance about the identification of those carrying out the stopping exercise. Authority cannot be in question when there is a truck that is 44 tonnes against an individual who is standing by the side of the road. The authority either works or the individual officers are in danger. There must be clear identification and I want to know what is guaranteed on that. I particularly want the Minister to address whether the list of traffic offences in the regulations is what the stop will be organised for. It would be a different matter if we went on to other issues. Will the Minister say how that will impact on the role that the stopping officers play?</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000048"></a>We understand the necessity of economising on police time, which is why the initial changes in the Police Reform Act were made, but that has to be consistent with a proper authorised road for the VOSA people so that they are protected in their job and can discharge it fully. The Minister has a number of questions that he needs to address.</p>

The flagrant breaches of the law by lorries from one side of the border were often caught.  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC70"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>VOSA officers have the power, as do Customs and Excise officers, to immobilise the vehicle. If there is any trouble, the police can be called anyway, but the officers have powers to stop the vehicle. That is the big sanction.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000050"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="110316114000110"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> My Lords, I thank the three noble Lords who have contributed to this short debate. Clearly, these regulations enable VOSA examiners to stop commercial vehicles for inspections that they routinely carry out at the roadside. These checks are on the roadworthiness conditions of vehicles and on whether the driver is complying with all relevant laws, including the particular law on maximum permissible time spent behind the wheel.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000051"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, made one or two points and was generally supportive. The stopping powers relate only to VOSA; no other agency can be legitimately associated with those roadside checks. The point about census checks could perhaps be looked at in future; I do not think that I can say anything about that, but I shall take it back to the department. The current priority is to enable VOSA to complete its duties throughout Great Britain.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000052"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Simon, made several points. I am delighted that I had some degree of notice on one or two of them, but not necessarily on all-if we cannot cover them all, we will have to write. He asked whether chief constables would be happy to let people work completely independently. VOSA officers will continue to maintain close links with the police. They have already been stopping vehicles in England and Wales since 2002-nine years-and there have been no problems. These regulations will allow VOSA to stop vehicles in a similar way in Scotland. They have the support of ACPO in Scotland and the Scottish Government.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000053"></a>The noble Viscount asked whether the fact that VOSA will be working on its own would encourage criminals to take advantage. VOSA officers will continue to maintain strong links with the police; even though they have the power to stop vehicles for inspection, they still have those strong links. In the event that they encounter any difficulty, they will immediately request assistance from the police in the normal way.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000054"></a>The noble Viscount asked how VOSA stopping officers will be trained. They will need to complete an intensive police driver training course before being appointed and an in-house training course to familiarise them with the extent and limitations of the powers-for example, the fact that VOSA officers are under no circumstances allowed to chase suspect vehicles. They will not be permitted to have blue lights. Their vehicles will have stopping matrix signs that request drivers to follow the vehicle to a safe stopping point, as they do at present.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000055"></a>The noble Viscount also asked whether VOSA has the necessary budget to provide a 24/7 service by stopping officers. Obviously, there is a limit to resources, just as there is for the police, and priorities have to be targeted. In some areas-on the main arterial roads into Britain, for example-VOSA can provide a 24/7 service, as it does. In other cases, it has fewer resources available but will rely on intelligence to determine when it is best to run enforcement exercises.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000056"></a>The noble Viscount asked whether in time the regulations could be extended to all vehicles. There are no plans to seek to extend the scope of these regulations to cover any other classes of vehicle. The law could be amended in the future, but that is not contemplated at the moment. VOSA's main priority is commercial vehicles, not cars-cars are primarily a matter for the police.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000057"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, asked how the VOSA officers would be identified. While on duty, they will be required to wear a uniform that is unique to them; to carry clear identification; and to be in clearly marked vehicles that have a black and yellow Battenberg livery, are clearly marked "VOSA" and have amber light bars on the roof.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000058"></a>The noble Lord asked questions and commented on the extent to which there are more vehicles on the road. He referred to foreign commercial vehicles in particular. He will be interested to learn that, in 2006-07, 56,596 roadside checks on foreign vehicles were made by VOSA. In 2009-10, that figure had increased to 177,460. Those figures come from the most recent random fleet compliance survey and VOSA's effectiveness report.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000059"></a>I trust that I have answered the bulk of the queries, as I have endeavoured to do. I will carefully check that nothing that I ought to have responded to is outstanding. As I have indicated, the purpose of the regulations is to create an efficient and effective mechanism for stopping commercial vehicles throughout Great Britain so that they and their drivers can be checked by VOSA examiners. These checks cover a wide range of compliance issues affecting vehicles and their drivers; they are necessary to keep our roads as safe as possible.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000060"></a>Historically, the police have stopped vehicles for VOSA, but it has to be said that that does not necessarily make the very best use of their valuable time. Of course, they have many other pressing priorities, which only they can deal with. For that reason, VOSA was given the opportunity in 2002 to stop vehicles for roadworthiness enforcement checks in England and Wales. That arrangement worked well in practice and we are now seeking to extend that practice to other types of compliance checks and to extend the new system throughout Britain. As well as making the process easier for VOSA, the new provisions will help to free up police resources in Scotland in a similar way for core policing priorities. The new provisions will also make easier the process of appointing VOSA stopping officers and provide a useful minor clarification of the relevant equivalent law in Northern Ireland. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000061"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="110316114000112"></a>The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</b> My Lords, the regulations concern the use of emblems on ballot papers by candidates at local authority mayoral elections in England and Wales. Their purpose is to make the changes necessary to address an oversight that has arisen in the drafting of the existing regulations governing the conduct of local mayoral elections.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000062"></a>The changes being considered today will enable a candidate who is standing on behalf of two or more registered political parties at such an election to request that the ballot paper should feature, alongside the candidate's particulars, an emblem registered by one of those political parties. I understand that a number of local mayoral elections are scheduled to take place in England in May 2011-I think that the number is five. The regulations will ensure that the issue is addressed ahead of those elections.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000063"></a>Under Section 29 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, a political party registered with the Electoral Commission may register with the commission up to three emblems for use on ballot papers by candidates standing for the party at elections. Electoral law is clear that a candidate standing on behalf of a single party may request that an emblem registered by that party appear on the ballot paper against the candidate's particulars.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000064"></a>However, at the May 2010 general election, it came to light that amendments to the parliamentary election rules set out in Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983 made by the Electoral Administration Act 2006 had had the unintended effect of preventing candidates standing on behalf of two or more registered political parties at UK parliamentary elections using on the ballot paper a party emblem registered by one of those parties.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000065"></a>This has affected jointly nominated candidates who have wanted a party emblem on their ballot paper, most notably those wishing to stand for the Labour Party and the Co-operative Party, and the Ulster Unionist Party and the Northern Ireland branch of the Conservative Party, where candidates have stood under the description, "Ulster Conservatives and Unionists - New Force". I should perhaps pre-empt any comments from the other side by saying that, as far as I know, these are the only two examples of political parties planning joint candidatures in the future.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000066"></a>These provisions have been replicated in the rules governing the conduct of various other elections. These include the rules for the conduct of local mayoral elections in England and Wales as set out in the Local Authorities (Mayoral Elections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007. Schedule 1 to those regulations contains the rules for a stand-alone local mayoral election and Schedule 3 sets out the rules where a local mayoral election is combined with another poll. As a result, there is now an inconsistency in the use of registered emblems on ballot papers at local mayoral elections by candidates standing on behalf of a single party and those standing on behalf of more than one party. The draft regulations we are considering today address this inconsistency, which has resulted from an  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>oversight in the 2007 regulations. As I have explained, these regulations are being made to address the issue ahead of the local mayoral elections scheduled for the 5 May. It might be helpful if I briefly explain the changes made by the regulations.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000067"></a>The issue arises in the context of the 2007 regulations. Rule 18(4) in Schedules 1 and 3-about candidates using an emblem on the ballot paper-makes reference only to Rule 7(1), which concerns the nomination paper for a candidate standing for a single party. To address the situation, Regulation 2 of the draft regulations before us inserts new Rule 18(4A) in Schedules 1 and 3. It refers to Rule 7(3), concerning the nomination paper for a candidate standing for more than one party. Further, Regulation 2 amends Rule 18(5) in each schedule so that it refers to paragraphs (4) and (4A) of Rule 18. The effect of these changes is that it will be possible for a candidate who is authorised to stand on behalf of more than one party at a local authority mayoral election in England and Wales to use an emblem registered with the Electoral Commission by one of those political parties, if they wish to do so.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000068"></a>The draft regulations allow such a candidate to use one emblem only on the ballot paper, which must be an emblem registered with the Electoral Commission by one of the parties for which they are standing. Our approach maintains the current policy that candidates nominated by a political party may have only one emblem featured against their details on the ballot paper. A candidate's request to use an emblem must be made in writing to the returning officer before the deadline for the delivery of nomination papers, which is noon on the 19th day before the day of the election. For the local mayoral elections on 5 May, this is noon on Monday, 4<sup></sup>April.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000069"></a>The Electoral Commission and the Association of Electoral Administrators highlighted this issue in their reports on the May 2010 election. The political parties have also raised this issue with us. There is a broad consensus that the issue should be addressed at an early opportunity and in time for the elections scheduled to take place in May of this year. I can confirm that the Electoral Commission was formally consulted on these regulations and has indicated that it is content with the changes being made to the 2007 regulations. The same issue was replicated in the separate rules governing the conduct of other elections. We are addressing the issue in the relevant legislation for the other elections scheduled for 5 May. It will require primary legislation to address the issue for a UK parliamentary election, and we will look for an opportunity to do this in advance of the next general election.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000070"></a>These regulations make a sensible and appropriate change to put right an oversight in the drafting of the existing rules governing the conduct of local authority mayoral elections to allow the use of emblems on ballot papers by candidates nominated by two or more parties at those elections. In that spirit, I commend them to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000071"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="110316114000113"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> My Lords, I hope not to detain the Grand Committee for more than a few minutes. Before I come to specifics of the regulations that my noble  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>friend introduced, would he comment on the report I read today? It said that Ministers and departments are under strict instruction, under the deregulation initiative or in/out process, that every time a new directive or regulation is introduced, one should also be abolished or repealed. If that is the case, I hope that we will, in future, get a brief description of what will be repealed to enable the new regulation to be introduced. Obviously, this is a very helpful and entirely desirable improvement to the situation, and I commend my noble friend for introducing it-in a totally non-partisan spirit, because I anticipate that the main advantage will be to the opposition party. I hope that the noble Baroness will acknowledge that on this occasion at least there is no ignoble partisan initiative or motive behind this, because clearly the primary benefit will be for Labour and Co-operative candidates. I know that there is a long tradition of them working together, and I hope that this will be accepted as an extremely helpful and consistent implementation of a principle that has been accepted in other parts of the electoral law.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000072"></a>I have three specific questions. As I understand it, it will now be possible for candidates standing for more than one party to have exactly the same opportunities for the use of an emblem on the ballot paper as those who are standing for a single party. However, it is a standing policy of all Governments that there should always be one emblem. The idea of combined emblems will provide a very interesting design objective in some circumstances. Whether the red rose is sometimes painted green-or there may be other opportunities for amalgamation-it will be a challenge to all designers. But there is also a problem of definition. I imagine that bringing together two emblems in a way that apparently creates a combined emblem will not be entirely easy to distinguish from two emblems separately put on the ballot paper. That is something that all Ministers in all Governments have rightly sought to resist as, once you open to door to that, you could have multi-emblems attempting to get on the ballot paper and more space being required-or else they would be too small to be legible. Is my noble friend entirely satisfied that the regulation will prevent  what would otherwise look like two emblems being rather loosely combined? That may seem a small  design problem, but it could turn out to cause  difficulties.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000073"></a>Secondly, and relating to that, we are approaching the noon deadline on Monday 4 April at considerable speed. The consultation on this issue took place immediately after the 2010 election, both with the Electoral Commission-and I have declared an interest as having a minor role on an informal advisory group for the commission-and more widely. It is unfortunate that the elections for mayors in Bedford, Middlesbrough, Mansfield, Torbay and Leicester, where they must now already be starting their campaigns, have not been briefly and appropriately informed of the change. I have no idea whether there are candidates in any of those five locations who intend to stand on behalf of more than one party, but we are near the deadline and I hope that some attempt has been made to inform people in those areas, the political parties and those responsible for electoral administration, that this proposal was coming forward.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC75"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000074"></a>Thirdly, in his introduction, my noble friend referred to the fact that in due course primary legislation would be required for UK parliamentary elections. Can he tell the Grand Committee whether this is yet another candidate for the so-called "Christmas tree Bill"? That is rather an unfortunate description; it might be more properly described as the "Odds and Sods Constitutional Reform Bill", because I know that a number of different proposals are likely to be contained in it. If it is, how soon may we expect to see that Bill? To adopt more parliamentary language, perhaps it could be called a portmanteau Bill. Either way, it is obviously important that the parties are given due notice that proposals will be brought forward as soon as time is available to deal with the bigger issue of the 2015 general election. As my noble friend has said, it is extremely important that we have total consistency so that the political parties, candidates and agents, as well as those responsible for electoral administration, have clear guidance that there will be a consistent approach right across the board.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000075"></a>Very briefly, since we are dealing with mayoral elections, I hope that my noble friend will be able to confirm that some of the issues arising over how executive mayors have been introduced into this country over the past 10 years are being reviewed in preparation for the Localism Bill, which is already under consideration in the other place. There are important problems that arise from that legislation, not least the fact that financial decisions are incredibly controversial when they are made by an elected mayor, because he or she can introduce a budget when two thirds of a council votes against it. There is also the issue of special responsibility allowances, which give the elected mayor huge patronage opportunities.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000076"></a>Obviously, this afternoon is not the opportunity to discuss these issues. However, I hope my noble friend will acknowledge that we cannot completely detach the issue of mayoral elections from wider concerns about the way in which the system is working, after a long period where it has caused some controversy in different parts of the country. When we come to the Localism Bill shortly, I hope that we will be able to address these.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000077"></a>I think my noble friend and his colleagues in the coalition Government have introduced some very sensible and, some might say, rather latter-day improvements to the system. They are correcting an inconsistency, a discrepancy that unfortunately managed to find its way into the previous basis for the identification of candidates on the ballot paper. I very much support and welcome the order before us.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000078"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="110316114000114"></a>Baroness Golding:</b> My Lords, if I may for a moment, I was on the Committee of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. I can remember very vaguely why it was called that. It was something to do with political parties so-called registering themselves in similar names-I think it was something like Liberal and Literal-so that voters would be confused by not reading properly. I had a letter in 2007 from someone saying that they had attempted to obtain the committee minutes and reports of this committee. He goes on to say that the committee office had performed a search in the Houses of Parliament and the parliamentary  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC76"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>archives for the committee's records. Unfortunately, and also rather incredibly, they reported on 20 January that the contents of the only file they had located related mainly to the establishment of the committee and included virtually nothing about any advice it may have given about the registration of parties. That seems incredible. I would like to know if in fact these minutes were found. I think it is important, because the registration of parties came before the registration of these emblems. The parties that are registered should be proper political parties, not ones that were originally trying to imitate another party. So I would be grateful if the Minister could let us know if the minutes have been discovered.</p>

<p><a name="110316114000079"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="110316114000115"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the Minister for his clear explanation of the order before us and I completely accept, of course, that it was under the Labour Government that the oversight occurred. I am very glad that the Minister and his colleagues are seeking to put that right. As the noble Lord said, some Labour candidates are also members of the Co-operative Party. I myself am a proud member of both parties. I recognise that we will benefit from this particular regulation, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="110316114000080"></a>As a consequence of the oversight, if a person stands for both parties, they are unable to use an emblem for either one on the ballot paper. Clearly, that was not the intention, and I am glad that that is going to be righted. The noble Lord suggested that he was very glad, because there would not be able to be a plethora of emblems on a ballot paper. While I accept that we would not want to have rows and rows of emblems, I would ask the Minister why one cannot have two emblems, perhaps, rather than one. It is just a simple question.</p>
<h5><a name="110316120000057"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000001"></a>The regulations before us clearly deal with mayoral elections. As the Minister said, in due course-or before 2015, if the Bill currently before the House goes through-there will be a need for primary legislation to deal with general election candidates. However, there may first be by-elections with candidates wishing to stand, for example, for the Labour and Co-operative Party and it would be good if a vehicle for the primary legislation could be found in the not-too-distant future.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000002"></a>I note the Minister's comment that this was about the Labour and Co-operative Party and the Ulster Unionists and the Conservative Party in Northern Ireland. He suggested that the legislation is only for those parties and that there is no question of any other parties standing together. However, the political landscape is constantly shifting. I am sure that the noble Lord opposite will accuse me of being ignoble and partisan, but I recently read a statement by a Conservative MP, Mark Pritchard, that this will make it far easier for coalition party candidates to be presented to the electorate. I am not suggesting that this is the reason behind the legislation, but it is clear that if a Liberal Democrat and/or Conservative candidate wanted to stand for both parties, they could in future. There is nothing wrong with that. I am suggesting only that, if a  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mayoral candidate wanted to stand for both those parties, these regulations will make that easier. I have absolutely no problems with these regulations and I welcome them. I look forward to hearing the Minister's answers.</p>

<p><a name="110316120000003"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="110316120000068"></a>Lord McNally:</b> My Lords, having desisted from drawing the attention of the Committee to the fact that we are yet again clearing up a mess left by the previous Administration, I was disappointed that the noble Baroness could not resist making the suggestion that this might be legislation for the coalition partners. I thought that I had pre-empted that. As has been clearly stated by both parties, there is no intention of putting forward joint candidates. We will be fighting the next election in May 2015, Parliament permitting the legislation, as separate and distinct parties. I believe that the noble Baroness really knows that.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000004"></a>I was interested in the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Golding. If she were on the committee, we have the guilty woman with us today. She made an important point about how, with the best of intentions, this kind of legislation came about. I remember the by-election in which the guy stood as the Literal Party candidate, while at the Hillhead by-election one of the candidates changed his name to Roy Jenkins in order to confuse. I am therefore well aware that the origins of this legislation were, rightly, to try to prevent the electorate from being confused, deliberately or otherwise, and to clarify the rules around the candidature.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000005"></a>On whether two or more emblems should be allowed, it is a matter of judgment. If we say one or two, someone will ask, "Why not three?". The general principle of the legislation is that there should be a level playing field for candidates. It is therefore right that candidates standing for a political party may use one emblem only on the ballot paper. I am quite sure that if at some stage somebody wanted to amend a piece of legislation, Parliament would consider it, but I suspect that we would return to the balanced view in the original legislation-that the best level playing field is to have one emblem. As long as the emblem chosen can be cleared by the Electoral Commission, it could possibly be a hybrid of the two, but I suspect that it would make sense to have just the one emblem.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000006"></a>Certainly, I was not saying that this is just for the Labour and Co-op parties, although the noble Baroness is right that the title "Labour and Co-op candidate" has a proud history in British politics. The redoubtable Alf Morris fought all his elections as a Labour and Co-op candidate in my neighbouring constituency of Manchester Wythenshawe when I was in the other place.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000007"></a>Of course, emblems have changed from time to time. I remember the Labour Party as a torch rather than a red rose. I cannot remember what the Conservative Party emblem was before the tree. Was it as torch as well? The torch obviously went out of fashion.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000008"></a>I was also asked whether the mayoral candidates had been informed. The political parties were consulted about these plans. Indeed, I am told-and this shows that the Labour and Co-op party machines are on their toes-that they actually approached the Cabinet Office to seek clarification. I will not say that things have changed since my day, but I was impressed by that.</p>

<p><a name="110316120000009"></a>I was also asked when the point about the general election would be addressed. My honourable friend Mark Harper was more daring than my brief in that he suggested that the individual electoral registration Bill might be a suitable vehicle. I do not know whether that would be the case or whether the suggestion made by my noble friend Lord Tyler of a portmanteau Bill would be better. However, I take on board the point made about the by-election. One of the things that we will take from this debate is that there might be a sense of urgency rather than simply thinking that it is a matter for 2014 or 2015. Certainly, the Government's intention is to address the issue.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000010"></a>On the question of the merits and demerits of elected mayors, although the regulations are about elected mayors, we will have to leave the debate that my noble friend Lord Tyler tried to tempt me into to our consideration of the Localism Bill, if that is where it will be. I do not know whether these regulations are covered by the in/out commitment. I do not know whether the rules are quite so rigid when we are carrying out a tidying-up exercise such as this.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000011"></a>On the question of where the missing minutes are, I can assure the noble Baroness, Lady Golding, that I will try to find out. I am also the Minister responsible for the National Archives. Missing minutes are very important, particularly minutes on an issue of such interest. Perhaps the officials responsible for this cock-up in the first place have stolen the minutes. I am grateful to all those who have contributed to this debate and I commend the regulations.</p>

<p>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Marine Licensing (Licence Application Appeals) Regulations 2011.</p>

<p><I>Relevant document: 16th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I></p>
</ul>

<p><a name="110316120000012"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="110316120000070"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Henley):</b> My Lords, the Committee will be aware that my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment and Fisheries presented these statutory instruments in another place on 7 March, where they were fully supported and passed with relatively little debate. The regulations form part of the new streamlined and transparent marine licensing system, to be introduced in April this year under Part 4 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, which we all remember. The Act was broadly welcomed by all parties when it was debated in both Houses, although it took some time.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000013"></a>The new system replaces two out-of-date and overlapping pieces of primary legislation-Part 2 of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 and Part 2 of the Coast Protection Act 1949-and establishes a single system for approving most projects at sea. The Marine Management Organisation, established in April last year, will carry out most of the Secretary of State's licensing and enforcement functions. The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change will license oil and gas-related activities. One feature of a modern, more transparent and accountable licensing system is the right to challenge a decision made by a regulator. The regulations before the Committee today establish two rights of appeal.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000014"></a>First, the Marine Licensing (Licence Application Appeals) Regulations 2011 are made under Section 73 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act. These allow an applicant to appeal to an independent body within six months of a decision on their marine licence application. These appeals will be handled by the Planning Inspectorate. The regulations set out what an applicant must do to appeal against a decision, as well as the responsibilities of the licensing authority and the appeals body. The Planning Inspectorate will decide whether the appeal is to be heard by means of written representations, a hearing or-in the larger cases-an inquiry, based on the complexity of the case, as in all other planning matters. The rules that apply to each type of process are set out in the regulations and  have been aligned, in general, with similar regulatory regimes.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000015"></a>The draft Marine Licensing (Notices Appeals) Regulations 2011 are made under Section 108 of the Act. The Act makes provision for a range of notices to enable a more proportionate approach to enforcement in the marine environment, designed to bring people into compliance. The regulations before the Committee set out a right of appeal against certain notices to the independent First-tier Tribunal, which was set up under the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, specifically to hear civil enforcement appeals. The instrument sets out the powers of the tribunal in relation to appeals against notices and the notices that can be appealed. Appeals will follow the rules and procedures of the First-tier Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber, which are set out in secondary legislation that came into force in 2009.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000016"></a>I give an assurance that the Government consulted on both sets of regulations in the summer of 2010. Respondents broadly welcomed the introduction of both the appeals mechanisms and the detailed proposals. The devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are licensing authorities under Part 4 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act and are each making their own regulations under Sections 73 and 108 of the Act. Therefore, what we are talking about today relates purely to England.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000017"></a>I hope that the Committee will agree that the proposals set out in these regulations provide the level of transparency and accountability that the public have come to expect from modern regulators and I hope that the Committee will join me in supporting this measure. I beg to move.</p>

Indeed, this is an opportunity to pay tribute to the former Government for introducing the Marine and Coastal Access Bill. I think that I remember there being 17 sessions. My noble friend Lord Taylor may recall how many there were.</p>

<p><a name="110316120000019"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="110316120000072"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I lost count.</p>

Some of them went long into the night but on the whole they were extraordinarily amicable, in contrast to some of our recent debates on other matters.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000021"></a>This is a very neatly designed scheme. It seems to be streamlined yet still transparent in terms of licensing and appeals under Part 4 of the Act. Of course, it is extremely important not just that there is a transparent process for licensing but that the appeals procedure is open to everyone to see how it works. In that context, and inevitably with a new system, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. It will not be until we have seen some case law and have had some experience of the system that we will know whether it is as fool-proof as one would hope.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000022"></a>Perhaps I may take up one point that my noble friend made. The Planning Inspectorate will decide whether the appeal is to be heard by means of written representations, a hearing or an inquiry based on the complexity of the case. The definition of "complexity" is obviously a matter of judgment. That is inevitable; we cannot prescribe it in advance.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000023"></a>I am sure that anyone who was involved in the long process of the legislation's gestation through your Lordships' House will remember that there were a great many interested parties, all of whom had an amazing array of expertise. I hope that, together with the consultation that has already taken place, experience over the next few months and years will show that the amicable, united spirit that we set in place is maintained. This is a very important new framework for the management and conservation of our coastal and marine neighbourhood. This set of detailed proposals looks relatively straightforward. I am happy to support them and to commend all those in both Administrations who have been involved in producing them.</p>

<p><a name="110316120000024"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="110316120000074"></a>Baroness Quin:</b> My Lords, I, too, welcome these regulations. I thank the Minister for bringing them forward today and for the way in which he spoke to them. As he pointed out, they have already been considered in the other place, where they were generally supported. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, recognised, they are supplementary provisions to the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, which, as he and the Minister pointed out, commanded strong cross-party support in both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para82"></a>

<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC81"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>functions of the Secretary of State. We agree that the MMO is the suitable body to carry out these functions. We very much support the aims of making the system clear and transparent, which was one of the points that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, stressed. We also support the fact that these two instruments, which are obviously linked, are being taken together in this debate, but perhaps I could ask one or two questions relating to the instruments separately, arising from reading the documentation in front of us.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000026"></a>Regulation 5(2) of the licence application appeals regulations mentions that the instrument,</p>
<ul><a name="110316120000055"></a>"may provide for payment to be made to the appointed person".</ul>
<p><a name="110316120000027"></a>However, it was not clear to me what kind of payment this was. Obviously, we are talking about an appeals system and we want people to feel that they are able to appeal if they believe that a decision has not been correct. I simply wanted to ask what kind of payment, if any, might be involved in that process. I may have misread it, but I would be grateful for clarification from the Minister.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000028"></a>The Minister will not be surprised to hear me question whether the MMO has the staffing and resources necessary to undertake these functions. Page 2 of the impact assessment mentions the cost to the MMO in terms of training, new forms that have to be produced, changes to the IT systems and so on. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that the staffing and resources are there to be able to carry out these tasks.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000029"></a>I note that for the licence appeals system there will be a review in three years, but under the notices regulations the review will be two years after the introduction of the system of new monetary penalties and notices. I am not quite sure what date that means for the notices system, but I wondered, given how linked the two things are, whether the review period should be more or less the same for both.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000030"></a>The notices regulations introduce a,</p>
<ul><a name="110316120000056"></a>"more flexible toolkit of enforcement options".</ul>
<p><a name="110316120000053"></a>We support that. As the Minister said, these provisions apply only where the Secretary of State is the appropriate licensing authority, so we are talking about England. I wondered, however, whether the devolved Administrations will have a similar or even the same system and in particular, in terms of monetary penalties, whether the devolved Administrations will have systems that are very much aligned with the one that will be introduced in England.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000031"></a>I found the impact assessment generally very helpful. However, I refer the Minister to paragraph 61 on page 21, which talks about the cost of familiarisation with guidance. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="110316120000054"></a>"It is assumed that 20% of those holding FEPA licence will each spend 40% of a working day familiarising themselves with the guidance".</p>

<p><a name="110316120000032"></a>To me, that somewhat begs the question: what about the other 80 per cent? Perhaps the answer is elsewhere in the document; if I have simply misunderstood it, perhaps the Minister can put me right on that point, either now or in writing.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000033"></a>As my colleague William Bain noted in the other House, these regulations comply with the Hampton recommendations on taking unnecessary matters out of the courts. As the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said, they introduce a reasonable system, so I am happy to support these additional measures, which complement and supplement the 2009 Act.</p>

<p><a name="110316120000034"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="110316120000075"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Baroness and to my noble friend Lord Taylor for their remarks. I will join my noble friend Lord Tyler in paying tribute to the previous Government-it is only occasionally that we do such things-for the passage of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill. I would also add how sorry we are that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who spent so much time on that particular Bill, as my noble friend Lord Taylor remembers it, is not able to be here today.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000035"></a>As regards how this legislation works, my noble friend Lord Tyler said that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, and he referred to the problem in terms of the definition of "complexity". I can give some sort of assurance from my ancient memories as a pupil at the planning bar-a very, very long time ago-that this is well understood in planning law. In terms of transposing-perhaps I may use that EU expression-these matters on to general planning law, there will be a great problem. Obviously, there will be questions of fact and degree as to where something lies and whether it should be undertaken by written representation, by some other appeal or by general public inquiry. However, these matters have previously been dealt with without too much problem.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000036"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Quin, first asked about payments. I understand that a salary or fee will be paid by the planning inspectorate to any appointed inspector, as has always been the case. That is what happens with terrestrial planning systems-they are paid for the work they do, as is right and appropriate. She also asked about staffing, saying that I would not be surprised by her question on whether the MMO would be able to meet its commitments. We have certainly taken advice from the MMO enforcement team on the level of resource required for this activity. It is perfectly happy that it has budgeted accordingly and will be able to deal with everything that it needs, as set out in the impact assessment.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000037"></a>I shall turn to the noble Baroness's complicated question-I am not sure whether I have got it right-about the different review timescales we have set out for two different things. One is of three years and the other two years. I understand that we are committed to monitoring and reviewing the use of notices after two years. Obviously, appeals on that system are different. However, if I have not quite understood her exact concern, I will certainly write to her and set out a proper response.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000038"></a>I am grateful that there is general agreement on both these two orders and the fact that they should be agreed. If I have failed to answer any of the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, I will obviously do so in writing. In the mean time, I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000040"></a>The Waste Framework Directive is the foundation stone on which all EU waste legislation has been built. It was originally adopted as far back as 1975-a date which many of us in this House can still remember-in what was then known as the Common Market. At that time, most waste was disposed of by landfilling or incineration.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000041"></a>However, the Waste Framework Directive has developed over the years as our awareness of the environmental consequences of waste disposal, and the unsustainable use of resources, has grown. The directive was substantially revised in 1991 and its scope extended from disposal to include also the recovery and recycling of waste. In recognition of the increasing international trade in waste for recovery, the 1991 revision also introduced an EU-wide definition of waste.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000042"></a>The latest revision of the directive builds on those solid foundations. Its aim is to place much greater emphasis on the sustainable use of resources by taking measures to prevent the production of waste, and by making better use of the waste that continues to be produced. It also simplifies regulatory controls by incorporating the Hazardous Waste Directive into the revised directive and repealing most of the Waste Oils Directive. However, protecting the environment and human health remains a key objective.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC84"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000043"></a>The fulfilment of the directive's objectives is of interest to everyone-householders, local authorities and businesses, big and small. We have developed our proposals to transpose the directive in close consultation with these customers and stakeholders. The process was begun by the previous Government, which consulted on the transposition of several key provisions. The coalition Government took this forward and consulted last year on a draft of the transposing regulations. In transposing the directive, we have sought to keep costs to businesses, local authorities, regulators and taxpayers to the minimum. Many of the directive's requirements can be met without additional measures or burdens and do not involve additional costs. Where new controls are necessary we have adopted a light-touch approach. I can assure the Committee that the transposing regulations do not gold-plate the directive.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000044"></a>A key new provision of the revised directive is the five-step waste hierarchy, which is to apply as a priority order in waste management legislation and policy. Our proposals for implementing the waste hierarchy through minimum changes to the planning, permitting and waste transfer note arrangements were well supported in consultation. They were widely recognised as representing a light-touch approach. The revised directive also sets two new targets for 2020: first, to recycle 50 per cent of waste from households; and, secondly, to recover 70 per cent of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste. The regulations impose no new measures to meet these targets. Current projections are that existing policy measures, including the landfill tax, should be sufficient to ensure that we meet them. There are no requirements in the transposing regulations that directly affect issues such as the frequency of local authorities' collection of household waste, charges to householders or the enforcement of waste collection services.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000045"></a>The revised directive also requires member states to introduce separate collection of wastes, where practicable, by 2015. The previous Government obtained clarification from the European Commission that what is known as co-mingled collection-where recyclable materials are collected together for subsequent separation-is an acceptable form of separate collection under the directive, provided it results in materials of sufficient quality to be recycled. The Government are satisfied that co-mingled collection is capable of providing the right quality of recycling material, so the transposing regulations we have laid before the Committee confirm that co-mingled collection is a valid form of separate collection. The regulations therefore contribute to the coalition Government's policy on localism by ensuring that decisions on the best ways to collect household waste remain a matter for local authorities. The regulations would allow local authorities to make those decisions and to provide the waste and recycling services that their residents want.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000046"></a>The regulations also provide scope for residents and local groups to contribute to the big society-for example, by setting up local re-use networks and helping to prevent waste, both of which come much further up the hierarchy and are to be applauded. I commend the regulations to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I must confess that I am standing in for him with even more trepidation on this set of proposals than I did on the previous one, where I had had some role in the passage of the marine Bill.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000048"></a>I think that the first thing that my noble friend would have said is that it is rather unfortunate that all this paper before us appears not to be recycled. I do not know whether my noble friend the Minister can confirm this. The symbol that usually appears on documents of this sort to show that they are on recycled paper is not present. It may be that the emblems have been mistaken, but we all have an increasing responsibility to try to make sure that we practise what we preach.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000049"></a>I have one or two questions. First, will my noble friend confirm that the long period since the European Court of Justice decision of, I think, 2005 that is referred to in some of the notes before us has been put to good use in dealing with the issues then raised? It is quite a long delay. I accept that these regulations deal with the directive on waste of 2008-09, but it should surely have been the concern of the previous Administration to deal with the ECJ judgment previous to that.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000050"></a>Secondly, I am sure that my noble friend Lord Greaves would have been able to cope with the concept of co-mingled collection much more adequately than me because it is new to me-I have no doubt that the Minister is all too aware of it-but there is a real dilemma here, of which I shall give just one illustration. My own local authority insists that the transparent windows on window envelopes are detached from the envelopes and disposed of in a completely different way. It is the first time that I have come across that anywhere in the country. It may be perfectly acceptable under these regulations for co-mingled collection, but in my locality it is not. A huge number of envelopes have such windows, as I am sure other Members of your Lordships' House will know from the mail that they receive. Every time I go home, I find myself spending quite a long time detaching windows from envelopes. The regulations do their very best, with what is described as a light-touch approach, to marry the objectives of consistency through the whole country with localism-my noble friend the Minister has referred to that. However, it is a real dilemma for the householder who, perhaps like Members of your Lordships' House, has to dispose of refuse in different parts of the country on completely different bases. Co-mingled collection is obviously an interesting issue.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000051"></a>I understand from what the Minister said, as well as from the briefing that I have received, that the Government are very properly insisting on trying to avoid overregulation and on giving local authorities the opportunity to take their own decisions. However, on these matters, it makes for a postcode lottery, with businesses and households through the country faced with quite different concerns and costs. It should be a constant concern of any Government to try to get that balance right. I would like to be reassured that, under the regulations, the avoidance of gold-plating and the insistence on a light touch will not result in a plethora of quite different policies in different parts of the country. That is an inevitable dilemma.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="110316120000052"></a>I have one other point, on timing. I note that, under the directive of November 2008, it was intended that the Government should achieve this transposition by 12 December 2010. I understand that, as a result of their failure to do that on time, an infraction letter was issued which I presume the Government have had to take note of and respond to. I just wonder where that matter stands and whether the Minister is confident that the Commission will not be able to, or will not wish to, take further action since we are some two or three months behind time on that.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000001"></a>I cannot pretend to be a great expert on these regulations, and no doubt I will be subject to the inevitable scrutiny of my noble friend Lord Greaves afterwards, but he would at least be concerned that these proposals seem to have been quite a long time in gestation. It so happens that they appear to have been printed on paper that has not been recycled, but I trust that when it is collected in waste bins around your Lordships' House will be appropriately recycled in the future.</p>

<p><a name="110316127000002"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="110316127000082"></a>Baroness Quin:</b> My Lords, these regulations are important. As the Minister pointed out, they transpose the Waste Framework Directive. Indeed, as the Explanatory Memorandum points out, in one way or another the fulfilment of the directive's objectives is of interest to everyone in the country-householders, local authorities, businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises, NGOs, consumer groups and so forth. I am grateful that we have had the opportunity today to look at these regulations. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, for representing the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, whose knowledge we miss on these occasions. I know that he has taken a deep interest in these issues for a long time.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000003"></a>Despite the fact that not many noble Lords are present for this debate or have spoken, these matters are of ongoing concern. I am sure that we will return to them at many points in the future on the Floor of the House and in Grand Committee. Certainly, the Opposition will be watching progress on this important matter carefully.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000004"></a>We are fortunate in that the Minister is in charge of this subject within the department. He is smiling-I hope that he is pleased to be in charge of it. Therefore, we are able to ask the relevant Minister the pertinent questions that need to be asked today and as this matter progresses.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000005"></a>The Minister reminded us that the regulations re-enact, repeal or revise three predecessor directives. With the EU, it is not always a case of adding new regulations. Sometimes, it involves repealing and scrapping previous regulations. I welcome the way that this has happened.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, mentioned that we were somewhat late in not complying with the deadline. He mentioned the infraction letter. I note that the Minister in the other place said that this was partly due to wanting to have as thorough a consultation process as possible. Obviously, I welcome the fact that a consultation has taken place. I note that the Minister in the other place also mentioned the point that was reinforced by the Minister here: that they had not wanted to gold-plate the regulations. However, I somewhat share the concern raised by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler.  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC87"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We are really just introducing the minimum requirements under the directive and keeping a light touch, as the Minister said. But we need to be assured that that light touch will be effective. We also want to be assured that encouragement to go beyond these requirements will be part and parcel of the system.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000007"></a>The last time that the Minister and I discussed environmental issues, his noble friend Lord Deben was present. He gave the Minister a hard time in terms of wanting an assurance that we could move faster in future. Many of the points that he made in the debate on the draft producer responsibility regulations should be borne in mind for this debate, such as the possibility of an earlier review if necessary.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000008"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Deben, the Minister said in the previous debate that the timing and circumstances of the waste review meant that two years was an acceptable period. None the less, if there are ways in which standards can be raised more quickly, that would be of great interest to us.</p>
<h5><a name="110316127000076"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000009"></a>My honourable friend the Member for Copeland, Jamie Reed, quoted the CBI in criticising the Government's timidity in some respects. He said that the CBI,</p>
<ul><a name="110316127000075"></a>"rightly identified a series of quick wins that the country could secure if the Government were bolder and more ambitious-from providing massive business opportunities to helping to meet climate change targets, bolstering our energy security capability and helping to unlock infrastructure investments from the private sector".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Fourth Delegated Legislation Committee, 8/3/11; col. 4.]</ul>
<p><a name="110316127000070"></a>Obviously, the CBI's concerns go wider than these particular than these particular regulations, but none the less it was right to stress the opportunities there are in greening the economy and getting ahead in the business of tackling waste effectively. We do not want a loss of momentum, as the noble Lord, Lord Deben, pointed out in the earlier debate. We want to keep momentum going and accelerate whenever possible.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000010"></a>We have examples elsewhere in the EU of economies seeming to do better with environmental issues and tackling waste. The Federal Republic of Germany has a good record in this respect. It would be good to see us going up in the European league table in this connection. I do not know whether the Minister has any further update on the timing of the Government's waste strategy. In our earlier debate, he said that it might come forward in April or May. It was not clear whether it might come forward before the local elections but, since local authorities are very much affected by these proposals, it would be interesting if the Minister could give us an indication of a precise date for the waste review. There are huge resource implications particularly for local authorities in these measures, and in that respect the impact assessment is very helpful in showing how local authorities are likely to be affected by particular aspects. But local authorities have a lot of choices in implementing these regulations and, while I can understand that it is good for them to be able to judge how best to respond to these requirements-a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler-we do not want that to be at the expense of sacrificing overall standards in making progress. So there is a bit of a dilemma, on which it would be good to hear the Minister comment.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000011"></a>I also recognise what the Minister said about co-mingling, but evidence points to the kerbside recycling system as being better economically and environmentally. I am slightly worried that the achievement of the Government, if I can call it that, in getting co-mingling accepted at European level, might act as a disincentive to local authorities to go to what seems to be the more effective, separate kerbside collections. In separation policies there is the choice between kerbside collections and the bring-bank system-in other words, the separate banks held in a central location in a particular local authority area. I also note that the impact assessment has a variety of costs included with each of these choices. Indeed, the cost ranges are quite large, and I wondered what discussions there were with local authorities to identify ways in which to recycle most effectively but not necessarily at the higher end of the cost scale, as mentioned in the impact assessment.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000012"></a>The target for England by 2020 is, I think, 50 per cent recycling, but the Government expect that target to be exceeded. I note that in Wales the target is 64 per cent. Does it not make sense to consider a more ambitious target in England, particularly if the Government feel that the existing target is likely to be exceeded in any case? I do not know what experience the Minister in charge has of how other countries are tackling these issues. However, it would be good to have an assurance that we will seek to learn lessons from the best-performing countries in the EU regarding this system.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000013"></a>Having said that, these are not at all regulations that we would seek to oppose. However, there are several concerns about how we will move forward in the years ahead, which the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and I have raised, and to which it would be good to get the Minister's response.</p>

<p><a name="110316127000014"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="110316127000083"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her remarks. She asked whether I was pleased to be in charge of waste. My Secretary of State the other day accused me of having become, after just nine months, what she described as a "waste nerd". I had to say yes and took pride in the fact that I had become a waste nerd; it is a subject of great interest to me and should be of great interest to all of us. I hope that this is a matter we will come back to in due course, when the waste review comes out in May. That is our current estimate; the trouble is that May seems very close at hand now but that is when we hope to get it out. It cannot come out in April because of local government elections and the purdah that goes with those. This is a matter that affects local government to a great extent. However, we hope to get it out in May. I hope we will have considerable discussions on the whole subject of waste-on how it should be seen as a resource and not just as waste; how we should dispose of waste; and how we should meet all our commitments. We will deal with those matters at that time. I am not sure that tonight is necessarily the opportunity to go through all that. If we do, I suspect all those waiting to debate Manchester might get somewhat irritated with me because I would take up too much time, having become a waste nerd.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC89"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000015"></a>The noble Baroness also referred to my noble friend Lord Deben, who said that he wanted to make sure there was no loss of momentum. Following that, she referred to various EU comparisons. It is always worth looking at what other countries in the EU are doing and how they deal with these matters. Looking downwards, it is always worth looking at what different local authorities do. By pursuing a policy of localism-which might mean that some authorities do better than others and that there is an element of postcode lottery-rather than trying to impose the same system from above, we can learn new things. Certainly, we look at what is happening in Europe.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000016"></a>It is also worth pointing out that we are not necessarily doing worse than many of our European comparators. Only today I saw some representatives of the packaging industry. They explained to me how well we had done in reducing packaging. After all, reducing waste is the most important part of the whole waste strategy. We have seen virtually no growth in our packaging waste over the past 10 or so years, despite the growth in the economy, whereas most other countries in Europe have. I do not know whether those figures covered England or the UK, but that is an area in which we are doing very well indeed and of which we should be proud. I pay tribute to what the previous Government did and what we shall continue to do when we come forward with our waste review, which I hope the noble Baroness will welcome in due course.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000017"></a>I will deal with one or two of the points that have been made by both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, on this. I can say only mea culpa-or somebody culpa-for what the noble Lord said about the document produced by the Stationery Office not necessarily being printed on recycled paper. That is probably a matter for the Stationery Office. However, I will ask officials to take it up and ask what the Stationery Office is doing about the use of recycled paper. That is important because it is something that Defra is very keen to do, not only by example within the department but by encouraging it throughout the whole government estate, to make sure that we do the right thing. Dare I say at this stage-two or three months before we produce our waste review-that I will give a guarantee that that will be produced on recycled paper and will be as environmentally friendly as it is possible to be?</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000018"></a>The next important point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, echoed by the noble Baroness, Lady Quin, is on this very difficult question of co-mingled waste collection. I appreciate that there are concerns about this. Speaking from my own experience of having been a Minister for Waste for all of nine months, and the number of visits I have made to materials recycling facilities-MRFs, normally shortened to "Merf"-I can say that the technology gain with MRFs is improving by the day. They are getting much better at separating the different recyclables from a co-mingled collection. That is very important, because only some authorities can pursue a policy of having a good kerbside separation which is appropriate for that particular authority and which seems to be the best at giving purer recyclables at the end. Technology will move on and will make  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC90"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>MRFs even better at separating things. In the mean time, we have to accept that different authorities have to do different things.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000019"></a>That is one of the reasons why I am a great believer in localism. I appreciate that my noble friend Lord Tyler said that there were real dilemmas in localism. One point that people always make is that it leads to what is called a postcode lottery. I do not think that that particularly matters, provided that the postcode lottery means that the best ones always get better and encourage the less good ones to follow them upwards. The other advantage of the so-called postcode lottery and of the localism view, which is particularly true in waste collection, is that any idea that the Government imposed their own rules top down would be wrong. We would get it wrong. Different local authorities pursue different ideas-it is almost the Maoist approach of letting 100 flowers bloom. I see the colleague of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, laughing; he hears a Tory talking about flowers. However, having different approaches coming from different authorities allows different ideas to be developed and I believe that that is good.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000020"></a>When I started visiting local authorities and watching the whole collection and disposal process, the first one I visited, not far from me, was Richmondshire in North Yorkshire. It is a very different place from the London borough of Richmond. Similarly, I live in Carlisle, partly an urban and partly a rural seat. It is very different from the other place I live in, Westminster. They offer very different services because of their different nature: the houses are high-rise, or whatever. Local authorities have to do different things, and some will want to pursue the co-mingled route and some another. The assurance we sought from the EU-which I gather the previous Administration also did-is that co-mingled will be satisfactory in terms of dealing with whether this is genuinely recyclable. But that is a matter that will have to be kept under review.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000021"></a>Lastly, may I deal with the question of timing to which my noble friend, Lord Tyler, referred? I appreciate that it is a matter that should have been dealt with by December 2010. However, as I think my honourable friend Mr Benyon made clear in another place, we thought it was better-as did the previous Government-to overplay the consultations to ensure that we got these matters absolutely right, that we were not going to gold-plate the directive and that all our measures were achievable. I hope that with that in mind, as well as the fact that in due course we will be producing our waste review, which I look forward to debating with the noble Baroness and others, the Committee is prepared to accept these regulations.</p>

The establishment of the new combined authority will leave Greater Manchester better placed to tackle its economic challenges and improve public service  delivery.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000023"></a>Part 6 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 enables the creation of economic prosperity boards and combined authorities. These are designed for groups of local authorities that wish to work closely together to deliver improvements in economic development, regeneration and, in relation to combined authorities, transport. They are corporate bodies with their own governance structures. They can be given local authority functions relating to economic development and regeneration and the transport functions available to integrated transport authorities. I should stress that whether to establish a combined authority is a voluntary decision for the local authorities concerned and that Ministers cannot impose combined authorities on areas.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000024"></a>The 10 local authorities of Greater Manchester have a long history of collaboration. For more than 20 years, the voluntary partnership known as the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) has successfully co-ordinated cross-boundary collaboration between the 10 local authorities on a wide range of issues.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000025"></a>The previous Government consulted in March last year on AGMA's proposal to establish a combined authority. The consultation showed strong support for the combined authority from a range of private sector and public sector partners across Greater Manchester. The combined authority has strong support within the business community and has the support of all 10 local authorities in Greater Manchester. In November, we confirmed our intention to support the establishment of the combined authority and to proceed with the order establishing the new authority.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000026"></a>Membership of the combined authority would consist of the 10 local authorities of Greater Manchester. Under the order, each constituent local authority is required to appoint one of its elected members as a member of the authority. The combined authority would be funded through appropriate contributions from each of the 10 local authorities and through the transport levy.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000027"></a>The order would transfer the functions of the integrated transport authority to the combined authority, which would also assume some existing transport functions held by the Greater Manchester local authorities. The order would also devolve to the combined authority certain local authority functions relating to economic development and regeneration. This should ensure more effective alignment between decision-making on transport and that on other areas of policy such as land use, economic development and wider regeneration. In particular, the same authority would determine Greater Manchester's sustainable community strategy and its local transport plan.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000028"></a>The Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority has a good history of delivering and improving transport in Greater Manchester. For example, it manages a concessionary fares scheme for senior, blind, disabled, and young permit holders and organises about 7.5 million school journeys each year. It has masterminded the expansion of the Manchester Metrolink, including important extensions to East Didsbury, Ashton, Rochdale, Oldham and Manchester Airport. However, with the establishment of the combined authority we would see a greater concentration of transport functions across Greater Manchester within one authority. This would help to deliver transport benefits beyond those which the existing integrated transport authority structure can provide.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000029"></a>The new arrangements will allow the combined authority to have much greater influence over the full range of transport infrastructure and services across Greater Manchester. In view of their decision to establish a combined authority, the Government are committed to working with Manchester on a forward-looking programme to examine how Greater Manchester can assume greater responsibilities and influence, comparable to those enjoyed by Transport for London. This agenda will be taken forward through a protocol on heavy rail that facilitates closer working between Greater Manchester and the Department for Transport, and a similar protocol on highways which will facilitate closer working between Greater Manchester and the Highways Agency.</p>

<p><a name="110316127000030"></a>The protocols will provide the basis for the combined authority to plan and develop its transport strategy in full awareness of programmes on national rail networks and the strategic road network in and around Greater Manchester. They will also enable the combined authority to be able to have a real influence on those national programmes, bringing to bear the authority's knowledge of what is needed from transport to facilitate the authority's strategy for promoting economic growth in Greater Manchester.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000031"></a>In October last year, the civic and business leaders of Greater Manchester were invited to proceed with the establishment of their proposed local enterprise partnership. They hope to have their new local enterprise partnership up and running next month. The Greater Manchester combined authority will work in close partnership with the local enterprise partnership to drive economic growth across Greater Manchester. Under Greater Manchester's proposals, the local enterprise partnership will provide strategic direction and leadership in delivering on Greater Manchester's economic priorities. The combined authority will act as the primary accountable body for Greater Manchester and as a repository of certain statutory functions, including those of the integrated transport authority.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000032"></a>We do not anticipate that establishing the combined authority will involve increased costs for the 10 local authorities within Greater Manchester, as a lot of the infrastructure to support the authority is already in place. Indeed, our expectation is that the combined authority will lead to considerable efficiency savings through sharing and avoiding the duplication of services. This is important at a time when public resources are so stretched.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000033"></a>In conclusion, I believe that the new combined authority will leave the local authorities of Greater Manchester better placed to support the delivery of economic improvements across Greater Manchester and to support the ambitions of its local enterprise partnership.</p>

<p><a name="110316127000034"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew30"></a><a name="110316127000086"></a>Lord Smith of Leigh:</b> My Lords, I should first declare a number of interests in this matter. I am leader of one of the 10 Greater Manchester authorities and chairman of the AGMA executive board. Last month, I was appointed chair of the shadow combined authority, because we anticipate the success of the order. We are well into planning for it.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000035"></a>I thank the Minister for the clear and thorough way in which he introduced the order and through him thank the Government for the way in which they reviewed the application for the combined authority for Greater Manchester and for agreeing to it.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000036"></a>There are some familiar faces here. We were in this very Room discussing the Committee stage of the wonderful Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill. That lasted a long time and, in one session, I rather surprised the Minister at the time by saying that, if you want this sort of thing to work, you have to give it some real teeth and real powers; otherwise, what is the point of going through all these processes? Fortunately, the Minister listened and, as a result, the combined authority is a more effective and more accountable form of government.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000037"></a>As the Minister described, with wonderful timing we entered the consultation phase in March last year, which of course straddled the general election. Therefore, there was an impasse before the election but, as I said, we were extremely pleased that the Government listened, and there was overwhelming support for the combined authority from partners in Greater Manchester. The authority shares with the Government the desire to improve the economy of Greater Manchester, and it does so in a number of innovative ways, particularly working with the private sector. We have no quarrels with that. We have a long history in Manchester of working with the private sector. We recently set up the Business Leadership Council, which is a fairly free-flying body. It can criticise AGMA if it does not think that it is responding to the needs of business across the conurbation.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000038"></a>As the Minister said, we have now been working together in AGMA since the abolition of the old met counties in 1986. That means that we have been working together for 25 years. I think that we have become more effective because we have realised that there is more to do. The tyranny of some local boundaries means that, when trying to achieve something locally, you need to think bigger, particularly on economic matters. With the support of the previous Government, there was an independent economic review for Manchester. A group of distinguished economists was able to come and say what was good about the Greater Manchester economy and, perhaps more importantly for all of us, what was not good and what we needed to do. One thing that the economists said we needed to do was to improve the governance, making it stronger, and integrate

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000039"></a>I want to comment on one thing that the Minister said which was not quite correct. In the wake of a very painful experience concerning the congestion charge, in which a referendum was broken, AGMA agreed to set up a Greater Manchester transport fund. It increased the levy from each local authority by 3 per cent above the demands of the service and put it into a transport fund, which was able to pay for the extensions to Metrolink, as the Minister evidenced. Therefore, although it went through the CA, the CA did not pay for it; the AGMA leaders agreed to do that. That is the kind of thing that we will do in the future. Despite the current pressures on local government, we are sustaining that going forward.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000040"></a>We also want to work with the Government on reforming public services, as the Minister said. In particular, we are a pilot for community budgets. We understand the need for work to be done regarding families with complex needs and the great costs that arise for local authorities and government. Often, we just manage a problem; we do not cure it. Therefore, we hope that we will be able to do better work on that. </p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000041"></a>The Minister is absolutely right: we have no intention of setting up a bureaucracy to run the combined authority. We see it as a way of saving in the long term by combining work. A lot of work is going from local authorities' highways services into the new combined authority, and that will produce savings across the board, apart from the general work that we are doing in that regard.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000042"></a>Finally, again, I thank the Government for their foresight. We believe that we can work together with the Government and achieve a lot on this matter.</p>
<h5><a name="110316127000078"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="110316127000043"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="110316127000087"></a>The Lord Bishop of Manchester:</b> My Lords, I have been Bishop of Manchester for eight and a half years now. During that time, I have been increasingly impressed with the way in which the different local authorities in Greater Manchester work together. The further co-ordination that the order will provide in terms of economic regeneration, development and transport is something that is not only a natural progression from all that has previously happened but something that I know will be enormously and widely welcomed within Greater Manchester.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000044"></a>I want to take this opportunity in Committee to pay a public tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, for the considerable work that he has personally done with this co-ordination over the years. He is held in very high regard across the local authorities and his wise guidance is a considerable reason why the different local authorities work so positively together.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000045"></a>I notice that at the end of the Explanatory Memorandum for the draft order it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="110316127000073"></a>"The impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies is expected to be negligible".</p>

<p><a name="110316127000071"></a>I entirely understand why that is said, but I want to add that many people, not least in the churches, will feel that the greater coherence that the order will provide will enhance the work of the voluntary sector. I very much hope that the order will be passed.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC95"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="110316127000046"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew31"></a><a name="110316127000088"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> I obviously support the order. It seems very sensible. In earlier legislation under the Labour Government, I moved amendments to allow the then PTEs to be joint signatories of railway franchises in their areas. I had a lot of support from the PTEs but faced an absolute stone wall from the Minister at the time. There will be huge railway development in Manchester, particularly the northern hub at the centre. It will require great work in Manchester. The Minister mentioned that there would be close working with the DfT, but I would like him to say what that means. In the past, people with experience in Liverpool and Leeds found that that close working led to very expensive delays and people feeling that they were not being helped by the department so much as throttled.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000047"></a>Going forward, when there are large developments, will the department bring itself to treat these large organisations that they are creating as partners rather than servants of the department? I am sorry if that sounds rather unpleasant, but I met several leaders of these authorities at the weekend and they were strong about that. There is an old saying, "I'm from the council: I'm here to help you". But it almost seems to be, "I'm from the department and I'm here to curse you". I would like the Minister to expand on how these freedoms will be exercised.</p>

<p><a name="110316127000048"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew32"></a><a name="110316127000089"></a>Lord Tope:</b> My Lords, I, too, join in the general welcome for this order. I give it our warm and enthusiastic support. It must be as near to perfection as any Government order can achieve. It is enabled by an Act of Parliament passed under a Labour Government. The noble Lord, Lord Smith, recorded the many happy hours we spent on the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill as it then was. I am hugely reassured to know that something good has at last come out of the many hours that we spent on it.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000049"></a>The order is supported by 10 local authorities and all the political parties, by business and now we hear that it has the blessing of the church as well. What more could any Government ever seek to achieve? Furthermore, we know that this is happening, quite rightly, by voluntary means rather than being imposed from above, and there is a strong lesson in that. We hear, too, that not only is it not going to cost more but there is an expectation of savings and that it can all be implemented without any great bureaucracy. This must be as near to perfection as we can ever hope from any government order, and I am sure that there will be nobody who would wish it ill or wish to oppose it on that basis. We give it our enthusiastic support, and I hope that it will show that this is the way of the future and this will be the first but not the last of a move in this direction. We wish it well.</p>

George Orwell would recognise him as an exemplary Wigan Peer if he were to rewrite his book. I also congratulate the Minister and the Government on proceeding with reasonable alacrity to bring forward this order. I have not checked, so I am not sure whether it meets the requirement of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, of being printed on recycled paper. If not, that is the only defect one could possibly  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC96"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>find with it. However, although this was the first order of this kind and there was a change of Government, it is nearly a year since the proposal was made. One would hope that on the basis of the experience of this order, if further applications are made-and I certainly hope that they are-the process will be a little swifter. Otherwise, particularly if there are a number of such applications, it will be quite a long time before they can be dealt with. However, presumably now that government departments have the experience of dealing with the process, it will be speedier.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000051"></a>I must also pay tribute not only to my noble friend but to his colleagues across the political divide in the authorities in Greater Manchester. They had their differences over the congestion charge, as he reminded us, but generally speaking they have worked very well together. I am sure that that will be the case after the pending local elections in May, although whether there will still be the same number of councillors of different political colours remains to be seen. In any event, it is clear that, not for the first time, Greater Manchester has blazed a trail for metropolitan governance in this country. The councils have, of course, a very strong municipal history. Now that they have come together and formed, in effect, a sub-region, those of us who are concerned with other areas of that kind need to watch carefully and learn from that.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000052"></a>I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I strike a slightly partisan note, but it is regrettable that the Secretary of State has seen fit to single out Manchester City Council for, in my view, excessive criticism-not in relation to this proposition but in more general terms. One hopes that the spirit animating the Government in reaching this satisfactory conclusion to the approach from Greater Manchester will be reflected in more measured language in looking at the problems encountered by all the authorities in that area. But of course they have worked successfully for many years, as the Minister and other noble Lords have said. There has been a very striking urban renaissance in Manchester itself and in Salford, which is welcoming hordes of reluctant BBC employees with open arms as the headquarters move there-but also in other parts of the conurbation. As an LGA study some time ago demonstrated, the scale of sub-regional governance is a key factor in bringing together the requirements for the development of the local economy and some of the infrastructure that goes with that, although there are other issues which transcend those boundaries and which need to be considered on a regional basis. In that regard, the structures that have existed will unfortunately no longer exist, and that may slightly impede the success of a very promising venture. Of course, it has to be borne in mind that this takes place against a background of a very difficult financial situation for the authorities.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para149"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000053"></a>My noble friend referred to Community Budgeting, or Total Place, as it was known before it was rebranded after the election. There is certainly potential here to look at problems across the range of public services that might be tackled more effectively, given the fairly cohesive nature of the area, although each borough has its own distinctive character. In the local health economy, for example, the issues of skills and further and higher education are not confined by boundaries. Like my noble friend, I hope that the new organisation  


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC97"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be able to influence developments there. Equally, I hope the Minister will persuade the relevant government departments that they must look outside the traditional silos and co-operate fully in the development of such an approach.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000054"></a>I join all those who have spoken in warmly welcoming this critical development. I hope that others will seek to follow it. I have but one question for the Minister, which relates to the constitution. Manchester city is to be visited with the novel creation of a shadow mayor, assuming the proposal is accepted under the Localism Bill. It is an interesting concept: the shadow mayor has to be appointed and there then has to be confirmation of the position in a referendum, perhaps the following year. However, that applies only to the city of Manchester, which is extremely well led by Sir Richard Leese. He will not be the Mayor of Greater Manchester-the surrounding boroughs will not quite accept that proposition, although I have no doubt that the press will try to portray him in that capacity-nor will anybody who might be elected to that position, if the referendum goes in favour of an elected mayor.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para151"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000055"></a>A question arises from the constitution, on which the noble Lord can perhaps help me. The membership is described as being based on each constituent council appointing one of its elected members to be a member of the new body. Maybe I am being even more pedantic than usual but it is not clear whether a mayor is an elected member of the council. The shadow mayor will be in place for the duration of that year; he is, by definition, a member of that council. If there is an elected mayor, the question then arises of whether he is to be regarded for the purposes of this order as an elected member of the council. He is not an elected member in the way that every other member is an elected member. It may be that this is a point with no substance to it but it might need to be considered. If it is not clear, perhaps some thought might be given to dealing with the situation. If it is clear, that is wonderful-we can all go away happy.</p>

<p><a name="110316127000056"></a><b><a name="110316-gc0001.htm_spnew34"></a><a name="110316127000091"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> It is quite clear that we all arrived happy. It is very nice, as a Minister standing in for a colleague, to get such a warm and congenial reception across the board for a statutory instrument. Perhaps I should volunteer to do this more often. It is a very pleasant experience. It has been interesting, too. I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, for his involvement in Manchester and for the way in which he welcomed this measure. I acknowledge the work of AGMA in serving as a nursery for this. What is so useful about it is the way in which both AGMA and Whitehall have worked together to make a success of the opportunity that the GMCA represents. I hope that that can be built on. During the debate, various noble Lords have suggested ways in which it can be built on. In many ways, it forms a model and is very much the pioneer. Of course, Manchester would say that it is always the pioneer.</p>

<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC98"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column GC98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the grounds that it covered a bit of the history. Therefore, I stand corrected, and the record will note the correction made by the noble Lord, Lord Smith.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000058"></a>I thank the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester for his tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Smith, and the concept of voluntary sector involvement across the Greater Manchester area. In fact, we had a debate in the dinner hour last night on the voluntary sector and the big society bank. The debate highlighted the importance of voluntary and community action. Co-ordinating that with the professional services that local authorities are providing is also very important. As I see it, there are opportunities for a number of functions to work together and form a platform. The authority's powers are of course limited to transport, economic development and sustainable development, but inevitably that will lead to the co-ordination of planning activities and of the location of services. I hope that the local authorities will find that working together creates not only efficiencies but strategic purpose which they can share.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para154"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000059"></a>My noble friend Lord Bradshaw, with his enthusiasm for the railways, hit upon the importance of railway development and, in particular, the northern hub. I think that I can reassure him on that point. The protocols to which I referred will cover that. We are also determined that the local enterprise partnership's involvement will mean that there is proper co-ordination between the investment by Whitehall and the interests of the local community expressed through the local enterprise partnership and the GMCA.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para155"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000060"></a>My noble friend Lord Tope got quite carried away with the perfection of the order. It is most unusual to hear a noble Lord refer to perfection when you are presenting a statutory instrument, but I thank him for his support. He, too, has great experience of local government and I think that he recognises the potential of this model.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para156"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000061"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, for welcoming the measure. It has taken a while but this was the first combined authority to be established under the legislation. Ministers wanted to consider the case for it and see how it fitted in with the new local enterprise partnership policy, and that, probably above all, accounts for the delay. However, I do not think that it has delayed the way in which those on the ground have been getting together, and I am pleased that that is the case.</p>

<a name="110316-gc0001.htm_para157"></a>
<p><a name="110316127000062"></a>We do not object at all to local authorities considering how they can operate across boundaries. We hope that co-operation can be, as it has been in this case, on a bottom-up basis. It has worked well here, and where a community of interests exists, I hope that local authorities will not hesitate to work together for the efficiency and economic prosperity of the areas they represent. That is one of the most important things to come out of this development, which I agree has a cross-party basis to it. There are differences of politics, and I would not share all the views of either the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, or the noble Lord, Lord Smith, but I think that we all recognise that in areas of policy such as this the priority should be to give democratically elected councillors the opportunity, through the services and economic opportunities they offer, to improve the lives of the communities they represent.</p>

<p><a name="110316127000063"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, asked me about a city mayor. As he will know, there are no powers in the order to elect a mayor. Currently, a mayor can be directly elected only for a single authority and on the basis of a referendum. The noble Lord may have been talking about a primus inter pares. I doubt that that would necessarily be appropriate in this area. Any councillor who was at the same time mayor-as the noble Lord will know, you have to be an elected councillor in order to be an elected mayor-</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<a name="11031690000003"></a><b><a name="110316-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="11031690000066"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Astor of Hever):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans (Andrew Robathan) and my honourable friend, the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the honourable Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt) have made the following joint Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="11031690000004"></a>Further to the announcement on 15 September 2010 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 40WS) on the number of ex-service personnel in prison in England and Wales, we want today to announce the findings of the Defence Analytical Services and Advice (DASA) study into the number of former service personnel on probation in England and Wales. DASA estimates that 3.4 per cent (or 5,860) of those supervised by probation trusts in England and Wales, as at 30 September 2009, had previously served as regulars in the UK Armed Forces. The figure has been adjusted upwards to take into account the incompleteness of DASA's service leavers database, which did not hold reliable records for those who had left the services prior to 1979 (Naval Service), 1973 (Army) and 1969 (RAF).</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="11031690000005"></a>The analysis entailed matching the personal details of all 18 year-olds and over with a supervision record held by the 35 probation trusts in England and Wales (172,203 records as at 30 September 2009) against DASA's service leavers database (1.3 million records). Of the matched records, 57 per cent were for community orders; 25 per cent for suspended sentence orders and 18 per cent for post-release licences. DASA also found this group to be predominately male (99 per cent), ex-Army (81 per cent), other rank (99 per cent), with 50 per cent being 35 years of age or over. DASA calculated that for ex-service personnel on probation, the time between discharge from the Armed Forces and the start of their current supervision record varied from zero to 47 years, with 49 per cent having received their supervision record within 10 years of leaving and only 6 per cent within a year of leaving. Information on previous cases of supervision records for these individuals was not available. However, DASA also estimated that, overall, a male member of the general population aged 18-54 was 12 per cent more likely to have a probation supervision record than a former member of the Armed Forces. The proportion of the general population who had probation records for criminal damage was 74 per cent higher than for a veteran. On the other hand, DASA determined that the proportion of ex-service personnel subject to probation supervision records for robbery was 37 per cent higher than the proportion of the general population of similar age group.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="11031690000006"></a>DASA's report is published in full on their website: <a href="http://www.dasa.mod.uk/pub-veterans_on_probation">www.dasa.mod.uk/pub-veterans_on_probation</a>. A copy of the report will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="11031690000007"></a><b><a name="110316-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="11031690000067"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Astor of Hever):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Liam Fox) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="11031690000008"></a>I wish to inform the House that repatriation ceremonies for those killed in operational theatres will move from RAF Lyneham to RAF Brize Norton by 1 September 2011.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="11031690000009"></a>The Ministry of Defence is committed to recognising the sacrifice made by service personnel on operations and part of that commitment is to ensure that there is a formal repatriation ceremony, which is a solemn occasion to provide the appropriate level of dignity and respect when the body returns to the UK.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="11031690000010"></a>For the past three and a half years, repatriation ceremonies have taken place at RAF Lyneham. The Ministry of Defence announced in July 2003 that RAF Lyneham will be closing as part of defence estate rationalisation and therefore following a detailed option study it has been decided that the most appropriate airbase for future repatriation ceremonies would be RAF Brize Norton. This move will take effect by 1 September 2011, before the cessation of flying operations at RAF Lyneham.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="11031690000011"></a>I would like to thank RAF Lyneham for its excellent work in supporting the important task of repatriation ceremonies. I am certain that RAF Brize Norton will maintain the standard of solemnity, dignity and respect to our service personnel killed on operations as shown by the personnel at RAF Lyneham. I would also like to record publicly my thanks to the people of Wootton Bassett, who have chosen to pay their respects in a unique and special way. It is such spontaneous public support that captures the spirit of the British people. I am very grateful for those who have participated; such gestures do not go unnoticed by those deployed on operations.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="11031690000013"></a>I am today placing in the Library certificates of destruction from contractors confirming compliance with Section 3 of the Identity Documents Act 2010. These certificates are accompanied by a covering note that sets out the process and method of delivery of destruction of the National Identity Register.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="11031690000014"></a>I can also confirm that all ID cards ceased to be valid legal documents on 22 January 2011. Cardholders were notified by post to their registered address shortly after enactment of the 2010 Act and border agencies and other interested parties were informed of the cancellation of the scheme.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="11031690000015"></a>The cost of decommissioning ID card systems and securely destroying the personal data is, subject to final invoices, £375,000. The cost of terminating and amending National Identity Service contracts with

I will also be placing in the Library a copy of a letter sent on 10 February 2011 to the honourable Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch that sets out the breakdown of these costs in more detail.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="11031690000076"></a>Immigration</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="11031690000016"></a><b><a name="110316-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="11031690000069"></a>The Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Neville-Jones):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Immigration (Damian Green) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="11031690000017"></a>My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is today laying before Parliament a statement of changes in the Immigration Rules that will reshape tier 1 of the points-based system (PBS) for migration, tighten the requirements of tier 2 of the PBS, and tighten criteria for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. The changes also include a route of entry for family reunion for those granted protection, and will reduce the re-entry ban for immigration offenders who leave promptly and facilitate visits by diplomatic and special passport holders from Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The statement of changes will take effect from 6 April 2011.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="11031690000018"></a>This Government are committed to reducing net migration in the UK to the tens of thousands. We review all routes of entry to the UK and implement a range of measures spanning all aspects of the immigration system.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="11031690000019"></a>In July 2010 the Government implemented an interim limit on tier 1 general and tier 2 general of the points-based system. These measures were taken to prevent a surge in applications through these routes whilst the Government consulted on the design of a mechanism to operate a permanent limit on non-EU economic migrants.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="11031690000020"></a>The UK Border Agency consulted employers in all sectors and received around 3,200 responses. Those responses helped shape the new tier 1 and 2 policies that formed the basis of the Home Secretary's statement on 23 November and were elaborated upon in our tier 2 statement of intent published on 16 February. I will today place a copy of our tier 1 statement of policy in the House Libraries, along with the impact assessment for the tier 1, tier 2 and settlement changes. The policies detailed in the statements will be given effect by the Immigration Rules laid before Parliament today.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="11031690000022"></a>Tier 1 is being refocused to provide a route for migrants that have real value to offer the UK.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="11031690000023"></a>In support of the principle that all non-EEA workers should be sponsored by their employer, we will close tier 1 general to new applicants from 6 April. We closed the route to new applicants out of country on 23 December. Transitional measures will be put in place to ensure that tier 1 general migrants already in the UK will be able to extend their stay so long as they meet the requirements in place at the point they entered.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="11031690000024"></a>Current tier 1 investor and entrepreneur categories will be reformed to fit the profile of the high value migrants they are intended for and to ensure that unnecessary bureaucracy does not stand in the way of these important individuals.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS14"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column WS14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="11031690000025"></a>Investors will continue to qualify for settlement after five years if they have invested £1,000,000 in the UK. Additionally, those who have invested £10,000,000 will be able to apply for settlement after the investment is in place for two years. Those investing £5,000,000 will be able to apply after the investment is in place for three years. Allowable absences will be increased from 90 to 180 days, enabling international business people to better manage their affairs abroad.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="11031690000026"></a>A new prospective entrepreneur visa will be introduced to allow entrepreneurs to come to the UK to secure funding. Switching into the tier 1 entrepreneur category will be allowed.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="11031690000027"></a>For the tier 1 entrepreneur category, the existing £200,000 funding threshold will be reduced to £50,000 where the funding was provided by a venture capitalist, a government department or a seed competition. Up to two business partners will be able to use the route if they have equal access to the funding. Finally, successful entrepreneurs who create 10 full-time jobs or have a turnover of £5,000,000 will be able to apply for settlement after three years.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="11031690000028"></a>A new category for exceptionally talented migrants working in science or the arts will be introduced in tier 1. The scheme will be administered by competent bodies in the arts and science. We will announce the details of these organisations in due course. We will apply a limit of 1,000 places in the first year. That limit, and the success of the route, will be monitored throughout the first year.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="11031690000029"></a><I>Tier 2</I></p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="11031690000030"></a>The number of certificates of sponsorship available for out of country migrants in tier 2 general will be limited to 20,700 for the year from 6 April.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="11031690000031"></a>The route will be reserved for graduate-level occupations only. On Monday we announced that we have accepted the Migration Advisory Committee's recommendations on graduate-level occupations on the current shortage occupation list. I have also asked the MAC to undertake a full review of the shortage occupation list.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="11031690000032"></a>In addition the minimum English language requirement for tier 2 general will be raised to B1 on the CEFR scale.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="11031690000033"></a>The limit will be operated on a monthly basis. Four thousand and two hundred places have been reserved for the first month and 1,500 places per month there after. When the limit is undersubscribed in a given month the places will be carried over to the next month. Where the limit is oversubscribed we will prioritise according to scarcity of skills in the first instance and then according to salary. Scientists, academics and researchers will be afforded an additional premium. A points table will give effect to this prioritisation.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="11031690000034"></a>The tier 2 intra-company transfer route will be reshaped and focused on specialists and managers. Transferees will be able to come to the UK for up to five years if they are paid over £40,000, including allowances. Other transferees will be able to enter for up to 12 months if paid £24,000 or more. There will be a 12-month cooling off period at the end of the migrants' stay to prevent individuals being perpetually sent to the UK for 12-month periods.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="11031690000035"></a>Transitional arrangements will ensure that the new requirements do not apply to those granted a tier 2 visa before 6 April.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="11031690000036"></a><I>Settlement</I></p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="11031690000037"></a>On settlement the rules change applies a new criminality threshold to settlement applications requiring all applicants to be clear of unspent convictions, and also extends the income criteria that apply to those on a temporary route so that it also applies when they apply for settlement, and to require such applicants to pass the life in the UK test prior to gaining settlement, subject to some transitional provisions.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="11031690000038"></a><I>Re-entry bans</I></p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="11031690000039"></a>I am also introducing an amendment to the Immigration Rules relating to the general grounds for refusal. The existing re-entry ban for those previously removed from the UK is being amended to make it clear that where migrants participate in an assisted voluntary return programme or leave otherwise voluntarily, we expect them to do so promptly after being told to leave the UK. Those who voluntarily leave the UK promptly at public expense will have their re-entry ban reduced from five years to two years. Those who continue to delay receive a five year or 10 year re-entry ban. This addition seeks to bring cases to a conclusion earlier by providing a clear incentive for people to depart from the UK sooner and increase participation in assisted voluntary return programmes.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="11031690000041"></a>There are also changes to the Immigration Rules in respect of certain family members of refugees and those granted humanitarian protection, where the family relationship arose after the sponsor in the United Kingdom left his or her home country.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="11031690000043"></a>I have also made provision to enable nationals of Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates who hold a diplomatic passport to be able to come to the United Kingdom for a visit without the need for a visa. This will facilitate travel and close working relations between these passport holders and the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="11031690000055"></a>The coalition Government are committed to reducing the number and cost of quangos and increasing accountability by transferring the responsibility for key decisions of public policy back to Ministers.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="11031690000056"></a>On 14 October 2010, I placed in the Libraries of both Houses a list of proposed reforms to take forward this commitment. The Public Bodies Bill has since been introduced to provide the legislative basis for reform. I have also placed in the Libraries an updated list of proposed reforms this morning.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="11031690000057"></a>Committees of both Houses have shown significant interest in the Government's review. This Statement accompanies our response to a report of the Public Administration Select Committee, <I>S</I><I>maller Government: Shrinking the Quango S</I><I>tate</I>.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="11031690000058"></a>The Government welcome this opportunity to restate the aims and intentions of our reform programme for public bodies and to correct some misunderstandings and inaccuracies apparent in that report.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="11031690000059"></a>With these reforms, we will increase accountability by putting into practice our clear presumption that functions carried out by the state should be accountable through democratically elected structures. We will ensure clear chains of democratic accountability through to Ministers by transferring functions into a department or by creating a new executive agency. We will also increase accountability to local decision makers and will also support our big society, transferring functions from public bodies to local government, voluntary or charitable bodies or social enterprises.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="11031690000060"></a>A secondary, but important, purpose is to remove duplication and waste, to save taxpayers' money and to streamline a chaotic and confusing public bodies landscape.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="11031690000061"></a>The PASC has criticised the Government for being unable to identify exact cost savings. We were always clear that savings would flow from this programme of rationalisation and reform. I can now announce that we estimate that cumulative administrative savings of £2.6 billion will flow from public bodies over the spending review period. When reductions in programme and capital spend are taken into account, we estimate that total spending through public bodies will be reduced by at least £11 billion per year by 2014-15, a cumulative amount of £30 billion over the spending review period. This does not include spending simply transferred elsewhere.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="11031690000062"></a>At the time of the October announcement, I indicated that a number of reviews were still in progress, with bodies listed as under consideration. I publish with this   


<notus-date day="16" month="3" year="2011" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS18"></a><b>16 Mar 2011 : Column WS18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Statement an updated list of reform proposals that give more certainty to the staff in those public bodies as to how the Government's review programme will affect them.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="11031690000063"></a>Implementation is being taken forward by departments, with the Cabinet Office operating as a source of support and guidance. I publish two key Cabinet Office documents today: a checklist of issues that departments need to consider in implementing public bodies reform; and a set of eight key requirements that must be followed in all cases. These requirements are annexed to the Government's response to the PASC.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="11031690000064"></a>The Government's commitment to the reform of public bodies does not end with the implementation  of this first stage of reform proposals. I also publish today a summary of a new robust system of triennial reviews and underline our determination to take decisive action where future reviews highlight inefficiency and waste. The Government intend that the powers in the Public Bodies Bill will provide a proportionate mechanism to implement the conclusions of subsequent reviews.</p>

<a name="110316-wms0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="11031690000065"></a>Reducing the number and cost of public bodies is a coalition priority. It is important that we make progress, and I make no excuse for the speed at which we have sought to realise our commitment. There is momentum and cross-party support for a radical programme of reform. We have already brought forward proposals on an unprecedented scale and with the Public Bodies Bill and our implementation plans we take those proposals to fruition. With our future process of review and reform, we will continue to ensure accountability in public life and identify and drive out inefficiency, duplication and waste.</p>

<a name="110316w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="110316118000005"></a>The first level of clinical assessment of mental health problems is provided by primary care services and the unit medical officer. Diagnosis or suspicion of PTSD would nearly always lead to referral to one of the military departments of community mental health (DCMH). There are 15 DCMHs across the UK, which provide out-patient mental healthcare exclusively to service personnel. These teams are made up of psychiatrists and mental health nurses, with support from clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. A wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available, including medication, psychological therapies, including cognitive behaviour therapy and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy, and environmental adjustment. The MoD works with a group of NHS trusts, led by Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Foundation Trust, to provide in-patient care in specialised psychiatric units. These arrangements mean that most patients can be treated near their units.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="110316118000006"></a>Reservists once demobilised are able to access the MoD provided mental health services through the Reserves Mental Health Programme (RMHP). The RMHP is open to any current or former member of the UK Volunteer and Regular Reserves who has been demobilised since 1 January 2003 following an operational deployment as a reservist, and who believes that the deployment may have adversely affected their mental health. Under the RMHP, we liaise with the individual's GP and offer a mental health assessment at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell in Nottinghamshire. If diagnosed to have a combat- related mental health condition, we then offer treatment via one of the MoD's DCMHs.</p>

These include more NHS veterans mental health nurses providing outreach and treatment; follow-up of service leavers 12 months after discharge, a 24 hour mental health helpline and enhanced service medical procedures to help identify mental health problems during service and prior to discharge, and where necessary treatment at DCMHs for up to six months following discharge.</p>
