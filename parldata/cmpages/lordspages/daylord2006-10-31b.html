special protection areas for birds, 65 marine special areas of
conservation and three statutory marine nature

Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, I thank the
Minister for his reply. Natural England advised Defra to close some 60
square miles of Lyme Bay, where the seabed containing some of the most
vulnerable marine life, including sea corals, sponges and all sorts of
wonderful things, was being destroyed by scallop dredging. That advice
was supported by the Southern Sea Fisheries Committee, so the closure
was supported by both environmental and economic interests. How does
the noble Lord explain the Minister&#146;s inexplicable response of
closing only three small areas, making enforcement extremely difficult,
and of closing them to all activity, including crab potting, line
fishing and recreational angling? Is not Defra&#146;s approach
nonsense?</p><p><a name="06103159000018"></a><b><a name="61031-0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06103159000814"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness is
misinformed. English Nature requested closure because of the pink sea
fan, not because of the reef. That was done, and in fact four small
areas containing 92 per cent of the known pink sea fan
sites&#151;part of the corals&#151;have been protected. The reef is
at risk, but we were not asked to deal with that. That will come later,
but so far the case has not been made for it. As I said, English Nature
did not request us to do what the noble Baroness
implied.</p><p><a name="06103159000019"></a><b><a name="61031-0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06103159000815"></a>Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean:</b> My Lords, is the Minister
aware that this year a number of salmon grilse of extraordinary light
weight have been caught? It is believed by many that the sand eel
population is being scooped up by factory ships and turned into oil and
that that is having a very damaging effect on the fish species further
up the food chain. Will Defra look again at the problem of sand eels,
which are very important for the fish and bird
populations?</p>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and

language development is crucial to maximising children&#146;s life
chances. Some children require support from speech and language
professionals, and often it makes sense to provide those services in
Sure Start children&#146;s centres and in schools. The decision on
the location of speech and language professionals is for primary care

and given that if they cannot speak fluently it is very hard for them
to learn how to read fluently, which can lead to social exclusion and
even crime, what workforce arrangements are in place to ensure
collaborative working between health and educational professionals, so
that they can jointly deliver services? Secondly, as early intervention
is so important, how many speech and language professionals are already
in place in children&#146;s centres and how many have advanced plans
to have
them?</p><p><a name="06103159000032"></a><b><a name="61031-0001.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="06103159000828"></a>Lord

know, there are now more than 1,000 Sure Start children&#146;s
centres up and running, and a good number of them have speech and
language therapists in place. We do not have the breakdown of the
figures for speech and language therapists by location, but with plans
to increase the number of children&#146;s centres to 2,500 in 2008
and to 3,500 by 2010, we would expect to see steadily more speech and
language therapists employed therein. It is the responsibility of local
children&#146;s trusts, which bring together the local authority, the
education service and the local NHS, to plan that provision locality by
locality.</p><p><a name="06103159000033"></a><b><a name="61031-0001.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="06103159000829"></a>Baroness

the only chance of preventing a lifetime of stammering and heavy social
and economic disadvantage. How does he respond to the Royal College of
Speech and Language Therapists, which says that six out of 10 NHS
speech therapy departments are too under-resourced to plan for or to
meet demand and that half say that the standard of their service has
significantly declined?</p>

importance of early intervention. My department has paid for and
distributed in each local authority new materials to promote early
intervention among practitioners, including <I>Communicating

my noble friend&#146;s points about the resourcing of centres, the

not available before. As I say, we have plans to increase that 1,000 to

Warnock:</b> My Lords, I am sure
that the Minister is aware of the enormous importance of learning songs

of research shows that children with a small vocabulary increase it
enormously if there is singing in class. Can the Minister suggest ways
in which primary school and reception class teachers can be encouraged
to get children singing as a way of improving their vocabulary and

Inspections Bill at 11.30 last night, the issue of singing was to the
fore, with contributions from many noble Lords.</p><p><a name="06103159000040"></a>This is a vital area of
work by local authority music services. For example, the Manchester
Music Service, which I visited recently, has exemplary materials, now
available nationally, for training ordinary primary school
teachers&#151;without their being trained as vocal teachers&#151;in
singing. That has a great capacity to be extended nationwide. The
recent report by the Music Manifesto champion, Marc Jaffrey,
particularly highlighted the room for expanding singing in primary
schools, and we intend to take that
forward.</p><p><a name="06103159000041"></a><b><a name="61031-0001.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="06103159000835"></a>Lord
Avebury:</b> My Lords, has the
Minister noted the prevalence of speech, language and communication
difficulties among young offenders, as highlighted in the Unstarred
Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, last Friday? Many of
these problems had been undiagnosed before the young offender came into
an institution. Does that not indicate that, in spite of the increase
in provision under this Government explained by the Minister, it is
still inadequate?</p>

enters the mouth, where it is mixed with saliva, often with respiratory
pathogens and occasionally with blood, if you have recently been to a
dentist for teeth cleaning. It is masticated and then given its exit in
the form of excrement. This excrement is either spat on to the pavement
or disposed of in other ways and carries with it certain dangers. As it
hits the pavement, it is commonly or colloquially known as a
&#147;gum turd&#148;. This gum turd may retain viruses and bacteria
for as long as it is wet. Then it becomes a &#147;flat&#148;, and
then it is cleaned up at a cost of maybe 50p per piece or less if there
is a major discount for 30 pieces per square metre.</p><p><a name="06103159000052"></a>Will the Minister confirm that there is

biodegradable. The manufacturers keep promising to make biodegradable
gum, but we see no evidence that they are doing anything to that
effect. It costs local authorities a fortune&#151;on average, I
understand about &#163;13,000 per local authority. With the number of
authorities, that is about &#163;5 million to clear the stuff up. It
lasts, I am told, on the street for something like three or four years.
It is expensive to clean. Some local authorities have used people on
community service orders to try to clean it up. It is unsightly if it
gets on clothes and shoes. It is a very anti-social way of disposing of
something that one has purchased. Ninety-one per cent of our high
streets are affected, according to samples. It is a serious issue, and
it is going to look a right mess, particularly all over London, as we

expensive for Westminster Council as, indeed, it is for some of the big
urban councils. Obviously too many anti-social, uncaring people are
disposing of gum this way when there are other ways of disposing of it.
Some local authorities have gum stickers on lamp posts and other kinds
of things where you stick the gum and it then gets cleared up. So there
are disposable products that local authorities can use to assist people
and direct them in the right way to dispose of the
gum.</p><p><a name="06103159000064"></a><b><a name="61031-0001.htm_spnew44"></a><a name="06103159000855"></a>Baroness

and practical suggestion. When the Government introduce their next

enable fixed penalty notices to be issued. I do not have any figures,
but I understand that some people have been issued with fixed penalty
notices for dumping gum. It is classified legally as litter. Some
people have been given on-the-spot fines. I cannot say that it is
working&#151;although it has started operating&#151;as you can

looking to do just that. They have fined some people and publicised it
locally to deter this appalling habit. Does the Minister agree that, if
there is to be sponsorship from chewing gum companies, an appropriate
place for the sponsorship would be on the little machines that go
around clearing up the stuff? Perhaps he would be interested to learn
that in the borough of Pendle, where I am a councillor, there is an
excellent little machine called Doris, which goes around removing all
the graffiti. It is accompanied on its tour every week by the
gumbuster. Doris and the gumbuster do a brilliant job, but it is very
expensive. If it could be sponsored by the people who are basically
responsible for the gum; that would certainly help local authorities

on the majority of expenditure. We are considering with the National
Audit Office how member states and the European Commission might better
manage EU funds at the national level and so provide the ECA with the

waste, not to mention fraud, in the Commission&#146;s spending, with,
for example, payments on non-existent farm animals and material errors
in over two-thirds of structural funds? Will the Government now concede
that the climb-down last December, which resulted in our pouring more

the noble Baroness&#146;s latter point; I do not think that she
seriously expects me to. We are not complacent about the issue.
Important steps need to be taken so that assurance can be forthcoming
in due course. The target date for the European Commission is for a
statement of assurance to be positive by 2009&#151;still too far in
the future. Developments have taken place recently&#151;for example,
the new accrual accounting system, the integrated internal control
framework and the single audit concept&#151;but there is still more
to be done. Although I do not have time to deal with the issue now, the
suggestion that 65 per cent, or two-thirds, of expenditure is subject
to material error needs to be seen in the context of the criteria used
for
materiality.</p><p><a name="06103159000080"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew60"></a><a name="06103159000871"></a>Lord

assurance considers two things. The first is whether the financial

with the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions and the
process&#151;which, I suggest, is not an integral part of most
company audits. Here, the materiality concept is important because the
Commission considers samples of expenditure, and, if the error rate is
0.5 to 2 per cent, the whole expenditure is counted as not approved. We
need to understand how that judgment is
made.</p><p><a name="06103159000082"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew62"></a><a name="06103159000873"></a>Lord
Tomlinson:</b> My Lords, does my noble friend agree
that the two examples given by the noble Baroness were thoroughly bad
ones? Agriculture and the structural funds are two of the large areas
of expenditure in the European budget dispensed through the member
states. If we are to get that correctness in the statement of
assurance, much greater responsibility lies with the member states,
which are responsible for 80 per cent of the disbursement of the
European budget. We ought to be pointing the finger at where the
responsibility lies, not just using the European Union as an alibi for
our prejudices whenever it is

absolutely right, which is why the UK is working with Denmark and the
Netherlands to provide better assurance for funds at member level.
There have been developments. For example, Wales entered into the first
contract of confidence with the Commission, which concerned improving
the internal control systems and having those approved in advance, an
audit strategy agreed for the whole period and an annual report of the
implementation strategy. My noble friend is right: member states are
responsible for the bulk of the expenditure, and it is there that most
of the problems
lie.</p><p><a name="06103159000084"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew64"></a><a name="06103159000875"></a>Lord

John Bourne, head of the National Audit Office, said last week that if

a single EU account, although that may not be the precise mechanism
adopted. This is about ensuring that the systems that operate at
member-state level are an integral part of the overall systems that the
Commission seeks to apply. They are important matters, and the
Government are addressing them. The Wales example that I cited earlier
is one approach to tackling that
problem.</p><p><a name="06103159000086"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew66"></a><a name="06103159000877"></a>Lord

that this will also pave the way for handling Motion A with similar
ease in your Lordships&#146; House today.</p><p><a name="06103159000107"></a>Moved, That the House

Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, bearing in mind the
recent question asked by my noble friend Lady O&#146;Cathain of the
Chairman of Committees, the House might perhaps just need a slight
flavour of the matter that we are debating. When I pressed this to a
Division on 17 May, I was concerned about the process that the
Government have adopted to designate a locality as an alcohol disorder
zone. Amendment No. 27 would have ensured that a local authority could
not act in a pre-emptive way when it wished to go through all the
bureaucratic hoops that could lead almost inexorably to the imposition
of an alcohol disorder zone on an area where licensees trade.</p><p><a name="06103159000109"></a>Since the House decided in favour of my
amendment way back in May, we have had further opportunities to debate
the designation process on Report. In addition, the Minister has made
it possible for the Wine and Spirit Trade Association and the British
Retail Consortium to meet those involved in preparing the regulations
that will deliver so much of this part of the Bill. I should like to
put on record my

This part of the Bill would have had a much rockier passage had it not
been for his activity.</p><p><a name="06103159000110"></a>I am also grateful to
the Wine and Spirit Trade Association and the BRC for keeping me
informed of progress at all stages. They and their vast membership
understand that while an alcohol licence brings opportunities, it also
carries significant responsibilities. They have made it clear to me
that ensuring that these responsibilities are met is a clear priority
for members of both organisations and that, through the trade
associations and through their own individual company policies, they
seek to demonstrate their responsible retailing approach. They have
made it clear that tackling under-age sales in particular, which was of
concern to noble Lords, is top of their agenda.</p><p><a name="06103159000111"></a>In November 2005, they
set up the Retail of Alcohol Standards Group to provide the industry
with a forum to share best practice and develop new ideas in the fight
to reduce under-age sales. It has been recognised that this group has
made excellent progress including, first, retraining on how to sell
alcohol legally and appropriately; and, secondly, commissioning
research to help members to understand why, despite training and
significant resources devoted to stopping under-age sales, such sales
continue to happen on occasions. This research has been shared with the
Home Office and other stakeholders&#151;a favourite government
word&#151;and they are taking positive steps to implement the
recommendations.</p><p><a name="06103159000112"></a>It
is vital that the licensing trade and the Government work closely and
constructively on the regulations as they are promulgated and on the
guidance that will be brought into effect as a result of this Bill. I
was therefore grateful to receive last week fromMr
McNulty&#151;the Minister in another place&#151;a letter setting
out his policy position that the Government are sympathetic to the
intention behind my amendment and that they wish to do all that they
can to avoid designations being necessary. It is important that ADZs
are treated as the very last resort and that they donot treat
responsible and irresponsible licensees alike. Mr McNulty maintained in
his letter that the intention behind my amendment could be covered by
guidance. He sent to me the extract from guidance that the Government
have developed with the WSTA. It was in the light of that, plus the
Government's further assurances that followed that they would continue
to work with the retail trade on the regulations and guidance, that I
indicated to the Government that I would not seek to oppose their
Motion today, and I do
not.</p><p><a name="06103159000113"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew78"></a><a name="06103159000889"></a>Lord

remind the House that I have an interest as a serving officer in the
TA&#151;indeed, I shall be on exercise this weekend.</p><p><a name="06103159000120"></a>In Committee, I explored the legal
defence of lawful excuse and reasonable excuse in respectof
military offences under the Bill. On the first day of our
deliberations, the Minister
said:</p><ul><a name="06103159000267"></a>&#147;Existing Clause 1
gives a defence of &#145;lawful excuse&#146;, which would allow a
defence that an accused had express or implied authority or whose
action is justified by
law&#148;.</ul><a name="06103159000248"></a>He went on to
say:<ul><a name="06103159000268"></a>&#147;&#145;Reasonable
excuse&#146; gives a wider defence which would allow a court martial
to look at all the circumstances and decide whether the conduct of the
accused was reasonable&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
24/7/06; col. 1596.]</ul><a name="06103159000249"></a>The
problem is that when a superior officer gives me a mission, he will
give me express tasks and he will give me implied tasks. He will also
give me express authority. Perhaps he will give me some troops and
equipment, or maybe he will give me wider rules of engagement. But he
will also give me implied authority to do anything that is reasonable
in order to achieve the mission. To determine whether I have implied
authority to take a given course of action, I have to ask myself: would
I be acting within my commander&#146;s intent, and perhaps his
commander&#146;s intent? To put it another way, if I was in a
situation and I was able to ask my commander for his express authority,
would he grant it? But the test that my commander would apply would be:
is this a reasonable request; does my subordinate want to take a
reasonable course of action?
<p><a name="06103159000121"></a>In Committee, I tested Clause 1(1)(d),
which makes it an offence to provide the enemy with supplies. In my
then Amendment No. 6, I suggested that medical supplies should be
exempt from this provision. The Minister responded by saying:</p><ul><a name="06103159000269"></a>&#147;Where it is proper to give an
enemy medical treatment, that is already covered by &#145;lawful
excuse&#146;&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/7/06; col.
1596.]</ul><a name="06103159000250"></a>But
of course the test will be one of reasonableness, and that is what I am
suggesting in my amendment: we should have a test of reasonable excuse,
not lawful excuse. If the test is not to be one of reasonableness, what
other test could be applied? Clause 4 covers looting. There is also
here a defence of &#147;without lawful excuse&#148;, but let us
suppose that I am leading a patrol and one of my men damages his watch.
The nature of the mission dictates that a watch is essential. We meet
friendly forces with prisoners of war and I order that one of the POWs
be relieved of his watch. Ideally, I would give the POW a receipt if
circumstances permitted. My commander, when giving me the mission, 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_168"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would never have anticipated the need for me to relieve a POW of his
watch, but I think that my course of action would be okay because I
would have the implied authority to do anything reasonable to achieve
the mission.<p><a name="06103159000122"></a>Amendments Nos. 7
and 8 provide for a defence of reasonable excuse rather than lawful
excuse, and all the other amendments seek to do exactly the same. I
shall not weary your Lordships by describing a possible scenario for
each of them, but I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to
say. Further, could he describe a possible situation where a court
martial might not or could not convict without only the narrower
defence being available; that is, can he outline a circumstance where
the court martial could convict if it was without lawful excuse, but in
the same situation could not convict if it was without reasonable
excuse? I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103159000123"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew80"></a><a name="06103159000891"></a>Lord
Astor of Hever:</b> My Lords, I welcome my noble
friend&#146;s amendments. As my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew
said in Committee, one of the principal aims of the Bill is to provide
clarity for service people. It would seem right, therefore, that the
same term should be used in each case, rather than
&#147;lawful&#148; in some instances and &#147;reasonable&#148;
in
others.</p><p><a name="06103159000124"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew81"></a><a name="06103159000892"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, we have some
sympathy with these amendments but perhaps the same position might be
met in a different way&#151;that it be recognised that there is a
duty on the new Director of Service Prosecutions to act reasonably in
bringing a prosecution. It is not in every instance necessary to
prosecute someone for a breach of one of the provisions of the Bill.
If&#151;as perhaps has not always happened&#151;the Director of
Service Prosecutions were to act reasonably in making his decision, the
fears of the noble Earl would be
met.</p><p><a name="06103159000125"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="06103159000893"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> My Lords, as I
explained to the noble Earl in Committee, and as he correctly quoted,
we believe that the existing clauses as drafted give the defence of
lawful excuse, which is intended to allow a defence that an accused had
express or implied authority or that his action was justified by law.
Unfortunately, I do not have the military experience of the noble Earl
and so, on the Floor of the House, I do not think that it would be
appropriate for me to come up with military examples such as he
describes. He has given a number of examples as we have discussed this
matter, but I do not intend to go through them in detail and detain the
House. Suffice it to say that we believe that the term &#147;lawful
excuse&#148; is sufficient to cover the circumstances that he has
described.</p><p><a name="06103159000126"></a>As the noble Earl
said, &#147;reasonable excuse&#148; would give a wider defence and
allow a court martial to look at all the circumstances and to decide
whether it thought that the accused&#146;s conduct was reasonable.
The offences of assisting the enemy and obstructing operations are very
serious, as they could potentially have a catastrophic effect on
operational effectiveness and may, in the worst case, result in loss of
life in our

that it was open to him to consider whether, for example, it was
&#147;reasonable&#148; for him to give an enemy information that
would be useful to it. I am sure that noble Lords will appreciate that
the matters that are prohibited in Clauses 1 and 3 are so central to
the operational effectiveness of our services and their operations that
there is no room for grey areas. As the clauses are drafted, it is
clear to all servicemen that they must not do these things unless a
clear legal reason exists.</p><p><a name="06103159000127"></a>I share the view of
the noble Lord, Lord Astor, about the importance of the Bill in
providing clarity to our Armed Forces. We believe that the Bill gives
such clarity. These are not matters that can be open to debate or
personal discretion. What one man considers to be reasonable may be
completely unreasonable when other matters are considered. In the
present environment in which our Armed Forces so often operate, it
would be unreasonable of us to place the burden on them of having to
weigh up such decisions. It is far better that we give clear direction
to the services on these matters&#151;and that direction is that the
matters listed in Clauses 1 and 3 are prohibited in the absence of a
lawful excuse.</p><p><a name="06103159000128"></a>I strongly
believe that it is appropriate that the narrower defence should apply
to both those offences and, for the reasons stated, I cannot support
the amendments. I urge the noble Earl to
reconsider.</p><p><a name="06103159000129"></a>The remaining
amendments in the group&#151;Amendments Nos. 7 to 10, 20, 24 to 26
and 29&#151;raise issues similar to the ones to which I have
responded in my reply to Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 5 and I do not
propose to go further and detain the House by repeating myself. I
reinforce our belief that the narrower offence of lawful excuse should
be applied to the offences to which the noble Earl Attlee has drawn
attention. Offences that would be affected by these amendments are also
likely to be the subject of orders, such as standing orders, which do
not allow for personal discretion or
debate.</p><p><a name="06103159000130"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew83"></a><a name="06103159000894"></a>Earl

is called deception. Sometimes it fails, especially at a low level, and

your Lordships of the declaration of interest I made at the beginning
of Committee: I am an advocate practising from time to time in courts
martial.</p><p><a name="06103159000138"></a>In Committee I sought
to introduce into Clause 3 a statutory defence to the effect that a
person would have a defence if he could prove that the action with
which he was concerned was illegal. Having listened to your Lordships
and to the Minister, I preferred the far simpler, more direct approach
of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, in his amendment in Committee to Clause
8. That would make it absolutely clear that the action or operations
referred to in Clause 3 must be lawful.</p><p><a name="06103159000139"></a>It is no defence for a defendant to
suggest that he was only obeying orders. If those orders are illegal
and unlawful but he nevertheless carries them out, he is still guilty
of an offence which may be as high as an offence against humanity. If
that is the clear position in law, the corollary of it is that if a
person is given an illegal order and instead of acting upon it and
committing an offence, he refuses to obey it, he ought to be able, in
the course of any criminal proceedings that are brought against
him&#151;whether they are for obstructing operations or, as we shall
come to later, for mutiny&#151;to require the prosecution to show
that the action or operation that he was ordered to carry out was not
lawful. It should be made clear to the prosecution that that is the
position. Should the issue ever arise as to the legality of an act or
operation the defendant is ordered to carry out, or even his
participation in an illegal war, he is entitled to take that defence
and argue it before the
courts.</p><p><a name="06103159000140"></a>In
Committee, your Lordships may recall the suggestion, particularly from
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, that the Attorney-General must
be the final arbiter of whether a war, an invasion, an act or
operation, is legal or illegal. I do not accept that; I do not think
that that is the proper way forward. It may be shown, in subsequent
proceedings, that a war is illegal. Is a person therefore not entitled
to ask the courts in individual proceedings that are brought against
him to determine the matter? The purpose of tabling these amendments is
to give the courts the right to determine the legality of the
operations or actions that are
planned.</p><p><a name="06103159000141"></a>I shall be a little
more specific about the amendments. In Clause 3(2)(a) an offence is
committed if, without lawful excuse, a person subject to service
law,</p><ul><a name="06103159000285"></a>&#147;does an act that
delays or discourages an action or
operation&#148;.</ul><a name="06103159000251"></a>Those
vital words, &#147;without lawful excuse&#148;, which we have just
debated under the amendment proposedby the noble Earl, Lord
Attlee, do not appear in Clause 3(1)(a). I do not understand why that
distinction should be drawn. Is that simply an oversight or is there
some genuine policy behind removing that defence from Clause 3(1)(a)
while it is included in Clause
3(2)(a)?<p><a name="06103159000142"></a>The other amendments
seeking to make it clear that the action or operation is lawful could,
I am quite sure, be met by the Minister if he were to give me an
assurance that any act or operation must be lawful 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_171"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>before an offence was committed. If I have that assurance from the
Dispatch Box today, it will not be necessary for me to weary your
Lordships further. But I would like an explanation of the omission of
&#147;without lawful excuse&#148; in Clause 3(1)(a) and an
assurance that the operation or action is to be lawful. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06103159000299"></a>3.30

Drayson:</b> My Lords, Amendments Nos. 4, 4A and 6
change the substance of the offence of obstructing operations.
Amendment No. 4 seeks to add &#147;without lawful excuse&#148; to
Clause 3(1)(a). It would mean that doing an act that was likely to put
at risk the success of an action or operation would not be an offence
if it was done with a lawful excuse. This cannot be right. The offence
provides that such an act requires that the defendant must have
intended or been reckless as to whether he prevents the success of the
action or operation. But there can never be a lawful or even a
reasonable excuse for preventing the success of an action or operation
when there is an intention to do so or the person is reckless as to
whether success is
prevented.</p><p><a name="06103159000144"></a>The position on the
next subsection is different. Here the Bill includes the defence of
&#147;without lawful excuse&#148; in the offence of delaying or
discouraging an action or operation. It is right that we have included
&#147;without lawful excuse&#148; in relation to this offence
because there may be good reason to do so. Indeed, there may be express
or implied authority to do so. For example, it may be necessary to
delay in order to await more troops. But the same, as I have said, can
never apply to preventing the success of an action or
operation.</p><p><a name="06103159000145"></a>Amendments Nos. 4A
and 6 relate to the lawfulness of the action or operation for an
offence to have been committed. This is a similar issue to that that
arises later with regard to the offence of desertion. I understand the
thinking behind these amendments, but they are simply unnecessary.
Issues of international law are rarely straightforward, and members of
the Armed Forces should not be expected to wrestle with the
complexities of this field of
law.</p><p><a name="06103159000146"></a>I dealt with these
arguments in Committee in some detail, and I hope that your Lordships
will forgive me for repeating myself. International law looks at
Governments and states in relation to the legality of operations; it
does not expect the ordinary serviceman or woman to assess whether an
operation is sanctioned by international law. It would totally
undermine the cohesion of the Armed Forces to provide, in respect of
operations, for a member of the Armed Forces to obstruct an action or
operation because he or she thought that it was unlawful or contrary to
international law.</p><p><a name="06103159000147"></a>The law
relating to whether a war or an occupation is lawful essentially
applies at a national level. It certainly does not create a legal
liability on service personnel who participate in it. The law which
applies to them is the law in relation to the conduct of that
operation.</p>

3(1) and 3(2). I am concerned about the response to the other
amendments; that is, my attempt to insert &#147;lawful&#148; in the
appropriate places. I have no doubt that before any action is taken by
way of warfare, that action is carefully considered, as the Minister
said a moment ago. But I am not asking a serviceman to grapple, as he
put it, with international law. I am saying that if he is brought
before the courts and his defence is that the action was unlawful, it
is not enough for the prosecution to say, &#147;It is a matter of
national law, the Attorney-General has decided that it is lawful, and
the courts cannot interfere&#148;. That excludes the jurisdiction of

13. I listened carefully to the concerns of noble Lords in Committee,
particularly those of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, regarding
the offence of mutiny and the manner in which the clause was originally
drafted. I agreed to consider that, and on reflection I agreed that the
clause could be redrafted in an effort to make the provision simpler to
understand, not least by including the word &#147;mutiny&#148; in
the body of the offence.</p><p><a name="06103159000162"></a>There
is no substantive change to the effect of the original clause; mutiny
remains both an agreement to resist or overthrow authority and the act
of doing so. Under Clause 7 as amended, it remains an offence to fail
to suppress an act of mutiny but not to fail to suppress the agreement.
I trust that addresses the concerns of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord
Craig, and I am grateful to him for highlighting the issue. I trust
that he regards this as a more satisfactory
result.</p><p><a name="06103159000163"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew88"></a><a name="06103159000899"></a>Lord

noble and gallant Lord said: My Lords, in Committee I expressed
reservations about the wording of Clause 8. It was convoluted. It
identified tasks that, if not fulfilled, would mean that an offence of
desertion would have been committed. I tabled a probing amendment to
allow the Minister to explain why we should accept Clause 8, whose
definitions of desertion differ significantly from those used in the
existing single-service Acts. Those identical definitions were
introduced by the Armed Forces Act 1971, which amended the Naval
Discipline Act 1957 and the Army and Air Force Acts of
1955.</p><p><a name="06103159000174"></a>The Minister&#146;s
response did not satisfy me. He admitted
that,</p><ul><a name="06103159000286"></a>&#147;the wording of
the clause takes more than one reading to be clear to the
layman&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/7/06; col.
1636.]</ul><a name="06103159000252"></a>But servicemen are
laymen, not lawyers, apart from a very few people in the legal branches
of the services. Is it too much to expect government support for
plainer English in the Bill? 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_176"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103159000175"></a>The Minister suggested that the wording of
the existing Acts meant
that:</p><ul><a name="06103159000279"></a>&#147;If a soldier were
due to go to Germany for a training exercise but went absent because of
some temporary trouble at home, he would be guilty of desertion, rather
than merely absent without leave. That would be too
harsh&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/7/06; col.
1636.]</ul><a name="06103159000253"></a>I agree. If temporary
trouble at home were the sole reason for his absence, surely he should
never have been charged with desertion. But if he was to go to Germany
and absented himself and there were indicators that that was, in the
words of the
amendment,<ul><a name="06103159000287"></a>&#147;with the
intention to avoid
serving&#148;,</ul><a name="06103159000254"></a>in Germany
or anywhere else overseas, then a charge of desertion would seem
appropriate.<p><a name="06103159000176"></a>The
definitions of desertion in subsection (2) of the amendment are taken,
word for word, from the existing legislation; the only variation is the
splitting of the second definition into two parts. That is to limit a
punishment of up to life imprisonment solely to someone found guilty of
desertion before the enemy. Compared with the convoluted wording of
Clause 8, these definitions are much clearer. Can we not stick to them?
Subsection (3) of the amendment follows the wording in Clause 8(4) but
is adjusted to restrict the punishment of life imprisonment to someone
found guilty of desertion when before the
enemy.</p><p><a name="06103159000177"></a>My understanding is that
the present legislation has not proved defective in achieving
convictions for desertion. It is well known throughout the three
services; it is a straightforward, much clearer definition than that in
Clause 8. In view of the major and complex tasks faced by all three
services in transferring from existing legislation to the new Act, it
would seem sensible and highly desirable to avoid changes and
differences, where possible. If the existing definitions are retained
in the new statute, there will be no need to re-write that part of the
manual of service law. Each of the existing Acts covering the three
services uses the same
wording.</p><p><a name="06103159000178"></a>I also dislike the
reliance on specific tasks as part of the new definition. That does not
arise in the three existing Acts or in my amendment. As I pointed out
in Committee, the reference to &#147;property&#148; in Clause 8
leaves many questions unanswered, given the definition of that word in
Clause 374. Clause 8(3)(c)
on,</p><ul><a name="06103159000288"></a>&#147;military
occupation of a foreign country or
territory&#148;,</ul><a name="06103159000255"></a>defines
a relevant service. But does a &#147;country&#148; or
&#147;territory&#148; include those of the European Union or the
Commonwealth? We might be expected to help out if there were a problem
in one of those. What about British overseas territories, where a
service man or woman might be posted? I expect that there may be
answers based on legal expertise to some of these points, but I should
like them to be clear to non-legal service personnel as well. I raise
them to underline my concern at the way in which the clause is
constructed, with its complex definitions of &#147;relevant
service&#148;. It may not be as all-embracing as the authors had
intended. 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_177"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103159000179"></a>I also asked in Committee whether
&#147;occupation&#148; covered every conceivable situation from a
large-scale invasion to a few service men being attached to a unit of
the country or territory at the relevant authority&#146;s request. I
have not had a response to
that.</p><p><a name="06103159000180"></a>My probing amendment in
Committee sought to give the Minister the opportunity to explain why it
was thought necessary to introduce a totally different construct to
describe the offences of desertion. It is totally different from the
existing one, which all three services have relied on for more than 35
years, since 1971, and which they will rely on until the new Act is
introduced. The Minister was not able to help in Committee but perhaps
he can this time, and I shall listen with care to his response. I beg
to
move.</p><p><a name="06103159000181"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew93"></a><a name="06103159000904"></a>Lord
Judd:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment No.
18, which is in this group. Ideally, I should have liked to speak to
this amendment separately but, in view of our procedural ruling, there
may not be an opportunity to speak about the importance of Amendment
No. 18 if Amendment No. 14
prevails.</p><p><a name="06103159000182"></a>I make plain that I
feel as strongly as anyone about the seriousness of desertion; I do not
want any misunderstanding on that score. Desertion can be a literally
terrible offence. In the modern technological services, the
implications of desertion can be even greater than was ever imagined in
the past. The desertion of a key person could have huge implications
for the whole operation and for the well-being and safety of comrades
and colleagues.</p><p><a name="06103159000183"></a>In his earlier
amendments, concerning the word &#147;lawful&#148;, the noble Lord,
Lord Thomas of Gresford, dealt at some length with the arguments.
Although his arguments did not prevail&#151;I was sad about
that&#151;they were very powerful and I shall not repeat them all
now. As the noble Lord kindly remarked, in Committee I tabled an
amendment about the word &#147;legal&#148;. I listened very
carefully to the Minister's reply and recognised that he and the
Government believed that there were complexities relating to the
interplay between international and domestic law. In view of the
significance of the arguments put forward by my noble friend, I decided
that, although I believed the issue remained vital, it was important to
address it with slightly different
wording.</p><p><a name="06103159000184"></a>Perhaps I may
anticipate an argument which the Government may deploy against my
amendment and which the Minister used in dealing with a previous
amendment. It is the suggestion that ordinary serving men and women
should not really be worried about the implications of international
law, as that is something for Governments. I am not persuaded by that
argument. It seems to me that an individual service man who does
something that is not lawful is, in the end, responsible for his action
and can be brought to task for it very properly.</p><h5><a name="06103159000302"></a>4
pm</h5><p><a name="06103159000185"></a>Another point that worries me
is that that is a little patronising as it suggests that we do not have
very intelligent service men and women who are capable of working out
very important things for themselves, and that that should be left to
their superiors and 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_178"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government. I do not accept that argument. For a short while, I held a
short service commission; I was a volunteer. I started as a national
serviceman, but I transferred into the regular Royal Air Force for a
short period. As an intelligent person deciding that I wanted to take
that step, I looked at its significance. It seems nothing but helpful
to spell out in the law that the action that one might be required to
take as a volunteer will be and must be lawful.</p><p><a name="06103159000186"></a>I turn to recent history. We all know
that at the time of the Iraq war the chiefs of staff went to great
lengths to ensure that they were persuaded that what was being
undertaken was lawful. I was immensely reassured that they took such an
issue so seriously. That is altogether good and healthy in the kind of
society in which I want to live. I commend them for
that.</p><p><a name="06103159000187"></a>It is also interesting to
note that this argument should be deployed by my noble friend, because
it seems to be contradicted at the beginning of the Bill, on page 1 at
line 16. On the responsibilities of someone taken prisoner, it spells
out what that person must not
do:</p><ul><a name="06103159000280"></a>&#147;A person subject to
service law who has been captured by an enemy commits an offence if,
without lawful excuse, he intentionally serves with or assists the
enemy&#151;</ul><ul><a name="06103159000281"></a>(a) in the
prosecution of hostilities or of measures likely to influence morale;
or</ul><ul><a name="06103159000282"></a>(b) in any other manner
not authorised by international
law&#148;.</ul><a name="06103159000256"></a>Let us consider
a prisoner who is isolated, under pressure, bewildered and
disorientated. At that juncture, he is expected to know whether
something that he is being asked to do is in keeping with international
law. We write that into the Bill, right at the beginning, so how can
the Minister&#146;s argument logically be deployed in later
provisions, the argument that, when it comes to the occupation of a
foreign country, it is not really up to the ordinary service person to
worry about whether something is in keeping with international law? I
find that totally inconsistent. Not for a moment am I suggesting that
the provision on page 1 should not be there&#151;it should
be&#151;but its logic utterly follows through into what I am arguing
in Amendment No. 18.<p><a name="06103159000188"></a>To occupy
a foreign country is a very serious matter. I would hate it if at some
later stage it were to be argued that Parliament specifically decided
that it was not appropriate to say that this must be in keeping with
international law. I do not think that would happen under the present
Administration or any in the foreseeable future, although one never
knows what might happen in Britain. Sometimes we do not take this point
seriously enough when we legislate because we look at our present
experiences and not at what might happen unpredictably. It could be
argued in a hot situation with some force that Parliament considered
the issue and decided that it was not appropriate to make this
reference to, and to underline, international law.</p><p><a name="06103159000189"></a>In these circumstances, I ask the
Minister to seriously consider my proposals in AmendmentNo.
18. I know that he is a serious man who listens to arguments and thinks
about these things carefully, and therefore beg him not to say anything
today

Campbell of Alloway:</b> My Lords, I oppose Amendment
No. 18. We have heard another passionate and lengthy recital, as
happened on Clauses 3 and 8. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, knows perfectly
well that he has done little but repeat what was said then. He also
knows that the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, and my noble and
learned friend Lord Mayhew have rightly advised the House that the
question of lawfulness the noble Lord goes on about is not a matter for
the serviceman. It cannot be. In the field, it is wholly impractical to
expect it to be. According to the noble and gallant Lord and my noble
and learned friend, it is not a matter for the serviceman or the courts
of law but for the Attorney-General in the exercise of his supervisory
role.</p><p><a name="06103159000191"></a>My name is attached to
Amendment No. 14. I do not propose to repeat anything that the noble
and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, said. I agree with all of it;
it was most neatly and eruditely prepared. I shall, however, make a
short point. Listening to the noble and gallant Lord, I thought, as
your Lordships may have done, that he made a good case for essentially
retaining what we know has worked reasonably well and is satisfactory.
I think that the noble and gallant Lord has thus far been unable to
discover any breakdown or hint of criticism.</p><p><a name="06103159000192"></a>Why, then, resort to primary legislation
without a clear, reasoned justification? The noble and gallant Lord got
none on the previous occasion. He sowed his seeds of wisdom in
Committee, which bore fruit on mutiny but fell on barren ground with
desertion. Desertion is essentially a question of intention: you move
from being absent without leave to desertion as a matter of intention.
There seems little justification for meddling with the extant system,
for the reasons that the noble and gallant Lord has
given.</p><p><a name="06103159000193"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew95"></a><a name="06103159000906"></a>Lord

good case.</p><p><a name="06103159000194"></a>The amendment would
provide a far more satisfactory definition of desertion than Clause 8.
As the noble and gallant Lord has said, it would continue to use the
current statutory definition, familiar to members of all three
services. The language used in the amendment of the noble and gallant
Lord has the advantage of both clarity and continuity.</p><p><a name="06103159000195"></a>On Amendment No. 18, I

<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_180"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 180</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103159000197"></a>I congratulate my noble friend on posing a
question that causes concern to a number of young people in many parts
of the world. I accept at once that it does not admit of an easy
answer. It is part of a larger question and it may help to consider it
in context. It has a long ancestry. It really consists of two
questions. If a soldier is commanded to do an act that is a criminal
offence, should he be excused from military discipline for refusing to
obey? That gives rise to the converse question. If he carries out the
command, should he be excused from criminal responsibility on the
ground that he is acting in obedience to superior orders, a matter
raised earlier in our proceedings today by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas
of
Gresford?</p><p><a name="06103159000198"></a>We
are presented with a conflict between two principles. The first is the
constitutional principle that the military is subject to the law, as we
all are. It is their constitutional duty to recognise that they are
subordinate to the civil authorities. A military commander has no power
in law to excuse a subordinate from complying with the criminal law.
The second principle&#151;of course I accept entirely what was said
by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell&#151;is that an army requires
discipline if it is to be effective. If every order evokes a debate, an
army simply cannot function. Traditionally, that dilemma has been
addressed in two ways. First, it has usually been provided that a
soldier commits a disciplinary offence only by refusing to carry out a
lawful order. That reappears in this Bill in Clause
12&#151;</p><p><a name="06103159000199"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew97"></a><a name="06103159000908"></a>Lord
Campbell of Alloway:</b> My Lords, this is for
clarification. That affects the constitutional position, I think. Does
the noble and learned Lord draw any distinction between an order given
on the field of action in armed combat and an order not given in those
circumstances?</p><p><a name="06103159000200"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew98"></a><a name="06103159000909"></a>Lord
Archer of Sandwell:</b> My Lords, if the noble Lord
will forgive me, I hope to come to something approaching his question
in a few moments. He asks whether I draw a distinction. I am not clear
that I can draw a relevant distinction. If there is such a distinction,
I have not heard it
formulated.</p><p><a name="06103159000201"></a>I was going to say
that, traditionally, a soldier commits a disciplinary offence only by
refusing to carry out a lawful order. It appears in Clause 12. As my
noble friend Lord Judd pointed out, it is referred to in Clause 1.
Fairly clearly, it underlies a lot of the thinking on military
discipline and has been reappearing in military disciplinary provisions
for a long time. Secondly, most systems have accepted that a soldier
commits an offence against the criminal law in obeying an order only if
that order is clearly unlawful. That has become known as the doctrine
of manifest illegality. It goes well back in history&#151;it was
provided for in the Roman army. A soldier was given a window of escape
from his dilemma. It would be possible to avoid both prongs of the
fork. It worked reasonably well when a soldier was expected to be a
trained automaton. His duty was to obey an order instantly and
unreflectively. More recently, as my noble friend has pointed out, and
particularly since the Second World War that position has changed. 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_181"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>First, before enrolment, soldiers are expected to attain impressive
standards of education. They are encouraged to show initiative and to
reflect on what they are doing. A soldier is no longer an automaton.
Secondly, questions arise in a wider context&#151;and we come to the
question posed to me by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell. We are all being
subjected not only to our domestic legal systems, but also to a
developing international legal order, and people with no pretension of
being international lawyers debate whether a particular war is a lawful
war.</p><p><a name="06103159000202"></a>Even that dilemma is not
new. Martin Luther addressed it when he said that there was no blame
attaching to participation in an unjust war, unless it was manifestly
unjust. That may not necessarily be persuasive to everyone. Napoleon
said that questions of theology were for the next world. But von Moltke
said that he opted for what he called,</p><ul><a name="06103159000289"></a>&#147;an army which does not
deliberate&#148;.</ul><a name="06103159000257"></a>That has sometimes
been misunderstood. What he meant was not that the military should be
unrestrained but that it should carry out the instructions of the civil
authority without question. There we find ourselves perhaps parting
company with some of our friends. Even the instructions of the civil
authority are not ethically conclusive. Someone may say, &#147;Even
if my government command me to do something, that does not necessarily
silence my conscience&#148;. In the last resort we cannot pass
responsibility for our actions on to the shoulders of
others.<p><a name="06103159000203"></a>There is a precedent
within our own history. In 1911 the Government were confronted with
something like a mutiny when our forces in Ireland were faced with
instructions to suppress Protestant resistance to the partition of
Ireland. In fact the matter was resolved not by prosecuting anyone but
by all sides using common sense. The dispute was not about what the law
provided but about how far an individual conscience should be
stretched. Whether we would agree with the senior officers who question
the instruction is not relevant. Most of us have a sticking
point.</p><p><a name="06103159000204"></a>The United States has
been confronted with this problem more than once in recent years. Young
people were troubled about the legality and the morality of the war in
Vietnam, and many were charged with desertion. The position was
considered by the Supreme Court in the case of Thier-Vaughn, which was
a refusal to participate in the Desert Storm operation. The court ruled
on that occasion that it could not question matters of foreign policy.
It said that they were not justiceable.</p><p><a name="06103159000205"></a>That view is understandable. It has been
frequently shared by the courts in this country. They have repeatedly
declared their reluctance to review decisions by the Executive in the
field of foreign relations, but to an increasing extent international
relations are impinging on the concerns of private citizens and
subjecting them to decisions about the proper course of action. We are
passing into an era where the doctrine of sovereignty is increasingly
under examination and the attitude of domestic courts to diplomatic
decisions may need to be reviewed in the not too distant
future.</p>

Lordships&#146; attention to yet another problem. Must the civil
authority always have the last word? What is a soldier to do if faced
with conflicting orders? What if there is a military insurrection and a
general, intent on overthrowing the civil government, orders a colonel
to occupy the presidential palace? It is not a practice to be
encouraged, but sometimes we may even have approved of such an action
by the military. General Pinochet declared that any action by the
military to check the killing and the disappearances he was ordering
was &#147;unprofessional&#148;. We may take leave to disagree with
him.</p><p><a name="06103159000207"></a>What
would we say of action by the military to replace the regime in
Zimbabwe? In words that have expressed the heart-searching of a whole
generation, &#147;It ain&#146;t easy, kid&#148;. I suspect that
we could embark on a long debate about the ethical implications. I
appreciate the dilemmas which the amendment raises, but we are
considering a young person who, by definition, has wrestled with his or
her conscience and decided that whatever the consequences for
themselves personally, they cannot transfer their personal
responsibility to others. By definition, we are talking about those who
are the best, most responsible and most unselfish of a generation. To
subject such a person to the full range of military penalties is not
something to embark on
lightly.</p><p><a name="06103159000208"></a>In all my years working
with Amnesty, I was repeatedly assured that this country had no
prisoners of conscience. What else would such a person be? I confess
that I have hesitated about this but, when the chips are down, I
support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103159000209"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew99"></a><a name="06103159000910"></a>Lord

have read in detail the Minister's remarks in response in Committee but
I still do not understand the advantages that the new wording would
give us.</p><p><a name="06103159000210"></a>There is the idea that
the new wording will in some way constrain the offence so that it
applies specifically to active service. Our Armed Forces today may not
always be in the theatre of operation, but they are all participating
in contributing to active service. It seems that, in order to make
those constraints, the Government proposals are trying to define things
too neatly and finely. There was clarity before. So I support the
amendment of the noble and gallant Lord in all but one respect, which
is covered by my amendment, Amendment No. 19&#151;that amendment will
of course fall if we agree to Amendment No. 14, but I give notice that
I will return to the question of the maximum punishment if Amendment
No. 14 is agreed to

not prolong the debate on AmendmentNo. 18, to which I have
added my name. We have heard cogent arguments from the noble Lord, Lord

responsibilities under international law. The noble Lord, Lord Judd,

wide-ranging speech&#151;ranging not only into history but
internationally.</p><p><a name="06103159000213"></a>Both noble
Lords made the point that, inClause 12, the offence is refusal
to obey a lawful command. It is therefore a defence to that charge to
say that the command was not lawful. Why, therefore, should it not be a
defence to a charge under Clause 8 that the operations referred to were
unlawful? I appreciate the position that has been so fervently
expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, who takes the
view that the Attorney-General is the final arbiter of whether the
actions or operations are lawful. I do not accept that. I believe that
it should be justiciable. Just as it is possible for a defendant to a
charge of refusing to obey a lawful command to argue in a court for a
decision that the command was unlawful, it should be
possible&#151;</p><p><a name="06103159000214"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew101"></a><a name="06103159000912"></a>Lord

worrying me is that there is a convention on Report that one does not
go in for a long <I>histoire</I> of matters that have already been
debated. I have tried to be brief. I shall not take any more time, but
I do not think that it is right to resuscitate matters that have been
debated at great length in

Although it is right that we should confine ourselves so far as we can
on Report, the principles behind a particular issue become clearer as
the debate goes on. The importance of those issues is also highlighted.
So it is here. Where we are dealing in essence with a constitutional
matter, it is important that it should be expressed, particularly if we
are going to vote on the matter, which we did not do in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06103159000216"></a>The Crown&#146;s
prerogative&#151;used to declare war, to send our troops into
operations, and so on&#151;must at the end of the day be subject to
scrutiny. If the exercise of that prerogative is illegal, the domestic
courts of this country should be able to say so. It is not a question
of the particular defendant, when he deserts or refuses to obey a
command, getting a book on international law to see what the situation
is; it is a question of whether, later in the courtroom, he can argue
legality or illegality before the people who are charged with deciding
such questions properly, should Her Majesty&#146;s judges decide
whether Her Majesty&#146;s Ministers have taken a legal
action.</p>

Drayson:</b> My Lords, we have sought in Clause 8 to
modernise and limit the offence of desertion. The first change that we
are making is to remove the current maximum penalty of life
imprisonment for all cases of desertion. This maximum was applied to
all desertion cases by the Armed Forces Act 1971. The second is to
remove the test for desertion or absence without leave to avoid any
service overseas or when before an enemy, and to replace it with the
narrower test of avoiding &#147;relevant service&#148;, which
covers the sort of service that is often called &#147;active
service&#148;.</p><p><a name="06103159000219"></a>The noble and
gallant Lord, Lord Craig, and the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, have asked
why perfectly good drafting in the current discipline Acts should be
changed. The changes to the drafting have two aims. The first is to
limit the offence&#151;we do not think that it is right that there
should be a specific offence to avoid any service overseas. The second
is to limit the circumstances in which a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment is available. We therefore could not leave the offence as
it is. The current offence is too broad but, because it is broad, it
has the attraction of being stated briefly.</p><p><a name="06103159000220"></a>We believe that it is right to make the
changes that I have mentioned, but I recognise that it has resulted in
complexity. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, has been unflagging
in his efforts to persuade me that we could do better. His drive to
achieve plainer English for our Armed Forces is to be commended, and I
must say that, on further reflection, I think that he has a point. I
have therefore decided to have one last look at the drafting of Clause
8 with a view to simplification. I think that we should be able to
achieve an improvement and I hope to bring forward a simplified version
of the clause at Third
Reading.</p><h5><a name="06103159000303"></a>4.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06103159000221"></a>However, I
do not think that it would be right to accept the substantive changes
provided for in Amendment No. 14. The maximum of life imprisonment will
be limited to desertion to avoid &#147;relevant service&#148;. It
is intended to cover those situations where it is particularly serious
for a serviceman to go absent. This is where a serviceman goes absent
without leave to avoid the sort of particularly dangerous and demanding
service that is often broadly described as &#147;active
service&#148; and where everyone&#146;s contribution is especially
important. It covers operations against an enemy, overseas operations
for the protection of life and property, and military occupation of a
foreign country. We retain the maximum of life imprisonment for
desertion to avoid service of these types.</p><p><a name="06103159000222"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew104"></a><a name="06103159000915"></a>Lord

Drayson:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord. The
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, asked two questions about the
definition of &#147;relevant service&#148;. The first is about the
meaning of
operations,</p><ul><a name="06103159000290"></a>&#147;for the
protection of life or property&#148;.</ul><a name="06103159000258"></a>The second is about
the meaning of &#147;military occupation&#148;. Those expressions
have very well established meanings and are used in the current
definition of &#147;active service&#148; in each of the current
service discipline Acts.
<p><a name="06103159000224"></a>An
operation to protect life and property simply refers to where our Armed
Forces may take part in operations abroad in response to a threat to
people or to physical property of any sort, so long as the threat is
great enough to justify the operation. Clear examples of this would be
operations to evacuate civilians and safeguard their property in the
event of a national disaster or a local conflict, such as occurred
respectively in Montserrat or more recently in the Lebanon. The
definition of &#147;property&#148; in the Bill, like that in the
existing Acts, relates to clauses dealing with property in the UK, and
so does not apply to this clause, which specifically relates to
operations
overseas.</p><p><a name="06103159000225"></a>Military
occupation involves the idea of control. It is therefore limited to
where our forces, perhaps with allies, have established military
control of a foreign area or country whether or not there are also
civilian authorities. It does not therefore cover a situation in which
we are present abroad either fighting to establish control or where we
are there at the request of the foreign Government. For example, before
reunification our Armed Forces in Berlin were one of the occupying
forces. But in West Germany our forces were of course not in occupation
of the country. On that basis, I hope that the noble and gallant Lord
will withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103159000226"></a>Under Amendment No.
18, it would not be desertion to go absent without leave to avoid
service in a military occupation unless that occupation was fully in
accordance with international law. We expect all members of the Armed
Forces to be aware of their personal responsibilities under
international law. They are trained in such important matters as the
respect for property and the proper treatment of prisoners, enemy
wounded and civilians caught up in the conflict. These personal
responsibilities are ones for which a deliberate breach brings criminal
liability.
</p><p><a name="06103159000227"></a>However, the
decisions to go to war and to occupy a foreign state are matters for
Government and Parliament, and are subject to democratic
accountability. I would add that even Governments and Parliament find
the issues of what international law requires or prohibits extremely
difficult. I therefore believe that it would be wrong in principle to
remove from members of the Armed Forces their obligations where they
consider that an occupation is not in accordance with international
law.</p><p><a name="06103159000228"></a>There is another reason.
Of course it is right that members of the Armed Forces, like all
citizens, should consider the rights and wrongs of operations in which
they take part. They should exercise their democratic rights on the
basis of what Governments expect them to do. But it is another thing to
provide that a member of the Armed Forces may in such a situation
simply desert his colleagues and his duties. That in my 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_186"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>view is the wrong thing to do. I believe that nearly all members of the
Armed Forces would agree. To allow it would be tantamount to telling
all other service personnel who stayed to do their duty that they were
misguided. I cannot imagine what effect this could have on morale and
on operational effectiveness.</p><p><a name="06103159000229"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd has asked why
Clause 1 refers to international law. He pointed out that the clause
makes it an offence for service personnel captured by an enemy to
assist the enemy in any
way,</p><ul><a name="06103159000291"></a>&#147;not authorised
by international
law&#148;.</ul><a name="06103159000259"></a>He said that
this would require the prisoner to consider what international law
requires and asked what objection there can therefore be to allowing
members of the Armed Forces to decide whether an occupation is in
accordance with international law. I have already indicated where I
believe the difference lies. The responsibility for undertaking
operations is not on the individual; it is a responsibility of states
and a matter for democratic control. Captured members of the Armed
Forces should not generally assist the enemy, and Clause 1 rightly
makes that an offence. But the Geneva Conventions recognise that
captors may require prisoners of war to do certain types of work, so it
would be quite wrong for a prisoner to be guilty of assisting the enemy

require him to do. Our personnel are trained on their rights if
captured and they will know when they may be required to

friend Lord Archer of Sandwell asked whether a soldier can disobey an
order to commit a crime. On this point I can give a reassurance to my
noble and learned friend&#151;a serviceman does not have to obey an
order to commit a crime. However, Amendment No. 18 is different; it is
not about crime. It allows a soldier to desert if he is serving in
occupation of a foreign country and that occupation does not have the
full backing of international law.</p><p><a name="06103159000231"></a>I hope that, with the explanations and

am in two minds over

hand, he let slip in his response to me that even when he has
considered it, he is going to leave life imprisonment as the maximum
sentence. So it is probably worth dealing with the issue while we can
on Report.</p><p><a name="06103159000237"></a>We are no longer in
the day of the press gang or of keeping our people in by fear of
retribution; we have an all-volunteer force. Indeed, as I pointed out
in Committee, the maximum punishment is so great that commanders fear
to press desertion as a charge and put forward absent without official
leave instead, however long people spend away. Even on the rare
occasions when charges are pressed, the punishment tends to be measured
in days of detention rather than years of imprisonment. So we have an
offence with such a heavy possible maximum punishment that it is not
going to be used. That is a matter of
concern.</p><p><a name="06103159000238"></a>One new factor is that,
since we debated this matter in Committee last July, the Government
have brought to the House amendments to rectify the use of another
excessive punishment, which at the time included desertion as one of
the causes. I am talking about World War I. Then, of course, the
maximum punishment was the death penalty; today, the maximum penalty
available is life imprisonment. It seems that we need to learn
something from this. We had to do some very curious legislative work in
order to provide limited pardons for those who were executed during
World War I, some for desertion. It seems that we are again just trying
to replicate legislation without thinking about the
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06103159000239"></a>I was pleased
that the noble Baroness, Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, spoke so
strongly in support of a maximum of 10 years rather than life
imprisonment when we considered this in Committee. She has added her
name to my amendment and it is to her regret that she is overseas and
unable to speak to it. She said in Committee:</p><ul><a name="06103159000284"></a>&#147;We are talking about
proportionality, and it is not proportionate to issue a life sentence
for desertion&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/7/06; col.
1632.]</ul><a name="06103159000260"></a>If you look at the
other offences where one haslife sentences or sentences of 10
years, you see that10 years fits much better in this case. I
have decided to pursue the amendment today. I beg to
move.<p><a name="06103159000240"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew108"></a><a name="06103159000919"></a>Lord
Astor of Hever:</b> My Lords, we cannot support the
amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord Garden, acknowledged in Committee,
recently a full life sentence has been used very sparingly in desertion
cases. None the less, it remains a crucial sanction to retain. We have
heard many times in this House how discipline is central to the success
of our Armed Forces. Desertion has been identified as perhaps the
biggest threat to discipline and is among the worst offences as viewed
by fellow soldiers. Service men and women need to be able to rely on
one another absolutely. In some cases, the potential threat of life
imprisonment is essential to ensure that soldiers continue to carry out
their duty while on dangerous operations. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd,
said earlier, a key person deserting could have huge implications for
an operation.</p>

Drayson:</b> My Lords, as I have
already said, in Clause 8 we have sought to modernise and limit the
offence of desertion. One of the changes that we are making is to
remove the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for all cases of
desertion. This maximum was only applied to all desertion cases by the
Armed Forces Act 1971. We recognise that in some cases it is not
appropriate for an offence of desertion to carry the maximum penalty of
life imprisonment. However, we are not persuaded that in the most
serious cases&#151;that is, when a serviceman is on relevant
service&#151;he should not face the possibility of life
imprisonment.</p><p><a name="06103159000242"></a>&#147;Relevant
service&#148; is the kind of service in which all involved need to be
able to rely completely on everyone else involved&#151;a reliance and
trust that are undermined where a member of the service leaves his
colleagues without permission. It is also the kind of service in which
the success of an operation can depend on every member of the force
involved. As I said on 24 July, leaving your mates in the lurch at the
time they need you most by deserting in the face of dangerous
operations is viewed in the Armed Forces as just about the worst thing
you can do.</p><p><a name="06103159000243"></a>I
have listened carefully to the arguments that have been made both today
and in Committee on this matter, but I do not think that the case has
been made for the reduction in the maximum sentence envisaged in the
amendment. In such circumstances, a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment may be appropriate in an extreme case and should be
available as a maximum for a court martial. I trust that the noble Lord
will see the requirement for retaining the sentence of life
imprisonment in the limited circumstances in which it will continue to
be available and understand why I cannot support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103159000244"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew110"></a><a name="06103159000921"></a>Lord

not unexpected reply. I do not doubt that in the past his predecessors
said the same about execution being the best way to encourage the
troops to do their job. One has to make a judgment about what is
proportional&#151;and life imprisonment is not proportional, in my
view, in this case. I would like to test the opinion of the

first, the question of advice from a senior officer or senior member
being the reality rather than an order; and, secondly,
performance-enhancing drugs.</p>



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_191"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103163000006"></a>My Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 deal with
advice. The Minister in his letter told me that there is really not a
problem. He says:</p><ul><a name="06103163000114"></a>&#147;This
is something we believe should be controlled by clear instructions to
service personnel not to advise others to take drugs without having
medical advice to that effect. We do not believe therefore that this is
a problem in practice&#148;.</ul><a name="06103163000094"></a>I hope the Minister will tell us how
often, and in what form, these instructions are issued. In my 32 years
of military service I cannot recollect having received any instruction
of that kind.
<p><a name="06103163000007"></a>The letter goes on to
say:</p><ul><a name="06103163000115"></a>&#147;That said, each
serviceman is expected to exercise some personal responsibility for his
own intake of drugs. In considering whether to take disciplinary
action, the respective rank of the individual who took the drug and the
person giving the advice would be taken into
account&#148;.</ul><a name="06103163000095"></a>Perhaps the
Minister will explain what he meant by that. If a junior soldier is
advised by a sergeant and accepts the advice, is he charged? If the
advice comes from a warrant officer, is he not charged? That seems a
curious practice. We are putting an unfair burden on our troops if we
are asking them to make that sort of informed decision.
<p><a name="06103163000008"></a>The letter says that
performance-enhancement drugs are,</p><ul><a name="06103163000138"></a>&#147;a developing area of research,
and at present we do not sanction their use by service
personnel&#148;,</ul><a name="06103163000096"></a>although I note from
col. 269 of <I>Hansard</I> of11 October that the noble
Viscount, Lord Slim, said in Committee that he has on operations
carried a pill in his pocket in times of dire trouble.
<p><a name="06103163000009"></a>We have a problem with the definition of
performance-enhancing drugs, and I do not believe the Minister has
provided the necessary assurances for a Bill that is about how we will
deal with them. He says that such drugs are not sanctioned &#147;at
present&#148;, which presumably means he is keeping his options open.
His letter goes on to say:</p><ul><a name="06103163000116"></a>&#147;In our view it would be improper
to give any such order in respect of any performance enhancing drug
which carried any risks
whatsoever&#148;.</ul><a name="06103163000097"></a>Again,
I am not sure that that fills me with confidence. The question is: to
whom would the risks apply? Presumably, the purpose of taking a
performance-enhancing drug is to increase the risks to the enemy. It
may have minimal risks to the person who takes it, but what about the
risks to the person&#146;s colleagues and allies? In Committee I
referred to the effect of performance-enhancing drugs on air crew
members involved in friendly fire
incidents.<p><a name="06103163000010"></a>Even
following the Minister&#146;s helpful and full explanatory letter, I
remain concerned that we do not seem to have made much progress on how
we address the issue of performance-enhancing drugs. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06103163000146"></a>5

which I believe the noble Lords are concerned about is where a superior
officer advises a serviceman that he should take certain drugs to guard
against the effect of chemical or other weapons. If a superior officer
advised a serviceman to take such drugs, he would do so on fully
considered medical advice. For this reason the serviceman would have a
defence to a charge of unfitness through drugs by virtue of subsection
(2)(a)
if,</p><ul><a name="06103163000141"></a>&#147;the
drug was taken or administered on medical advice and [he] complied with
any directions given as part of that
advice&#148;.</ul><a name="06103163000100"></a>I am
confident, therefore, that the clause contains safeguards that address
the concerns that noble Lords have raised. I urge the noble Lord to
reconsider the amendment.<p><a name="06103163000014"></a>In
my letter I made the point that it is important that the advice is
given through the chain of command. The chain of command would
therefore give the advice based on considered medical advice given to
it.</p><p><a name="06103163000015"></a>Amendment
No. 23 provides for an additional requirement when administering drugs
for &#147;operational performance enhancement&#148; reasons. I take
on board the noble Lord&#146;s point about the potential development
of such performance enhancing drugs. I have considered the matter
further. It is important to state specifically that the drug must be
authorised by the Secretary of State and requires the written consent
of the individual.</p><p><a name="06103163000016"></a>There is no
policy specifically relating to the authorisation of so-called
performance-enhancing drugs. Indeed, we have no agreed definition of
what constitutes such a drug. This is a developing area of research and
at present we do not sanction their use by service personnel. I believe
that the concern is that in the future members of the Armed Forces
might be required to take them. As the noble Lord says, this Bill looks
to the future and therefore we should think about that matter. We have
thought about it. The important point here is that, were we to move in
this direction, such drugs would be subject to the current arrangements
that cover all drugs. Singling out performance-enhancing drugs is
neither helpful nor necessary. No matter what its purpose, each drug
should be looked at on its own merits through a medical assessment of
the risks and benefits. The assessment would then be made of whether it
would be beneficial, or indeed lifesaving, to the servicemen.</p>

administered to members of the Armed Forces on the basis of advice,
considered medical advice and then informed consent. Personnel would
not normally be ordered to take drugs. If they were to be ordered to
take drugs, that would only be done with the express agreement of the
Secretary of State acting on legal and medical advice. Apart from the
difficulties of the definition of performance-enhancing drugs, I do not
see the need for a specific clause about them. I hope that reassures
the noble

were raised when the Bill was scrutinised in another place.</p><p><a name="06103163000031"></a>The offence of
inaccurate certification is committed if a service man or woman signs a
relevant certificate without ensuring its accuracy. Relevant
certificates relate to Her Majesty&#146;s ships, aircraft and
aircraft material. The amendment would provide for the extension of the
offence of inaccurate certification to prescribed equipment. I am
grateful to the noble Lord for pushing me to further consider this. The
point that he made about equipment on land vehicles relating to
identification of friend or foe was a very cogent argument. There is,
however, a balance to be struck between extending the offence to all
service material, which would be excessively bureaucratic, and ensuring
that it can cover equipment

air platforms. I have just given the example of IFF.</p><p><a name="06103163000032"></a>Putting a list of
descriptions of equipment in the Bill would be too inflexible and would
not take into account changes in technology. The amendment therefore
provides for the Defence Council to prescribe the descriptions of
equipment to which the offence applies. Amendment No. 73 to Clause 373
requires these Defence Council regulations to be made by statutory
instrument. That provides the appropriate level of scrutiny while
ensuring the services retain the central voice over which equipment is
described for this purpose. The services have been consulted about this
and are content with the proposal that I have brought forward. I am
grateful to noble Lords for highlighting this issue, and I hope that
the amendment meets with your Lordships&#146; approval. I beg to

Although Amendment No. 28 is perhaps vague at first glance, I fully
accept his argument in favour of flexibility and I am pleased that he
has left it to the Defence Council to prescribe descriptions of
equipment to which the offence will apply. That will allow the Armed
Forces themselves to influence which equipment is covered by the
offence. Therefore, we welcome and support these

the regime of certification to meet future
challenges.</p><p><a name="06103163000035"></a>However, the annexe
to the Minister&#146;s letter stated, however, that the situation
remained that testing and checking of all land equipment did not
involve a formal certification procedure and that such a procedure
would not be practical or useful. I understand that the Minister
believes that he needs to look at the issue on a case-by-case basis,
and that is important, but the letter gave the impression of there
being closed minds within the land systems staff. As the services work
more closely together, they need to pick up best practice from each
other. Lives depend as much on proper servicing and checking of audit
systems on land as on the sea and in the air, where the services have
been more practised in that.</p><p><a name="06103163000036"></a>I
welcome these amendments, but perhaps the Minister might wish to keep

Lords who were here when we debated this matter in Committee may recall
my comment in withdrawing the amendment that I had not heard any reason
from the Government as to why a change as dramatic as this was being
made in the existing
provisions.<p><a name="06103163000048"></a>I am grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, and to the Bill team, who, no doubt,
assisted him, for writing to me extensively on 25 October. In
particular, the justification put forward in the letter was that the
present exclusions for &#147;treason, murder, manslaughter or
rape&#148; committed in the United Kingdom were, he stated,
&#147;an historical anomaly&#148;. He went on to
say:</p><ul><a name="06103163000123"></a>&#147;By
this I mean that it is anomalous that the Service system can deal with
very serious sexual offences committed in the UK but not rape; that
they can deal with grievous bodily harm or official secrets cases in
the UK but not manslaughter. And they can deal with very serious cases
(carrying up to life imprisonment) for a number of offences committed
within the UK (as well of course abroad). The list of exclusions is
arbitrary&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_196"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="06103163000147"></a>5.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06103163000049"></a>Having had
that letter from the Minister, I realise that it is an arbitrary list
of exclusions. However, the answer is not to remove those exclusions
but to extend the offences which, if committed in the United Kingdom,
should not be subject to court martial. Thus, not only should a soldier
or a civilian subject to service law not be charged with offences of
treason, murder, manslaughter or rape committed in the United Kingdom,
as at present, but, following the Minister&#146;s analysis, he should
not be charged with any offence carrying a sentence of life
imprisonment.</p><p><a name="06103163000050"></a>Perhaps I may
explain to your Lordships that if a person is sentenced by court
martial to more than two years&#146; imprisonment, he is immediately
thrown out of the services and will serve his sentence not in a
military prison but in an ordinary prison as a civilian. If the
sentence is life imprisonment, he then becomes subject to the regime
for lifers within the prison and he will be subject to all the usual
routines of parole and so on until his sentence is exhausted. So, if a
soldier or civilian subject to service law is to be convicted of
serious offences such as that and immediately lose his status, it seems
right that he should have the opportunity of being tried in the Crown
Court and not by court martial. Therefore, I propose to withdraw
Amendment No. 30 and redraft it for the purposes of Third Reading to
extend the list of offences that would be subject to ordinary
trial.</p><p><a name="06103163000051"></a>The Minister also
says&#151;this is really at the crux of the matter so far as we are
concerned&#151;in his
letter:</p><ul><a name="06103163000124"></a>&#147;I do not accept
that a military system which is the equivalent of the civilian system
must be the same as that civilian system in every respect. Our aim is
to create a service system which is as good as the civilian system and
which is appropriate for the services. It must be capable of operating
in a service context and have due regard to that
context&#148;.</ul><a name="06103163000103"></a>I am sure
that it is the Government&#146;s aim to try to bring the court
martial system up to the standards of the civil system, as exemplified
by trial by jury in the Crown Court. It seems to me that, if the
Government were to accept some of the amendments that we have tabled,
they would be some way along the line to improving the system. It has
improved over the years but not as a result of the desire of any
Government, whether this or any predecessor Governments; it has
improved because of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights,
which has pointed out in judgment after judgment that a fair trial by
court martial has not been possible in important
cases.<p><a name="06103163000052"></a>That brings me to
Amendment No. 31. Although, as with all Bills, this Bill was certified
by the Minister as complying with the European convention at the
beginning of its passage, a decision of the European Court on Wednesday
last week was fundamental. I pray it in aid in support of Amendment No.
31.</p><p><a name="06103163000053"></a>Your Lordships may recall
that in Committee we discussed the case of Martin, in which I was
involved. It went to the House of Lords and subsequently, in 1997, to
the European Court. The judgment was delivered last Wednesday, just in
time for this debate. That gives your Lordships some idea of the
importance of the Human Rights Act&#151;it was not available for the
House of Lords' decision in 1997&#151;in bringing the European
Convention into British law.</p>



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_197"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103163000054"></a>This was the trial of a 17 year-old
civilian, the son of a serving soldier, for murder. The trial took
place by court martial in Germany because at the time of committing the
offence his father was in the Army, stationed in Germany. By the time
the trial took place, 12 months later, his father had left the forces
and the young lad was taken back to Germany, having been on remand in
this country, and he was tried there. First, the matter went to the
courts martial appeal court in which the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Bingham, who was then Lord Chief Justice,
said:</p><ul><a name="06103163000125"></a>&#147;We have some
considerable sympathy with the appellant's
complaint&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06103163000104"></a>that
is, of an abuse of
process&#151;<ul><a name="06103163000143"></a>&#147;With
the benefit of hindsight, it seems plain that the trial could have been
conducted in England without undue difficulty. It would in our view
have been preferable if this young appellant, whose subjection to
military law was purely vicarious and involuntary, had been tried here
with all the procedural safeguards which procedure in the ordinary
criminal courts affords. We cannot, however, stigmatise these
proceedings as abusive. They were strictly in accordance with a
procedure prescribed by Parliament to apply in such
cases&#148;.</ul><a name="06103163000105"></a>As I said to
your Lordships, the Human Rights Act had not been thought of when that
case was heard in 1996.<p><a name="06103163000055"></a>When
the matter went to the House of Lords, the noble and learned Lords,
Lord Slynn of Hadley and Lord Hope of Craighead, expressed the view
that the decision to prosecute the applicant, a civilian aged only 17
at the time of the murder, by court martial had been inappropriate.
Again, the decision was that the proceedings were conducted within the
rules laid down by Parliament and could not, therefore, be
abusive.</p><p><a name="06103163000056"></a>It is
very interesting to see what the European Court of Human Rights has
made of this in its judgment which was published last Wednesday. An
important judge in that court is Sir Nicolas Bratza, a very
distinguished English lawyer who, when practising in this country, used
to appear mainly on behalf of the Government. He has an impeccable
background. The European Court went beyond children under the age of 18
to all civilians and
decided:</p><ul><a name="06103163000126"></a>&#147;It is,
however, a different matter where the national legislation empowers a
military court to try civilians on criminal charges ... While it
cannot be contended that the Convention absolutely excludes the
jurisdiction of military courts to try cases in which civilians are
implicated, the existence of such jurisdiction should be subjected to
particularly careful scrutiny, since only in very exceptional
circumstances could the determination of criminal charges against
civilians in such courts be held to be compatible with Article
6&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06103163000106"></a>that is,
the article which requires a trial to be
fair&#151;<ul><a name="06103163000144"></a>&#147;The
power of military criminal justice should not extend to civilians
unless there are compelling reasons justifying such a situation, and if
so only on a clear and foreseeable legal
basis&#148;.</ul><a name="06103163000107"></a>It concluded
that the complaint of young Martin was fully justified and upheld his
appeal and awarded costs. There was a violation of the requirements of
a fair trial. In the past few days, the European Court has decided that
that which is proposed in the Bill denies to a defendant a fair
trial.

in mind the Martin case, my amendment is limited to a civilian under
the age of 18 who is subject to service discipline. It suggests that no
civilian of that age may be prosecuted before the court martial for an
offence under this clause. The service civilian court should set up a
proper system of juvenile courts, or something akin to them, which
could deal with the under-18s. No more should youngsters who have not
joined the Army, Navy or Air Force be hauled in front of a court
martial, with all that that implies, but without, as the then Lord
Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said, the
procedural safeguards that the Crown Court affords.</p><p><a name="06103163000058"></a>I say it loud and clear: we have moved a
long way on courts martial. However, they are not the equivalent of a
Crown Court jury trial with the procedural safeguards we have in this
country. Still the Government drag their feet with this Bill in front
of them. I do not suppose we will look at the issue again for 10, 15 or
20 years.</p><p><a name="06103163000059"></a>I hope that the
Government can respond. They must respond to the European
court&#146;s judgment. In his letter, the noble Lord, Lord Drayson,
says that:</p><ul><a name="06103163000127"></a>&#147;Given the
ruling of the European Court in <I>Martin</I> which we have received
today I am sure you will understand if I confine my comments for now to
these issues in relation to service personnel&#148;.</ul><a name="06103163000108"></a>As your Lordships
would expect, the Government were not able to respond so quickly, in
relation to civilians, to a judgment delivered only last Wednesday.
Again, that is why I will not be pressing Amendment No. 31 tonight, but
I shall table it again at Third Reading. That will at least give the
Government a little time to consider whether this Bill is not the ideal
opportunity to respond to the concerns of the European Court of Human
Rights. <p><a name="06103163000060"></a>I
told your Lordships that these were three disparate issues. Amendment
No. 35 is on a different, although not unrelated, issue. In 1861, 150
years ago, it was decided that the courts of the United Kingdom could
try any British citizen charged with murder, even though that murder
did not take place in the United Kingdom. Any British citizen may be
tried for an offence committed abroad. All that Amendment No. 35
provides for is that, where the courts of the United Kingdom have such
extra-territorial jurisdiction to try a service offence committed
abroad, the defendant may elect to be tried in the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06103163000061"></a>All the opposition to
our amendments has been along the lines that we must maintain
disciplined services. I entirely agree with that aim. We should stop
from time to time, however, and look at it from the defendant&#146;s
point of view. That is what is missing. We have looked at the criminal
court system in this country with the aim of ensuring a fair trial and
doing what is right for the individual, and have tried to prevent the
innocent from being convicted. Notwithstanding some of the recent
measures by the Government that have weakened the position of the
defendant in the British courts, we still look at it from the
defendant&#146;s point of view. We should do that when considering a
military system of justice, instead of always concentrating on the
needs of discipline, morale and so on. We should look at whether a
person charged with an offence before a court martial

so I will speak to it in some detail. Amendment No. 31 seeks to prevent
civilians who are under 18 being tried before a court martial. As the
noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said, on24 October the
European Court of Human Rights gave its judgment in the case of Martin.
We need to be clear what it
decided.</p><p><a name="06103163000063"></a>As we have heard, the
case was about the son of a serviceman who was tried by court martial
in 1995 for the murder of a civilian in Germany. The court martial was
subject to the same objections as were found to exist in the Findlay
case in 1996, and which were remedied by the Armed Forces Act 1996. So
it is no surprise that the European court also decided in Martin that
the court martial was not compliant. The court did not decide that
courts martial should not try civilians or that they should not try
civilian juveniles, but it stated the important principle that a
military jurisdiction should only be exercised over civilians if there
are &#147;compelling reasons&#148; to do so. In Martin, there was
the possibility of civilian trial in the UK, because the charge was
murder. The European court did not decide whether there had been
compelling reasons for a court-martial trial. It did not need to,
because, as I have said, it decided the case on the basis that the
court martial was not compliant. It did not go into what it thought
would be compelling reasons. In the Martin case, the reasons for
court-martial trial were mainly to do with the availability of
witnesses, most of whom were German. But there were other
factors.</p><p><a name="06103163000064"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew124"></a><a name="06103163000162"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, will the Minister
accept that cases are being tried in this country in which witnesses
are being brought from all parts of the world, including
Iraq?</p><p><a name="06103163000065"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew125"></a><a name="06103163000163"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, I accept the noble
Lord&#146;s point. In the Martin case there were other factors.
Besides his age, Martin was no longer subject to service law. He had
been back in the UK for over a year and his father was no longer in the
Army. The European Court of Human Rights commented that it had
&#147;considerable doubts&#148; about whether it would have found
the reasons for court-martial trial &#147;compelling&#148;. I
believe that we should provide for all civilians subject to service
discipline to be subject toa system of investigation and trial
which will apply the criminal law of England and Wales, which conducts
its proceedings in English and which is ECHR compliant. This is
especially important for contractors and others who increasingly
accompany our forces on operations
abroad.</p><p><a name="06103163000066"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Thomas of Gresford, this evening stated that civilians subject to
service law should not be subject to trial by court martial for any
offence in the UK carrying life imprisonment. I

offences committed in the United Kingdom. That jurisdiction only
applies to the services abroad.</p><p><a name="06103163000067"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew126"></a><a name="06103163000164"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, the amendment does
not confine itself to civilians. It refers, as does the current Army
Act, to serving soldiers or service personnel, as well as to civilians
subject to service
law.</p><p><a name="06103163000068"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew127"></a><a name="06103163000165"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Lord, but I thought that it was important to make that
point.</p><p><a name="06103163000069"></a>It is in the vital
interests of the services, the civilians who live and work with them
and the civilian population among whom they operate that there is a
fair and robust system of justice outside the United Kingdom to deal
with offences by civilians, as well as service personnel. We must
recognise that the use of civilians deployed with our Armed Forces has
increased in recent years. This is the reason for our general approach
in this area.</p><p><a name="06103163000070"></a>The largest
constituency affected is our service families overseas. We realise that
20,000 or so children accompany them. This presents real challenges. We
must accept, however, that from time to time these under 18s may commit
serious offences against other service dependants or even against
service personnel in UK service bases overseas. In these circumstances,
as the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Kingsland, have said, the
foreign local jurisdiction may be highly undesirable. Even if it
affords a compliant court, it will not apply the law of England and
Wales and may not conduct proceedings in English. I believe that we
would be failing in our responsibilities if we did not provide that. Of
course we must ensure that the court martial makes proper provision for
juveniles and I know that judge advocates receive the same training as
Crown Court judges in this
respect.</p><p><a name="06103163000071"></a>Amendment No. 35 seeks
to permit service personnel and civilians subject to service discipline
to elect trial before civilian courts in the United Kingdom where those
civilian courts have extra-territorial jurisdiction. I start by
restating two key principles that underpin the Bill and with which, I
am sure, no noble Lord would disagree. The first is that our Armed
Forces require a separate system of military justice. The second is
that the service system must underpin service discipline at all times.
The military context in which offences occur is important in
operational and non-operational environments. Although it is not
absolutely clear, it appears that the purpose of Amendment No. 35 is to
permit service personnel and civilians subject to service discipline
facing the most serious criminal charges to elect trial before the
civilian courts. It therefore undermines both the key principles just
described. Giving such persons the right to opt out of the military
justice system, which would be the effect of the amendment, would have
a detrimental effect on its standing. It would suggest a lack of faith
in the service system, 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_201"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and that the military context is not crucial to the handling of serious
offences committed in the service
environment.</p><p><a name="06103163000072"></a>I
am convinced of the case for a separate military justice system. I
recognise the importance of the military context. I believe that our
military criminal justice system is competent and compliant. The
military justice system is well able to deal with the most serious
cases. The recent decision of the Judge Advocate General to appoint a
High Court judge to a court martial and the willingness of service
prosecutors from time to time to instruct civilian counsel demonstrates
that, on those rare occasions when specialist experience is required,
the military justice system can import it. The result is that the most
serious and complex cases can be dealt with and the system, in turn,
commands the confidence of the public and the Armed Forces. It is not
hard to envisage circumstances where the interests of justice might be
best served and victims&#146; rights best protected by trying charges
together. The amendment would prevent exactly that, where a series of
serious criminal offences included some committed overseas. Similarly,
if the alleged offences included both criminal conduct offences and
service discipline offences, should the accused be able to force
separate hearings? Again, that cannot be right. A key characteristic of
the military criminal justice system is that it is able to conduct
trials anywhere in the world. In recent years courts martial have sat
in the United States, Belize and the Falkland Islands, and there is a
trial pending in Brunei later this year. Trials overseas often make
good legal as well as military sense. There are many reasons for a
portable, effective and, of course, compliant court-martial system.
Making that system a hostage to the preference of the accused in the
way proposed would not
work.</p><p><a name="06103163000073"></a>In
response to Amendment No. 31, I have set out our position on civilians
subject to service discipline, following the recent case of Martin. I
believe that our military system is compliant and that it delivers a
high-quality system of English law in the English language, anywhere in
the world. However, if, on consideration, we need to make changes in
the light of the judgment, we will do so. Powers already in the Bill
make that possible. In doing so, we will take careful account of any
requirement of compelling circumstances regarding the trial of
civilians subject to service discipline. For the reasons I have given,
I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103163000074"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew128"></a><a name="06103163000166"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, the very point I
seek to make is that the European court has held that the system is not
compliant. It is not enough for the Minister to come here three or four
days later and say &#147;I believe it to be compliant&#148; when
the European court has held otherwise. It is therefore for the
Government to make a proper response. For that reason I will not be
pressing Amendment No. 31 tonight.</p><p><a name="06103163000075"></a>On the broader issues, of course I accept
that there should be a military disciplinary system. I said in
Committee that it is right that defendants should be tried in such a
way overseas. The point about Amendment No. 30 is that it relates to
offences in this country&#151;murder and rape in this country. Why
should a defendant, because he is a soldier as opposed

court martial rather than allowing him the greater procedural
safeguards in the Crown Court?</p><p><a name="06103163000076"></a>The most obvious procedural safeguard,
which we will debate shortly, is the requirement for unanimity in a
jury or a majority verdict of 10 to two. As your Lordships are aware,
in a court martial only a simple majority is required. If five officers
sit they can decide guilt by three to two&#151;or innocence by three
to two if it comes to that. Similarly, if three are sitting they can
decide on offences&#151;to which life imprisonment is annexed for
offences committed in this country, if the amendment to the Act that
the Government propose goes through&#151;by a simple
majority.</p><p><a name="06103163000077"></a>Why should a
serviceman, or a civilian subject to service discipline, be tried on
these important issues for an offence committed in this country by a
number of officers, with perhaps one warrant officer sitting in? Maybe
we should go back to Cromwell's days. Maybe the court martial system is
so great that we should get rid of juries altogether and have military
commissions sitting all over the country deciding guilt or innocence.
The fact that a person is a serviceman or the son, daughter or wife of
a serviceman, should not mean that he is to be treated differently for
an offence committed in this country. That is Amendment No. 30. I will
come back to that because, as I said, I wish to broaden the area of the
exceptions. </p><p><a name="06103163000078"></a>Amendment No. 35
extends slightly a provision that has existed in our law for 150 years,
since 1861. No reason given by the Government for rejecting any of
these amendments carries any logical sense other than to state over and
over again that we must keep military discipline. That is not, in my
submission, a proper way to approach legislation of this sort. I beg
leave to withdraw Amendment No.

Reading, for the armed serviceman on active service who complies or
intends to comply with his orders and rules of engagement. This
amendment achieves that by a rebuttal of presumption in favour of the
serviceman, which assuredly is no absolute defence, as was the proposal
in old Amendment No. 61.</p><p><a name="06103163000085"></a>The rules of
engagement as such do not have statutory force. The defence applies to
trials for homicide or breach of international convention, either under
the civil jurisdiction in exceptional circumstances or by courts
martial.</p><p><a name="06103163000086"></a>This
is a probing amendment for your Lordships&#146; consideration, as
spoken to by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, on Second Reading.
This defence is but part of a fair and just regime which recognises the
realities of armed combat and peacekeeping and can be trusted by the
servicemen. The amendment acknowledges that rules of engagement, if
written, are but a framework within which verbal orders and rules of
engagement, which often form an amalgam, are given in context with a
specific operation, whether on combat or peacekeeping, as spoken to by
the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, on Second Reading, and
assented to by my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew of Twysden, who
is in his place. The noble and gallant Lord
said:</p><ul><a name="06103163000132"></a>&#147;Justice cannot be
dispensed in a vacuum; it must depend on the circumstances prevailing
at the time at the scene of operations and rules of engagement, if

new services law was heralded in the evidence of the Judge Advocate
General, Judge Blackett, and was assented to by the noble and gallant
Lord, Lord Boyce. It was the evidence given to a Select Committee of
another place. It was referred to in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, on Second Reading at col. 252. It was also assented to by
the noble and gallant Lords, Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank and Lord
Vincent of Coleshill. I shall cite a small but crucial passage. The
amendment is dependent only on the acceptance of a new service
law&#151;a military law. In another context, I think that the noble
Lord, Lord Drayson, was speaking about that some moments ago. The noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, cited Judge Blackett,
saying:<ul><a name="06103163000133"></a>&#147;There
are cogent reasons for maintaining a unique system of military justice,
separate and distinct from the civilian system. These are to . . .
support operational effectiveness and morale . . . maintain discipline
which is an essential element of command . . . reflect the special and
unique nature of the Armed Forces, in which sailors, soldiers and
airmen are required to use lethal force to support Government policy,
to risk their personal safety, and to be prepared to lay down their
lives for their country, and . . . extend the law of England and Wales
to personnel serving overseas and outside the jurisdiction of the
civilian courts&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/6/06; col.

which this House is, so to speak,
built.<p><a name="06103163000087"></a>I shall cite two short
passages from the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, which
support the principle of the amendment&#151;there being as yet no
provision in the Bill that gives effect to such appraisal. He
said:</p><ul><a name="06103163000134"></a>&#147;In response to
one of the important points made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell,
about the situation where a soldier 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_204"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>makes a mistake, it is important for me to reassure the Committee that
if a soldier acts in combat on his view of the situation, even if it is
wrong, he will not be guilty of a crime. That is a fundamental
principle, which we need to keep clearly in focus as we consider this
matter&#148;.</ul><a name="06103163000111"></a>In the other
passage, he
stated:<ul><a name="06103163000135"></a>&#147;The noble
Lord, Lord Campbell, raises an important point when describing the
similarity between orders and the detailed nature of rules of
engagement. He has also emphasised the point to which I alluded at the
beginning of my response, which is the importance of the intent to do
wrong. The noble Lord is right. We have heard on the Floor of this
House as we have debated this issue in the past how in combat this may
be a split-second decision made in very difficult circumstances. I
remember vividly the description that the noble Viscount
made&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/10/06; col.
295-96.]</ul><a name="06103163000112"></a>Unfortunately, the
noble Viscount is not in his
place.<p><a name="06103163000088"></a>Those are the sort of
twin pillars. It now comes to give but one example where, had the
amendment been in force and this defence available, it would have saved
a conviction for murder. I shall take it shortly because it was dealt
with at some length in Committee. If this defence had been available to
the Scots Guardsmen, Fisher and Wright, they would not have been
convicted of murder, as their evidence on oath that they intended to
comply with the orders, rules of engagement and training&#151;they
were both pretty young, so training was relevant&#151;was wholly
accepted by the Army board. It is quite obvious that if they had had
that defence open to them, it would have been very unlikely that they
would have been disbelieved on their
oath.</p><p><a name="06103163000089"></a>However, their only
defence was self-defence&#151;as to fear their murder by coffee jar
bomb attack. That was rejected by the trial judge. There was no other
defence. As it was a finding of fact, it foreclosed on any appeal to
the Court of Appeal or application to the Appellate Committee of this
House or to the CCRC to refer the case for reconsideration
tothe Court of Appeal. A civil system of law had hit the
buffers of its own making. The stain of a conviction for murder is
indelible, unless there is fresh evidence. There was none. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103163000090"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew130"></a><a name="06103163000168"></a>Lord

convinced of that; but I do not think that the point is sufficiently
important for me to take it beyond stating our difference.</p><p><a name="06103163000093"></a>Rather, I want to talk about the other
aspect, which is the question of the status of rules of engagement. I
put on record my gratitude to the Minister, who has helpfully provided
me with an extremely perspicacious document produced by his officials
in the ministry, who have clearly spent a great deal of time thinking
about this matter. I am much obliged to him and to them for what they
have
done.</p><h5><a name="06103168000039"></a>6
pm</h5><p><a name="06103168000001"></a>My amendments seek to meet
the two primary criticisms that have been brought to bear on me from on
high about enshrining the rules of engagement. The first relates to
flexibility and the desirability of commanders being able to refashion
and reformulate the rules of engagement, sometimes over a period of
hours or within even smaller time limits. The second relates to
confidentiality and the importance of the rules of engagement not
getting into the hands of the enemy.</p><p><a name="06103168000002"></a>We have abandoned on Report the very
specific drafting that we adopted in Committee, to say simply
that,</p><ul><a name="06103168000038"></a>&#147;the rules of
engagement shall have statutory
force&#148;.</ul><a name="06103168000036"></a>This, I
submit, meets both the concerns expressed by the Minister. It does not
matter how often the rules of engagement change in the course of an
operation; whatever they happen to be at the relevant moment when the
soldier&#146;s action is called into question, they will have
statutory force. So it is not necessary to enshrine them in any
document, although of course they will be in some documentary form in a
unit or in some formation above a unit. Nevertheless, because the law
requires them to have statutory force, they will, by that very
requirement, have the force that I seek. It flows from that that, as
there will be no publication of the rules of engagement, they will by
their very nature be confidential. I therefore believe that the two
objections made by the Minister do not
apply.<p><a name="06103168000003"></a>Why
is it so important to give rules of engagement statutory force? I need
only remind your Lordships of the arguments that I advanced in
Committee. There are primarily two such arguments. First, the new role
that Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights plays in our
law requires anyone contemplating an activity to know before he
undertakes that activity whether he is likely to commit a crime. That
applies precisely to a soldier on the battlefield, who needs to know
what legal framework is brought to bear on what he can and cannot do.
He needs certainty, or as near certainty as one can give&#151;one
cannot give absolute certainty. At the end of the day, even in the
context of rules of engagement, he must, of course, exercise only force
that is reasonable and apposite in the circumstances; but apart from
that necessary common-law qualification, the rules of engagement
provide him with a framework in which he can have confidence.</p>



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_206"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103168000004"></a>The
other reason is particularly germane to the kind of operations that we
undertake in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under the convention of the
International Criminal Court, it is perfectly possible for a soldier to
do something in breach of that convention which gives the state in
which he is conducting his operations the right to try him for a war
crime. As that is so, it is vital that a soldier knows exactly where he
stands. I can think of no more serious threat to one of our soldiers
abroad than the possibility of being tried for a war crime by a state
that does not respect human rights. The rules of engagement give him a
degree of certainty that otherwise does not exist.</p><p><a name="06103168000005"></a>I have no idea how the Minister will
respond, but when this point was ventilated in Committee, I had a great
deal of support from your Lordships, including the noble and gallant
Lords, Lord Vincent of Coleshill, Lord Craig of Radley and Lord Inge,
the noble Lords, Lord Ramsbotham and Lord Thomas of Gresford, and the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell of Markyate. All of them supported
the idea that the rules of engagement should be given statutory form.
In these amendments, I have tried to meet some of the criticisms of
detail that were made and to provide something that protects
flexibility and security but also gives the individual soldier the
certainty that he requires. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103168000006"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew131"></a><a name="06103168000043"></a>Lord

Noble Lords will realise that it is absolutely essential&#151;this
has been said many times, most recently by the noble Lord, Lord

immediate and first-rate medical attention, and confidence that, if he
is brought into a situation where he is required to take action that
may result in killing someone or opening fire on people but where he
acts in good faith under the orders that he has been given, he will be
dealt with fairly and consistently under the law by that chain of
command.</p><p><a name="06103168000007"></a>It is very difficult
to describe &#147;good faith&#148; absolutely and precisely. In the
same way, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for the
way in which he described not the prescriptive nature of rules of
engagement but the rules of engagement as a framework, whose statutory
force, which again is not prescribed, is essential in order that our
Armed Forces can have confidence that, if they act in good faith within
that framework, they need not fear anything from the chain of
command&#151;or the legal chain of command, as it were&#151;that
goes with it. That is why I am pleased that the amendments in the name
of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, stand with Amendment No.

Mayhew of Twysden:</b> My Lords, these are ingenious
amendments or, more accurately, a new clause and amendments. If they
are carried, perhaps with a little alignment or tidying up, they will
serve as a very present help in times of trouble. Properly understood,
they would do so without impinging on the doctrine that being obedient
to an unlawful order is no excuse. Nor would they breach the principle
that disobedience to a lawful order should attract punishment. They
would also provide a fair criterion for visiting a serviceman&#146;s
conduct when engaged in armed combat with criminal liability in a
proper case. This is a fair criterion, because it is realistic. If it
were not realistic, it would not be
fair.</p><p><a name="06103168000009"></a>There
are circumstances that impose on a serviceman who is required to engage
in armed combat a degree of stress that must be unique in any field of
employment. Of course, it is possible even when engaged in armed
conduct to behave in such a way that by any standard and by any
criterion one is guilty of murder. No one suggests that that is not so.
Equally, no one suggests that those circumstances are such that they
always can properly lead to a conviction for murder. To put it another
way, no one has suggested that the circumstances of combat are such
that the offences of murder or manslaughter are legally incapable of
being committed. They plainly are so capable. The amendments seem to
address the availability of liability to conviction.</p><p><a name="06103168000010"></a>A point that has been made before more
persuasively and vividly than I can make it is whether a soldier has
done what he has done in the heat of action and in the fear of action,
which is perhaps more important, or whether what he has done was in
breach of the common law of manslaughter or murder. That cannot
sensibly be determined by a fine examination of the matter months later
in a prosecutor&#146;s office. The nearest thing to a bang that would
be heard there is when Archbold&#146;s <I>Criminal Practice</I> falls
off the desk. Still less can we realistically expect a soldier in
action to perform this exercise for himself. Surely what the soldier
steers by are his rules of engagement and the orders made pursuant to
them, as has been pointed out by my noble friends Lord Kingsland and
Lord Campbell of Alloway, which can and frequently are
varied&#151;and the latest version is all that the soldier can
reasonably be expected to bear in
mind.</p><p><a name="06103168000011"></a>I
suggest that justice requires that the soldier knows when he is sent
into action that his conduct will be judged thereafter by a test that
is fair and simple, which should be something like this: &#147;You
are subject to the rules of engagement and rules made pursuant to them,
and if you come through this action you will in any event be safe from
prosecution provided that you have not deliberately set out to disobey
any of them&#148;. The soldier will understand that: it is simple,
clear and fair. That is the just way to order things. It will remove
the lurking fear, which soldiers have spoken of so frequently and so
recently&#151;we have all read it&#151;of a civilian prosecution
process that is unfair because it fails to take cognisance of the
exigencies of armed combat.</p>

Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, we are very
sympathetic with the thinking behind these amendments, although we are
not very happy with the actual wording. It should be quite simple: if a
serviceman acts within the rules of engagement, he will not be
prosecuted&#151;never mind convicted. He will not have&#151;as
certain servicemen have arising out of the Iraq conflict&#151;years
of worry that prosecutions are pending against them. It should be one
of the foremost principles on which the Director of Service
Prosecutions acts. He should consider, where the rules of engagement
were conveyed to the proposed defendant, whether the defendant
deliberately breached those rules and, if so, what the consequences of
that were.</p><p><a name="06103168000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, said that the question is whether the soldier acted in good
faith. He pointed out that there are difficulties in defining
&#147;in good faith&#148;. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said
that a soldier should know where he stands. In the case of the
paratroopers tried at Colchester last September&#151;I declare an
interest in that I was involved on behalf of one of them&#151;it was
apparent that no thought had been given in the prosecution to what the
rules of engagement were at the time. The defendants were a platoon of
soldiers who had been patrolling in the Maysan province. As far as they
were concerned, they had been told by an officer, &#147;Well,
it&#146;s back to Northern Ireland rules now. We have just won this
war&#148;. In fact, it was not and those were not the rules of
engagement. The rules of engagement that were still in force at the
time of the incident with which they were concerned were the rules of
engagement that were employed on the invasion into Iraq&#151;to seek
out and destroy the enemy. That was the broad concept in operation. But
the paratroopers thought that they should be acting like policemen in
the role that they were familiar with in Northern Ireland. Your
Lordships will remember that, for a time, berets were worn in an
attempt to win hearts and minds in the southern part of Iraq. The
situation was that they did not know what the rules of engagement were
because the rules of engagement had not been conveyed to
them.</p><h5><a name="06103168000040"></a>6.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06103168000014"></a>Therefore, the Director of
Service Prosecutions, when he is considering a prosecution, should
think, &#147;Did they know what they were supposed to do? Did they
act in good faith within those rules or were they deliberately
disobeying orders?&#148; It is far better for the decision on whether
to prosecute to be taken at that point, rather than for a defence in
the terms of this amendment to be discussed years later on whether the
defendant had the intention not to comply with orders and rules of
engagement when charged with murder, manslaughter or breach of
international convention. We are not happy with the amendment because
it looks at matters at too late a stage. The issues that the noble
Lords, Lord Campbell and Lord Kingsland, have very properly raised
should be considered when the decision to prosecute is
made.</p><p><a name="06103168000015"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew134"></a><a name="06103168000046"></a>Lord
Blaker:</b> My Lords, I had not intended to intervene
in this debate, but one point is not being sufficiently stressed. I was
an infantry officer in a line regiment in 1944. I fought from Normandy

<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_209"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Belgium. During the last action in which I took part and was wounded, we
were informed that there were no Germans on the start point of the
operation. In fact, there were Germans at that start point, greatly to
our surprise. If I ask myself whether I would have had time to think
about the rules of engagement in that situation, I believe that I would
have been shot, and so would some of my men. The decisions have to be
made instantly.</p><p><a name="06103168000016"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew135"></a><a name="06103168000047"></a>Lady
Saltoun of Abernethy:</b> My Lords, I, too, support
the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. I cannot help wondering
whether, if our soldiers had had to go into battle fearful of shooting,
even in self-defence, pulling their punches all the time lest they be
tried for murder, we should have won two world wars. How, in the speed
and heat of battle, as the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, has said, can a
soldier have time to be certain whether he is being threatened? It is
his life or his enemy&#146;s. It seems to me quite wrong to ask him
to risk his life for his country with his hands tied behind his back,
as it were. Under those circumstances, how can we be surprised if
recruitment becomes rather sticky? I could not nowadays encourage my
grandchildren to join the Armed Forces knowing what they could face
when they come
home.</p><p><a name="06103169000001"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew136"></a><a name="06103169000235"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, it would be difficult for me
to overstate the importance of this subject, which is why we have had a
number of briefings on rules of engagement during the debates on this
Bill. I am very grateful to noble Lords who have attended those
briefings and discussions that we have had in this House and at the
Ministry of Defence. So I will speak at some length on this matter. As
we have debated the Bill, there have been clear differences of opinion
on a number of issues, but on the matter of rules of engagement there
has been a higher level of misunderstanding across the House than on
any other issue, which is why we in the Ministry of Defence has taken
so much trouble to try to explain to noble Lords the practical purpose
of rules of engagement. Perhaps I may expand on that a
little.</p><p><a name="06103169000002"></a>Rules
of engagement are key documents vital to the success of every
operation. They are always classified to ensure that information about
the way our forces will operate during a mission does not get into the
public domain or into the hands of the enemy. Despite that, at a
briefing held on 23 October for noble Lords, we took the unusual step
of showing copies of actual rules of engagement for an operation. The
reason we did that was to give noble Lords an opportunity to understand
the way in which they are written, their complexity and their purpose.
I think that those noble Lords who were able to attend the briefing
found them illuminating and perhaps even
surprising.</p><p><a name="06103169000003"></a>Rules of engagement
give our commanders the political and military framework to achieve
their mission, including limits on the use of force. They must be
consistent with the law, of course, but their purpose and even their
language is operational. Rules of engagement are and must be flexible.
They must 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_210"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not and do not tie commanders&#146; hands unnecessarily. They leave
important decisions to commanders on the ground and those commanders
need and value this responsibility. Rules of engagement are more often
than not specific to individual missions. No two profiles are the same.
Crucially, they can be modified quickly to meet the needs of a changing
threat or a changing mission. Rules of engagement must retain these key
characteristics. If they do not, it would damage our operational
effectiveness. To give rules of engagement statutory force in the way
suggested here would be prejudicial to those characteristics on
operations.</p><p><a name="06103169000004"></a>Servicemen know
that the rules of engagement will help them to conduct operations in a
way consistent with the law, but each serviceman still has a
responsibility to carry out his role lawfully. To that end, personnel
rely on a combination of their training and detailed guidance. I shall
address the points made just a moment ago by the noble Lady, Lady
Saltoun, because she is absolutely right: it is vital for the
individual soldier to have confidence in the basis on which he can
operate so that, under pressure, he is able to make clear, split-second
decisions with a level of confidence and clarity. But giving statutory
force to the rules of engagement is not the way to achieve it.
</p><p><a name="06103169000005"></a>I recognise that Amendment No.
32 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, seeks to
safeguard the position of soldiers in combat. It would mean that a
serviceman who opens fire during armed combat or peacekeeping is not
guilty of unlawful killing unless he intended not to comply with an
order or rule of engagement. This defence is to apply where the
serviceman has acted mistakenly, but in good faith. I understand the
intention, but orders and rules of engagement simply do not cover every
situation in which a serviceman might open fire. I have tried to
explain why rules of engagement should not be drafted to tell each
soldier exactly what the law requires of him in every possible
situation. To take a simple example, rules of engagement do not say,
&#147;Do kill a prisoner&#148;; that is a matter for training. So I
return to the principle: do noble Lords want rules of engagement to be
legal documents or operational documents? They cannot be
both.</p><p><a name="06103169000006"></a>I turn to Amendment No.
33. This would give all rules of engagement the force of law. It is a
pity that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, was not able to attend the
briefing on 23 October because we went into some detail on this point.
As we looked at the detail of rules of engagement, it was clear how it
would be inappropriate to try to give them statutory force. As I have
said, they have an operational purpose and they vary between
operations. The amendment would mean that the law would change both
between and during operations; that is, changing as swiftly as the
operational situation changes. It would create a position of legal
encirclement of our Armed Forces in a way which I am sure the noble
Lord does not
intend.</p><p><a name="06103169000007"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew137"></a><a name="06103169000236"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord says
that rules of engagement change and so they do, but what is the status
of the yellow card that 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_211"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a soldier carries, telling him what he can and cannot do? Can he shoot
to kill, or may he fire only in self-defence? These are important
issues of principle. It is no good saying to a soldier, &#147;We are
giving you a card, but by the way, operational circumstances may cause
these rules to change
tomorrow&#148;.</p><p><a name="06103169000008"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew138"></a><a name="06103169000237"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Lord and I will address his point in a moment. Rules of engagement may
form a document many pages long and of some complexity, detailing the
nature of the operation. The card sets out guidance to a soldier
operating in certain circumstances which I will come to shortly.
However, we should not confuse the yellow card, as it was known during
operations in Northern Ireland, or card alpha, as it is sometimes
referred to, with rules of engagement. One is a sub-set of the other
and we should not use the terms
interchangeably.</p><p><a name="06103169000009"></a>Amendment
No. 34 would refine and limit Amendment No. 32. As I understand it, it
would limit the defence under Amendment No. 32 to where there were
rules of engagement which were relevant to conduct alleged. But the
problems I have outlined in relation to Amendment No. 32 also apply
here and, as I have explained, these are operational and not legal
documents in their drafting.</p><p><a name="06103169000010"></a>There are vital points of
principle here. How are our operations to be directed if every change
in the mission framework has statutory force? What effect is that going
to have on the officers drafting these operational mission frameworks?
How is our criminal law to work if we purport to change it between and
even during operations, and how are our servicemen to be trained in
what the law requires? Nevertheless, I recognise the sincere aim of
noble Lords in addressing this matter. I recognise that underlying
these amendments is a matter which is of the greatest importance to
this House, and as we have debated the issue we have heard how in
operations, servicemen who are tired, perhaps under fire and therefore
under considerable pressure, may have to make split-second decisions
about when to open fire. As we have just heard from the noble Lord,
Lord Blaker, from his experience, it is vital that our servicemen have
complete confidence in their position so that they can make instant
decisions in response to a situation, given the difficult circumstances
in which they often find themselves. Given that, I welcome the
opportunity to give the following assurances. Whether a serviceman who
opens fire and kills someone is guilty of murder depends on his view of
the situation at the time, and what he does on the basis of that view.
This applies both in combat and at any other time. For example, if a
soldier opens fire because he believes that he is faced with an enemy
combatant, he has not committed murder even if he has made a mistake.
It is the honestly held view of the service man or woman which counts
at all times. But inany case, a serviceman can use lethal
force against anyone who he thinks is posing an imminent threat to
human life. Again, what matters is the honest belief




<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_212"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that he has in making the assessment. This is the law of self-defence
and no rules of engagement can interfere with that inherent right, and
as is explicitly stated on every rules of engagement profile.</p><h5><a name="06103169000037"></a>6.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06103169000012"></a>I believe that their training
reassures all service personnel that they may trust to their view of
what is happening. I hope that my statement here will strengthen that
confidence. We ask a great deal of our Armed Forces. In return we owe
them not only our gratitude and support but must give them the
confidence to carry out the demanding and dangerous tasks we demand of
them.</p><p><a name="06103169000013"></a>No court
martial has resulted from a combat incident in these last three
demanding years of high intensity operations. At the same time, I am
very aware that one case has perhaps done more than anything else to
create uncertainty in this House and perhaps elsewhere about the legal
position in which servicemen might find themselves&#151;the case of
Trooper Williams. I do not wish to go over the details of the case
again&#151;noble Lords are already very familiar with it&#151;but
we have, as far as possible, ensured in the Bill that such a situation
cannot recur. We have also sought to ensure that servicemen do not face
investigation without good
reason.</p><p><a name="06103169000014"></a>The Bill,
therefore, makes three important changes. The commanding officer will
no longer be able to dismiss a serious case so as to prevent further
consideration by the service prosecuting authority. Clauses 125 and 127
provide that if the prosecuting authority decides not to charge, that
authority will be able to direct that the accused is to be treated as
acquitted. By such a direction, the Director of Service Prosecutions
can bar prosecution in civilian as well as service courts. Lastly,
commanding officers will have the general duty to ensure that
allegations and evidence of offences are investigated appropriately.
They will have a duty to make service police aware of allegations or
evidence of serious offences. But they will only have to do this if the
allegation or evidence is such as would indicate to a reasonable person
that such an offence had been committed by someone in the CO&#146;s
command.</p><p><a name="06103169000015"></a>The main
provision is in Clause 113. We believe that this will allow commanding
officers to exclude those incidents where there is simply no real
evidence of a serious offence. None of us wishes to have a situation
where personnel on operations face an investigation following incidents
where they have acted entirely properly.</p><p><a name="06103169000016"></a>As many noble Lords
will be aware, for almost two years now we have had in place in Iraq a
post-incident procedure. This ensures that after shooting incidents
where persons have or may have been killed or injured, commanding
officers gather all available information within their unit and make an
informed decision as to whether there is any evidence that an offence
has been committed. If they conclude that there is no such evidence,
they can recommend that a service police 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_213"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>investigation does not take place. That recommendation is put to their
chain of command for agreement. If the chain of command, which takes
service police and service legal advice, agrees, the report is filed.
This brings an early resolution to the vast majority of incidents. It
also allows us to demonstrate that our commanding officers have made an
informed decision and we have an audit trail of all incidents. Even
when a commanding officer determines that an offence may have been
committed, he is able to delay a service police investigation if the
operational circumstances demand it. His recommendation to delay has to
be agreed by his chain of command, also acting on service legal and
service police advice.</p><p><a name="06103169000017"></a>This
policy ensures, even in high tempo security operations conducted in
places such as Iraq, that commanding officers retain a proper
discretion as to whether there should be an investigation. It also
ensures that the very rare case in which there is evidence of an
offence is investigated by service police, with the support of service
prosecutors, as soon as possible. In this way, the operation of the
military justice system determines, for example, whether a serviceman
acted in good faith.</p><p><a name="06103169000018"></a>I can
confirm that the post-incident policy has proved very
successful&#151;so much so that, at the request of our operational
commanders, it has been adapted for use in Afghanistan. I can also
confirm&#151;this is very important&#151;that the provisions in the
Bill that I have described about the CO&#146;s role will support such
a policy.</p><p><a name="06103169000019"></a>I have taken some time
to set this out in some detail. These are vital issues of real
importance to our Armed Forces. I hope that, as a result, members of
the Armed Forces may continue to have confidence that the law takes
full account of the extraordinary and dangerous requirements that they
are expected to face. I hope that I have explained why&#151;although
I recognise their intention&#151;these amendments would not be in the
interests of the Armed Forces. On that basis, I cannot support
them.</p><p><a name="06103169000020"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew139"></a><a name="06103169000238"></a>Lord

have a fundamental disagreement about statutory force, an issue which
we cannot resolve. In that respect, I am basically on the side of the

at stake, but what are we going to do about it? Frankly, I do not
really know, but I think something must be done.</p><p><a name="06103169000022"></a>I should say to the noble Lord, Lord
Thomas of Gresford, that in the case of the Scots Guardsmen&#151;I
happen to know about it&#151;the soldiers&#146; orders that
morning, a Scots Guardsman having been killed by a sniper the day
before, were to stop and search. They had been trained with their rules
of engagement to give the warning twice&#151;&#147;Stop or
I&#146;ll fire&#148;. They had been trained to fire in a certain
position, in a certain way, at a certain part of the body to kill or
maim. That was their training. On the last occasion, General Sir Mike
Jackson was sitting on the Army board. He cross-examined them in depth
and was totally satisfied that they were telling him the truth. It is
no use saying that if people comply with the rules of engagement, as
the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, did, they are all right. The men did not
have a defence&#151;they were not all right. If they had had a
defence, they could have avoided their

moved an identical amendment in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06103168000020"></a>My position is that
the power to dish out 90 days&#146; military detention summarily is
just too much. I am not convinced that commanding officers want this
power. It is not much fun exercising summary judgments and many
commanding officers will be distinctly uncomfortable awarding more than
30, let alone 60 or 90 days&#146; military detention, even if it can
be awarded only using extended powers and with the prior knowledge of
the defendant&#151;a point of which I am sure the Minister will
remind us&#151;and even though the Royal Navy already has 90 days
available for detention.</p><p><a name="06103168000021"></a>The
House needs to understand that military detention is not some form of
military community service but a severe but effective regime. The
Minister will argue that the change is desirable because without
retaining 90 days for the Royal Navy the number of courts martial might
have to be increased. That is a fair point, but if the Army can manage
with a maximum of 60 days, what is the Royal Navy doing 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_217"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wrong with its regime of military detention? It must be doing something
wrong. Why cannot it achieve the desired corrective effect with only 60
days? I should be interested if the Minister could tell us how often
Royal Navy commanding officers have been granted extended powers beyond
60 days.</p><p><a name="06103168000022"></a>The Minister will also
argue that if the Army and Royal Air Force were granted the ability to
award90 days with extended powers, they would be able to
reduce the number of courts martial by increasingthe
punishment available, because it would not be necessary to resort to
court martial. But the argument would be more convincing if we saw Army
commanding officers regularly seeking and using extended powers. One
senior Army officer to whom I spoke last week said that he never sought
extended powers when he was a commanding officer, and when he was a
brigade divisional commander he never granted them. It would be helpful
if the Minister could show some statistical evidence that the extended
powers are currently being sought and used by commanding officers, and
of to what extent the Royal Navy uses extended powers over 60
days.</p><p><a name="06103168000023"></a>Make no mistake&#151;I
was and still am prepared to exercise military discipline, but
detention of over60 days is excessive. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103168000024"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew144"></a><a name="06103168000049"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> My Lords, I supported the noble Earl in
Committee on what seemed a sensible amendment, seeking to harmonise
detention powers to levels that have been perfectly satisfactory for
the Army and Royal Air Force in the past. I look forward to hearing
from the Minister how often the Royal Navy uses its powers between 60
and 90 days and why the circumstances are so
different.</p><p><a name="06103168000025"></a>There is another
question&#151;which I trust that the Minister has examined&#151;of
the resource costs that may be affected by this. Of course, if one
brings up a level of punishment to a higher one, it sucks up the cases
of people who would normally get lower punishments. That may involve
extra resources in terms of detention provision. I hope that the
Minister will be able to tell us that that has been taken into
account.</p><p><a name="06103168000026"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew145"></a><a name="06103168000050"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, there has been much interest
in the position of the commanding officer in the military criminal
justice system, and I believe that we are all agreed on the importance
of this. In recent years, some 95 per cent of cases have been dealt
with at summary level. These sorts of cases, minor in terms of the
criminal law, cover the low-level misconduct which, if not dealt with,
can have a significantly corrosive effect on unit discipline and
cohesion. We are convinced, and I am sure that the noble Earl will
agree, of the merits of this
approach.</p><p><a name="06103168000027"></a>A
key element of our consideration has been to ensure that in the future
commanding officers will be able to deal with an appropriate range of
offences. We have looked carefully at the different approaches of each
of the services. We have done so in anticipation of the requirement in
years to come, and therefore 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_218"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>against a background of an increasingly expeditionary approach to
operations in all our armed services. This has informed our approach to
the offences that commanding officers should be able to deal with and
the levels of punishment which they should have available.</p><p><a name="06103168000028"></a>Under the
Bill, Army and Air Force commanding officers will be able to deal with
a small increase in the number of offences than they can deal with now.
These are offences, such as assault occasioning actual bodily harm,
which in straightforward cases are regularly dealt with by their naval
counterparts and which, if proved, may require greater punishments. We
must not forget, of course, that at Clause 239 it is specifically
provided for that an accused must be given credit if he admits an
offence and has co-operated with service police, and this applies to
punishments awarded in the new summary hearing system as well as at the
court martial.</p><p><a name="06103168000029"></a>I am happy
to send further detailed examples to the noble Earl of the
Navy&#146;s use of this power, but I can give some data on how often
it is used. In 2005, Royal Navy commanding officers awarded periods of
detention 79 times at summary trial. Of these, eight were
for60 days or more, and seven of these followed a guilty plea.
In a further 24 cases, commanding officers awarded punishments of more
than 40 days&#146; detention. In 23 of these, credit for guilty pleas
may have reduced the punishment from more than the 60 days which this
amendment proposes. Removal of the power of 60 to 90 days&#146;
detention for the Royal Navy would therefore generate an unacceptable
increase in cases sent for trial by court martial. It would quite
simply have an adverse impact on confidence in the system of
discipline, and on operational effectiveness.</p><p><a name="06103168000030"></a>Conversely, by gaining these powers, the
Army and RAF might well see a small reduction in the number of cases
that need to be dealt with by court martial if accused persons are
happy to be dealt with by their commanding officer. There are important
safeguards in place over the use of extended powers to deal with the
additional offences and the use of sentences of detention longer than
28 days.</p><p><a name="06103168000031"></a>The
powers of punishment available to commanding officers is an integral
element of Bill proposals. The amendment would have an immediate
adverse affect on the administration of discipline in the Royal Navy,
and would remove what would be an important improvement for the Army
and Air Force. The proposals in the Bill have been carefully developed
to reflect the current and anticipated future requirements for
commanding officers, and safeguards appropriate for service personnel.
I hope that in light of this explanation the noble Earl will withdraw
his amendment.</p><h5><a name="06103168000042"></a>7

Attlee:</b> My Lords, I am still a bit disappointed.
The Minister mentioned actual bodily harm. It is sensible to include
that as an offence that could be dealt with summarily, for the simple
reason that actual bodily harm need not be a very serious assault. It
is a matter of some damage being done to the
victim.</p>

&#147;CHAPTER 5 THE
ADMINISTRATION TRIBUNAL
<ul><a name="06103170000034"></a>THE ADMINISTRATION TRIBUNAL</ul><ul><a name="06103170000035"></a>(1) There shall be a Tribunal, to be
known as the Administration Tribunal.</ul><ul><a name="06103170000036"></a>(2) The Administration Tribunal may sit
in any place, whether within or outside the United Kingdom.</ul><ul><a name="06103170000037"></a>(3) The Administration Tribunal shall
have the functions and composition conferred on it by this
Chapter.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06103170000002"></a>The noble Earl said: My
Lords, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 39 to 48. The Government
have made it much harder for the commanding officer to exercise summary
jurisdiction. It is thus harder to maintain discipline and morale in
military units. I always wondered how the services would work around
these legislative changes. The answer is what is called
&#147;administrative action&#148;, which is taken instead. By and
large, service personnel are content with this, because when they foul
up, the matter can be dealt with speedily&#151;a short flash-to-bang
time&#151;just like the situation that obtained before the moving
target of the ECHR impacted upon the summary dealing arrangements.
Ministers from my party have been just as morally weak-willed as those
from this Government.</p><p><a name="06103170000003"></a>The
problem, though, is that there is no appeal against administrative
action. That is particularly significant if the action is a discharge,
or, in the case of an officer, a requirement to resign the commission.
The Minister will point to the grievance procedure and the welcome
changes under the Bill. However, I think there is still a gap,
particularly in the case of forced discharge or resignation, because it
is harder to fight your case from without.</p><p><a name="06103170000004"></a>Some noble Lords may
think the tribunal might be a hindrance to the chain of command. I do
not think it should be. For instance, suppose a serviceperson&#146;s
career is to be terminated because his services are no longer required.
He can be discharged. With the proposed tribunal, however, the decision
to discharge can be repealed, and rapidly, because there is a provision
in my amendment to provide for rapid decision-making. In a case similar
to that of Mr Skinner, of Deepcut notoriety, the tribunal could
not&#151;indeed, would not&#151;take very long to reject any appeal
against discharge on the grounds of suitability to serve in Her
Majesty&#146;s forces.</p><p><a name="06103170000005"></a>Another problem arises where a
serviceperson is required to pay for loss or damage of equipment. I
confess I am not fully conversant with current procedure and the
provisions of the Bill, but I have personally been invited to pay for
loss of equipment by administrative action. I never signed for the 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_220"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>equipment I was alleged to have lost&#151;a sleeping bag. The
quartermaster sergeant did not have any paperwork that I had signed to
show that I had lost a sleeping bag. The problem was that everyone in
the squad had signed for a sleeping bag, so he assumed that I had lost
one. I had not. Old soldiers will be thinking, &#147;No change
there&#148;, but a tribunal would provide some way of rapidly seeking
redress.</p><p><a name="06103170000006"></a>Some noble Lords may
think that this process would be terribly time-consuming. The tribunal
could consider several simple cases in a morning, but in more
complicated cases it may be able to deal with only one in a sitting.
Some might think that the tribunal should have a wider remit, but in
drafting my amendment I was careful not to overlap with the remit of
the commissioner of military complaints. My objective is to provide a
means of appeal primarily against administrative action, which is
becoming much more prevalent, particularly against a discharge or
requirement to resign the commission. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103170000007"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew148"></a><a name="06103170000046"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> My Lords, I welcome the fact that the
noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has moved his amendment on administrative
tribunals, which we did not have time to consider in Committee. The use
of administrative action by the services in order often to bypass the
need for legal action was commonplace in the past and, from what the
noble Earl says, that has not changed over the years since I was in the
services. Whereas civilians have recourse to industrial tribunals when
their employer deals with them through comparable action, the only
action open to the serviceman at the moment is a redress of grievance,
which we know is ponderous and not transparent in showing justice being
done.</p><p><a name="06103170000008"></a>I recognise that we may
have a new situation with the ombudsman arriving, which may solve some
of the problems. The one criticism I had of the noble Earl&#146;s
amendment was that at Amendment No. 39 the rights of appeal seemed to
be rather narrowly drawn. I can think of cases of administrative
action, varying from merely placing a letter on the personal file
through to a posting on short notice, that might in other jobs amount
to constructive dismissal because it has affected the person&#146;s
career.</p><p><a name="06103170000009"></a>I support the principle
here. If we can ensure the needs are covered by the commissioner, we
may be able to meet the needs that there are, but we need to be aware
that administrative action in the services is an important part of the
set of different disciplinary measures available to commanding
officers.</p><p><a name="06103170000010"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew149"></a><a name="06103170000047"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, Amendments Nos. 38 to 48 seek
to create a right of appeal to a form of tribunal against certain
administrative actions, mainly any decision to discharge someone or to
require him to resign. The tribunal would be able to overturn the
decision or decide on other administrative action.</p><p><a name="06103170000011"></a>The amendments propose
appeals to the tribunal on three counts. In the case of discharge and
the resignation of a commission, service personnel already have the
right to respond before the discharge or resignation is made final, and
thereafter the right to 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_221"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>redress should they feel there are grounds for complaint. Equally, where
an individual is required to pay for the loss or damage of service
equipment, that requirement may be as a result of summary proceedings
against which he has the right of appeal or, if not, representations
through the chain of command, and, ultimately, service complaints are
available.</p><p><a name="06103170000012"></a>Given the limited
grounds proposed for the tribunal, the redress system would still be
required for other cases. We have confidence in the streamlined redress
system that the Bill provides and do not think that it would be right
to introduce a totally different system for certain cases. The tribunal
would represent an unnecessary and bureaucratic change that would serve
only to delay and complicate
matters.</p><p><a name="06103170000013"></a>I note the points made
by the noble Lord relating to the services ombudsman. Given what I have
said, I request the noble Earl to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103170000014"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew150"></a><a name="06103170000048"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Garden, for his comments on the amendment. I tabled it
as I have witnessed the problems that it seeks to address. I am aware
of situations where servicemen have been required to resign or have
been discharged and where the redress of grievance procedure is not fit
for purpose. I hope that the Minister will inform me in
writing&#151;he is extremely reliable in that regard&#151;although
the Bill may by then have completed its passage, how many redress of
grievance claims have been made in respect of discharge or requirement
to resign a commission, how long each has continued and how many are
outstanding. Frankly, I am not happy about the increasing use of
administrative action to get round the problems that we have created by
making it harder to exercise summary jurisdiction. However, that is not
something that we want to put in the Bill. We have a lot still to do.

provision made by Court Martial
rules.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06103170000019"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, I will deal first with all the government
amendments in this group. These amendments deal with the minimum and
maximum numbers of lay members required for a court martial. In
Committee I said that I would consider noble Lords&#146; arguments,
in particular those of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, and the noble Lord,
Lord Thomas of Gresford, about the desirability of stipulating the
minimum and maximum number of lay members of the court martial in the
Bill rather than in
rules.</p><p><a name="06103170000020"></a>The
combined effect of these amendments is that there will ordinarily be a
minimum requirement of three members. But, in cases prescribed in
regulations, the minimum number will be five. Those cases where five
will be required will be decided by objective criteria, for example
&#147;all Schedule 2 offences&#148;. The size of the court martial
panel therefore broadly reflects the current position in the Army and
Air Force district and general courts martial.</p><p><a name="06103170000021"></a>In addition, these amendments allow for
regulations, which will be subject to the affirmative procedure, to
provide other criteria which will allow a further two members to be
added to the minimum requirement. It will be for a judge advocate to
decide whether to direct the court administration officer to specify
additional members of the panel, and he will be able to do so only in
limited circumstances.</p><p><a name="06103170000022"></a>The
relevant criteria will focus on matters such as the likely length or
location of the trial, particularly when held overseas, other than in
Germany. The reason that we need to have the flexibility to have
additional members specified for a trial is to avoid the problem of a
trial collapsing because a lay member drops out for some reason. With
additional members a trial may proceed even if one or two members drop
out, provided that the number of members does not drop below the
required minimum.</p><p><a name="06103170000023"></a>The amendment
also provides for rules to allow the judge advocate to sit alone in
certain circumstances. There may, for example, be legal matters to
decide, which must be done in the absence of the lay members so as not
to prejudice their findings of
fact.</p><p><a name="06103170000024"></a>In the light of that
explanation I hope that noble Lords will feel able to support these
amendments. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103170000025"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew152"></a><a name="06103170000050"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, other matters arise
in this grouping. The noble Lord, Lord Drayson, has followed some of
the suggestions made in Committee, for which I am grateful. However, I
say in traditional Liberal Democrat tones that he does not go far
enough.</p><p><a name="06103170000026"></a>The
points of principle to which I refer in Amendments Nos. 50 and 51 are
important. I imagine that to those who have been in the services and
have sat on courts martial it must seem very odd that in America a
court martial can consist of a cross-section of the Armed Forces, as
opposed to officers and warrant officers. However, as I said
previously, if one looks at the matter from the point of view of the
defendant who is seeking a fair trial, there is a basic principle
involved. 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_223"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The basic principle as set out in Magna Carta is that he should be tried
by his peers. The private soldier who appears before officers cannot
expect them to have the same understanding of the circumstances in
which he committed offences as a jury drawn from a cross-section of the
community, particularly if he is charged with a civil
offence.</p><p><a name="06103170000027"></a>I
pose again the point I made in Committee. First, would it not seem odd
for a policeman to be charged or tried by senior police officers or for
firemen to be tried by senior fire officers, or for someone working in
the City to be tried by senior accountants or financiers from the City?
Throughout the community it can always be said, &#147;We are part of
a special group. We have special rules that only we understand.
Therefore, it is only right that we should be the people who try the
underling who is brought before us because of his misdemeanours. We are
part of such an arcane mini-society that only we can understand the
matter&#148;. That is not the principle on which the criminal law
generally acts in this country. Whatever a person&#146;s position,
when he is brought before the ordinary criminal courts of this country
he is tried by a cross-section of the community with wide experience of
all matters and he can expect them to have a full understanding of his
background and
position.</p><p><a name="06103170000028"></a>Secondly,
Amendment No. 51 proposes that the court martial should consist of a
cross-services section of people. I understand that there is a
considerable desire in the services for them to remain separate. They
have different traditions in many regards, which we respect. But surely
the armed services should be looked at as a whole in the context of a
Bill which brings them together for the purposes of courts martial and
criminal proceedings. A Director of Service Prosecutions covers all
branches of the services. Amendment No. 58, in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord Astor, suggests
that,</p><ul><a name="06103170000043"></a>&#147;Court Martial
rules must make provision for the majority of the Court Martial panel
to be drawn from the defendant&#146;s own
service&#148;.</ul><a name="06103170000032"></a>That
seems inappropriate. Surely it is right that experience across the
services should be shared and that there should not develop one level
of understanding or of justice in one service and another level in
another.<p><a name="06103170000029"></a>I shall not pursue
Amendment No. 52 at all. Amendment No. 55 would simply require the
qualifications for membership of the court martial to be limited to a
serving member of the Armed Forces without reference to rank or
position. In Committee I pointed out that that is the position in the
United States, and has been for many years. I see no reason why we
should not move to a more egalitarian system in courts martial in this
country.</p><p><a name="06103170000030"></a>My final point, on
Amendment No. 57, is very different. It is on majority verdicts. I have
already spoken about that today, and I am not going to repeat what I
said. It is the most distinctive part of courts martial that the
decision is by a simple majority. I know the verdict is decided by
simple majority in Scotland, but there are 15 jurors there. There are
simple majorities in some of the continental systems, 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_224"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 224</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but we have always thought our system of trial by12 jurors to
be superior to systems where only a few people sit.</p><p><a name="06103170000031"></a>Magistrates courts in
this country deal with 95 per cent of criminal cases, but they have
very limited powers and deal with minor offences. If courts martial
confined themselves to disciplinary matters, which take up most of the
first part of the Bill, and did not get involved in civil offences, I
would have a different attitude. However, where murder, manslaughter,
rape and so on can be charged, and where prosecutions can proceed
before courts martial, it is only right that majorities, as set out in
Amendment No. 57, should be required before guilty findings are made. I
have said as much as I need to without repeating what I said in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06103172000001"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew153"></a><a name="06103172000055"></a>Lord
Astor of Hever:</b> My Lords, I will speak to
Amendment No. 58. We have tabled the amendment again as it concerns an
issue that men in the Armed Forces feel strongly about, not least noble
and gallant Lords in this House, as well as the Chief of the General
Staff and the First Sea Lord, as they made plain in their evidence to
the Select Committee in another place. It is very much our view that
members of a court martial panel should be drawn from the
defendant&#146;s own service. Despite what the noble Lord, Lord
Thomas of Gresford, said, that view is shared by many of the service
men and women in all the services to whom we have spoken.</p><p><a name="06103172000002"></a>I am very grateful to
the Minister for his helpful response to the amendment, both in
Committee and outside the House, and I have taken his comments on
board. I accept that in his position he has to allow for the rare
situations where there is a case for mixed panels at court martial. I
would very much like to see a presumption for a single service panel,
and I would be grateful if the Minister could give an assurance that
there will be such a presumption. I also support Amendment No. 59,
proposed by my noble friend Lord
Attlee.</p><p><a name="06103172000003"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew154"></a><a name="06103172000056"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for the
Minister&#146;s amendments in this group, which are welcome. I do not
support the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of
Gresford. If he is right in his general approach, perhaps we should
dispense with courts martial entirely and remand all the cases to Crown
courts in the United Kingdom&#151;just bin courts martial altogether.
I do not think that that is the view of the House. I do not know
whether the noble Lord has noticed, but not all soldiers are
particularly bright, and if you had a small panel, they would struggle
with a complex fraud case, as does a jury
now.</p><p><a name="06103172000004"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew155"></a><a name="06103172000057"></a>Lord

Attlee:</b> My Lords, generally speaking, the other
services, on average, have more intelligent servicemen. That is a fact
of life. Royal Air Force equipment is rather more delicate than a
Challenger tank, and the Royal Navy&#146;s equipment is really
complicated.</p>

assumes that the officers on a court martial feel it their duty to
convict. I have not sat on a contested court martial, but I know that
the ethos among officers is definitely not to want to convict, because
then you are going to have to sentence. Officers in a court martial
want to be absolutely sure, if they are to convict, that the person is
guilty beyond all reasonable doubt. I strongly support my noble friend
Lord Astor of Hever in his Amendment No. 58. I would be extremely
unhappy if I found myself being court martialled by a panel other than
one made up of Army officers who understood the context of the
situation in which I had found
myself.</p><p><a name="06103172000007"></a>I have an amendment in
this group, and I declare an interest because I have a cousin in legal
practice in Scotland who undertakes a considerable number of service
cases. My understanding is that the most northerly court martial centre
will be in Catterick and there will be none in Scotland. However, there
are a large number of service bases in Scotland, such as Kinloss,
Lossiemouth, Leuchars, Arbroath, Rosyth, Helensburgh and Edinburgh.
Surely, a tri-service court martial centre in Scotland would be viable.
There are considerable costs in moving all the court players all the
way to Catterick from Scotland.</p><p><a name="06103172000008"></a>There is a further problem with the
summary appeal court, which sits at a court martial centre. As I said,
the most northerly court martial centre is Catterick, and a serviceman
might be deterred from appealing a summary jurisdiction, even though he
knows that he has been unfairly dealt with&#151;I am afraid to say
that I have been told that even today there are one or two commanding
officers of questionable parentage. The reason for this reluctance is
the need to go all the way to Catterick&#151;not just for himself, to
appeal, but for all the other players. That does not compare well with
the civilian situation, where you can appeal a magistrates&#146;
court decision in the local Crown court. I hope that the Minister can
assure me that one of the benefits of the Bill will be that we can have
a tri-service court martial centre in
Scotland.</p><p><a name="06103172000009"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew157"></a><a name="06103172000059"></a>Lord
Boyce:</b> My Lords, I will make one or two comments
about some amendments in the group. First, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas,
contends that there is a need to have privates or other ranks on the
court martial panel. I am unable to agree with that. The noble Lord,
Lord Thomas, said that the court members should be experienced.
Certainly he will find that the private, or even the corporal, does not
have sufficient experience. Experience is vested in the warrant
officer, or indeed in the officer, given that, certainly in the Royal
Navy, a third of officers have come up through the ranks. It can be
perfectly well found among officers and warrant officers sitting on the
court. By the way, the services are not egalitarian; let us try to
remember that.</p><p><a name="06103172000010"></a>On the amendment
proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, about Scotland, I mentioned in
Committee, and before, the importance of making sure that our court
martial locations are distributed throughout the country. In addition
to the points that 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_226"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Earl made, I will add two more. First, if you are having a
court martial and you are coming down from Scotland, you would lose a
large chunk of your unit, who may be witnesses or friends. That can be
disruptive to the unit&#146;s activities. Secondly, the reason for
having a court martial in a local area is <I>pour encourager les
autres</I>; it allows people in the unit to see the person being court
martialled in the area where he has been operating, appointed or
drafted. I would like some reassurance from the Minister that we will
not just see two or three court martial centres, as currently
outlined.</p><p><a name="06103172000011"></a>Finally, I support the
noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, in his plea that the default position
should be that a single person being court martialled should have on
the court martial largely those from his own service. I do not agree
that you will see a trial involving, for example, a flying incident
being properly judged by a court martial with no aviators on it, or,
vice versa, a trial involving a grounding incident in the Navy being
properly tried by those in other services. If the amendment is not
successful, I hope that the Minister can reassure us that there will be
some sort of provision to make sure that, by and large, the court
martial trying a single service defendant will be populated by people
from the same service.</p><h5><a name="06103172000054"></a>7.30

Drayson:</b> My Lords, I will now deal with
Amendments Nos. 50, 51 and 58, which relate to how membership of the
court martial is
selected.</p><p><a name="06103172000013"></a>Although some of these
matters are dealt with in the service discipline Acts, we believe they
are more appropriate for rules. But those rules will be subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure. I can confirm that we intend that the
court martial will comprise a majority of officers with provision in
rules for there to be one or two warrant officers, depending on the
size of the
court.</p><p><a name="06103172000014"></a>Amendments
Nos. 51 and 58 take completely opposite viewpoints on whether there
should be mixed-service panels. We strongly believe&#151;this is the
view of all three services&#151;that a court martial should generally
be made up from individuals of the defendant&#146;s own service, and
that should be the presumption. There will be exceptions to
that&#151;for example, when there are co-defendants from different
services. Rules will provide the criteria upon which the court
administration officer should select a mixed
panel.</p><p><a name="06103172000015"></a>It is important for the
service context to be given due weight in relation to any offence,
whether or not it occurs during operations. Also, most personnel
usually serve in their own single service environments and would expect
to face a tribunal comprised of members of their own service. We
believe that members of the Armed Forces broadly have confidence in the
court martial system, and changes that dilute the service character of
the court martial can undermine the confidence of service personnel in
it. Subject to that, selection should be random. Obviously, none of the
members can come from the same chain of command as the defendant, nor
are they likely to have any involvement in the case, and 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_227"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 227</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is stated in the Bill. It would not make sense to select from that
group where no person is or should be eligible. The Bill provides for a
joint court administration officer, who will ensure consistency in the
selection procedures.</p><p><a name="06103172000016"></a>Amendment
No. 55 would, in effect, prevent the appointment of civilian lay
members at the court martial of a civilian. That is clearly
inappropriate. We shall consider the composition of the court martial
on the trial of a civilian and can deal with that in rules. The recent
judgment in the Martin case is relevant here. We will certainly want to
consider whether a majority or even the whole lay membership of the
court should be civilian in those rare cases where a civilian is to be
tried for an offence in the service system. Those rules are already
subject to affirmative resolution procedure, which will ensure that
your Lordships will have an opportunity to scrutinise our proposals in
due course. I would therefore urge the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of
Gresford, not to press his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103172000017"></a>Amendment No. 57
makes various proposals in relation to verdicts. I can agree on one:
that the judge advocate should have no vote on finding; but that is
already provided for in Clause 160(2). I have recently written to the
noble Lord on the remaining issues, so I will briefly summarise our
position. The imposition of a system of unanimous verdicts has an
attraction to those familiar with the English jury system. However, a
court martial is not the same as a jury trial. The vast majority of
cases that the court martial will hear are equivalent to those that are
dealt with in the magistrates&#146; courts in England and Wales,
where a simple majority suffices&#151;namely, a vote of two to one.
This will be mirrored in the court martial for the majority of its
cases.</p><p><a name="06103172000018"></a>There is nothing
inherently unfair in a system where simple majority verdicts are
allowed. As well as in our own magistrates&#146; courts, they are
used in jury trials in Scotland, in the Court of Appeal and in many
other jurisdictions across the world, including in the House of Lords
and the European Court of Human Rights. Simple majority systems are
different, but not
inferior.</p><p><a name="06103172000019"></a>We
accept that the members of the court martial should seek unanimity on
the verdict if possible. Judge advocates already give a direction to
the lay members to seek to do that. By attempting to impose the allowed
split of a majority verdict, the amendment would introduce the risk of
a hung court and a retrial. It would mean that an accused who, in the
court martial system may be acquitted on a three to two decision, for
example, would instead have to be retried. That would be most
unattractive to the Armed
Forces.</p><p><a name="06103172000020"></a>I cannot support an
amendment that would require the division on a majority verdict to be
disclosed to the court. That does not occur in the magistrates&#146;
court, as the decision of the lay members of the Bench is the decision
of the court. That is the effect that we seek to replicate for the
court martial. The only occasions when splits are announced to a court
are when judges are giving their verdicts&#151;for example, in the
House of Lords. Lay members of a 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_228"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>court martial are not judges and I see no good reason to depart from the
model of the magistrates&#146; court in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06103172000021"></a>Finally,
on Amendment No. 59, I welcome the opportunity to address the issue
raised by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, and spoken to by the noble and
gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, in relation to court centres. As I said at
Second Reading, the military criminal justice system must operate where
there are significant concentrations of service personnel. It is
therefore quite right for the noble Earl to raise the issue of
Scotland, where in future there will be more personnel from all three
services, from Faslane to Lossiemouth. As I said in June in reply to
the noble and gallant Lord, I believe that there is a strong service
case for Scotland, and for the
south-west.</p><p><a name="06103172000022"></a>I do
not believe that the court martial in the UK should be confined to the
three new court centres. I am sure that in complex cases where their
excellent facilities will be essential, all three services will use
them. That is common sense. It is also common sense that where there is
no such specialist requirement, the key driver must be the operational
effectiveness of the services and not of court buildings. I am sure
those who provide services to the military criminal justice system will
recognise that.</p><p><a name="06103172000023"></a>I
hope that the noble Earl will understand why, having supported his
reasoning, I am unable to support his amendment. This is not a matter
on which we should legislate, but I hope that I have given comfort to
him as to our direction in this matter. I hope that the noble Lord will
be encouraged by my response and will not press his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103172000024"></a>On Question,

the Ministry of Defence to welcome always having an independent member,
as it would almost certainly reduce the number of cases with which the
new Service Complaints Commissioner would have to deal. In his reply in
Committee, the Minister seemed to think that the arrival of the
commissioner would reduce the need for an independent member of the
service complaints panel, but both posts are complementary. In his
answer then, the Minister again gave specific cases where the Secretary
of State might think that an independent member was necessary. But if
the Secretary of State makes decisions about when to include an
independent member, that will tend to look as though he does not trust
the chain of command and that will undermine it. If we have a standard
system which is understandable, that will reinforce the chain of
command and the confidence that the services have in the system. I beg
to move.</p><p><a name="06103174000006"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew165"></a><a name="06103174000115"></a>Earl

an independent member, does he mean someone with no military experience
whatever or someone who has military experience but is no longer
serving in the regular Armed Forces? It might be desirable for someone
who is no longer serving and is out of the system to take an
independent view, but I am not sure about the presence of a complete
lay person.</p><p><a name="06103174000007"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew166"></a><a name="06103174000116"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> My Lords, I mean an independent member in
the same sense as in the clause. Perhaps an independent member should
always be present rather than only when the Secretary of States decides
that one should be there.</p><p><a name="06103174000008"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew167"></a><a name="06103174000117"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, Amendments Nos. 61 to 63 would
require an independent member to be present on all service complaint
panels, and Amendments Nos. 64 and 65 would allow the Secretary of
State to require more than one independent member in prescribed
cases.</p><p><a name="06103174000009"></a>Our starting point is
that at the heart of the relationship between service personnel and the
chain of command is the chain of command&#146;s responsibility to
investigate wrongs and remedy them. But, in some cases, the balance
moves in favour of an independent element in that process.</p><p><a name="06103174000010"></a>We have already
identified the key areas where an independent element is needed. They
are where a complainant alleges unlawful discrimination or harassment,
bullying&#151;which can amount to harassment in some
instances&#151;or bias or other improper behaviour. But we do not
intend to limit the cases to those instances. There will certainly be
others in which expertise or independence calls for an independent
element. We also propose to ensure independent oversight of the
effective working of the system by the appointment of a statutory
Service Complaints Commissioner, who will report directly to the
Secretary of State.</p><p><a name="06103174000011"></a>We
considered very carefully the value that an independent member would
bring to the decision-making process and concluded that, in addition to
the 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_231"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>key requirement to inject a fresh but informed perspective on a case, we
would also look at the knowledge and experience in a particular field.
In other cases, independence is not a key requirement, and in those
cases there is no reason not to use panel members from the wider chain
of command or civil servants&#151;especially ones with knowledge and
experience relevant to the
complaint.</p><p><a name="06103174000012"></a>We
therefore believe that our proposals for an independent member on
panels in the consideration of certain cases will achieve the right
balance between, on the one hand, independence and outside areas of
expertise and, on the other hand, the need for the services to respond
to complaints and for complaints to be considered by the chain of
command with a clear understanding of the service context.</p><p><a name="06103174000013"></a>There should not be a requirement for
more than one independent member to fulfil this function, given that
one member will have been appointed to a particular panel on the basis
of his independent and fresh perspective and also, perhaps, experience
and expertise applicable to the complaint in question. It is important
that the services do, and are seen to, consider and remedy any wrongs,
but there should also be an independent element within the system and
an independent review of the performance.</p><p><a name="06103174000014"></a>On the strength of my response to the

information. But, as he said in that
letter:</p><ul><a name="06103174000091"></a>&#147;This is very
much work in progress and will continue to be developed in consultation

very short as regards getting this provision into the Bill in a
satisfactory structure. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell
us who are the others to be consulted, as mentioned in his letter,
apart from the Children&#146;s Commissioner. A question arises over
whether the roles of the Children&#146;s Commissioner and the Service
Complaints Commissioner are exactly parallel. However, I am aware that
the Ministry of Defence has a history of thinking of members of the
Armed Forces as children needing appropriate discipline and needing to
be kept in order.
<p><a name="06103174000021"></a>The Minister&#146;s
letter outlines a timescale for implementation&#151;which, again, is
helpful&#151;with selection beginning next year for appointment by
the end of 2007. It would be useful to have in the Bill a schedule of
what is required for a person to be a service complaints commissioner.
That is what my amendment attempts to do. As I said, it has been tabled
in some haste because the Government&#146;s amendment came late and
we had little time in which to respond.</p><p><a name="06103174000022"></a>It is important that this new post should
be defined in the right direction. Specifically, can the Minister tell
us whether it will meet all the requirements of the Blake report, which
considered the need for such a commissioner? For example, paragraph
12.101(iii) of the report
states:</p><ul><a name="06103174000092"></a>&#147;In an important
case, the Commissioner should be able to institute legal proceedings to
set aside legally flawed decisions not to prosecute&#148;.</ul><a name="06103174000083"></a>Is that the sort of commissioner that
the Minister is proposing? I beg to move.

Astor of Hever:</b> My Lords, we oppose the
amendments in this group, which are an unnecessary addition, given the
presence of Clause 366. We are concerned that the amendment would give
even more powers to the commissioner and would therefore undermine the
chain of command even further than is done by Clause 366. We have heard
many times from noble and gallant Lords and other noble Lords in this
House that preserving the chain of command is the essential ingredient
for the discipline of the Armed Forces, and we cannot support an
amendment that would further weaken that.</p><p><a name="06103174000024"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew171"></a><a name="06103174000121"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, we now
return to what I previously called a key part of the Bill, on which I
have written to noble Lords. In speaking to Amendment No. 66, I shall
also cover Amendments Nos. 67 and 72.</p><p><a name="06103174000025"></a>I remain absolutely
convinced that the appointment of a Service Complaints Commissioner
under the Government&#146;s amendments moved in Committee is right
for the way that the Armed Forces operate. It meets the overall
objectives underpinning Mr Blake&#146;s recommendation in the Deepcut
review, which sought to promote the effective operation of existing
military proceedings, rather than to replace them and to provide
independent assurance that the procedures are working as effectively as
they can. It will provide the best solution for service personnel. They
need to have confidence in a fair and efficient system. I believe that
this is best achieved by the changes we are making in the Bill. They
streamline the existing system and introduce 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_233"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 233</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>independence where that is necessary. But they also retain a connection
between redress and the services. I think it essential to retain the
important role of the services in looking after the welfare and
discipline of those under
command.</p><p><a name="06103174000026"></a>I would like to
reiterate some of the main points of our proposed system. First, the
Service Complaints Commissioner will have an important role in relation
to allegations of bullying, harassment, and other forms of misconduct.
The commissioner will be able to refer such complaints to the chain of
command, which will then have to check with the alleged victim whether
he or she wants to make a complaint. These allegations can be sent to
the commissioner by the alleged victim or any other member of the
public.So the Bill will provide an alternative to going
straight to the chain of command. We will lay down in subordinate
legislation, which will be subject to affirmative resolution, how the
commissioner is to be kept informed about cases he has referred to the
chain of command. This will also ensure that whoever contacted the
commissioner about the case can also be kept informed of
progress.</p><p><a name="06103174000027"></a>There will be
independent oversight by the commissioner of the performance of the
system as a whole, with direct reports to Parliament and direct access
to Ministers. Further, the independent element in the consideration of
complaints related to bullying, harassment and other forms of
misconduct will be provided by the presence of an independent member on
service complaint panels. We have already talked about complaint panels
and I now want to concentrate on the
commissioner.</p><p><a name="06103174000028"></a>As
I have said previously, and I again stress here, although some of the
proposals in AmendmentsNos. 66 and 72coincide with
those of the Government, Amendment No. 72 goes beyond what is proposed
by the Government. The noble Lord&#146;s amendments would involve the
creation of a parallel system of complaint, controlled and directed by
a commissioner. The relationship between its decisions and those of the
internal redress system is not specified, but I suspect that having two
systems would inevitably be complicated. The amendment leaves it to the
Secretary of State to work out the details of this parallel or
alternative
system.</p><p><a name="06103174000029"></a>However,
these amendments would undermine the responsibility of the services for
dealing with complaints and the parallel system they require would mean
that some complaints would be dealt with under the internal system and
some under the commissioner&#146;s. This could result, for example,
in a lack of consistency in dealing with complaints; in the application
of time limits; and ultimately, a significant and worrying decline in
the ability of the services effectively to look after their own
people.</p><p><a name="06103174000030"></a>However, I share the
view of the noble Lord, Lord Garden, expressed in the House on 12
October, that it will be crucial to ensure that the post of Service
Complaints Commissioner is filled by an appropriate person. As such, we
intend that this individual will be someone of the stature and
experience appropriate to a post of this importance, as the noble Lord
has said. 



<notus-date day="31" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_234"></a><b>31 Oct 2006 : Column 234</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We will consult the Children&#146;s Commissioner in line with the
recommendation of the House of Commons Defence Committee.</p><p><a name="06103174000031"></a>We envisage that
appointment will take place through public advertisement and a fair and
open competition, and that the normal principles of the public
appointments process will apply. We will consult further with any other
persons whom we think can usefully contribute. We intend that the
selection panel will include an external, independent element, and we
are exploring the possibilities, including the opportunity for the
selection panel to be chaired by a senior Civil Service commissioner. I
remain convinced that the appointment should be made by the Secretary
of State, as is the norm in comparable cases, and we see no reason to
be different with this appointment.</p><p><a name="06103174000032"></a>I also agree that the commissioner should
be adequately resourced in order to give effect to the role. This will
need to be kept under review in relation to the commissioner&#146;s
workload as the role develops. As an individual officeholder, the
commissioner will have the legal powers necessary to appoint staff. The
commissioner&#146;s annual report will provide the commissioner with
the opportunity to raise any concerns about resources and the ability
adequately and effectively to carry out the role on that basis. I most
firmly believe that the existing system will work fairly and
efficiently, and that it will maintain the balance between the service
role and the appropriate degree of independence in responding to
complaints. I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103174000033"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew172"></a><a name="06103174000122"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for his response. I now find myself somewhat confused about what this
new post will do, which is part of the problem. There seems to be a
reluctance to define the post in any great detail. The Minister has
raised the issue of the independent member of the service complaints
panel, yet when we discussed that a moment ago, that was something that
would be invoked only when the Secretary of State saw fit. On these
Benches there is a real concern that we may find that all the
recommendations of Nicholas Blake after Deepcut fall between two
systems, neither of which has been fully
implemented.</p><p><a name="06103174000034"></a>I turn to the
suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, that Clause 366 says
everything necessary&#151;I think he was indicating that. In that
case, we differ because it is a very sparse clause and just says that
the Service Complaints Commissioner exists.</p><p><a name="06103174000035"></a>I take seriously the Minister&#146;s
concerns about particular aspects of the schedule that we are offering
in Amendment No. 72. I shall reconsider that, but we have not finished
the debate on whether we have a clear view through the Bill on what the
Service Complaints Commissioner will be able to do and whether that
will meet the requirements of Blake. For now, I beg leave to withdraw
the amendment.</p><p><a name="06103174000036"></a>Amendment, by

suspicious movements through his airfield. Your Lordships will have
seen that the vice-president of the United States last week appeared to
endorse the practice of interrogation using water-boarding as a

Stephen Grey, <I>Ghost Plane</I>, was featured in the <I>Guardian</I>
of 26 October. We have tried to get the Government to respond to these
concerns in different ways, with amendments to the Civil Aviation Bill
and the Police and Justice Bill.</p><h5><a name="06103174000113"></a>8
pm</h5><p><a name="06103174000048"></a>I now have
a much more limited aim: to ensure that military personnel are not
implicated in this nightmare activity of extraordinary rendition. The
debate we had in Committee was extraordinarily useful. The Government
took their usual position that there is no problem because it is all
covered by international treaties already. The Minister gave us
reassurances that the military are not really at risk because all these
flights are covered by diplomatic clearances; the commanding officer is
thus absolved of responsibility.</p><p><a name="06103174000049"></a>I was, however, less comforted once I
re-read the views of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;I am pleased
to see him in his place&#151;whose knowledge of the law much exceeds
mine:</p><ul><a name="06103174000102"></a>&#147;I am in no doubt
that if the commanding officer of any aerodrome in the United Kingdom
had reason to believe that an in-transit aircraft was engaged in an act
of external rendition, or there was a real risk that it was so engaged,
he would be under a personal legally binding duty to investigate the
matter, irrespective of any superior orders he had had to the contrary.
Not to act, in those circumstances, would render him liableto
prosecution for complicity in torture&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 12/10/06; cols.
439-440.]</ul><a name="06103174000085"></a>My
amendment is a very mild one in some ways, to ensure that we do not end
up in that situation. In Committee, the Minister was obviously less
certain about the commanding officers&#146; situation, as, one must
assume, the commanding officers will be. The amendment permits the
Defence Council to help commanding officers by issuing appropriate
regulations, and reminds them of their legal responsibility. I beg to
move.

Drayson:</b> My Lords, the amendment once again
raises issues such as extraordinary rendition, as well as international
obligations. In the context of the Bill and the debate in Committee,
however, the concern relates particularly to the responsibilities of
commanding officers.</p><p><a name="06103174000055"></a>I do not intend to add
to what my noble friend Lord Triesman said on extraordinary rendition
in general in the debate on 18 July. Nor do I wish to add to what was
said more recently, on 18 October, by my noble friend Lady Scotland.
She made it clear, in the context of the Police and Criminal Justice
Bill, that the Government are more than satisfied that the police
already have sufficient legal powers. They are able to react to any
intelligence suggesting that any offence under either UK domestic law
or our international obligations is being committed when foreign
aircraft transit through our jurisdiction, including our military
airfields.</p><p><a name="06103174000056"></a>I
am afraid that Amendment No. 69 does not add anything to the law as it
stands. As I have said, there are already sufficient legal powers to
react to any intelligence that an offence is being committed. Any
regulations that might be made under the proposed clause would not add
to those powers. Propose subsection (2) of the amendment, again, adds
nothing. Of course commanding officers, like anyone else, must not
become parties to crime. We do not consider that there are any other
international obligations which this clause could be referring
to.</p><p><a name="06103174000057"></a>I hope that what I have
said adds to the debate and reassures noble Lords that this amendment
is neither necessary nor desirable. There is already sufficient
provision in domestic law to cover their concerns. I hope that, having
raised the matter once more, the noble Lord feels able to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103174000058"></a><b><a name="61031-0002.htm_spnew183"></a><a name="06103174000133"></a>Lord

illness. The perceived lack of information in this area, whether
justified or not, is not helpful either to the families of service men

thinking particularly of the great

service. This is why this amendment sought to ensure that the Director

Prosecutions.</p><p><a name="06103174000071"></a>Like
many other noble Lords, I am particularly grateful for the way in which
the Minister has kept us involved during the progress of the Bill.
Therefore, on reflection, I have accepted that there may be occasions
when there is not a suitable service lawyer to fill the appointment of
the Director of Service Prosecutions. I obviously hope that this will
be the case only on rare occasions. However, I accept the argument that
it would be wrong to create a straitjacket by placing a statutory
requirement in the Bill. If such a situation arose&#151;when there
was no suitable candidate with military experience&#151;I hope that
it would be possible by regulation to ensure that the Director of
Service Prosecutions designate undertook an appropriate induction
course. It is essential that servicemen and servicewomen have
confidence that the Director of Service Prosecutions understands the
conditions of operational service. I beg to

confidence of our Armed Forces is sustained in the Director of Service

such experience, he should be given the opportunity to gain some before

I would agree with the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, and say how
helpful the Minister has been. I hope that he will consider the

the Bill. I have especially taken on board the views of both current
and former service chiefs, who have

have assured me that they are content with the Bill as it stands and
with the proposals that I outlined to your Lordships for the selection
process. They welcomed the consultation that there will be about the
job specification, and the terms and conditions for the post, and the
involvement of a senior serving officer in the selection process. I
think we agreed on two things: that the director should have
appropriate service experience; and that the recruitment process should
be sufficiently robust to ensure that the person appointed will be an
outstanding individual who will enjoy the confidence of the services
while being entirely independent from
them.</p><p><a name="06103174000075"></a>By &#147;service
experience&#148;, I mean an understanding of service life and
operations in each of the services and of the needs and the working of
a service system of justice and discipline. It is possible that there
will be an outstanding candidate for this important post who does not
have previous uniformed experience or, indeed, whose service might have
been some years before. In both cases it would be particularly
important for them to undertake an appropriate induction period before
taking up the appointment. Similarly, where the director to be
appointed is from one of the services, he or she might also need a
period to develop a deeper understanding of how the other two services
operate. We recognise that such an induction process needs to be
intensive and of a sufficient duration in order for the individual to
develop a detailed understanding of life across all three services. As
I have already said, it is essential that the director has a knowledge
of how each of the services operates and of the needs and the working
of the service system of justice and discipline. On the basis of these
reassurances, I hope that the noble and gallant Lord feels able to

the publication of the review of sustainable construction. The review
was launched in July 2005 and reflects the views of many in the
construction industry and of other interested parties. It pulls
together in one document the main strands of government policy and
industry initiatives on sustainable construction, taking account of
developments since the publication of <I>Building a Better Quality of
Life</I> in 2000. It also sets out some initial targets on how industry
can meet the challenge of sustainable construction. Copies of the
review are available in the Libraries of both
Houses.</p><p><a name="06103160000034"></a>I have asked my
officials to develop over the course of the next year a forward-looking
strategy for sustainable construction. This will refine the initial

the industry can work together to deliver greater sustainability in the

and a new cross-country) from four currently existing franchises
(Central, Silverlink, cross-country and Midland Mainline). The new
franchises will begin operation on Sunday 11 November 2007 and
will provide over 2,000 daily rail
services.</p><p><a name="06103160000038"></a>Each ITT has been
informed by recent public consultations. Bidders have to provide the
minimum service levels the ITT sets out and can propose additional
services subject to any operational constraints and
affordability.</p><p><a name="06103160000039"></a>Our aim is to
build on the recent success of current operators, meet current and
future passenger demand and facilitate increases in capacity. The
changes proposed will increase the number of trains operated per day
over the rail network. In many areas, timetables will change to help
deliver more frequent and faster services. In particular, the west
coast main line will see marked increase in capacity, following the
significant investment on the route, with the implementation of a 2008
timetable. In the new cross-country franchise, bidders will be required
to price a 30 per cent increase in capacity on key routes. The east
midlands franchise starts the process of segmenting the long distance
and commuter markets on the route, which will make train lengthening
simpler to implement.</p><p><a name="06103160000040"></a>Bidders
must deliver value for money for both passengers and taxpayers, and
deliver improvements for current and future rail users. Performance
will be contracted to improve significantly across all three new
franchises.</p><p><a name="06103160000041"></a>In the east midlands
and West Midlands franchises, where the operators are responsible for
stations, the busiest stations will achieve secure stations
accreditation to improve passenger safety. The winners of the three
franchises will also accept interoperable smartcard ticketing across
the whole of the franchise during its lifetime. Fares regulation will
remain capped at a maximum average rise of RPI plus 1 per cent on all
regulated
tickets.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61031-wms0001.htmstate_7"></a><a name="06103160000009"></a>Surveillance:
