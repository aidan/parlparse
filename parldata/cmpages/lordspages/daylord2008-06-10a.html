Drug misuse in prison, as measured by random mandatory drug tests, has, however, dropped by 63 per cent since 1997. Drug misuse is a chronic relapsing condition that can take many years to address successfully. The time spent in prison often represents only a small part of the treatment process, so there are no measures in place to determine levels of drug dependency for prison leavers.</p>

Given that drug dependency lies at the root of so much crime and so much reoffending, is he aware of the constant transfer of prisoners within the system undermining the effective treatment of prisoners? Will he undertake to consult the prison doctors in the British Medical Association on how to co-ordinate the better treatment of prisoners in prison with the treatment of prisoners on release back into the community?</p>

I understand the concern about prison transfers. When the prison population is under pressure, there is concern about the impact that it can have on drug treatment programmes. Clearly, the Prison Service does all it can to ensure that that does not happen, but the integration of services and the collaboration between the health service, the Prison Service and through care services is very important indeed. As far as the BMA is concerned, I am ever eager to talk to that organisation.</p>

Does my noble friend agree that treatment services outside prison in the community have improved dramatically in the past few years due to the hard work of professionals and that in prisons, with the integrated treatment services that are now in place, those services can be expected to improve dramatically? Key to all this is the resettlement of prisoners outside prison. In other words, we need through care and after care to be successful.</p>

There is no doubt that it is very important that the kinds of programmes that have been developed are developed in parallel in prisons, which is happening in a number of prisons. We expect to see expansion of that in the future. Through care and proper integration between prison drug treatment services and care after the person leaves prison are critical.</p>

I certainly agree that the case for vigorous sentencing is very clear. There is no ambivalence from the Government in relation to their attitudes towards drugs. We have made it consistently clear that these drugs are illegal and should not be taken.</p>

Drugs worth &#163;100 million are estimated to be traded from prison cells and SOCA estimates that up to 30 high profile prisoners run their empires from behind bars. We know that the Government have commissioned a report from David Blakey, which apparently was given to Phil Wheatley, the director-general of the Prison Service, last month. When will the Minister agree to share the contents of that report with the rest of us so that we can see the true scale of the problem?</p>

Because it is an attempt to quantify illicit dealing, it is very hard to come to an accurate figure. My understanding is that research undertaken in 2001 estimated that the sum was up to &#163;24 million. This House should not ignore the major efforts made by the Prison Service to improve security. Ministers received Mr Blakey&#146;s report about three weeks ago. Understandably, we wish to consider it before we make known our recommendations in due course.</p>

There is of course a wider relationship between drug use and crime, but those are the figures I have.</p>

The onus is on individuals to familiarise themselves with the law of the state in which they are driving. The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency will be provided with an extra &#163;24 million over three years to enforce the rules on roadworthiness and driver hours.

I am not unfamiliar with it. The department has recently designed a new sign to advise large and heavy vehicles not to take unsuitable routes. The issue of satnavs relates to that.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="080610107000345"></a> Clause 2, page 3, line 4, at end insert&#151;</p>

</ul>
<a name="80610-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="080610107000124"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this group of amendments completes the drafting of provisions relating to the possible future change to terms and conditions and to loans. As I stated on Report, the drafting of two amendments accepted into the Bill at that stage required an addition. The power to give undertakings in Clause 2(5) as currently worded encompasses only undertakings about loan regulations as defined in the Bill. However, just as Clause 2(4) enables compensation arrangements about both loan regulations and Section 186 regulations, so we need also to enable the Secretary of State to give undertakings about the power to make or amend regulations under Section 186 of the Education Act 2002. Without this power, the Government could give undertakings not to amend various repayment terms and conditions but would not be able to guarantee that they would not cancel the loan outright&#151;a power included in Section 186. Amendment No. 1 would rectify this.</p>

<a name="80610-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="080610107000125"></a>Amendment No. 3 makes the equivalent addition to Clause 4(6). This will mean that when making or amending regulations under Section 186 of the Education Act 2002 as well as in amending loan regulations, the Secretary of State must seek to ensure that borrowers will not be in a worse position as a consequence of their loan being sold. Amendment No. 4 is consequential on Amendment No. 1. Welsh Ministers do not have the power to make or amend regulations under Section 186 so the Bill cannot give them the power to make undertakings on that subject.</p>

<a name="80610-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="080610107000126"></a>The amendments to the drafting in this group of amendments are important in that, were a government to be using undertakings in a sale transaction, it would be essential to cover the Section 186 regulations as well as the loan regulations. I believe I flagged this up on Report and hope the noble Baronesses opposite will understand. I beg to move.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="080610107000351"></a>(3) The report must be laid during the period of 3 months beginning with the date on which the Secretary of State enters into the transfer arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="080610107000131"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 2 deals with value for money, which has rightly been at the centre of our debate. We have listened carefully to the arguments put forward by the noble Baronesses, Lady Verma and Lady Sharp, on this matter and have been persuaded that we should strengthen the commitment we have already given in debate.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="080610107000132"></a>Amendment No. 2 places a statutory obligation on the Secretary of State to report to Parliament within three months of each transaction. That report must inform Parliament about the assessment of value for money his department has made leading to the transaction going ahead. It should also reflect any guidance the Treasury had given to his department to ensure the required procedures used across the public sector for assessing value for money are adhered to.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="080610107000133"></a>The amendment would ensure that, throughout the long-term programme of sales, Parliament will receive prompt and transparent information to help it to exercise scrutiny over the sales. As I have said at earlier stages of the Bill, the Government will welcome that parliamentary scrutiny, and that of the National Audit Office, as it will help to ensure that the programme of sales develops over time and yields good value for money over the long term. At the same time, the process will preserve the essential flexibility that we need to retain to alter or supplement the exact criteria applied to each sale, for which we have argued in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="080610107000134"></a>Amendment No. 5 ensures that the obligation to report to Parliament is confined to the Secretary of State and to sales for which he is responsible. Welsh Ministers and the Welsh Assembly Government, should they go ahead with sales, will be determined to fulfil their obligations to obtain good value for money and will account appropriately to the National Assembly for Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="080610107000135"></a>I am extremely grateful to the noble Baronesses, Lady Verma and Lady Sharp, for their thoughtful and constructive approach to value for money. I am pleased to be able to move the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

Indeed, that has been a marked feature of every stage of this process, for which the Minister deserves our gratitude. The willingness of the Minister to respond to our scrutiny is testament to her open-mindedness and is an example of the way in which the parliamentary process is meant to work. I still feel that there are a few questions that need to be answered, and I will get straight to the point.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="080610107000137"></a>First, this is a minor point, which I hope will be taken up in the other place if I cannot get an adequate answer today. How will the independence of the report be guaranteed? Is there any way to ensure that the Treasury does not give guidance to make a sale look like there is value for money, when a more independent source would have disagreed? What is the precise nature of the guidance that is expected?</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="080610107000138"></a>This morning, I listened to the segment on the &#147;Today&#148; programme about the sale of QinetiQ to the Carlyle Group, which the National Audit Office claims lost the taxpayer &#163;90 million. The Government seem to defend the sale to the hilt, claiming that there was in fact value for money for the taxpayer, despite independent evidence to the contrary. That seems to me to be a gloomy foreshadowing of where we might be with the student loan sale. In fact, what I heard on the radio was precisely what I warned against on Report.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="080610107000139"></a>I repeat for the record that, if the report intimates that the taxpayer has lost out in any way and the Government try to persuade the public that this was the best deal in the current climate, or that in fact it was better than expected, that would be wholly unacceptable and deeply discouraging. It would annihilate any trust that taxpayers may cling to when it comes to safeguarding their money. I do not want to be the student loan Cassandra, but I have grave suspicions that I will be hearing a similar argument on the radio about the student loan book in the all-too-near future.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="080610107000140"></a>That leads me to my second question, which is about the fact that the Government have already spent the &#163;3.4 billion that has been budgeted. It is my understanding that the sale of student loans this year must yield something near to that amount. Is that inaccurate? Was the projected revenue just a guess appended to the Comprehensive Spending Review, or was it factored into government spending? Will the Government have to sell more loans to generate this sort of money?</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="080610107000141"></a>The assurances have been in the form of the repetition of the claim that the Government are committed to a vigorous value-for-money framework. My overriding question is how, considering the current market, it would be possible to give such a guarantee. Are there any investment analysts who think that now, or even soon, would be the best time to sell? I understand that the Minister took advice from Deutsche Bank regarding ways to make the loans more commercially attractive. At any time in the discussion, did it indicate that this was the best possible time to sell the debt? The answer to that question is extremely important.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_487"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="080610107000142"></a>In the interest of establishing how ready the Government would be to wait to sell the loans to guarantee value for money, I should like to hear the answer to a final question. What would happen if the Government waited two years to sell the loans? Would the Government have to find the &#163;3.4 billion from somewhere else? While a report is a welcome step in the right direction, it is by no means close to the destination&#151;real confidence that the taxpayer is not going to be hurt.</p>

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="080610107000143"></a><a name="80610-0003.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80610-0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080610107000468"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I should like to echo the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, in saying how much we welcome the co-operation we have had from the Government Benches, particularly the attitude of the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, to the Opposition Benches. We are very grateful to her for bringing forward various amendments, a number of them at our behest.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="080610107000144"></a>I too have a few reservations. I was slightly surprised that the Opposition accepted this amendment without question although I realise now that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, is asking a few questions. We are now getting a quick report after the transfer arrangements have been put into effect. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, explained to us, these transactions have to be simultaneous so that the sale takes place simultaneously with the clinching of transfer arrangements. Inevitably, the report is ex post rather than ex ante, whereas we were asking for an assurance that procedures would be gone through that meant that the Treasury and those involved in the sale were having to ask questions before they entered into these transactions to make sure that they were succeeding in getting value for money.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="080610107000145"></a>We were all agreed that there was a Catch-22 in this. In so far as the Government revealed their hand as to how they were going to proceed with the sale, it made the commercial transaction itself difficult to carry through because they would, to some extent, be revealing their hand. In some senses this is a second best. Again, we were agreed that the process of the National Audit Office and the report to the Public Accounts Committee&#151;as happened with the sale of the Defence Research Agency and Carlyle&#151;can point up where value for money has not been obtained. The difficulty is that by that time the deal will have been done. If it is bad value for money, the taxpayer suffers. Although there will be a quick report to Parliament here, the very fact that the Treasury guidance has to be revealed makes it the more likely that we shall see the Treasury looking for and wanting to gain value for money. Nevertheless, we are looking at whether we are succeeding in getting value for money after the event rather than before the event.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="080610107000146"></a>My final point, which I made again at Report, is that the present time is not a good time to try to securitise any loans. The noble Baroness was talking about listening to the &#147;Today&#148; programme this morning. I was listening to the &#147;Money Programme&#148; over the weekend and it was talking about the complete collapse of the securitisation of loans on both the American stock market and on our own stock market. This is not a good time to try to securitise any set of loans. As  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_488"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 488</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I said last time, I wonder why the Government are determined to go ahead with the sale of a &#163;3.4 billion tranche of the loans in the year 2008-09 rather than going for a smaller tranche of the loans to see how things would proceed, or even leaving it completely this coming year and proceeding when the market is more likely to be a good one. It seems to me that it would be sensible for the Government to begin by piloting a relatively small sale rather than going straight into a very large sale of &#163;3.4 billion of the loans.</p>

<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="080610107000147"></a><a name="80610-0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80610-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080610107000469"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> My Lords, I shall do my best to respond to the questions of the noble Baronesses. I shall start with the question of the valuation of the student loan book. We have consistently said that the valuations that we referred to, including the &#163;3.4 billion that was alluded to as a first tranche of the sale programme, were estimates for preparation for the CSR&#151;the figures are not anything other than estimates for budgeting purposes. I make it absolutely clear that we have said all the way through the passage of this Bill that if the conditions for sale are not right, the sales will not be made. There are very strong duties on the accounting officer&#151;in this case, the Permanent Secretary of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills&#151;to ensure that value for money is obtained on behalf of the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="080610107000148"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked about the independence of the report and the nature of the guidance. There will be a government report on value for money, as we have discussed. We expect the National Audit Office to report on the initial sale or sales and, I would imagine, perhaps on further sales thereafter. The guidance involved covers all government expenditure and asset sales and will rightly apply to the sale of student loans portfolio.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="080610107000149"></a>I want to clarify the situation regarding the stories on the &#147;Today&#148; programme. As I said, the Government will welcome scrutiny of the sale of student loans by Parliament and the National Audit Office. That will help us to ensure that the programme of sales develops over time and yields good value for money over the long term.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="080610107000150"></a>I do not wish to comment particularly on the QinetiQ sale but that has created a leading FTSE 250 company. As the Public Accounts Committee highlighted, it has raised significant proceeds for the taxpayer and protected the viability of a business of strategic importance to UK defence. I understand why the noble Baroness drew attention to this question. The sale of student loans is very different from the sale of a defence company; it involves a long-term programme and the Government will seek to build on the advice that they receive, including that from Parliament and the National Audit Office. We are taking expert advice&#151;the noble Baroness asked about this&#151;from our sales adviser, Deutsche Bank, and are working very hard to make the most of that advice.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="080610107000151"></a>The noble Baroness generously accepted that we have tried to make practical sense of the concerns raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Verma and Lady Sharp. We will bring forward what we see as a workable option for a report for the very long term.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="080610107000164"></a>The Bill legislates in five main areas to improve education and skills. First, it will make it compulsory by 2015 for all young people to participate in some form of education or training, at least part time, until they are 18 years old. Secondly, it will make various provisions to encourage, enable and assist young people&#146;s participation. Thirdly, it will give adults certain rights to expect skills training and enable analysis to take place of the quality and value of such training. Fourthly, it will make a number of changes to the inspection and regulatory regime for independent schools and non-maintained special schools. Fifthly, it will help to ensure a fair and transparent admissions system to schools both pre- and post-16.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="080610107000165"></a>The most significant provisions raise the education and training leaving age to 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2015. The Bill&#146;s first clause places on all young people resident in England a responsibility to participate in education or training up to their 18th birthday from those dates, provided that they have not first achieved a level 3

Clauses 2 to 9 describe and define the range of ways in which young people can participate. These include: full-time education or training, including school, college and home education and informal learning programmes designed to re-engage young people; work-based learning, such as apprenticeships; and, for those who are employed, self-employed or volunteering, part-time education or training, provided it leads to an accredited qualification and takes up the equivalent of at least one day a week.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="080610107000166"></a>Clauses 10 to 35 place duties on local authorities, employers and parents to support young people in fulfilling their duty to participate. Clauses 40 to 48 set out the implementation process. Raising the education and training participation age will work only if the appropriate education and training is on offer and young people can access it effectively. However, if a young person refuses to engage, despite a local authority&#146;s best efforts, it will have recourse to appropriate sanctions&#151;a formal last chance to engage voluntarily, an attendance notice, a fixed penalty notice and ultimately, an appearance before a youth court, which could lead to a fine. However let me stress that these are ultimate sanctions. If at any point, even after sanctions have been sought, the young person starts to engage voluntarily, proceedings would be stopped. We expect that only a very few cases will get this far.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="080610107000167"></a>Clauses 54 to 60 transfer responsibility for the Connexions service, which encourages and supports young people&#146;s participation, from central government to local authorities. They allow for its inspection by Ofsted and for guidance and some level of direction from the Secretary of State over its core functions. They also allow for Connexions services to gather records about young people&#146;s activities, to enable them to provide effective advice.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="080610107000168"></a>Clause 66 puts a duty on schools to offer full and impartial information and careers education, especially to students approaching GCSE. Clauses 71 to 75 establish for adults a right to intermediate and basic skills training in certain circumstances and, for those aged between 19 and 25, to their first full level 3 qualification. To enable analysis of the effectiveness and economic value of adult skills training, they also provide for sharing anonymised information between the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, the Department for Work and Pensions, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the devolved Administrations.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="080610107000169"></a>Clauses 80 to 130 streamline the registration and regulation of independent schools. They transfer registration of these schools to Ofsted; they strengthen the independent schools standards by adding a new standard on leadership and management; and they repeal previous legislation creating a now unnecessary bureaucratic requirement for independent special schools to be formally approved by the Government for the purposes of accepting children with special educational needs. I should add that while the raising of the education and training age in the Bill applies directly to England only, at the request of my Welsh colleagues, I expect to move an amendment at a later stage to enable the National Assembly to apply similar provisions in Wales in future, should it so desire.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_491"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="080610107000170"></a>Why are we raising the education and training participation age? The high number of people who drop out of education and training after the age of 16 represents a long-standing weakness in our national education system. We are currently placed 24th out of 29 in the OECD on participation in education or training at 17. Young people who drop out of education and training so early suffer serious loss in terms of their economic and social prospects, and their individual losses aggregate to a serious national weakness in terms of social cohesion and prosperity.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="080610107000171"></a>There is overwhelming evidence of the negative consequences of dropping out of education and training at the age of only 16. There is a strong correlation between becoming NEET&#151;not in education, employment or training&#151;and other risk factors. NEET status is proven to be a major predictor of poor health, depression and low income. Furthermore, young people with a level 2 qualification earn, on average, 25 per cent more than those without, or the equivalent of &#163;100,000 over their lifetimes, at present values.</p>

<a name="80610-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="080610107000172"></a>It is an important national priority that, whatever employment they enter, all young people have the transferable skills and gain the qualifications they need to prosper and to be able to adapt to the changes of employment that they will face during their lifetime. This imperative is set out graphically in the report on skills produced by my noble friend Lord Leitch, which predicts that the number of low-skilled jobs will decline by 81 per cent by 2020. Moreover, we know that those who leave education or training at 16 are disproportionately from poorer families, so making sure that all young people stay on until at least the age of 18 is also a matter of social justice.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="080610107000173"></a>What progress are we making on reducing the proportion of those not in education, employment or training beyond the age of 16? Our latest indicators show recent progress: the Labour Force Survey covering January to March this year showed a 0.9 per cent reduction in 16-18 year-old NEETs and, specifically, a 1.9 per cent reduction at the age of 16, and latest Connexions data from local authorities show a 1 per cent reduction in 16-18 year-olds not in education, employment or training over the past year. However, we have got much further to go. Prior attainment is one of the strongest indicators of whether a young person will stay on beyond 16, so it is vital that we continue our focus on raising standards in our schools. More young people than ever are now achieving the level 2 standard of five or more grades A* to C at GCSE or equivalent at age 16, and 2006 saw the highest numbers ever continuing in full-time education when they completed Year 11.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="080610107000174"></a>However, we need far more young people to achieve at GCSE and to stay on beyond that. This is why the Government are today publishing the National Challenge strategy<I>,</I><I></I>which sets out the next phase of our programme to improve underperforming secondary schools. National Challenge is targeted on the 638 secondary schools nationwide where fewer than 30 per cent of pupils gain five good GCSE passes, including English and mathematics, and it is supported by &#163;400 million of targeted investment. Where schools are stuck below the 30 per cent threshold, and self-improvement is not  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_492"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 492</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sufficient to raise them above it by 2011, more radical solutions will be implemented. They will include a large number of additional academies by 2011, so that we close more low-attaining schools and replace them with independently managed academies resolutely focused on raising standards and extending opportunity.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="080610107000175"></a>We are therefore fully alive to what needs to be done to improve standards at school level. I could talk equally about the changes that we are bringing about in the teaching profession and what we are doing to see that every child masters the 3Rs in primary school. However, over and above school improvements, we also need a more relevant work-related curriculum for teenagers who would benefit from it; we need new and better vocational courses and qualifications to lead on to more and better apprenticeships; and we need better advice and guidance for young people as they make decisions about the choices available beyond the age of 14. Together with higher school standards, it is on this basis that it is right and credible to raise the education and training participation age. Let me, then, take these three elements in turn&#151;work-related diplomas, apprenticeships, and advice and guidance.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="080610107000176"></a>First, on work-related diplomas: for students beyond the age of 14, we are developing new diploma qualifications, which combine the best of theoretical and practical learning with educational rigour and extensive work-related experience. The diplomas will appeal to young people with all kinds of ambitions, giving them the opportunity to select from different units and options. The first diploma students will begin studying this September. The new diploma has three elements: generic learning, including English and mathematics, which is common across all diplomas; principal learning in a broad subject or sector; and additional or specialist learning that can be selected according to the interests and aspirations of individual students.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="080610107000177"></a>The diploma will be available at three different levels: at foundation level, it will be equivalent to five GCSEs at grades D to G; at higher level, equivalent to seven GCSEs at grades A* to C; and at advanced level, equivalent to three and a half A-levels. It will be available in 17 disciplines, including engineering, construction, information technology, health and other service sectors. All diplomas will require a student to achieve a minimum standard in English, Maths and ICT, to complete a project and to do a minimum of 10 days&#146; work experience. Diploma students will, therefore, acquire the skills and knowledge essential for a particular sector of employment, while they are also given the broader skills and aptitudes that employers require, including teamwork, independent learning and problem solving.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="080610107000178"></a>Secondly, on apprenticeships, we are transforming the quantity and quality. Apprenticeship starts increased from 65,000 in 1997 to 180,000 last year. Completion rates are rising just as radically, from 24 per cent in 2001 to 63 per cent last year. We are building on this progress, so that by 2013&#151;when this legislation first takes effect&#151;a further 90,000 apprenticeships will be available, alongside an entitlement to an apprenticeship for every suitably qualified young person who wants one. These are employer-led places and every apprentice  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_493"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 493</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be employed under either a contract of employment or apprenticeship. Clause 67 is an important step in extending apprenticeships. It makes it explicit that the LSC is under a duty to provide apprenticeships on an equal footing with other education and training options beyond the age of 16.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="080610107000179"></a>However, I know that as well as wanting to be assured that enough apprenticeship places are available, noble Lords will be concerned whether the apprenticeships on offer are of high quality. We will strengthen the quality of apprenticeships by improving the apprenticeship blueprint against which all apprenticeships will be quality assured; by integrating apprenticeship component qualifications into the qualifications and credits framework; and by introducing new national completion certificates that will incentivise more apprentices to complete their training, give them the recognition they deserve, and provide future employers with clear statements of an apprentice&#146;s achievements.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="080610107000180"></a>The role of sector skills councils in articulating employer demand will be central to extending apprenticeships. The new national apprenticeships service will work in partnership with the sector skills councils. We have also agreed a set of new functions for those councils, including: to promote the take-up and spread of apprenticeships, to brand national completion certificates, and to maintain a bank of qualifications from which apprenticeship frameworks will be formulated.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="080610107000181"></a>Some young people will want to work for employers without the capacity to provide apprenticeships of sufficient quality, and we certainly do not wish to stand in their way. Employment can give young people invaluable skills and experience from the age of 16. However, we believe that all young people should have access to high quality, accredited training for at least one day a week alongside their employment to make sure that they can continue to develop their skills and careers. That is provided for in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="080610107000182"></a>Thirdly, I come to advice and guidance. It is essential that all young people receive the support they need to make the right choices about their education and training beyond the age of 14. At the moment, information, advice and guidance are provided by the Connexions service, which is the responsibility of the Secretary of State. The Bill will transfer the legal responsibility for delivering the Connexions service to local authorities. Through their children&#146;s trusts arrangements, local authorities will be able to integrate the Connexions service into their wider youth support services. Local authorities are uniquely placed to tailor the service to meet the needs of young people in an area by working with schools, colleges and other local learning providers.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="080610107000183"></a>That will be vital to support some of the most vulnerable young people, who have complex needs which may act as barriers to participation. For some, that will involve targeted youth support, which will provide a dedicated lead professional to help to organise support across a range of services including education, social services and Connexions, drawing in what they need from the most appropriate services. That transfer will also support high-quality delivery by requiring local authorities to have regard to the information,  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_494"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 494</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>advice and guidance quality standards, which were launched in July 2007 and have been widely welcomed by the sector.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="080610107000184"></a>Let me also say a word about a key incentive to encourage young people to stay in education beyond the age of 16: education maintenance allowances. For some young people, financial considerations can be the major barrier to learning. Through the new education maintenance allowance, the Government have already made significant progress in encouraging young people to participate after the age of 16, and we are committed to maintaining that progress. EMAs will continue as the participation age rises, although we will look at the structure of financial support to ensure that it is as effective as possible. More than 540,000 16 to 19 year- olds are now in receipt of EMAs at a cost of about &#163;500 million per year. That is a wholly new investment and policy development under this Government.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="080610107000185"></a>This brings me, finally, to the issue of compulsion. Those who oppose the raising of the participation age argue that improving education and training is alone sufficient to improve participation. They argue that putting a legal duty on young people is heavy-handed; that it will lead to the criminalising of young people who face challenging circumstances often beyond their control; and that it will only increase the disengagement of young people.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="080610107000186"></a>The noble Baroness sitting opposite me may, in the nicest possible way, be about to make those arguments, so let me get my retaliation in first. Let me first say a word about enforcement. I cannot overemphasise that enforcement is a last resort. Making a success of this policy requires that we motivate more young people to continue beyond the age of 16 because they positively want to do so, taking advantage of all the new opportunities, including diplomas and apprenticeships, which I described earlier.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="080610107000187"></a>However, we cannot will the end without willing all the means required to achieve it. The experience of some other countries suggests that where a requirement to participate has been introduced without a means of enforcing it, it has had little effect, whereas those countries which have introduced a means of ultimately enforcing the requirement have seen a significant increase in participation&#151;the most recent example being Western Australia. If participation in education and training really matters, it should be enforced, just as school attendance is currently enforced. I assume that those who do not wish to enforce this higher education and training participation age are not in favour of making school education voluntary simply because of the existence of truancy.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="080610107000188"></a>We also need to look at who loses from non-enforcement. Without compulsion, a hard core of young people who come from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, and who have so much to gain from continuing their education and training, will be less likely to participate voluntarily, and may be left behind in a continuing underclass. However, with compulsion, we believe that participation will soon be seen as the normal and expected option for all young people&#151;just as was the case when the Victorians made primary education compulsory for all and when the school leaving age was raised to 16 a generation ago. This is  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_495"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>why the Bill necessarily sets out in detail the process that would be followed in cases of non-compliance. In doing so, it imposes duties not only on young people but on parents, schools, colleges, employers and local authorities, and all have their part to play in this fundamental social reform.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="080610107000189"></a>In conclusion, let me set this reform in a broader historical context. Precisely a century ago, in 1908, no less a figure than Winston Churchill&#151;then in his Liberal phase&#151;proposed a reform similar to the one we are bringing to the House today. His intention, he said in an impassioned letter to Prime Minister Asquith, was to,</p>
<ul><a name="080610107000362"></a>&#147;thrust a big slice of Bismarckism over the whole underside of our industrial system&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080610107000339"></a>A key element of that, he argued, was to make education compulsory until the age of 17. This did not come to pass, not least because of the rapid approach of war with Germany. However, there continued to be strong political and industrial support for the change, and as the First World War drew to an end, HAL Fisher, president of the Board of Education in Lloyd George&#146;s Liberal-Conservative coalition, included in the Education Act 1918 a requirement that every young person should be in at least part-time education or training until the age of 18. Fisher argued that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="080610107000358"></a>&#147;The compulsion proposed in this Bill will be no sterilising restriction of wholesome liberty, but an essential condition of a larger and more enlightened freedom, which will tend to stimulate the civic spirit, to promote general culture and technical knowledge and to diffuse a steadier judgement and a better-informed opinion through the whole body of the community&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80610-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="080610107000190"></a>Alas, because of post-war economic uncertainty and cuts in government funding, the Fisher Act was never fully implemented. But Fisher&#146;s words ring as true today as they did in 1918. This Bill is no restriction of wholesome liberty, but an essential condition of a larger and more enlightened freedom for our people. I commend it to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="080610107000193"></a>However, in case the Minister thinks that I am getting carried away in my support for the Bill, I will add that, just because we can all sign up to the same goals, that does not necessarily mean that we think that the Government have found the right means of

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="080610107000194"></a>There are serious flaws in the Bill and I know that I will not be alone, both inside the House and outside, in raising them. Not least of these is the way in which the Government legislate, although sadly that problem is not confined to this Bill. Large parts have been added without proper debate or scrutiny, making our job here all the more important, and the consultation process is open to question, although I shall come back to that. The Bill, like so many before it and like the education Bill that we will see in the next Session and on which, bizarrely, this Bill depends for its full implementation, will once again bring in more structural changes to a sector that is heartily tired of tinkering and tampering.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="080610107000195"></a>Part 1 of the Bill deals with raising the participation age in education and training. Part 2 lays out the support that will be provided to enable this to happen. The Bill creates a duty on all young people to participate in education or training up to the age, ultimately, of 18 and places further duties on parents, local authorities and employers to facilitate this. I am sure that I will not be the only person to lift my hands in despair at how the Government are going about achieving this worthy ambition. A breach of this duty will result in sanctions. The Minister assures us that this is the last resort, that it will affect only a tiny number of people and that the sanctions are there simply to send out a message, but we have serious concerns.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="080610107000196"></a>The young people at whom these measures are aimed are already disaffected with the education system. I realise that we are now talking about the cohort of year 6, but the children are similar. In many cases, they have in effect dropped out before they turn 16. Truancy rates are at their highest for 10 years, so if the Government cannot keep in school all our children who should be there now, how do they think that we will cope with thousands more disaffected young adults who are suddenly being told that they must stay on in a system that they feel offers them nothing?</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="080610107000197"></a>The Government have looked at this problem and have typically come up with the wrong solution. Instead of compulsion, with the threat of being slapped with a fine and hauled in front of the youth courts, we should look at how to engage and excite young people so that they have a desire to keep going, to maintain enthusiasm and to be informed and educated enough to make up their own minds without the Government bossily telling them what they can and cannot do. Surely that would be a better long-term approach than creating this raft of regulations, rules, penalties, duties, parenting contracts, threats, sanctions and the masses of attendant bureaucracy that these measures will inevitably create.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="080610107000198"></a>I had an interesting meeting with the Institute of Directors, 70 per cent of whose members are from small and medium-sized enterprises&#151;the very employers on whom the burden will fall most heavily and who have the least resources to cope. They are extremely concerned about the extra paperwork, the extra time and the difficulties that the Bill will create for them; they are concerned about falling foul of the law should they miss something or make a mistake. The Government

We have real unease about the practicalities and the principles of compulsion and we will press the Government on this issue.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="080610107000199"></a>When we look at the training and education that will be made compulsory, we must be wary of allowing the Government to set targets in the heedless pursuit of just any qualifications. As my honourable friend Michael Gove said in another place, we should do everything that we can to harness every individual&#146;s intellectual talent. I wholeheartedly agree, but would add practical talent. However, this is not only about acquiring a piece of paper. That piece of paper has to mean something.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="080610107000200"></a>My mother left school at 14 and worked until she was 67 without any formal qualifications. Yet you could not have met a better educated, better informed person, who was exceptionally good at what she did. There must be thousands of people like her; otherwise, our economy would not be as strong and robust as the Government assure us that it is. We must not have qualifications simply for qualifications&#146; sake. The skills that are to be acquired must be meaningful to the young person and useful to their work. This may well take the guise of informal education, where appropriate, which can help to provide young people who have chaotic lives with the self-confidence, resilience and skills that they need to make the most of formal education and their personal development.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="080610107000201"></a>A lot of these young people will move into jobs in service industries such as catering and retail, where perhaps the most useful skills are simple ones but ones that they simply have not been taught: the importance of time-keeping, personal presentation, being pleasant and looking at people when you speak to them. These things might seem minor to us but they can do so much to improve the attitudes and prospects of young people in that kind of workplace, or indeed in any kind of workplace.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="080610107000202"></a>Much of what the Government are trying to achieve would be unnecessary if only standards in our schools were better, as the Minister acknowledged. The Government announced today that they have given local authorities 50 days to come up with a plan of action for their worst-performing secondary schools, although I am slightly at a loss as to why the possibility of their becoming academies is seen as a threat. Nevertheless, it begs the question: why 50 days when the Government have had 11 years?</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="080610107000203"></a>It is what happens before the age of 16 that will have the most impact. Our children should get the best start that they can. We simply must not tolerate a situation where four out of 10 children cannot master the basics. Without the ability to read and write, and without a grasp of numeracy, all the exciting and wonderful things that education has to offer are lost. We should not be surprised when children become disengaged and disruptive. Tackling underachievement early must be a priority before it has a chance to have a knock-on effect and handicap a child&#146;s future.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="080610107000204"></a>We also need a proper route to vocational training through diplomas and modern apprenticeships, but  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_498"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 498</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that must mean suitable, hands-on experience, not someone just sitting behind a desk ticking boxes. Vocational qualifications must be rigorous and they must be valued by our young people, which means that they must be valued by employers. We will ask the Government to show that they have properly thought through the practicalities, logistics, funding and organisation required to provide flexible, meaningful and desirable training courses for all these young people. That includes proper support for young people with learning difficulties across the spectrum to help them to overcome the barriers to employment. We must also be mindful of the distressingly high number of young people who suffer from mental health problems. Unless we ensure that we make adequate provision for them, they will continue to fall through the cracks of the new system, as they have done in the old.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="080610107000205"></a>In addition, we should have better advice available for young people so that they know their options for the future and can make informed choices. Career guidance needs to start earlier and should be geared specifically to providing detailed information on the skills requirement of particular occupations. In two-thirds of schools in England, careers advice is co-ordinated or delivered by staff without any formal qualifications in this field. Moreover, wearing my shadow Minister for Women&#146;s hat, I believe that careers advice should robustly challenge gender stereotypes. According to excellent research by the YWCA, the five lowest-earning apprenticeships are dominated by women, while&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;the top-earning apprenticeship is almost 100 per cent male. This is so important because women in poverty find it much harder to pull themselves out of it and a woman in poverty at the age of 16 is twice as likely as a man to be trapped in poverty at the age of 30.</p>

<a name="80610-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="080610107000206"></a>Part 3 deals with improving adult skills, an aim that no one could criticise. Demographic change means that it is becoming increasingly important that we improve the skills of our existing workforce. We welcome moves to a more comprehensive, single careers service, but we fear that the Government are in danger of repeating the mistakes that they made in the establishment of Connexions. It would be a great pity if the objective of universal and impartial careers advice were overshadowed by the urgency of targeted programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="080610107000207"></a>The Conservative Party believes that lifelong learning and acquiring new qualifications&#151;either to help with better employment prospects or for general well-being&#151;are worthy goals, which is why we have deep concerns about the Government&#146;s policies on equivalent-level qualifications. The University of Bolton&#151;an institute close to my heart&#151;has 9,000 students, half of whom are mature students and many of whom are working and studying for their degrees on a part-time basis. The Government&#146;s actions will cost Bolton &#163;1.5 million next year, but the university is so committed to those students that it will bear the cost, which will not be easy. Universities all around the country will be facing the same problem.</p>

If there was ever a case of &#147;if it ain&#146;t broke, don&#146;t fix it&#148;, this surely is it. Our independent schools are recognised by the OECD as the best schools in the world. I have been enormously encouraged by the efforts of the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, to encourage understanding between the state and independent sectors, to foster excellent working relationships and to share best practice. Independent schools have a good working relationship with the DCSF but are upset and worried that it will be ruined by these changes.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="080610107000209"></a>I should have thought that the Government would welcome and encourage a good rapport between one of their departments and a sector for which it has responsibility. Perhaps Ministers are so unsettled by such an unusual occurrence that they were not thinking entirely logically. It is such a shame that, at a time when barriers, real or perceived, are being broken down between the independent and other sectors, the Government would jeopardise that by injecting confusion and difficulty into the situation. The Government tell us that they consulted on the issue, but the Bill was written and published before the consultation was complete. This is a reform&#151;I use that word loosely&#151;that the independent sector did not want, that Ofsted did not ask for and that will place the Secretary of State further away from what was and should continue to be a good working system. We will seek to have this part removed from the Bill.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="080610107000210"></a>I also hope that the proposed changes to Section 347 schools, of which there are only 75 in the country, will be considered carefully so that we do not end up with a fearfully bureaucratic scheme where none is necessary and serves only to hamper the excellent work that the schools do. Two other areas that we will want to explore further are the changes to the admissions code that were added so late that there was little time for debate in the other place and&#151;I am sure that this will come as no surprise to the Minister&#151;the protection of personal and sensitive information, on which we will be seeking reassurance.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="080610107000211"></a>In conclusion, I quote the words of the educational charity Edge:</p>

My noble friend Lady Perry of Southwark, who I am glad to see is in her place, unfortunately has had to withdraw because she cannot stay for the closing speeches, but she will be taking part in the further stages. Throughout the Bill, we need to think about imaginative and positive schemes. Over the past few weeks, I have been heartened after speaking to some of the truly remarkable organisations that we are so lucky to have in this country, such as the Prince&#146;s Trust, Edge, Barnardo&#146;s, Rainer, the YWCA and countless other voluntary bodies that do so much excellent work in helping our young people to realise their potential. I place on the record my thanks to them and to all the other organisations that have taken so much time and trouble to brief us. There is so much opportunity for noble Lords on all sides of the House in this Bill. We have the chance to make a real difference

We on these Benches are at one with him in his intention to ensure that as many young people as possible participate in learning, at least until they are 18. All the statistics show that the qualifications one obtains by the age of 18 are a good predictor of future life chances and income prospects. However, the Minister will not be surprised to learn that we take issue with him on some of the ways in which the Government propose to achieve this desirable outcome. To be 24th out of the OECD list of 29 countries for staying on in education or training is a terrible indictment after 11 years of a Government who try hard but often choose the wrong systems in order to achieve their outcomes. We are also in serious doubt about whether some parts of the Bill are necessary at all. Despite the consensus about the desirability of the outcomes, this has already been a very contentious Bill in another place.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="080610107000214"></a>I turn first to Part 1, which addresses the duties on young people, their parents, LEAs, education institutions and employers, in relation to participation up to 18 and the framework of penalties proposed. When looking at measures proposed by the Government, I usually ask myself five questions. Is the outcome desirable? Are the means proposed right and proper? Are they the most appropriate means for achieving the end? Have the Government assigned the necessary resources? Is the timescale appropriate?</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="080610107000215"></a>The first question is easy: of course the outcome is desirable. All the indicators show that, so there is no need to dwell on it. As to resources, only time will tell. Are the means right and proper? Well, some of them are and some of them are not. The proposals to widen the range of educational and training opportunities and support arrangements are much needed. Many young people who leave education at 16 do so because they have already become disengaged from school; turned off by the curriculum and perhaps by the style of teaching; demoralised by failure; possibly even bullied. Some of them with special educational needs or physical or mental disabilities find the world of school so difficult to cope with that they are only too glad to leave at 16. Some of them have already voted with their feet and failed to attend for years.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="080610107000216"></a>We all have great hopes for the new national diplomas, although some of us have considerable reservations, in particular about whether they contain relevant practical experience. We welcome proposals to increase the number of apprenticeships and of pre-apprenticeship courses that will make them accessible to a wider range of young people. However, we are unhappy about the compulsion element in the Bill and the penalties for those who refuse to participate. Enforcement may be a last resort, but so, we are told, is imprisoning children. We have 3,000 children in custody at the moment, so pardon my scepticism about that.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_501"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 501</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="080610107000217"></a>On the question of a timescale, the Bill puts the cart before the horse. There is a strange tension in it. On the one hand, the Government introduce an entitlement for every young person to study a diploma or take an apprenticeship by 2013. They also introduce two adult entitlements, which Liberal Democrats have long supported: a lifelong entitlement to free level 2 and basic skills tuition, and a similar entitlement to level 3 tuition up to the age of 25. Hurrah for all that. However, they spoil it by saying that in the same year that these entitlements come into force, young people must participate up to 17; and, two years later, up to 18. This timing is inappropriate and I shall table amendments to put these things in the correct order. We should try entitlement and support first before we resort to compulsion.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="080610107000218"></a>I also question whether we are on track to have the quantity and diversity of provision in place by then. I will table an amendment to ensure that this is audited before the implementation of compulsion. I believe that compulsion is inappropriate and possibly self-defeating, and I will seek to overturn it. At a time when the Government are considering giving young people of 16 the right to vote, it is wrong to force them to spend their lives in a certain way. They can go to work and pay taxes, get married and have children, join the Army and possibly vote; and the Government believe they have a right to tell them what to do. No, I do not believe that governments have that right. Staying on after 16 should be an entitlement, not a legally enforceable duty.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="080610107000219"></a>We should help and encourage young people, so let us look at those who are most likely to resist the duty to participate up to 18 and see whether the Bill contains enough support for them as the system will work only if it adequately identifies and addresses the reasons for their exclusion. They are the disengaged ones, and the ones with physical and mental disabilities and special needs. There is often an overlap here, because their special needs were not addressed earlier. The reasons for disengagement are complex and will not be solved by compulsion. If you look at the options available in Clause 2, you will find the clause lacking. The main focus should be to ensure that there is flexible, varied and high-quality provision for all young people, whatever their circumstances. I will table an amendment to add to the list in Clause 2 a package of learning and support tailored to the needs of those who find it most difficult, which will widen the limited range of learning experiences to include more informal and community-based options. This should help the most vulnerable young people&#151;teenage mothers, young carers, those with health or addiction problems, Traveller communities, young people in custody and others with special needs.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="080610107000220"></a>It is a pity that the Government are spoiling what could be a good Bill by trying to insist on the penalties and I shall seek to change their minds. The Joint Committee on Human Rights also expressed its concern that,</p>
<ul><a name="080610107000363"></a>&#147;relying on criminal coercion for ... enforcement is potentially disproportionate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080610107000340"></a>I will table an amendment to give an LEA a duty to assess the young person&#146;s specific barriers to participation and provide a tailored package of support and appropriate learning experiences before it can embark on the

It is just not good enough to accept caring responsibilities or a young baby as a &#147;reasonable excuse&#148; for not participating and let the person opt out. That could just be a let-out for the LEA from providing the help and support that would allow these young people to take up their entitlement to education beyond 16.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="080610107000221"></a>Despite the Government's assurances about criminal records, I am still concerned about the duty in the Bill to disclose the offences and the effect it might have on a young person's future prospects. I am also concerned about all the data protection issues in the exchange of information. As for fixed-penalty fines, there should be a much lower cap than has been discussed in another place. Of course, I welcome the expansion of the EMA to a wider range of courses, but the rate has not increased since 2004. A fine of up to &#163;200 for someone whose only income is EMA is completely disproportionate. It will, of course, fall on the parents, who probably have not got much money anyway.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="080610107000222"></a>There are particular concerns among those who work with young people with special needs about the arrangements for good quality and timely assessment. We would like to see this done for all those with special needs, not just those with statements, especially given the wide range of attitudes of different authorities to statementing and the general move away from reliance on it anyway.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="080610107000223"></a>I have concentrated on Part 1 of the Bill as my noble friends on these Benches will deal in more detail with Parts 2 and 3. However, careers guidance is a vital part of the jigsaw. Since this function was handed over to Connexions, careers guidance in schools has almost disappeared and will need to be completely recreated. Although there is much good quality careers advice on the internet, young people will need knowledgeable guidance to find their way through it before they make their GCSE choices. That will require a great deal of training in the teaching force, and this is one of many places where we are not yet ready to implement these changes and will probably not be for five years. It is vital that the opportunity is taken, with a major shake-up of careers advice, to address the gender, race and other stereotypes on the labour market, and ensure that all young people have all options available to them. In my convent school, if you were any good, the nuns would suggest that you become a teacher; I did. However, that was the extent of their ambition for us. Things are quite different now, but we have a long way to go to achieve wage equality between men and women and between the various races that make up our population.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="080610107000224"></a>On Part 4, I echo the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton. I, too, believe in the old adage, &#147;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&#148;, which applies in this case. Whatever you think of independent schools, there is no good reason for changing the registration and regulation arrangements for them. Transferring them to Ofsted is unjustified and unnecessary, and the consultation was sadly lacking. No one has called for it. There has been no major issue about quality or inspection needing to be addressed. If the system needs streamlining, there are other ways of doing it that do not upset a system that is working well. I, too, will be seeking to delete this part from the Bill.</p>

At a time when we are desperate for more expert and high quality provision for such young people, it seems to me nonsense to dilute their expertise and specialism. For what purpose? Is it in order to save money? I challenge the Minister adequately to justify these measures and, if she cannot, I will seek to delete them from the Bill.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="080610107000226"></a>In Part 5, I welcome the tightening up of the admissions system&#151;which we will of course scrutinise in detail&#151;and thank the Bill team for their assurance in an e-mail this morning that all this will apply to all academies. However, I have concerns about Clause 138 on the powers schools will be given to allocate alternative provision. I am concerned that this may have a disproportionate impact on groups already over-represented in school exclusions. I ask the Minister for an assurance that there will be a thorough equality impact assessment of this measure as soon as possible. Some PRUs do an excellent job although the quality is patchy across the country. I am again grateful to the Bill team for their assurance that the place of good PRUs in post-16 provision will be seriously considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="080610107000227"></a>I will be taking the opportunity to fill in gaps in legislation and to table amendments on the voice of the child, statutory PSHE and on the gap in promoting well-being in FE colleges. I have raised all these issues before and I will do so again.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="080610107000228"></a>Finally, I should like to say a word about Wales. I understand that the Minister may bring forward a single framework clause to allow Wales to make up its own mind about these issues. He will be aware that the nearer we on these Benches can get to letting the Welsh people make their own decisions, the happier we will be. Much progress has been made on Welsh education since devolution and matters relating to 14 to 19 year-olds are in hand. We should like to ensure that there are no barriers here. Having said all that, I assure the Minister that we shall adopt our usual level of constructive engagement as we take forward our detailed debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="080610107000230"></a>The good news for the Minister is that I welcome the extension of educational opportunity and aspiration. That is the clear intention of the Bill, for which it must be praised. Its direction of travel is one that we all believe in, as has been said more than once. The more sombre news is that some have said in my hearing that, if the pre-16 system were adequate and performing as it should be, the Bill would not be necessary and that, if it is not adequate and is not performing as it should be&#151;many of us see the difficulties in that regard&#151;the

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="080610107000231"></a>I take heart from the Minister&#146;s points about the various developments, not least as regards diplomas, which seek to change pre-16 and post-16 education. However, the critical question is whether the Bill comprises a new start for 16 year-olds or whether its provisions can be built into the existing system. The proposed improvements add to the strength of the Bill and the possibilities that it lays out will be an incentive to improve the existing system. I hope that at later stages I shall be able to return to questions that I cannot deal with now, such as inspection, which has been mentioned, and adult education, where the Bill is too timid. There are great possibilities in that area, which we ought to address&#151;if not in this Bill, on a future occasion.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="080610107000232"></a>The Bill embodies a new form of encouragement but also a new principle of compulsion in post-16 education. This will be a major issue in our debates. It is not quite as significant as the raising of the school leaving age that was introduced 30-odd years ago, but it none the less constitutes a significant compulsory extension. My mind is open on compulsion, as I accept that some may not respond to encouragement in this area. If a large number do not respond to encouragement and that number grows beyond what can reasonably be predicted, the question arises of what is to be done with and for them. I shall come back to that complex point, on which I have reservations.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="080610107000233"></a>The Bill takes the right direction but the fundamental question is whether it will work. Is it a practical solution to a specific problem and a clear answer to a clear question? It proposes a single solution for two rather different problems and two rather different questions&#151;that is both a strength and a weakness&#151;which may be overoptimistic. I realise that these days Ministers have to be optimistic&#151;I accept that that is part of the trade&#151;but I do not always share the optimism. I shall return to that in a moment.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="080610107000234"></a>The two issues, problems or questions that the Bill tries to deal with, are, first, the need to develop further our national skills base, for all the reasons that the Minister properly laid out, and, secondly&#151;this is the emphasis in the Bill&#146;s detail&#151;the need to provide further opportunity for a wide group of young people. The dangers lie in the width of the group of young people. It will include young people who have done well in the pre-16 system and who will enjoy and benefit from the opportunities that will be provided if the Bill goes through. However, as has been said, many have drifted out of education. How in a realistic and practical way does one target those who have joined the ranks of the NEETs&#151;those not in employment, education or training?</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="080610107000235"></a>The proposed legislation is based on the assumption that a solution to the real range of problems encompassed in the second question&#151;the needs of young people&#151;might well be met in a way that simultaneously deals with the issues in the first question, enhancing the national skills base. That may be overoptimistic and may have led to some of the details being generalised rather than being made more particular. In other words, it suggests that there is a demand and that we have a potential source of supply.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="080610107000236"></a>There will be a series of questions that I hope I can be reassured about during our debates. My first question is whether legislation is the solution to all the problems, especially to the second group, when what is certainly needed is a change of culture&#151;with a small &#147;c&#148;&#151;in the widest possible sense. We need a change in aspiration&#151;the Government and the other parties have paid due attention to this&#151;among our young people and a change in the culture of the playground, so that particularly boys are not put off further education and further study. These will be the difficult cases.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="080610107000237"></a>A change of culture is required. Legislation can help that, but it cannot guarantee it. It can, however, hinder it. I will raise that point in a few moments. Parliament and legislation alone will not win the battle. There are other players: the schools and colleges, the employers, the local authorities, the young people in question and their parents. All have a significant part to play if the aspirations of the Bill, which I think we all share, are to be met.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="080610107000238"></a>I am enthused by the vision, but the range of players leads me to want to examine in greater detail, as I am sure we will in our deliberations on the Bill, how those who have an important part to play can be encouraged and supported. The colleges are primed. They are enthusiastic and ready to go. They properly see opportunity in this. That is marvellous, because they have a role to play that is not sufficiently well developed in our education system.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="080610107000239"></a>In many cases, the need for the Bill, as I suggested, arises from the failure of the early school system in basic literacy and numeracy. Will the provision include what we might otherwise call remedial education in the basics of literacy and numeracy? If these skills are not there very early in the process, the process will not carry through to successful conclusion.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="080610107000240"></a>The employers&#146; record is not always good. The Minister has given us some encouraging statistics, but I have recently seen some others about the building and construction industry, which one would hope might be an important player among the group of employers, that are not encouraging. The number of apprenticeships being created is certainly not near the target for that group. The worries that the industry has, which the CBI has flagged up, include the possibility that there could be unintended consequences&#151;for example, 16 and 17 year-olds, who might have a job at the moment, not being offered jobs for fear of the bureaucracy and regulation that will descend particularly on smaller employers. The consequence of fewer jobs for 16 and 17 year-olds cannot be a good outcome.</p>

<a name="80610-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="080610107000241"></a>What help will be given to the local authorities? Again, we have had some outline of this, but how far were they consulted on the onerous and complex responsibilities that will be given to them? What was their response? On policy&#151;this matter will fall under the purview of local authorities&#151;at what point will avoidance become a criminal offence? This is a key question. I read what is in the Bill but when in the process will this occur?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="080610107000242"></a>Worries have been expressed about the legislation being overenthusiastically interpreted in the years to come. There is a clear risk of that. Is there not a better way? That is the question being asked. I have not ruled  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_506"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 506</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out compulsion in the extremes, but one reassurance is the possibility that young people might work off any criminal record. With a future of successful employment in their early 20s, within a period the offence might be annulled from the record. That would make me rather less concerned than I am about the possibility of young people being given criminal records for something that I confess I did when I was 15 to see Australia playing cricket: missing classes and school. I dare say that I did not reach the criminal offence stages, but it is a worrying prospect that that habit could lead to a criminal record, given the impact of that on the rest of the lives of these young people. My other question on this is whether, if this is a criminal offence, DNA samples will be taken from these young people. If so, will those samples be kept on record? That is a serious question. Both these points could be dealt with within current legislation if there were a way of, in due course, working out one&#146;s term and having the record annulled. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on that.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="080610107000243"></a>Some parents will rise to the opportunity and some are already semi-detached from these young adults, who in some cases will be parents themselves. How is the term &#147;parent&#148; defined? If I were in a local authority I would want to ask this question forcefully. Is it the two adults who happen to live in the same house as you? Is the father the individual whose name is now by regulation put on the birth certificate? Who are the parents? This a real question. If one wants the details, one can talk to any head teacher or teacher in a school working in a difficult area. They will tell you in some detail that identifying parents and getting a decent discussion going with them is possibly the most difficult thing that they have to do. However, the Bill has one solution, which is that in the end they might be legally responsible.</p>

I am glad to be able to continue the debates that we began last year, during passage of the Further Education and Training Bill in this House, on the well-being of young people aged 16 to 18, particularly those in FE colleges or on skills or vocational courses. I know that over the past few months Ministers have discussed some of these matters with my noble friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth, who is unfortunately prevented from being present to speak on this topic today because of an unbreakable engagement. As noble Lords will be aware, this is a topic on which he has spoken with characteristic panache and what I can only describe as a form of Scottish and Danish eloquence that is unique.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="080610107000246"></a>First, I say again, in common with many Members of this House, how much I welcome the Government&#146;s commitment in the Bill to make available to all young people up to the age of 18 the entitlement to programmes of education and training, whether in schools or colleges, in training schemes or in employment. We recognise  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_507"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 507</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Government&#146;s emphasis on the economic necessities that underpin much of the legislation and the potential wider benefits to society. The comprehensive and penetrating report on skills by the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, has alerted us to the skills gap between employees in many sectors in this country and those in many of our European partner countries. We are delighted to support the measures, which will enable the development of an extensive range of skills programmes for adults as well as young people.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="080610107000247"></a>Perhaps most importantly, we have also emphasised from these Benches throughout these debates the importance of a broad and deep education for all; a good foundation not only in skills but in that knowledge and those human qualities that make for a whole person who is then able to contribute their very best to society. As is set out in the Education Reform Act 1988, which I know applies only to 16 to 18 year-olds in schools, that necessarily involves &#147;spiritual, moral, cultural ... development&#148; to prepare young people for,</p>
<ul><a name="080610107000364"></a>&#147;the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of adult life&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80610-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="080610107000248"></a>I underline and repeat that it is to prepare them for adult life. The young people at whom the Bill is addressed are not necessarily full adults, but nor are they children. In the discussions that have been held over the past year, Ministers have expressed the view that 16 to 18 year-olds deserve to be treated more as adults and to have more of the freedoms that are accorded to university students of 18 plus. There is to be much said for that view, at least in the way that young people in colleges, and indeed in many schools, are able to plan their learning and are not confined all day in school or college buildings. I wish a few of them would cease meeting outside my front door, but that is another matter.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="080610107000249"></a>We welcome the emphasis on listening to the learner&#146;s voice. FE students are learning the responsibilities and duties of adult life&#151;to attend when they are required to on different sites and on employers&#146; premises. We also need to recognise that this is a learning process requiring support and guidance, as young people develop the values, beliefs and attitudes that will determine their future as husbands or wives, as employees and employers and as responsible members of society. We also need to recognise, as I am sure we do, that some of these young people are at an age when they are most vulnerable to pressures whether of drugs, excessive drinking, sexual exploitation, or of different forms of violence such as gang affiliations and gun and knife crime of which we have, tragically, had too many examples over the past few months.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="080610107000250"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that the United Nations report on youth placed Britain at the bottom of a list of 21 OECD countries in terms of young people&#146;s well-being. That report shows something of which many of us are aware&#151;that all is not well with some of our young people. What I propose is simple: all young people, not just those who are gifted or lucky enough to be pursuing A-level studies in schools, should be entitled to provision for their moral and spiritual development and should be faced with those moral and spiritual challenges that go with adult life. Human flourishing is not solely dependent on the acquisition of skills.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_508"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="080610107000251"></a>We welcome wholeheartedly the initiatives that the Government have taken to support the provision for the development of moral and spiritual development in this sector. A report last year entitled <I>Making Space for Faith</I> demonstrated enthusiasm among FE students for exploring issues of values, belief and faith. The LSC handbooks on multi-faith chaplaincy have been enormously helpful to colleges, as has the current DIUS initiative &#147;All Faiths and None&#148; which explicitly addresses the big questions of meaning and purpose in life. We commend the excellent work already going on in many colleges encouraged by chaplaincies and the National Council for Faiths and Beliefs in Further Education. I could name examples of excellent practice in colleges in my own diocese where there have been some imaginative and innovative programmes to engage with different faiths and encourage greater social cohesion. I am also aware of colleges where the post-16 citizenship initiative enables young people to explore social and political issues and explore voluntary activities in the community.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="080610107000252"></a>I draw the House&#146;s attention to the fact that only half of FE colleges have chaplaincies while other colleges that argue that they are not funded to provide for students&#146; spiritual and moral development and yet others that insist that these issues are purely a private matter. But they are not a private matter; they affect public life at every level of society. In further education where a higher proportion of students are from black and ethnic minorities and from white working class estates where gang culture can be prevalent, these young people deserve above all an education that,</p>
<ul><a name="080610107000365"></a>&#147;prepares them for all the responsibilities and experiences of adult life&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80610-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="080610107000253"></a>I add a tiny post-script. I wish that the word &#147;vocational&#148; was used not only about education in the FE sector but that it could be used in all sectors in education, in the independent sector and in schools. The very word &#147;vocation&#148; contains within it spiritual and moral values which should be at the heart of all learning in schools, FE colleges, HE institutions and so on.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="080610107000254"></a>While I welcome these initiatives, they seem to me to fall some way short of the underpinning which a statutory entitlement would give. Last week my noble friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth discussed with officials from the DIUS a new non-statutory framework for the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of young people. I should be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s view on this important suggestion which I believe could be of great benefit to the many colleges that struggle to identify how these deep and important issues can be addressed within vocational curricula. I remain convinced that a legal entitlement is the best way to ensure that all young people have opportunities to be prepared for the responsibilities and challenges they will face in their adult lives.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="080610107000255"></a>There is no doubt that the Bill is a major step forward for this country in providing an equal entitlement to education and training for all young people up to the age of 18. But is it right that in this one particular segment of education which should cover citizenship as well as spiritual and moral issues, the 43 per cent of

It will not surprise your Lordships&#146; to know that we in the church believe that these spiritual, moral, social and cultural values are among the most important elements of anyone&#146;s education. We should like to ask the Minister to think again and to find a way, if possible, by which an amendment to the Bill could be included to correct the anomaly and to give that entitlement to all young people for their own personal good and the well-being of the whole of society.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="080610107000257"></a>The Bill continues to push against the ceiling on expectations, about which we can never be complacent. We know what we want from our schooling&#151;we have talked about this many times in this House. We want every school to be a good school and every student to be able to fulfil their potential. We want no child to be written off at any stage of their schooling and, particularly, we need to focus on the transition points at 11 and 16. To deliver an education system that truly delivers for 100 per cent of pupils is a major undertaking and requires sustained commitment. A huge shift in expectations is still needed.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="080610107000258"></a>We should remember that, a generation ago, the top one-fifth or so of school leavers gained good school-leaving qualifications and that less than one in 10 went into higher education. The other four-fifths left school with only a basic education and few qualifications, and the bottom 10 per cent lacked even basic competence in literacy and numeracy.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="080610107000259"></a>We have moved a long way from that, and quite quickly, but no one who believes that education is the key to equality of opportunity can feel that we have yet gone far enough. Some of the proposed changes that we are talking about today are controversial, but education reform is never easy and is not necessarily popular at the time.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="080610107000260"></a>I looked back over comments on recent reforms and found that literacy and numeracy hours were ridiculed as some sort of Stalinist measure that would knock inspiration out of teaching. The tune changed when the levels of achievement went up. We were warned that city academies would extend provision for the privileged few but they have instead started to deliver improvements in results that are well above the average in the most disadvantaged communities whose children were written off for too long. Of course, tuition fees were savaged by commentators and opposition parties and, I admit, by more than a few in my own party who thought that it was fine to continue a system that limited the number who could go to university to those who always had gone and who were subsidised by those who never had a chance to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="080610107000261"></a>It is always tempting to sit still and consolidate and it is understandable why many in education with the best of motives say that enough is enough. Reforms are always difficult to implement for those at the sharp end.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="080610107000262"></a>We have a great deal to celebrate and build on today. Let us look at the 2007 results achieved in our schools. We now have 80 per cent achieving key stage 2 at level 4 and above; that is up 17 per cent since 1997&#151;the figures are 77 per cent in maths and 88 per cent in science, up respectively 15 per cent and 19 per cent. With key stage 3 in English, 74 per cent get to level 5 and above; that is up 17 points since 1997. In science, the figure is 73 per cent, which is up one point; 76 per cent get maths, which is up 16 points since 1997. Big, big improvements have already been made. Sixty per cent now get five or more good GCSEs, with 47 per cent getting maths and English as part of that.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="080610107000263"></a>Today's announcement on failing schools&#151;in which less than 30 per cent of pupils get five GCSEs&#151;is welcome. Although I know that that will be controversial in some quarters, I confess that in time I hope we can go further. It is right that we are rigorous in our efforts to turn round these schools in as short a time as possible. Those who say that it needs longer must recognise that generations of pupils are failed in this way. Personally, I confess that I am also concerned about that group of somewhat coasting schools in the middle&#151;the ones that get along quite happily but whose value-added scores tell the real story: that those pupils, too, are not being challenged sufficiently to reach their full potential.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="080610107000264"></a>While pupils living in the top quartile of affluent areas have a more than 70 per cent chance of gaining at least five good GCSEs, those in the bottom quartile still have only a 30 per cent chance; we cannot afford to sit still. Of course, we know that it can be done. Most of us here today have visited many schools that are bucking the trend. Much of our focus has been on secondary schools and beyond, but we also need to be increasingly concerned about primary schools and keeping up the pressure there, as well as on the transition from primary to secondary schools.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="080610107000265"></a>Too many children are still behind grade at 11, and stand still or worse in year 7. Literacy is the tool that opens up education, and without it we see underachievement, disillusionment, poor behaviour and wasted future lives. I strongly welcome the additional resources being put into individual literacy schemes by the Government. I have seen the evidence, on paper and in person, in various primary schools around the country. Last year I visited Maryland primary school in Newham, which had increased its skill level in two years from 59 per cent to 87 per cent of children achieving key stage 2 at level 4 or above. It was running the Read Write phonics scheme. Similar schemes are being run by different LEAs around the country, but Maryland had an amazing scheme. Every adult was involved, from dinner ladies to lollipop ladies, from every teaching assistant to the head teacher. The whole school was divided into very  small groups doing intensive literacy support, with amazing results.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_511"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 511</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="080610107000266"></a>There are other schemes with equally great results. For example, Wigan is producing phenomenal results with normal funding as well. So there is a lot to look at and learn. I urge renewed energy on literacy or there is a real danger that we will stand still and make later opportunities so much more difficult to access.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="080610107000267"></a>I turn to another area of concern, which is the transition from school at 11. It is little wonder that many pupils never recover from this change as it is traumatic for too many. Recently I have seen three interesting actions to try to improve that transition . The first is nurture classes&#151;intense classes in year 7 in primary schools in an attempt to bring pupils up to standard within year 7. It is obvious stuff, but it is not done enough. It is very intensive and focuses on very few teachers and a smaller curriculum. But by the end of year 7 there is an amazing transition and those children are ready to access fully the national curriculum.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="080610107000268"></a>The second experiment worth looking at are all-age schools, which can ease or virtually eliminate the transition from primary to secondary, which is particularly important in disadvantaged communities. I advise a charity, Ark, which has two such schools under way that will offer education from three to 18. We should follow this important experiment with interest.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="080610107000269"></a>The third approach refers to small schools focused on year 7, so that within secondary schools there is a school that is almost separate, where pupils can be separated at play and lunch times and the focus is much more on developing ethos, belonging to the school and setting clear expectations of behaviour and achievement. When those pupils go into year 8, they are ready to learn in greater depth.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="080610107000270"></a>There is so much that we all agree on in this and previous Bills on education, but I know that the big controversy will be the change in the leaving age for education and training to 18. I confess that if the change were to be brought in immediately I would oppose it. The curriculum would not be ready; the apprenticeships and training opportunities would not be there in sufficient numbers; and the organisation would not be ready. But this change will happen in stages between now and 2015. Above all, this change must build on continuous improvements through the school system from five to 16.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="080610107000271"></a>We know that the enlarged numbers entering higher education have not yet truly widened opportunities for the most disadvantaged pupils whose numbers at university have barely changed. Young people who leave education and training at 16 are disproportionately from poor families. Less than half of those with no qualifications are in work compared with nearly 90 per cent of those with graduate level qualifications. Raising the education participation age in stages from 2013 to 2015 is about social justice, provided of course that the right building blocks are in place to make a success of it. The onus will be not only on government, but on employers, who want skilled workers, and on schools to ensure that the building blocks are in place well in advance of those stage dates.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="080610107000272"></a>Some will argue that this is in some way illiberal. I do not understand the arbitrary nature of that argument. If it is illiberal to educate to 18 it must have been

It would be great if the change to 18 could happen without legislation&#151;in many ways, all of us would like that&#151;but it has not happened and there is no reason to presume that it will. The UK needs to realise the potential of all its children, and I believe that this measure can help us to do that. It is the obvious next stage of the UK&#146;s long history of increasing participation in education.</p>

In particular, he tells us that for the first time in over 30 years, we are changing the education leaving age. He looks to history, as an historian would, and calls to mind that in 1918 HAL Fisher considered keeping children in full or part-time education until 18. That was never implemented, not only because of post-war austerity but because even then there were strong differences of opinion about the best method of vocational education: work apprenticeships, school training or a mixture of the two.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="080610107000274"></a>The Bill and future decisions will have to resolve those problems, which Fisher failed to do in 1918. They must resolve them if the extension of the leaving age is to work. The Minister knows as well as I do that problems related to vocational training have bedevilled English education for more than a century. If we are to resolve those difficulties, we must first establish, absolutely and completely, dedicated technical colleges devoted to serving respected&#151;I underline that word&#151;vocational qualifications. I have bored this House too often on this, but those colleges should be modelled on those that exist on the continent, particularly in Germany and Holland.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="080610107000275"></a>We must not be under any illusion&#151;this should govern all our discussions&#151;that this will be an easy task. Such colleges will be expensive. Technical vocational education is very expensive. In my last years as headmaster of St Paul&#146;s, we offered a technical qualification, even though it was an academic school, and it cost more than pure science. We are talking about large amounts of money. For that reason, state support will be needed. It is not enough for my party to talk about industry or parents doing it because we are talking about large sums of money.</p>

<a name="80610-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="080610107000276"></a>If we establish these colleges, it will be crucial to appoint staff who have the confidence of industry and, possibly more important, of the pupils. I stress that it will be necessary for the department to avoid temporary solutions to the difficulties&#151;which departments and Governments are prone to&#151;by bussing pupils to a variety of schools over a wide area in order to offer a range of courses. As an ex-headmaster, I assure the Minister that that will not work. It would be time-consuming, difficult to administer and, knowing pupils of that age, a lot of them will be lost in the passage. If not run properly, or at all, it could bring the project into disrepute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="080610107000277"></a>Further&#151;and this has eluded us for a long time&#151;we must define precisely the object and nature of vocational education so that it gains massive respect, such as it enjoys on the continent, from society, industry and,  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_513"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 513</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more importantly, the pupils themselves. At this point, I must pay respect to the work of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and my noble friend Lord Baker in providing pilot schemes for vocational colleges in Birmingham and the West Midlands. I must also add my respects to the Minister himself, who has given enormous support to these schemes. Therein lies the hope for applying them to the whole country.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="080610107000278"></a>I turn to the vocational diplomas, another pillar of this project, and here I enter areas of controversy&#151;as is the nature of my life. I maintain, and I hope that the Minister can find a certain agreement here, that the prestige of these new diplomas will be weakened if they are designed so as to satisfy not only the needs of vocational learning but those of traditional courses based on book learning and the traditional university processes. It has proved very difficult to have one diploma satisfying two masters: that has failed on a number of occasions. Of course, this business of trying to combine diplomas that satisfy vocational education and traditional university courses is not followed anywhere in Europe, which is where these vocational diplomas enjoy substantial prestige.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="080610107000279"></a>This landmark legislation&#151;and I agree with the Minister that that is what it is&#151;will fail unless we get the issues of the colleges and diplomas right. Making education part or full-time to the age of 18 is a risky business. It is crucial to provide a structure that works well&#151;that is important, and I support the Bill to that extent. If we fail in that, the ramifications will go on for many decades. Let me assure your Lordships that pupils aged 16 to 18 are not the easiest; I taught them for 30 years of my life, and they included quite a number of Members of this House. If they are being bussed from place to place, they can also be rather elusive. If we do not provide the right patterns for these diplomas and colleges, the young people will not accept them. At 16, they are old enough not to accept that. They will vote with their feet and the whole edifice will fall to the ground.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="080610107000280"></a>Having said all of that, I am jolly glad that I am not a Minister. I am too old to even think of it, but I congratulate the Minister on this bold step and hope that he succeeds where that great Liberal historian, HAL Fisher, did not even dare to go. I hope that he avoids the fate of HAL Fisher, who lost office two years afterwards&#151;I am sure that he will.</p>

Those Back-Bench speakers who preceded me have also set the rest of us a standard in coming forward with ideas. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, had a crafty idea to deal with and expiate the problem of criminality. The noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, has just spoken on the technical college proposal. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans introduced the moral and social dimension of education. The noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Huyton, introduced something which, for a moment, seemed not concerned with the Bill but is relevant to its purposes: how to better the transition from primary to secondary. I regard that as utterly fundamental.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_514"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="080610107000282"></a>In welcoming the Bill and its purposes my concerns will be over how it responds to a fundamental need to invest in the intellectual and skills capital of our people and how it addresses a moral and social issue of great weight: how to engage those who have not been successful in education and who feel to an extent rejected by society. They in turn reject society, with sad consequences for their lives and for the quality of our civilisation.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="080610107000283"></a>I have four issues to raise, the first of which is the imperative to raise the standards in skills and education. The second is the motivation to do that. Thirdly, related to motivation is creating a perception in the minds of employers and students that what is on offer to them is relevant to them and of high quality. Finally, we must be careful to ensure that in perfect administration we do not create so much red tape that we cause people to back out of our good intentions.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="080610107000284"></a>I start with the economic imperative. References have been made to the report by the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, and his finding that we need to lift the proportion with a level 4 qualification to 40 per cent by 2020, compared with 29 per cent at the time of his report. It is a big increase. I have said before, and I say again, that talking of at least 40 per cent can be misleading, because the Germans and the Americans are there already. We are talking about where we will be in 2020. In other words, in 2020 we will be as far behind as we are now.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="080610107000285"></a>On how far behind we are now and the prospect that the Germans will advance, our Select Committee on Economic Affairs, in its report on apprenticeships, told us that, by their early 30s, 78 per cent of Germans are at level 3, compared with our 42 per cent&#151;a gap of more than 30 percentage points at the moment. If you dip down, there is still a big gap at level 2. It is not only the Germans who are 20-odd percentage points above us, the French are too. So they are at a higher level to move up beyond their high levels in excess of ours already. That is a tremendous challenge and there is an imperative need to make a success of what is intended in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="080610107000286"></a>That brings me to the important issues. The first proposal on my agenda is to increase the entitlement to free level 3 qualification up to the age of 25. Bearing in mind how far we are behind, surely it must not be limited to that. People between 25 and 35 are still raising a family and getting the money together for a first home. Our problem is so great that we must be a touch more generous than 25. I am pushing it up not just for their sakes, but for all our sakes.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="080610107000287"></a>Then there is the statutory provision for free courses for a level 2 and for those at the most basic levels of mathematics and English. Great, but if you can look at the sums in the impact statement, you see that the extra expenditure and, through that, the extra places must be very few. I have looked into that with the help of officials and it is an issue that we ought to go into further as we proceed. The ideas are good, but I am concerned&#151;this is my only concern about the Bill&#151;that we use the opportunity that it gives us to do what the Government and all of us want. I am concerned that we shall not adequately exploit the opportunity.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_515"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="080610107000288"></a>That brings me to the question of motivation, my second point, which the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, raised. Compulsion is one approach. The successful approach is: &#147;I want to do it&#148;; and, from employers, &#147;I want to be engaged in this&#148;, rather than being forced and driven by laws, requirements and penalties. We need some new thinking on what will motivate young people, especially those who have been least successful in education, and have left it and shaken the dust of education off their sandals&#151;I am talking about adults now&#151;to come back in to remedy what they have missed in the past. I wrote to the government department concerned, the DIUS, about a month ago suggesting the need to bring together people with a wide range of experience and expertise to consider the issue of why those people do not come back and how to entice them back. It is not the kind of committee I want, but this layman is saying: &#147;Offer them something they want&#151;it may be studying Spanish to go on holiday, just to get them going and back into learning. It may be learning how to play rock music. Get them engaged in something they enjoy doing and you can develop from there&#148;. You have to get them through the door to get them started. That is the big problem.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="080610107000289"></a>Perhaps government departments can be helpful in getting people to move up from level 2 to level 3&#151;where the Germans have been so immensely successful&#151;by laying down job specifications. For example, languages are very important in the health service and the police, and such a specification would stimulate some people to do things they would not otherwise want to do. Motivation is the key issue behind everything we hope to achieve.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="080610107000290"></a>One piece of brilliant new thinking from this Government, in which I played a small part for a time, was the creation of Learn Direct. This system made it easy to learn from home by providing first class learning materials and allowing you to use modern technology to do it when you wanted, how you wanted and wherever you were at any time. It has been a great success. About a quarter of a million people are engaged in programmes at level 2 or, if they are not at level 2, they are ready to lift their attainment in the basics or a vocation. This kind of approach could also be relevant in schools education as a back-up to teachers. I may, if I remember, come back to that if I have sufficient time.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="080610107000291"></a>The Government have been innovative in qualifications and opportunities. That is great. One such opportunity is the young apprenticeships scheme which now involves 9,000 young people, I think, in extended pilots. They are going well and had a very successful report by Ofsted. However, it is one thing to do it when it has been carefully nurtured, managed and helped for 9,000, but to go national is a very different business. We need a huge investment of mind in how to achieve that and how to motivate and encourage employers to want to offer the opportunities. There have to be schools which can provide the back-up.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="080610107000292"></a>When schools move to the 14 vocational diplomas it will be the biggest challenge that secondary schools have faced for decades. They will be dealing with 14 diplomas at three levels in addition to what they do  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_516"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>already and the three new &#147;academic&#148; diplomas. How on earth can we do that? We have to invest in teachers in order to have the capabilities to offer this to a high standard. If it is not to a high standard and if it is not seen to be relevant by employers then it will not succeed. People will have to want to do it and see value in it. There is a big challenge not in the concept but in the implementation of the policy.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="080610107000293"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, for raising the question of technical colleges. I have worked with the noble Lord, Lord Baker, on this and have made tentative enquiries in various parts of the country about offering to 14 or 16 year-olds the opportunity of diplomas that require highly specialised and costly equipment and facilities that have continually to be updated. Those should be offered by specially built, designed and equipped technical colleges of high standing, perhaps sponsored by universities and major employers. The initial response we are getting is encouraging. These are very early days. However, just as there has been creative thinking about the options offered in secondary schools&#151;the young apprenticeships and the diplomas&#151;we have to be prepared to open our minds, while accepting the comprehensive as the basic rock of the system, to develop our minds and reach out to new ideas. I am glad, incidentally, to hear that government are opening the door to all-through schools. There may be an issue here about the age of transition from primary to secondary, but perhaps we will discuss that on another day.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="080610107000294"></a>There is provision, which I welcome, for the local authority to be responsible for seeing that the lads and the lasses do their stuff, but there is no responsibility in the Bill to provide the resources. I do not see how you can do one without simultaneously doing the other, and one must not assume that if you have done one, Parliament will approve the other.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="080610107000295"></a>My time is up. In conclusion, the key issue behind all this is that, having created an excellent framework and highly desirable objectives, we must provide the underpinning in terms of teachers who are well qualified to teach and the capability in specialist colleges, where they are needed, to offer highly technical subjects. We must also be sure that the employers want to engage because they can see that this is what they want and that it is not bound up in red tape. It is being made easy for them and it is so relevant. On that basis, the Bill can be a great success.</p>

I suppose that, if we were old enough, we would have wanted it since 1918. The Minister and others have mentioned that, but they have not mentioned the fact that the requirement for education to 18 was repeated in the Education Act 1944 by the Conservative and Labour Government. The only proviso was that it would not be implemented until resources permitted. It is extraordinary how many things resources have permitted since then, but not apparently this. The result has been one of the most unequal education systems in the advanced world. It is bipolarised, with many people leaving at the minimum school leaving age, which is low, and many people

Associated with that has been a very unequal distribution of earnings, which we all deplore.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="080610107000297"></a>We have seen huge advances in A-levels and university education, but for the other half of our children there has been far too little progress since the raising of the school leaving age to 16 in the early 1970s. Now, at last, we have a Bill that is almost entirely devoted to that group of children. It is extraordinarily unusual to have an education debate that is confined to this group of children. I totally welcome it and I congratulate the Government on having proposed the Bill.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="080610107000298"></a>I have two important questions about the Bill. First, will it actually deliver the quality that one hopes for for the people who will get more education because of it? Will the education be good enough? Secondly, can we achieve the quantity that is implied by the universal requirement in the Bill?</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="080610107000299"></a>On quality, how much education will people have to have, and of what kind? The Bill says that a person must be either in full-time education or apprenticeship or in part-time education or training while in work. What is the definition of part-time education or training? The Bill says that a person must be working towards a qualification accredited by the QCA and be getting 280 hours a year of guided learning. That is wonderful, but there is a proviso. If he is not getting 280 hours of guided learning, he must be working for a qualification for a number of hours that are assigned by the QCA. This is a most awful weakness. Surely we should specify that people should get some education, not be signed up for something for which they will have to do some education if they want the qualification.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="080610107000300"></a>I understand the thinking, but let us suppose that the employer thinks that a person could get the qualification with less than the 280 hours of guided learning. Obviously, such a person should be doing a higher qualification or aiming to achieve more than a bare pass. We do not want people to be signed up just for a qualification; we want them to get education. Equally, another employer might sign up a person knowing that he or she was not likely to get that education. We must have a specification of how much education a person should get, not just what they are signed up for. I hope that the Minister can look again at this weak link in the description of extra education.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="080610107000301"></a>Another aspect of quality is where this education is provided. Where will the guided learning happen? The Labour Party used to talk about off-the-job education and training. I do not think that these words appear in the Bill, although I may not have read every word. However, in general, that is not said. The Bill should refer to education away from the individual&#146;s workstation, although it quite possibly could be on the employer&#146;s premises. People can learn a lot at their workstations, but the basic purpose of the Bill is to stop people spending all their time at their workstations. They need to be able to think about what they are doing, as well be able to do the job in front of them. We are concerned about getting an educated workforce with the ability to analyse what it is doing as well as just being able to perform rote operations. That is lacking in parts of the British workforce, which is why we have an Education and Skills Bill and not just a skills Bill.  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_518"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We want an educated workforce whose members learn and think about their jobs. I urge the Minister to think about a requirement for most guided learning to be away from the workstation. If that does not happen, we can easily see in what direction this will lead.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="080610107000302"></a>On quantity, could we get everyone up to the age of 18 into education by 2015? As things are, I very much doubt whether we could do that. It would not be for the reasons of penalties that have been discussed; it would be to do with what is required from employers in order to make this possible. No one thinks that we will have everyone in full-time education. A great part of this expansion will have to be in part-time education and apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="080610107000303"></a>A striking feature of the Bill is that, in order to satisfy the law, young people will have to be not just in part-time education but in employment for more than 20 hours a week or on an apprenticeship. This will require a huge response from employers. My sums suggest that there will have to be something like a doubling in the number of young people on apprenticeships or in jobs with training, which would require at least 250,000 extra places of that kind. Can that happen? Some existing employers who now do not provide training will provide training, but others will say, &#147;If we have to provide training, we are not going to be bothered with young people&#148;. We need to find an additional incentive to get them interested.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="080610107000304"></a>I see that the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, is no longer here, but the report on the apprenticeship system by the Economic Affairs Committee, which he chaired and on which I serve, addressed the question of how we could get enough employers to provide enough apprenticeship places to satisfy the Government&#146;s undertaking that any young person with adequate minimum qualifications should be guaranteed access to an apprenticeship in the same timescale as that in which we are raising the age of participation in education. That is an important question. It is clear that increasing the number of people on apprenticeships will be the single biggest factor in making it possible to engage everybody in the extended educational experience, so we considered how it could be done. We came to the conclusion that, unless we pay employers something for taking on apprentices, it is unlikely that it will be possible.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="080610107000305"></a>That costs money, but we need also to think about the implications of moving to a system of compulsory education. Currently we are trying to increase participation in education and to encourage more young people to demand it by bribing them with education maintenance allowance and through child tax credits. However, if education is compulsory, those become less important. What will be absolutely crucial is a sufficient supply of places of a kind that people will want to take up if they are all going to be engaged in education up to 18. We should be spending significant sums of money now on generating an adequate supply of places to ensure that young people aged between 16 and 18 can have their meaningful educational experience.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="080610107000306"></a>I am not sure that I can make a specific suggestion but I believe that, without any mechanism for generating a supply of opportunities, in a way the Bill lacks conviction. It is no good saying that young people  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_519"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have to remain in education without showing what will be in place to ensure that there is something for them to do. The education maintenance allowance was a simple way of encouraging young people to remain in education, but now we should use at least some of that money or other funds to ensure that there is something for them to go to. That is a thought worth pursuing. Of course it could be too complicated to tie the provision of places to whether someone is entitled to EMA. As has been said, most of the people whom we are talking about come from deprived backgrounds, in which case we could make a lump-sum payment to every employer who takes on an apprentice or an employee aged under 18 with training needs. Sensible sums of money would go a long way towards motivating employers. Unless we have something like that, in enforcing the Bill we will be marching young people unwillingly into full-time education because there will not be the part-time opportunities to make them, as the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, said, get up and go.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="080610107000307"></a>The Bill is very welcome, but I hope that the Minister can make it more ambitious in terms of quality. We should be talking about what is actually going to happen&#151;the actual provision of education, not the qualification that someone signs up for. We should ensure that most of the education takes place away from the workstation and we must have a realistic strategy for making available enough of the kind of places that young people will want to take up. It is wonderful that the Government have grasped the nettle of undereducation, but let us really root it up.</p>

There has been for years a crying need for some change for this age band in education, so those who listened to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer making his Budget speech on 21 March 2007 were delighted to hear him say that it was the Government&#146;s intention to,</p>
<ul><a name="080610107000366"></a>&#147;for the first time in our country&#146;s history make education a right for every young person until the age of 18&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, 21/3/07; col. 827.]</ul>
<p><a name="080610107000341"></a>It was a surprise, therefore, to find that page 1 of the Explanatory Notes said with absolute accuracy:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="080610107000360"></a>&#147;The purpose of the Bill is, first, to change the statutory framework to put a duty on all young people to participate in education&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610107000342"></a>I wish that I knew what happened to change that opinion. I cannot believe that the choice of language was fortuitous in either case.</p>

<a name="80610-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="080610107000309"></a>So we come to the question of whether compulsion will achieve the admirable aims that the Government have set themselves. I think that it is not the right approach. We are talking about what is now the end of compulsory education and the carry forward from that&#151;the point at which children fully engaged in good education should have a momentum towards more learning, which would carry them into it when it was readily available, of good quality and free to their

What concerns me is the failure of the secondary system to deliver that momentum. Attention should be paid to that and I am glad to see that the Long Title of the Bill addresses that. What is needed&#151;this is not entirely amenable to legislation&#151;is to get what, years ago, was called the behaviour of the children right in school, so that they actively engage with their education. That is done by confirming every child&#146;s value as an individual, however handicapped they may be and whatever their SEN, by welcoming every little advance in behaviour and learning with congratulation, not brushing it aside or ignoring it if the pupil is difficult.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80610-0008.htm"/>


<a name="80610-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="080610107000310"></a>At my first school, this was practised very well. I remember one youth who definitely had SEN being led by the hand round the football field by one of the teachers, to get him involved in the game. What struck me was that, at the end of the summer term of his first year, everybody was getting prizes and one thought, &#147;Poor David, he will not get a prize&#148;. However, he had developed an enormous interest in the mowing machine that cut the grass on the playing fields. He became skilled in maintaining the mowing machine; he got a prize for doing so and was promoted back into the body of the school and the esteem of his friends. Similarly today, there are children who will not do mathematics beyond a fairly elementary stage, but if you engage them in building working scale models of Formula 1 racing cars, you get them very quickly discussing the flow characteristics of air and fuel  and doing the most advanced calculations because  they want to. That is what this Bill ought to be  doing: getting the children to want to do what they need to do.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="080610107000311"></a>The next thing we have to do is to engage them in the activity of running the school, so that the way the school is run belongs to them and those who disrupt it are actually acting against them. I have seen examples in this country and in Norway that are quite breathtaking. I remember doing this myself when I was leading a youth club. I had a desperately difficult child who was always breaking the rules of indoor football until I made him referee. After that, he became a model. We ought to do more of this. You can carry that into the management of schools. Years ago, a committee that I chaired looking into discipline in schools recommended serious consideration of the use of school councils to engage children in exactly this way.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080610107000312"></a>When the Minister of State for Schools and Learners addressed the Parliamentary All-Party Group for Children, he was minuted as saying that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="080610107000361"></a>&#147;the government believes that it is right to have compulsion in place because it knows of no other way to get beyond the 90% participation rate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610107000343"></a>I ask the Government to try a bit harder. I know there will be difficult cases. However, to criminalise them, even if it is only for two years, for having failed to complete their duties&#151;how are they going to get jobs? How are they going to build the first slice of their CV if, to every employer, they have to say, &#147;Yes, I have a criminal record, I have been done for truantism&#148;&#151;or whatever it is going to be called. No doubt it will have a more advanced and important name, but that is what it will be. That handicaps them off the starting block. Everybody else is halfway round the first lap before they begin.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="080610107000313"></a>These children are too often those who start with a disadvantage. This brings me to my third and final point, which goes back to the secondary system. Recently, it was discovered by a reliable body&#151;I cannot remember which, but I assure your Lordships that it is a good one&#151;that 55 per cent of the children who fail SATs are dyslexic. In the Bill there is a provision that allows local authorities to provide for the assessment of children in what is now their last year of compulsory full-time education. That is like examining a hospital case just before they go into the mortuary. This should be done at the beginning&#151;the saving would be startling.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="080610107000314"></a>I was recently at a seminar and will give the example provided by an organisation called Xtraordinary People of two schoolboys from Southwark. The names, no doubt, are fictitious. Lenny failed key stage 1 SATs at the age of seven. A teacher at his school had just finished training as a dyslexia specialist and picked up that Lenny was dyslexic. Between KS 1 and KS 2, this teacher supported Lenny for just one hour a week and he passed KS 2, scoring the highest level, 5, in English, maths and science. Calculated at an hourly rate, this support would have cost a total of &#163;2,250. Kirk failed KS 1 SATs aged seven, too. He was given a statement for dyslexia, which provided him with 20 hours&#146; support per week from a learning support assistant. He failed KS 2 SATs despite the support from the statement, which had cost the local authority a total of &#163;27,000. Xtraordinary People provided Kirk with a dyslexia specialist for 20 hours of specialist support when he started at secondary school in Y7. In one term, Kirk improved by two years. This support cost &#163;600.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="080610107000315"></a>The mathematics is unanswerable. We must have screening for all children early in their careers, and appropriate support for them&#151;not the blanket of any adult who has good will and will help them, but somebody who knows how to treat this condition. It is an increasingly common condition; or at least, it is increasingly commonly diagnosed. Now we have that knowledge, we can act on it. That will feed through the whole school system, because nothing makes pupils more disruptive&#151;and impedes the learning of others, as well as stultifying their own&#151;than frustration at being unable to achieve high academic ability because of dyslexia. This is one way into crime and prison. If your Lordships doubt me, ask the Prison Service what percentage of prisoners are dyslexic. You will be amazed.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080610107000316"></a>We have the cure for two difficulties here: a cure for disruptive behaviour in school and a cure for the rising or unsatisfactory incidence of juvenile offending, and eventually adult offending, too. I do not think that is an exaggerated claim; it is something that we have not picked up on and I hope that, during the Bill&#146;s passage, I will be able to encourage the Government so to do.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="080610107000318"></a>The Bill is welcome. It begins to put in place the framework for realising the vision in the Leitch report for up-skilling the UK's workforce so that it can remain competitive in a rapidly changing global economy. The problem to be addressed is deep seated and wide ranging. In 2006, more than one-fifth of 16 to 18 year- olds in England were not in education or training, including one in 10 who were not in education, employment or training. However, in debating the report of the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, last year, and also the Further Education and Training Bill, we took particular cognisance of the deep and persistent inequality which continues to dog the lives of many disabled people and the key part played by the education system in both perpetuating and alleviating it. I shall therefore devote my remarks to seeing that the Bill is fit for purpose in this regard.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="080610107000319"></a>That is well worth doing. As the <I>Raising our Ambitions</I> report by the Social Market Foundation found last year, improving the skills of disabled people would not only significantly improve their employment prospects, but also realise major economic benefits for the country as a whole, adding up to &#163;35 billion over the next 30 years. There is a raft of statistics to show the close association between disability, employment and skills. At 16, young disabled people are twice as likely to be in no form of education, employment or training as their non-disabled peers. This increases to three times by the age of 19. Disabled people are half as likely to have a degree and 40 per cent have no qualifications at all. Of all those in Britain with no formal qualifications, more than one-third are disabled. It is estimated that, by 2020, there will be only around 600,000 jobs in the economy for people with no qualifications.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="080610107000320"></a>As a result of all this, disabled people and people with long-term health conditions face significant disadvantages. They are far less likely to be in employment than non-disabled people. Their employment rate remains some 25 percentage points below the national average. This global picture masks particular deficits in employment opportunities for people with particular types of impairment: only one in 10 people with severe learning disabilities and two in 10 with mental health problems are in work. Disabled people in work are far less likely to be skilled and are disproportionately in low-paid, low-status jobs.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="080610107000321"></a>The compound of low skills and unemployment means that disabled people and those with long-term health conditions are also more likely to be socially excluded and live in poverty. Disabled adults are twice as likely to be living in poverty as non-disabled adults. Young people aged between 16 and 18 who are not in education, employment or training are at a much higher risk of experiencing poor outcomes in adult life and passing on this disadvantage to the next generation. The equalities review set up to identify the deepest and most persistent causes of disadvantage found that not being in education, employment or training for six months between the ages of 16 and 18 was the single most powerful predictor of unemployment at age 21.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_523"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="080610107000322"></a>Given that, to raise the age of participation in education or training to 18 makes good sense. It provides a major opportunity to improve provision for the many young people who leave school at 16 with few skills and poor long-term prospects. However, young people who have rejected or been excluded from school do not just want &#147;more of the same&#148;. More vocational pathways for 14 to 19 year-olds are needed, particularly an expansion in work-based learning, including apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships for the many young people who are not motivated by the traditional school environment&#151;work-based learning opportunities have more than halved in the past two decades; alternative and transitional provision, including entry to employment and foundation learning tier programmes, funded on a stable basis, to re-engage young people and support their return to mainstream learning; and provision for young people with learning difficulties and disabilities, with meaningful opportunities for progression.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="080610107000323"></a>Employers are obviously key to delivering these opportunities, but serious questions have been raised as to whether work-related training provision will be up to the job without radical change. First, there is just too little of it to meet demand from young people, and recruitment to the opportunities that exist goes along highly stereotyped lines, with better paid apprenticeships going to the traditional white male client group. A particular effort must therefore be made to ensure that the drive to increase the number of apprenticeships is not at the expense of quality, so that young people at the greatest disadvantage end up in apprenticeships that do little to unlock potential or create a route out of disadvantage.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="080610107000324"></a>Similarly, the role of employers in addressing inequality in in-house training provision needs attention, with support for positive-action &#147;train to gain&#148; initiatives, targeting 16 to 18 year olds for non-traditional skills and progression opportunities in traditional jobs. I was reassured by what the Minister said on quality in work-based learning, but the fact that he had to say it indicates the low base from which we start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="080610107000325"></a>To drive expansion, the Bill should be strengthened to require local authorities to audit the sufficiency and diversity of provision, encompassing both learning and support services. Ofsted should report to Parliament on progress towards an appropriate learning place for every young person and provision of appropriate support services. Barnardo&#146;s alternative education and training services work with young people who have been excluded from, or have rejected, school. They report that these young people say that being free to choose is critical to their motivation to attend and achieve. However, Barnardo&#146;s accepts that if steps are taken to find the right course for a young person and to put in place the necessary support, it is reasonable to expect them to participate&#151;through some system of enforcement, if necessary. However, I concede that this is controversial. Safeguards are necessary and I hope that these can be built in as the Bill passes through your Lordships&#146; House to ensure that the level of the penalty notice is set at an amount reflecting the financial support available to the poorest young people; that a young person can pay in instalments; that the young person can make

I welcome the assurances given by the Minister in the other place on the last two points, but it would be helpful to have them somewhat more firmly anchored in the structure of the legislation.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="080610107000326"></a>Some young people face significant barriers to participation in education and training, such as poor basic skills, low self-confidence, financial hardship, early parenthood, mental health problems, substance abuse or homelessness. The Bill needs to make clear that, in assessing whether a young person has a reasonable excuse for not attending, attendance panels must consider the extent of support provided by the LEA. The types of support expected to be available, such as transport, childcare and learning support, should be set out in guidance and take account of existing best practice.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="080610107000327"></a>While the Bill places clear duties on young people to participate, it is less clear about the responsibilities of others such as schools, colleges and employers as regards enabling participation. I should like to see the Bill provide for learning and support contracts, particularly for young people whose unmet support needs might constitute a reasonable excuse for not participating. These would constitute a commitment for the young person, and thus an incentive for participation, and would not be just a burden on providers. The Secretary of State gave a commitment at Report stage in the other place that learning and support contracts would be included in guidance to local authorities. This is welcome but I believe they are of sufficient importance to warrant being placed in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="080610107000328"></a>The requirement to participate in full-time education or training must not result in any young person living in poverty. Financial incentives are a key lever to encourage participation. Conversely, financial hardship is a key reason why young people drop out. The proposed restructuring of financial support for young people must ensure a minimum income guarantee for those aged 16 to 18 living independently who are particularly vulnerable to financial hardship, parity of financial support across different routes so that learning choices are not influenced by differing levels of benefits and allowances as at present, and more efficient processing and payment of the education maintenance allowance. There are other respects in which the Bill needs further disability proofing but they are of a comparatively detailed and technical nature. I have already spoken about some of them with the Bill team and will be happy to follow that up in writing. For today, it would be helpful if the Minister could give me comfort on some of the more strategic matters that I have raised.</p>

I am not sure that the Bill is ambitious but its direction of travel&#151;where it wants us to go&#151;is extremely ambitious. The goal of having all our young people stay in education or training up to the age of 18 was aspired to in 1917, as we have been told, and we will be the generation which achieves it. However, this Second Reading debate is one of the most unusual that I have come across. I respectfully say that I have never known so many speakers talk about matters that are not included in the Bill. However, I am about to do the same. I say gently that the Minister did exactly the same. For about a third of his speech he talked about things that were not in the Bill. That is what is strange about the Bill; it makes sense only if you look at it in conjunction with all the work that has been done on raising standards, the EMA, the changing curriculum, the diplomas and improved staff skills. If it never passed into law, education for 14 to 19 year-olds would go on improving. It is an unusual Bill but its direction of travel is ambitious when considered in conjunction with other work that is being done in this area.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="080610107000330"></a>The Bill&#146;s main provision concerns compulsion. I suspect that if the Government had not decided to make that a central part of their strategy for 14 to 19 year-olds, the Bill would not have been introduced this year. There are two points of view on the matter. Some noble Lords say that enforcement may be the only thing that will work for some people whereas others say that everything may work apart from enforcement. Therefore, the debate on enforcement is very polarised. Both arguments have merit. There is no doubt that persuasion is better than compulsion. However, imposing criminal sanctions on 16, 17 and 18 year-olds who do not attend school is a strange notion. It is nonsensical to introduce a law without providing a means of enforcing it. However, if people do not engage with this measure despite all we have done and you want to keep 16 to  18 year-olds in school, the administrative solution is to introduce compulsion. Therefore, I can see both sides of the argument and why people arrive at the conclusions that they do.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="080610107000331"></a>I am not convinced that easy answers can be found by changing the curriculum. I do not think that an easy solution can be found as regards vocational work, diplomas, the quality of teaching or anything else. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, that the matter is far more complicated than that. However, I have concerns about the details of compulsion. I am concerned not so much about whether this is an illiberal Bill but about whether it is workable. I am concerned about the shift from attendance being the parent&#146;s responsibility at the end of year 11 to it being the student&#146;s responsibility at the start of year 12. That is a huge shift in a six-week period. I am not sure how you prepare the type of young people we are talking about to face up to and come to terms with that responsibility.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="080610107000332"></a>I am in favour of criminal sanctions being imposed on people who do not send their children to school. Your actions should not jeopardise your child&#146;s ability  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_526"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and right to succeed. However, I am less convinced about the imposition of criminal sanctions on people when their actions affect only their own chances. That is a confusing issue but the thing that causes me most concern is the procedure for enforcing this measure. If we wish to be fair, to impose a sanction as a last resort, and, we hope, never to have to impose it at all, there should be opportunities to get the young person back on board at every stage of the process. We are dependent on teachers informing the Connexions service if there is a problem. That service informs the local authority and therein lies a story and possible delay. The child has to be warned, notice has to be given about attendance and an appeal panel has to be set up. If that does not resolve the issue, notice has to be given that a penalty may be imposed. Then notice has to be given for an appeal. At the end of that process the Youth Court may become involved. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a perfectly respectable process whereby we ensure that the measure is implemented. However, my difficulty is that the aim of staying in education or training between the ages of 16 and 18 should be to route a young person into lifelong learning. It is not just about education and training between the ages of 16 and 18 but about not letting young people drop out in those years and never getting back throughout their adult lives. However, as regards the robustness of the enforcement process, I am not sure that if you get young people back into education or training between the ages of 16 and 18 you will necessarily help them to commit themselves to lifelong learning beyond the age of 18.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="080610107000333"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, I am very undecided on the matter. The Minister said that if you want the end you have to will the means, but both sides of the argument that have been put forward have strengths and weaknesses. However, we might look at two or three other matters before we make a decision on which avenue we go down. I wonder whether we fully understand what goes on in the minds of 16 to 18 year-olds who choose to disengage with learning. It has been said that in the past few years we have made tremendous progress in encouraging people to stay on in education or training beyond the age of 16. However, we are still nearly at the bottom of the OECD table so there is nothing to boast about. The NEET tables show striking regional variations. In the south-east 5.6 per cent of 16 to 18 year-olds are NEET. In Yorkshire and Humber the figure is 9.2 per cent. In the north-east, which has the highest percentage of NEETs, the figure is 10.5 per cent. In the north-east twice as many young people are NEET than in the south-east. If the performance of the worst-performing region could be made to match that of the best-performing region, 6,000 fewer students in the north-east would be in the NEET category. Nationally that would mean a NEET rate of something like 94 or 95 per cent, which on my calculation puts us in the top 10 to 15 per cent of the OECD range. So, if we could get the worse performing region to be at the level of the best, we would have a take-up rate of 95 per cent.</p>

<a name="80610-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="080610107000334"></a>On the difference between the south-east and the north-east, I do not for a minute think that teachers are better in the south-east than in the north-east, that there are better and more motivated 16 to 18 year-olds,  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_527"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 527</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or that there is a more exciting curriculum or a more engaging support system. The difference is that in the north-east there is a higher level of unemployment, more jobs with fewer skills and more parents and adult who have not been to university. Surely that has something to do with it. In the north-east you are not surrounded by people who talk about jobs needing a high level of skill; people in the north-east, Yorkshire and Humberside are more recently in touch through their parents with the death of the old manufacturing industries and less in touch with the birth, growth and expansion of the new industries that need a high skill. I should like the Government to look at that.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="080610107000335"></a>Perhaps that is not an enforcement issue; perhaps it is a regional economic issue. Because of that one thing, what very much surprised me is that the department does not publish or collect NEET information on either a regional or a local authority basis. It has to rely on the Connexions data, which uses a different set of criteria from the Government in the Labour Force Survey published in the <I>Statistical First Release</I>. Therefore, is this not a regional economic issue, and how can the Government address this without having to hand regional figures on what NEETs are? We could do more in our school system to give a very clear signal that children do not leave school at 16. Why do we have GCSEs? GCSEs were a school leaving examination. That is why they are published in the tables. That is why mums and dads are very keen on what their kids do. That is the history of them. As long as we have at the end of year eleven the biggest, most important exam that a child has taken since the day they were born, children will get the message that they can leave school. Indeed, we still talk about whether a 16 year-old will stay on whereas the Americans talk about whether a 16 year- old will drop out. While we have what is an important school leaving exam and while we have education from five to 11, 11 to 16 and 16 to 18, we will have a structural problem in giving that message to young people.</p>

Evidence shows that the economic well-being of a country is increased by higher rates of literacy and numeracy, and that continuing learning after compulsory schooling brings rewards financially and in personal fulfilment. However, it is apparent from the debate, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, set out, that we are disputing whether it is better to have entitlement and encouragement or compulsion and even criminalisation for the post-16 age group. In extending the educational leaving age, it may well be more complex to motivate and engage young people and to win hearts and minds, but it would reap dividends in comparison with a cohort of the press-ganged.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="080610114000002"></a>The current years of compulsory education provide a unique period of opportunity. Of course, the fact that that is compulsory can be a deterrent to some young people who are impatient for independence. If school does not seem relevant to them and it is associated with failure and boredom, they will be unwilling to continue to learn. So, as other noble Lords indicated, it is particularly important to have a choice of learning programmes leading to appropriate accredited qualifications. That full range of options is not yet fully developed and embedded.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="080610114000003"></a>A-levels have been around for over 50 years, long enough to be a familiar concept, but they have changed and developed over the years&#151;changed in subjects and assessment methodology, and even in the numbers of passes, moving from a pre-set percentage of pass/fail to criterion assessment where all those who meet the agreed standard are awarded a pass. That in itself has led to increased numbers of passes with higher grades, causing ongoing problems for universities and institutions in delineating the best from the excellent. There is also the international baccalaureate, which is gathering champions in independent and state sectors.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="080610114000004"></a>To balance that provision, practical alternatives have to contend with the familiarity and status particularly of the A-level. It may be a mere 90 years since the Fisher Act failed to be implemented, but I think we can go back generations in seeing the disregard for practical skills as against academic achievement. We have suffered as a country and as individuals from the undervaluing of the practical crafts and technical skills that are now represented in the diploma. But it is a real challenge for apprenticeships, vocational qualifications and now for the diploma. For the diploma to succeed&#151;and too much is at stake for young people for it not to succeed&#151;we would do well to look at past initiatives.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="080610114000005"></a>Rather more recently in history, in the 1990s I was involved in developing the general national vocational qualification. GNVQs were introduced as the main alternative to A-levels, to be of equal esteem based on practical work-related achievement. They were developed at some speed to a political rather than an educational timetable. They came under attack from the start by the media. Their undoubted value for a

After various rebrandings and reforms they disappeared last year. The diploma must not be allowed to go down that route.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="080610114000006"></a>Diplomas need a simplicity and clarity of purpose to attract young people, parents and employers. There is a danger that in the rush to have a full range available, they may be rolled out too speedily at the expense of thorough piloting, good resource materials and, above all, full engagement from teachers and assessors. They also need some inspiring case studies. It is early days but there are examples around. We hope that some exciting publicity will be generated when the World Skills Competition comes to London in 2011. It will provide real visual examples, incentives and enthusiasm, and show the achievements possible in the craft and manual skills: catering, hairdressing, construction and engineering&#151;the range of topics covered by the diploma. Meanwhile, skills competitions provide real incentives for young people to see what can be achieved.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="080610114000007"></a>Perhaps I may turn to Chapter 3 of the Bill and touch on the duties placed on employers. As other noble Lords have said, those duties are onerous. Many organisations and, indeed, other noble Lords have urged a close look at these clauses. With respect to 16 to17 year-olds, as we mentioned, some 100,000 young people are NEETs and not fulfilling their potential. That number would be greater but for the fact that many with few or no qualifications have left school with sighs of relief and found work, often with small employers in garages, restaurants, hairdressers, shops and offices. Professor Alison Wolf from King&#146;s College London states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="080610114000083"></a>&#147;Most young employees work for small firms. As a result of this legislation, many such firms are likely to stop employing any 16 or 17 year olds. This will have a devastating effect on the youth labour market and on the skills and future employability of many young people&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610114000079"></a>If it is easier to employ those over 18, many employers will choose that option. As the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, said, in the process, disaffected 16 year-olds may be lost to the job market and, perhaps more importantly, may not be willing to try again or have the confidence to acquire new skills.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="080610114000008"></a>That adds to the case for adult skill training. There are currently 6.2 million economically active adults without a full level 2 qualification and even more who lack numeracy and literacy skills. This figure will not change by itself. As we know, well over 70 per cent of the 2020 workforce have already completed compulsory education. They are beyond the reach of diplomas, although not now, thankfully, of adult apprenticeships. Training for adults becomes of greater importance as demographics show fewer young people entering the workforce but an increase in skilled jobs. Some jobs previously considered low-skill now have higher skill requirements. Sectors such as care and cleaning have not been rated as highly as they deserve. They require considerable skill and knowledge, and they play key roles in society. Both are dominated by women and that gender imbalance may be an added hurdle to full recognition of the commitment involved and the need for training.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="080610114000009"></a>Training also makes demands on the individual. The impact assessment assumes that Skills for Life participants forgo &#163;2,500 in earnings and incur course costs of &#163;250 while studying. The implication is that this is a good thing, but however well motivated adults may be, they will also have other commitments. Women are likely again to be disproportionately affected through their lower earnings and by bearing the greater load of domestic and family responsibilities. We therefore welcome the encouragement and financial support for adults to acquire new skills, currently up to level 2. Like the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, we would like to see those plans extended so that they fund tuition fees up to a greater age than 25, as currently planned. I also share my noble friend Lady Walmsley&#146;s concern about the disclosure of data and sharing of information. We shall seek reassurances on those clauses in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="080610114000010"></a>The opportunities for adult training should be as flexible as possible. Ideas such as spreading the entitlement over a period of time or ensuring that unit and module accreditation can also be transferred will help to attract and retain learners. As ever, FE colleges are key players in all of this. They have the expertise to respond to the changing requirements of government, employers and individual learners. Their full involvement is essential in ensuring that adult learning is accessible and deliverable. When the Learning and Skills Council gives way to the Skills Funding Agency in 2010, as planned, we hope that its &#163;4 billion budget will allow a more generous view of adult training and that the changeover in institutions will not cause additional red tape.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="080610114000011"></a>The Bill sets out aspirations which we welcome. Although legislation can change the climate of opinion and do much to promote good practice, the measures set out rely on enthusiastic participants, wide-ranging opportunities and the active involvement of employers. There is work to be done on all these fronts. Meanwhile, we welcome the direction of the Bill and look forward to working on the detail in Committee.</p>

An illustration of the problem is what the Minister said about diplomas, that they will offer extensive work-related experience which turns out to be 10 days. That is what students doing GCSE and A-level get at the moment. This is not a successful vocational system because it is not being taken carefully enough.

All these groups require specialist, focused and understanding provision. You cannot try to hit them with more of the same that they have fallen out of or lost interest in or that is not focused on them.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="080610114000014"></a>I have seen examples of how this can go wrong in the prison system. Some while ago prison education was taken over by DCSF. The department has no one in it who has any experience of working in prisons. It has subcontracted a lot of the work to the Learning and Skills Council, which is similarly ill equipped to understand what goes on in prisons. A lot of specialist work has been done on how to reengage prisoners. As has been said, many of them have completely dropped out of the education system, hate the idea of sitting in a classroom and require to be re-motivated. Much of that specialist work, a lot of it done by the voluntary sector&#151;my wife is involved in this side of things&#151;has gone by the board because the LSC will only fund standard qualifications aimed at employment. If you have a criminal record, employment is immensely difficult to get. Prison is an immense impediment to overcome when you are looking for work. You need a strong motivation and an understanding of your own abilities to get through that. Not to equip prisoners with that&#151;not to give them back a basic place within their own family and society&#151;is a fault that is developing in prison education because of a centralisation, a lack of understanding and a lack of appreciation about what can be done at a local level.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="080610114000015"></a>A lot of these people who end up outside education are just teenagers. They got bored with it and want to do other things. They are not focused on education. They need space and time. That is what the gap year evolved for, to give pupils a breather, but some kids need that earlier on. We ought to be allowing these children to come back to education at their own pace&#151;looking after them, keeping in touch with them as the Bill proposes, but giving them space. It should be enough to get where they ought to be in education by the age of 25 if they have been doing useful things before that. By extension, we ought to be happy to see people taking several years out before university so that when they come back to education they come back to a course that they really want to do, are motivated to do and are actually going to work at, rather than spending time in the bars and clubs, as is advertised by many universities at the moment. There is a lot to be said for taking this whole business more gently.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="080610114000016"></a>In Committee I will focus on trying to find ways of making the Bill more flexible and allowing room for the voluntary sector to get involved and to be innovative. I will try to make sure that the local authorities&#146; role is supportive and that we do not let them get back into running things, as the Government have rightly had as a policy aim. The local authority should be there as a friend of the pupil, trying to make sure that he develops his life right, rather than as a provider itself. The idea of individual budgets is  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_532"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 532</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>constructive in that respect. Money should be attached to the pupil and spent in any way that the local authority considers useful taking regard of the requirements of that pupil. Why should the local authority&#146;s options be restricted by what some central body has said is appropriate for children in general? These will often be specific cases.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="080610114000017"></a>I will certainly oppose making non-attendance a criminal offence. There are lots of things that are good for us. It is good for us to play sport, and you are supposed to play sport at school; but once you are an adult, I am jolly glad to say that you are not criminalised if you do not do so. It is entirely inappropriate that we should seek to criminalise not doing something just because it is good for you to do it. Again, this comes back to the DCSF&#146;s lack of experience in these matters. It does not realise how problematic it is to get employment once you have a criminal record. It will absolutely blow a hole below the water line in those kids&#146; prospects if they have a criminal record. That is not the way to help people under any circumstances whatever. I shall join my noble friends on the Front Bench in opposing that.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="080610114000018"></a>I do not know whether I shall be as enthusiastic as those on my Front Bench about removing Part 4; but I want to understand what it is about. I have not seen anything anywhere that explains to me what advantages the Government see in the changes that they are proposing regarding independent schools. As has been said, the system seems to be working well at the moment, and the changes are not in themselves obviously logical. I do not necessarily believe that independent schools are perfect in all respects, but the Government need to show the benefits of the changes that they are proposing to themselves, to the wider community and to independent schools.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="080610114000019"></a>I shall look carefully at what is being proposed for the Careers Service, which frankly has been a laughing stock for many years. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said that she wants it to break gender stereotypes; it does that to a certain extent. My son went through one of the processes to be told that he should be a beautician. He is a great deal larger than I am and would make an imposing person behind the nail varnish.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080610114000020"></a>Most of all, I hope that we&#151;particularly my Front Bench, but perhaps also the Liberal Democrats, who might hope that in 2010 this endless game of piggy in the middle that they have been playing will end and they will catch the ball at last&#151;will recognise the importance of getting this right and that we will learn through the discussions that we have in Committee and later what it is that we would do if we were given the chance.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="080610114000021"></a>I absolutely support my noble friend Lord Pilkington in talking about specialist vocational colleges. They would be centres of innovation and centres of excellence that would be able to do far more in advancing the cause of vocational education than could ever be done by central diktat. We always suspect what comes out of the centre, but where we have individual schools and colleges leading the way, we are prepared to admire and to follow. They would fit so easily in the academies programme. As happened in West Dunbartonshire, once you have some real examples of

That would solve a problem that we have all faced unsuccessfully for a very long time.</p>

Ironically, I have a particular affection for the Education Act 1944, one of the two education Acts that have been mentioned, which had the same purpose of raising the school leaving age. That Act also put to an end the pernicious practice of requiring women teachers to retire on marriage. That was one of the UK&#146;s earliest anti-discrimination legislative steps for equalising opportunities for women, even if it was a shortage of teachers, rather than any passion for equal opportunities, that was the real motivation behind putting that provision in the Act.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="080610114000023"></a>Like many noble Lords who have spoken, and like many of the experts in this field, although I welcome the Bill I wish that the Government had decided to give the first generation involved the choice of whether to continue in education&#151;suitably accompanied by the maximum number of carrots&#151;rather than going straight down the compulsion route. It is surely significant that the Government&#146;s consultation with young people showed that 47 per cent were against the compulsory duty imposed by the Bill, with only 30 per cent backing the idea. It would certainly have helped to make a stronger case for entering the dangerous and potentially counterproductive route of applying sanctions if that was to happen only after the duties imposed on the parties concerned&#151;parents, schools, colleges, the LEAs, employers and, above all, the young people themselves&#151;had not been met.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080610114000024"></a>Be that as it may, I am glad that the legislative framework that your Lordships are asked to approve in this Bill tries to ensure that the right choice for each individual&#146;s extra years, once made, is adequately supported and that the individual young person&#146;s wishes are taken into consideration. That is required by Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child&#151;it has not been mentioned so far, but it is an important provision&#151;which also requires that due weight should be given to their views. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that will indeed happen.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080610114000025"></a>I welcome, too, the Government&#146;s commitment to improving the quality of careers advice to ensure that stereotypes about gender, disability, race and employment are challenged in schools and elsewhere. A number of noble Lords have mentioned that. The Equality and Human Rights Commission and the YWCA particularly stressed in their evidence the need to challenge gender stereotyping. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, made that point forcefully. We are seeing many more men in well paid apprenticeships and so on, while women are still going for low-paid areas. That has to be challenged. This commitment is key to the future. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that this is the intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080610114000026"></a>It is good news that this is only enabling legislation. The school leaving age will rise to 17 by 2013 and to 18 by 2015. There are a number of years to prepare the young people concerned. That should enable most students by that time to become alert to the advantages, both to the economy and to their own future prospects in the global nature of the world in which we live, of the extra years of compulsory education and training. I also find it encouraging that considerable flexibility is built into the legislation as to how those years can be spent. Particularly important will be the ability to combine employment with part-time education and training, which is far more likely to attract those who feel that they have nothing further to gain from school. We have heard a lot about them and I am concentrating on them still further.</p>

<a name="80610-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="080610114000027"></a>There are, of course, some large dark shadows across the scene. I have in mind, for example, the announcement about the 638 secondary schools that have a struggle ahead if they are to get back into their own ownership rather than becoming other forms of school. That clearly illustrates the concern that many schools are failing a considerable number of young people, a large proportion of whom will come from the poorer sections of the community, as was illustrated by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley. We should note, of course, that it is those children who this autumn move from primary to secondary school who will be the first to be affected by the school leaving age hike.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="080610114000028"></a>I return to the unease that is felt about the compulsion to participate. We already know that the enforcement process will create particular problems for some groups. Some of your Lordships heard at a useful meeting that we had with the Bill team last week that considerable attention has already been given in the other place to some of these groups, such as young people with special educational needs and other disabilities. They and perhaps particularly young carers, who have additional problems to cope with, will certainly need that extra individual attention and support to ensure that the appropriate package of learning is planned, supported and available. There is no doubt that this group will receive similar attention in your Lordships&#146; House, not least when we have such experts as my noble friend Lord Low participating in the debate. We will need, too, to be reassured that as well as the necessary human resources&#151;I agree about the need to involve the voluntary sector&#151;we will also have available realistic financial backing.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="080610114000029"></a>I have a special anxiety about whether the five years before these plans become operational will be enough time for sufficient progress to be made, particularly for those disaffected young people from deprived, often chaotic, home backgrounds to feel content to remain within the education system for yet another two years. After all, despite some excellent government initiatives such as Sure Start, that cycle of deprivation&#151;identified many years ago by Keith Joseph&#151;is sadly still with us. We have not yet found the solution. It can hardly help youngsters from such backgrounds if, on top of these handicaps, they risk acquiring a civil and, ultimately, some form of criminal record as a result of breaching these new educational requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="080610114000030"></a>In many debates and particularly during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill and the Children and Young Persons Bill, a number of your Lordships have urged the Government to concentrate resources in two areas: first, in supporting families immediately that they show the signs of dysfunction; and, secondly, on efforts to reduce the almost immediate reoffending records of the high proportion of such disaffected youngsters who end up in the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="080610114000031"></a>How can we prevent the compulsory requirements of this legislation from adding to that risk? Will the Minister, when she replies, tell us how this Bill will affect this group positively? How exactly&#151;this is a rather different but not unrelated question&#151;will it affect the education and skills training requirement for 17 and 18 year-olds who are in custody? Following up on an Oral Question that I asked in your Lordships&#146; House recently, I ask whether education and training will in future take precedence over paid prison jobs throughout the country. Will there be skilled teachers for ensuring that young offenders acquire those basic literacy and numeracy skills that they have clearly missed out on for so long? At least as important, is it intended that apprenticeships and some of the new diploma courses can be begun while the young people are in custody?</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080610114000032"></a>I am getting towards the end of my time, but the other aspect of the Bill that I want to welcome is those clauses that seek to implement the recommendations of the Leitch report. It is important to be reminded that some 74 per cent of our working age population in 2020 are already over 16. Therefore, the opportunity to acquire the necessary level 2 qualifications at no extra cost throughout adulthood is a welcome initiative. Sadly, the level 3 opportunity is to be limited to 19 to 25 year-olds. I support my noble friend Lord Dearing&#146;s suggestion that, in any event, this age limit should be moved up to 35. More than that, I prefer to take the hint from the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, that lifelong learning should be here to stay. That should be emphasised. It really does not matter when you take the next course; with almost every job that you do, it is necessary to have further education and training to keep pace. With that in mind, I hope that this Bill, when it gets to the second stage of having something to implement, will be rather changed by the processes that it will go through in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

I give this Bill a very warm welcome, especially Part 1, on which I want to focus my remarks. The duty that it imposes on young people aged 16 and 17 to participate in education and training and the requirement on LEAs to promote their participation, as well as the duties on employers to make it possible for young people with jobs to participate, are a hugely important educational reform. I believe that the Bill, when enacted, will be an historic step in the expansion of education for those who have opted out of learning far too soon,  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_536"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 536</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in many cases damaging their prospects for the rest of their lives. Our position in the OECD tables, which the Minister cited, is totally unacceptable. This reform is long overdue and, therefore, all the more welcome. The moral and economic case for it is overwhelming.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080610114000034"></a>Like my noble friend the Minister, I want to say something about history. It is nearly 100 years since,  in 1909, a consultative committee on education recommended a system of compulsory part-time education for young people after they left school. The committee saw it as an option to be decided on locally but hoped that it would spread to cover the whole country. A century ago, progressive thinkers of the Edwardian era produced the first official report that can be said to be the initial steps towards the Bill that we are discussing today.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="080610114000035"></a>As the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington of Oxenford, and others have said, the Bill&#146;s legislative antecedent was the Fisher Act of 1918, the first of the three most important education Acts of the 20th century. That Act provided a legislative framework for part-time education for those aged 14 to 18. The day continuation schools that it proposed were not mandatory and, as the Minister said, their development was killed off by the Geddes economies that axed public expenditure in the early 1920s.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080610114000036"></a>My noble friend Lord Layard reminded us that the idea was revised in the second great education Bill of the 20th century, which became the 1944 Education Act, sometimes known as the Butler Act. The Act envisaged that LEAs would have a duty to provide county colleges&#151;perhaps the sort of thing that the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, was referring to&#151;for young people not at school or in other educational institutions. I believe that there were no sanctions for non-attendance for the day, or two half-days, envisaged in the legislation. Once again, the provision was not implemented. In 1959, the Crowther report on the education of 15 to 18 year-olds put the case again. Another 50 years have passed since then, but it finally looks as though we may be getting there.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080610114000037"></a>I have touched on the long history of proposals for extending education on a part-time basis for young people who have left school to underline my belief that compulsion is required to make it a reality. Those who argue for a voluntary approach have failed to absorb the lessons of history. In the past, because there was no compulsion, nothing happened. I put it to those who oppose compulsion and argue for a voluntary approach that, when the school leaving age was last raised, in 1973, it was not considered to be sensible to argue for no compulsion. When full-time school education is extended by statute, the view is taken that it should be universally applied. Why should that view not be taken in relation to the part-time extension of post-school education for 16 and 17 year-olds? There can be no half measures in trying to reach the most vulnerable young people who are currently receiving no education or training but who desperately need it if they are to engage in meaningful work in today&#146;s economy.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080610114000038"></a>Unlike the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, and other noble Lords on the opposition Benches, I therefore congratulate the Government on having the courage of their convictions and on making participation compulsory, even though it is important to do everything  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_537"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 537</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that we possibly can to ensure that enforcement is a last resort. I was reassured by what the Minister said about this, although I thought that he was perhaps a little overoptimistic about the numbers of people who are likely to be resistant to the Bill&#146;s requirements.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="080610114000039"></a>As other noble Lords have said, it is vital to recognise that, for the legislation to work, the education and training provided must be suitable to meet the needs of youngsters for whom continuation in full-time classroom learning is not an acceptable option. These are the pupils who do not like school and want to leave at the first opportunity. Many of them are, I am afraid, wholly unrealistic about their employment opportunities and have not made the link between learning and having a good job. To help them to make this link and to motivate them requires ingenuity and imagination. Innovative forms of learning, largely based in the workplace, are required. </p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080610114000040"></a>The Bill embraces two main options: employment with a part-time course followed in an FE college or the workplace, or an apprenticeship. The distinction between them will often be blurred but in both cases the contribution of employers is central. For that reason, I am delighted that the CBI broadly backs the Bill and supports raising the participation age and reducing what it calls,</p>
<ul><a name="080610114000084"></a>&#147;the significant proportion of 16 to 17 year olds who are not in education, employment or training&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080610114000080"></a>However, like my noble friend Lord Layard, I was disappointed that the CBI seemed to be saying that it is acceptable for firms to provide employment for 16 and 17 year-olds without providing proper training, too. In its briefing to Members of this House, it claims that many employers providing &#147;valuable work opportunities&#148; for young people will be put off by having to provide training and to police participation. The question must be: just how valuable are these work opportunities if they are not accompanied by properly organised training? Nor does it seem likely that young people themselves will feel, as the CBI said,</p>
<ul><a name="080610114000085"></a>&#147;forced back into school or college&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080610114000081"></a>because they are asked to pursue qualifications in a work-based context. That would be truly irrational behaviour on the part of those young people who have already rejected formal education in the classroom.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="080610114000041"></a>It is, however, vital to accredit in-house training that is provided by employers, which will encourage them to see value in training their young employees towards obtaining vocational qualifications. Such training should allow progression from the diplomas for l4 to 19 year-olds that numbers of young people will, by the time that this Bill is enacted, have been following. The reform of vocational qualifications has been on the agenda for a long time. It is vital that the sector skills councils address these reforms, simplifying and rationalising an overcomplex system and keeping qualifications up to date. This is not a one-off job&#151;continued monitoring will be needed to make sure that they really are fit for purpose as economic change takes place.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="080610114000042"></a>That brings me to apprenticeships. Their decline over the past 30 years is little short of disastrous. The most shocking statistic that I came across when I was a Minister in the Department for Education and  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_538"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 538</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Employment was that in the borough of Lambeth there were only 25 apprenticeship places available&#151;that was in a part of London where many young people had rejected full-time classroom education. We must all lament the fact that work-based learning has more than halved over the past 20 years. I deeply regret the fact that, as a Minister, I was unable to do more to halt the decline. However, I am pleased that the committee that I set up, which was chaired by Sir John Cassels, to examine ways of restoring apprenticeships eventually led to the recent report from DIUS, <I>World-c</I><I>lass Apprenticeships</I>. The report set a target of 400,000 apprenticeships by 2020. However, this target will be achieved only if employers in the public and voluntary sectors, as well as the private sector, embrace the new scheme with real drive and enthusiasm and are committed to improvements in quality. The Government also have to play their part in providing the right incentives and in avoiding unnecessary red tape. The recently advertised post for director of the National Apprenticeship Service will be one of the most important jobs in our education system. I hope that it attracts an excellent field. The sector skills councils must also give high priority to the delivery of not just apprenticeships but high-quality apprenticeships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080610114000043"></a>This Bill is not about universities but, as a vice-chancellor of a university that is committed to widening participation, I believe that, when the Bill&#146;s measures have been implemented, universities will benefit from a wider range of young people with the potential to benefit from higher education. Widening participation from sixth forms and FE A-level programmes has almost reached its peak, and it has been an uphill struggle. A successful work-based route through apprenticeships and other programmes can and should lead into higher education for some of the participants. This will be particularly true for foundation degrees that are jointly designed by universities and employers. But many other vocational degrees in higher education may be appropriate next steps for some of the young people who will benefit from this Bill. However, universities must be willing to reach out to them and accept their work-based qualifications as alternatives to academic qualifications for entry to university courses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080610114000044"></a>Some details in the Bill require further consideration at later stages. For example, like some other noble Lords, I would like to see the clauses on adult education becoming a little more radical. However, Second Reading is not the time to quibble about such details. This Bill is a great step forward in the long history of extending education to a greater proportion of the population. It has taken 100 years to reach this point. Progress may have been slow, but progressing we now are. If this House is still sitting in 100 years&#146; time, it will look back to this date and say, &#147;This was an historic moment&#148;. I greatly look forward to the Bill&#146;s full implementation by, I hope, 2015.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="080610114000046"></a>A good parent cares about what his children are doing. That is particularly germane for current concerns about the strength of the family. If we do not ensure that a child has some meaningful, useful occupation of their time, what are the options for them? I intend to speak of the potential benefit to young people leaving the care system, 25 per cent of whom do so at the age of 16. I wish to highlight concerns that the new imperative that they must be in educational training is not undermined by the failure to provide a proper transition for those young people out of the care of their local authority.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="080610114000047"></a>More than 30 per cent of care leavers experience homelessness in their first year out of care. To be in education or training, surely one has to have a home. I was most grateful to the Minister for extending the duty on local authorities to provide a range of appropriate placements for looked-after children in the Children and Young Persons Bill. Will that duty be extended to include an appropriate range of supported accommodation for care leavers?</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="080610114000048"></a>The management of the relationship between the young person and his social worker, foster carer or residential care worker is crucial to ensuring that these young people can engage with education or training. I will ask the Minister to set a clear new priority for health trusts further to prioritise looked-after children and care leavers. In particular, will the Minister ensure that every foster carer, social worker, residential child care worker, hostel or foyer worker has regular contact with an appropriately skilled mental health professional to discuss the management of their relationship with the young person?</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="080610114000049"></a>These young people need appropriate housing and stable relationships with their carers if they are to remain engaged. Those providing the stable relationships need to be supported by a psychiatrist, a child psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist. They need a home, both physical and emotional, if we are to keep them with us. I warmly welcome Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s intention to keep 16 and 17 year-olds in education or training. I acknowledge the difficulties entailed in achieving that very laudable ambition. One need only think of the success of the Government&#146;s summer Splash play schemes in reducing crime rates to recognise the importance of this purposeful activity to young people. If we want to change the gang culture to keep young people off drugs and away from alcohol, out of anti-social and criminal behaviour, this must be the right direction.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="080610114000050"></a>This is particularly true of care leavers and young people in care, who are still heavily overrepresented in the NEET statistics, which we heard from the Minister earlier. While the number has reduced in recent years thanks to Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s endeavours, it has not kept pace with the reduction that has been achieved for the whole population of young people. Care-experienced young people are heavily overrepresented in our prisons, secure training centres and secure children&#146;s homes. Great emphasis has been placed by

I very warmly welcome the recent pilots to allow some young people in foster care a stronger say on whether they can remain with their foster carer up to the age of 18 and the related pilot to enable some young people to remain with their foster carer to the age of 21. I encourage Her Majesty&#146;s Government to expand these possibilities as fast as possible and to apply them equally to residential care. I hope the new duty that the Minister introduced in the Children and Young Persons Bill&#151;the duty I mentioned earlier&#151;may help in this process. The challenge to achieving this, though, is considerable, given that there is a shortage of 10,000 foster carers in England alone and that we lose 10 per cent of our foster carers each year, which I was told at a recent meeting with the Fostering Network. The improvements that the Government are developing for social work may provide some of the support that foster carers need to stay in their vocation.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="080610114000051"></a>Notwithstanding our hopes for the future, currently young people leave care at 16 and 17, to go into either independent living or supported accommodation with the expectation of an early transfer into independent living. I recall speaking to a teacher about one of his pupils. She was in care, achieving well. She was moved into a flat of her own, something she very much wanted. Shortly, she was failing in school, accruing debt and then losing her flat. I strongly suspect that there is far too much emphasis on moving young people from supported accommodation, such as foyers and hostels, into independent living as soon as possible. Often, I suspect, the transition should take years and not months.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="080610114000052"></a>I know from having worked as a volunteer in supported accommodation for several years that the qualification system is not fit for purpose and that the close partnership with mental health services is lacking. Sixty per cent of young people enter care because of abuse and a further 10 per cent because of family breakdown. Not surprisingly levels of mental disorder in the foster population are in the region of 45 per cent and in children&#146;s homes about 68 per cent. Sustaining consistent reliable caring relationships with such young people is problematic. We need to look to the model of pedagogue and social educator used on the Continent. I warmly welcome Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s forthcoming pilots of this model.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="080610114000053"></a>Some of your Lordships may have seen the recent transmission of the documentary, &#147;Hold Me Tight, Let Me Go&#148;, on BBC 4. It records the journeys of children in care through the Mulberry Bush School, a therapeutic community in Cambridgeshire. The Mulberry Bush is an outstanding model of what can be achieved when staff receive the right support and leadership. It has now been operating for more than 50 years&#151;it is its 60th anniversary. Its chief executive, John Diamond, commented to me last Friday along these lines. He said that carers choose to care because they wish to have the pleasure of caring for another person. Children in care respond to care in general but, because of their experience of their own parents, in a characteristic way. They throw back the care offered. They take every opportunity to make their carer feel useless. In the Mulberry Bush case, and the film is a beautiful

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="080610114000054"></a>The natural response of any normal person to such behaviour is to walk away. The next response, if one cannot leave, is to retaliate. We have seen this in the inquiries into abuse in children&#146;s homes and in the overuse of restraint at Oakhill Secure Training Centre. The appropriate professional response is complex but it hinges on not allowing the child to destroy the relationship with his carer. This latter response is possible only if foster carers, social workers, residential childcare workers, foyer and hostel workers have excellent supervision from their line managers, which includes consideration of the relationship with the child and the emotions provoked in the carer by that relationship. Additionally, they need regular contact with a psychiatrist, a child psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist again to reflect on their relationship with the young person.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="080610114000055"></a>I hope that I have not strayed from the Bill. If its purpose is to ensure wider engagement of 16 and  17 year-olds, particularly those at the margins, then I think I have not done so. Will the Minister extend the duty on local authorities to provide an appropriate range of local placements for looked-after children to include an appropriate range of supported accommodation for care leavers? The MP for Stafford, David Kidney, may move an amendment along these lines to the Children and Young Persons Bill, and I hope that the Government will give him a sympathetic response if he does so.</p>

<a name="80610-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="080610114000056"></a>Furthermore, will the Minister prioritise looked-after children and care leavers with mental health trusts so that the carers of these young people receive the support they need to sustain the stable and caring relation required for them to succeed in education and training and for them not to repeat their own histories of neglect with their own children? I understand from the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, who I see in his place, that there is a review of child and adolescent mental health services. I should be grateful if the Minister could take forward these concerns to the Secretary of State who is leading the review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="080610114000057"></a>I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply. I regret not having given her notice of my questions and understand if she would prefer to write to me in response.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="080610114000059"></a>In my brief comments, I shall concentrate on one major aspect of the Bill which worries me&#151;Part 1. I have no difficulty with increasing compulsory education until the age of 17 or 18. As the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, said, the case for it is overwhelming. It is moral, social and, as the Minister pointed out in his opening remarks, those between the ages of 16 and 18 in education are less likely to get involved in crime, less likely to go to prison, less likely to get pregnant or to engage in anti-social behaviour.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="080610114000060"></a>I am convinced that it needs to be done, but how do we go about doing it? I have no difficulty with compulsion; it is absolutely necessary. If one can show that individuals  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_542"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 542</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have certain responsibilities that they refuse to discharge, or if there are certain matters of national interest, compulsion in those cases has to be ensured. My difficulty is whether the balance between compulsion and incentive is right. I looked at the debate that took place when the age for compulsory education was increased to 16, and I heard echoes of that debate this afternoon. It had the same arguments&#151;no compulsion is to be used, and why not make it voluntary&#151;but we increasingly realised that compulsion was necessary. However, the two cases cannot be compared because until the age of 16 a child is the responsibility of his parents and a minimum educational requirement is a must. After the age of 16, the game begins to change. Individuals become responsible for their own behaviour. We therefore need to ask whether their autonomy is being respected and whether they are being persuaded to engage in education.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="080610114000061"></a>I have no difficulty with the argument about compulsion; my difficulty is with the balance between compulsion and persuasion or compulsion and incentives. My suspicion is that the Bill is a little too punitive and tends to rely a little too heavily on compulsion. That causes four difficulties. First, how can we guarantee that pupils between the ages of 16 and 18 will stay on? All the polls that the Government have referred to show that young people are not terribly happy about this. How are we going to compel them and how much punitive action can we take to make sure that they stay on? Secondly, if they do stay on, what guarantee is there that they will acquire the level 3 qualifications that we want them to acquire? They may get two or more NVQs, or something like that, but they have little market value. Thirdly, if they are alienated from the system, they could be a disruptive presence in the school and prevent others acquiring the desired qualifications. Fourthly, as many noble Lords have pointed out, young people tend to find work in small firms, which often find it economically unviable to give time off for training and cover absences. We can put pressure on them, as the noble Lord, Lord Layard, said, we can ask them to take the responsibility, but beyond a certain point, compulsion has its limits. If employers are not prepared to hire people aged between 16 and 18, what do we do?</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="080610114000062"></a>I suspect that even if the Bill were to be implemented and enforced in its current form, it will not achieve its objectives. The important thing is to look for a more nuanced strategy with a better balance between incentives and compulsion. I shall suggest three or four ideas that the Government might wish to explore. If we were to ask why people do not stay on beyond the age of 16, we would find that there are four major reasons: they are bored with formal education; they find the curriculum irrelevant to their needs and interests; they need to earn money to help maintain their families or themselves; or they come from families where education beyond 16, or even 14, is not highly valued. If we are concerned to increase the school leaving age, we need to address these underlying factors. My idea for a nuanced strategy is to show how we might be able to address these underlying causes of pupils not staying on beyond the age of 16.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_543"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 543</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="080610114000063"></a>I shall suggest four ways. First, we must find ways of making education attractive. A flexible curriculum might be one way, and a less intimidating formal environment might be another. Better advice and guidance from teachers and personal mentoring might be helpful, and if people do not stay on after the age of 16, we need to make sure that education is as personalised as possible, taking into account the needs and interests of those whom we want to persuade to stay on.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080610114000064"></a>Secondly, alienation from education generally starts pretty early, long before pupils reach the age of 16. We need to find ways of making formal education until the age of 16 more attractive. That requires planting some love of learning&#151;not that one is likely to be really successful, but one hopes&#151;and, more importantly, giving them some competence so that they do not find education a drag and a source of low self-esteem.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="080610114000065"></a>Thirdly, since formal schooling does not suit everyone, we may need to involve youth and community-based projects, which are often less threatening or intimidating and tend to be better prepared to provide quality learning. We might also involve other agencies that have a better rapport with the young and can motivate them. For example, the trade unions might be able to play an important part.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="080610114000066"></a>Fourthly, but no less importantly, we need to look at the EMA. The maximum amount offered is &#163;30, depending on the circumstances of the parents. That may not be enough to compensate those with adverse family circumstances. It is worth noting that the proportion of 16 and 17 year-olds who are not in education or training but who have jobs has been going down steadily since 2001. That statistic shows the importance of the financial incentive. This is particularly relevant in relation to ethic minorities, about whom virtually nothing has been said so far. It is unfortunate that we do not have reliable statistics on which ethnic minorities tend to participate in education beyond the age of 16 and why others do not. The little research that I have done shows that the reasons why many of them do not stay on beyond the age of 16 are the fear of unemployment and a lack of resources. That was not so until the mid-1990s. Until then the statistics always showed that ethnic minorities, unlike the indigenous community, tended to stay on in school, not only until the age of 16 but even beyond. For the past 10 or 12 years, the trend has reversed, and we might need to ask why.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="080610114000067"></a>We might also explore the possibility of encouraging colleges to create and award their own qualifications in the same way that the universities do. They can create specialist products to suit employers with whom they can be encouraged to work closely. The Bill points in that direction, but we need to go a little further. If we are going to go in that direction, colleges need to be better funded. It might not be a bad idea for colleges, in order to produce specialised products, to work closely with trade unions, which generally have a better rapport with, and understanding of the requirements of, 17 and 18 year-olds in jobs.</p>

However, I shall read all the speeches with great interest. I am now in the dreadful and dreaded spot where most things of note have been said, so I shall confine my remarks to a few brief instances relating mainly to vulnerable young people, who were noted by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080610114000069"></a>During the debates on the Children and Young Persons Bill earlier this year, this House did a wonderful job of collaborating across parties to make a significant difference to that Bill and change it for the benefit of children. On this Bill, there is unfinished business from another place, and I look forward to improving it during our deliberations.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080610114000070"></a>I welcome the Bill and the intention to have all young people engaged with learning and staying on in education or training until the age of 18. I entirely support the remarks made by my noble friend Lady Blackstone. Participation in some form of education and training should be the norm. There need to be safeguards and support, but too many of our young people lack aspiration, which is fundamental to achievement and to accessing the five outcomes of the Every Child Matters agenda. I mention that agenda because I believe that government policy should hang together and that this Bill is part of a scenario of laws, reports and so on that apply to children, including the recent Children&#146;s Plan.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080610114000071"></a>Earlier this week, the four Children&#146;s Commissioners in the UK published their joint report, which made many valid points. In the context section at the beginning of that report, it is worth noting that there are good things about being a child in the UK. In England, for example, children are described as increasingly well educated, with the majority ambitious and engaged, motivated and making a positive contribution. That is good news: those young people will, no doubt, make full use of the 14 to 19 reforms that promise different types of provision to suit different needs and interests, including apprenticeships and diplomas. The Minister has described those offerings and I will not repeat them. However, the commissioners also expressed concern, at least for England, at</p>
<ul><a name="080610114000086"></a>&#147;the application of punitive measures to those children not engaging in education and training&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080610114000082"></a>I, too, shall express that concern today.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080610114000072"></a>The Institute for Public Policy Research recently published a report on youth justice, suggesting that the more affluent young people in society are involved in extracurricular activities while those less advantaged are spending their time unsupervised on the streets. I understand that a new Bill, referred to in the draft legislative programme, will address the educational needs of those in custody, but there are other vulnerable young people. My first plea, then, is for strong and co-ordinated programmes of social skill development. Social skills are often the prerequisite for any participation in other education. Some young people do not achieve because they are too angry, depressed and unsupported to allow themselves to do so. That is why I believe personal, social and health education to be so vital at all levels of education. I have seen it work miracles in schools; we must apply programmes of PSHE in all settings. I would be surprised if the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has not already had her say about that, and I wish that I had been here to hear it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080610114000073"></a>The CBI, in its useful briefing on the Bill, discusses the importance of literacy and numeracy skills. It points out that 50 per cent of employers are dissatisfied with school leavers&#146; literacy and numeracy. Earlier this week, I was in a young offender institution where literacy and numeracy skills have improved dramatically in accordance with many programmes. It has intensive educational programmes, and support and personal skill development programmes to back up the education inputs. Young people lacking such skills cannot take advantage of education, so I hope that a good deal of preparation will go into making sure that support systems are operating well in advance of the changes proposed in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080610114000074"></a>I also hope that diversity of provision will be in place. In 2006, more than one-fifth of 16 to 18 year-olds in England were not in education or training, including one in 10 who were not in education, employment or training. That is simply not helpful to young people, or to society. We need work-based learning, alternative provision such as entry to employment and foundation learning tier programmes, and provision for young people with special educational needs. As the National Children&#146;s Bureau points out, the new compulsory system must have choice and be responsive to the individual circumstances and needs of vulnerable groups in order to avoid serious setback. The NCB also echoes my plea to have pastoral and personal support systems available to young people in educational establishments or the workplace.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080610114000075"></a>I know that Barnardo&#146;s has consulted young people about alternative education and training services. A clear message from that consultation was that choosing to participate was crucial to motivation and achievement. I believe that choice is possible, and has to be made possible, within a compulsory system but, as my noble friend Lord Parekh just said, choices have to be made attractive. Barnardo&#146;s accepts the need for an enforcement process, but is seeking safeguards to ensure that the level of the penalty notice is set at an amount that reflects the level of financial support available to the poorest young people, that advocacy is available to enable the voice of the young person to be heard at an attendance panel at every stage in the process, and that young people who fail to participate are not left with a criminal record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080610114000076"></a>Barnardo&#146;s and others will be seeking to establish learning contracts to support young people who are disaffected and disengaged, to get them back into education and training. Those learning contracts are already used in several Barnardo&#146;s services and are being piloted as activity agreements by the Government. Such contracts set out the responsibilities of each party including the young person&#146;s support needs, their expectations and learning goals and the role of the LEA, the parent and provider or the employer.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="080610114000077"></a>Young people, especially disaffected young people, will be much more likely to engage with systems if they feel involved. They also gain in communication skills and confidence by being involved. Young people who have lacked support, or who have poor communication skills, are disadvantaged in many ways. They need structure and a relationship with a sympathetic adult to become involved in learning. By engaging

Additional support is also necessary for young people coming out of custody in order to engage them in education or training, and learning support contracts could certainly benefit that group.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="080610114000078"></a>I welcome the Bill. Too many young people from disadvantaged backgrounds do not engage in education, which perpetuates the cycle of deprivation. A diversity of choice could improve aspiration. What, then, about these vulnerable groups? Will support for their engagement be built into new systems? What about personal support, such as counselling, advocacy and personal, social and health education? What about learning contracts to encourage participation and commitment? I look forward to my noble friend&#146;s replies, and to the future stages of this Bill.</p>

<a name="080610117000001"></a><a name="80610-0011.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80610-0011.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080610117000068"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, remarked in his introduction, this is landmark legislation. As the noble Lord, Lord Layard, and the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, have reminded us, it goes back not only to 1918, as the Minister mentioned, but to the aspirations that the Acts of 1944 and 1959 renewed. Indeed, it has taken us almost a century to fulfil the ambitions of that 1918 Act.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="080610117000002"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, remarked that what was notable in this Second Reading was the number of people who had spoken without actually discussing issues that the Bill addresses. That was right, but it can nevertheless be explained: the Minister rightly introduced this as part of a package of much wider education reforms being introduced by this Government, and aimed at improving the UK&#146;s overall educational performance. That is necessary if we are to compete in the global marketplace, an issue picked up and discussed at length in the report by the noble Lord, Lord Leitch.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080610117000003"></a>Much has been made of our 24th position, out of 29, in the OECD league tables but if those tables are looked at it will be seen that our failure is, above all, in the intermediate and lower ends of the spectrum. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, picked up that point. We have far too few young people acquiring the intermediate technician grade of NVQ level 2 and 3 skills, and far too many with no qualifications at all. As the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, said, if we are to acquire the requisite 40 per cent of the adult population with level 4 qualifications, they need to start by at least acquiring levels 2 and 3. That is the gap that the Bill aims to fill by either keeping young people in full-time education or training until they are at least 18 or making sure that they are in a job where they are receiving training that leads to some sort of qualification.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="080610117000004"></a>In doing so, it encourages those with lower level qualifications to stay on and seek better qualifications and puts particular emphasis on the 22 per cent of the cohort&#151;120,000 a year&#151;who are currently leaving school at age 16 and do not proceed to any further qualifications, and especially on the 10 per cent, 60,000 a year, who come into the NEET, not in education  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_547"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 547</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employment or training, category, most of whom have effectively dropped out of school when they were 14 or 15, have no qualifications to speak of, drift in and out of employment and are highly vulnerable to drink, drugs and criminality.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="080610117000005"></a>How is the Bill aimed to cope with those aspirations? It does so by making it a duty on all young people to stay in education or engage in work with training opportunities, in the hope that, although some will resist, the majority, recognising that there is no choice, will comply with the law and settle for staying in school, going on to college, getting an apprenticeship or finding a job which offers the requisite amount of training. It is to be made compulsory but, as with the ban on smoking, the hope is that most people will just fall in with compulsion without fuss.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="080610117000006"></a>Secondly, the Bill&#151;well, not the Bill, but part of a whole package of reforms about which we have talked at some length&#151;is about reforming the curriculum. It is widely acknowledged that for many young people&#151;roughly 50 per cent of young people in schools&#151;the GCSE/A-level secondary school curriculum has been too academic and a turn off. The aim of the new diplomas is to introduce a new curriculum that is practical and relevant, with opportunities to study subjects allied to the world of work.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="080610117000007"></a>Side by side with that is the reform of apprenticeships&#151;again, not strictly part of this Bill but part of a Bill that we will be seeing next year, alluded to by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton&#151;with an increasing number and range of apprenticeships, so that there are plenty of apprenticeships for young people who wish to leave school and do their learning and earning side-by-side. Indeed, post-2013, there will be an entitlement to apprenticeship for all who want it.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="080610117000008"></a>Lastly, the aim is to revamp careers guidance to provide better and more comprehensive information, advice and guidance for the general run of students in schools and colleges, especially for those 12 to 13 year- olds who have both complex choices to make between GCSEs, A-levels, diplomas and apprenticeships and to extend the mentoring, advice and placement services already provided by Connexions for the NEET group, responsibility for which is now to be handed over to local authorities.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="080610117000009"></a>It has been made clear in the debate that we on these Benches are not alone in sharing the Government's aspirations but having some doubts as to whether this package will work. Our reservations come in several forms. First, we are a little worried that the cart has been put before the horse. The key issue mentioned by a large number of people is that of motivating young people and the reform of the secondary school curriculum.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080610117000010"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, mentioned, we want these young people to commit themselves to, in the words of the noble Baroness, lifelong learning. We need to keep our fingers crossed that the diplomas will do that job. They remain something of an unknown quantity. We also have to keep our fingers crossed that they will prove popular with young people.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_548"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 548</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080610117000011"></a>I have been very surprised to learn that the hair and beauty diploma, due to be rolled out for a local consortium at Guildford College in September 2009, has no practical hairdressing for the first two years. Last week's <I>Times Educational Supplement</I> highlighted the lack of relevant practical work experience required by many diplomas. We have to hold our judgment on these things; there will inevitably be teething troubles with the diplomas during the next five years. It is crucial that in 2013, when the Bill comes into operation, which is, as my noble friend Lady Walmsley mentioned, when the diplomas are due to be up and running, the two things can coincide well together. We would have preferred to see the new diplomas successfully introduced before making the commitment to raising the learning participation age, but I understand the argument of those who say that unless you commit yourself, you do not get there.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="080610117000012"></a>Personally, I share the view of the noble Lords, Lord Pilkington, Lord Lucas and Lord Dearing: if we are going to make diplomas work, there is a lot to be said for having specialist institutions. Trying to move young people around from one institution to another to take little bit of the diploma here and there does not work. They need specialist equipment and we need to give them the high regard that there is in the technical high schools in Germany. I hope that some of the experiments that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, spoke about, will go forward.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="080610117000013"></a>Secondly, there has been the issue of compulsion; we have had a great deal of discussion about that. I think that we are all agreed that we do not want those who truant from school acquiring criminal records but, given the way that those young people flout the law at 15, why should we expect them to comply with it at 16 and 17? What will happen if they do so? We pressed the Bill team on the matter when we met them the other day and they told us that each individual would be assigned a personal mentor through the Connexions service, as they already have been, who would work with them one-to-one to ensure that they were helped and supported in finding a solution that fitted their circumstances.</p>

<a name="80610-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="080610117000014"></a>The evidence is clear. If you have the resources, working intensively with that group can work. I shall read two pieces of evidence given by the Prince&#146;s Trust in the early phases of discussion in Committee in the other place, when they had the evidence sessions. Martina Milburn, from the Prince's Trust said that,</p>
<ul><a name="080610117000063"></a>&#147;some of these people are not going to be turned around in a few months&#151;it takes years. The Prince's Trust team programme has a 12-week personal development programme, which takes only unemployed young people and the NEET group ... with the right intervention and the right programmes&#151;the Trust certainly is not the only one doing it&#151;you can make a significant difference. Of the 40,000 people in our groups last year, 78 per cent. went into education, training or employment, which I think is phenomenal, given the backgrounds that most of them were from. It is not easy; it is not cheap; and it requires a lot of people doing a lot of the right things&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="080610117000062"></a>It is clear from that that it is vital to recognise that not all learning will lead to accredited qualifications. The evidence from Barnardo's and the Prince&#146;s Trust is that, given the chaotic lives of some of those young people, it is a matter, first, of learning how to learn, before they are really ready to go on courses that lead  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_549"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 549</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to qualifications. There needs to be some flexibility in the system, a point picked up on by several noble Lords. It is also necessary to recognise the high level of special educational needs among those groups. That in turn raises the question of whether the necessary specialist help is available, and for how long it will be needed.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="080610117000015"></a>Again, the evidence from the Prince&#146;s Trust made clear the difficulties that apply here. It talks about a pilot programme on which it had a team of 15 people working. It said that,</p>
<ul><a name="080610117000064"></a>&#147;at least a third of the young people on something like the team programme have a recognised mental health issue and at least one, if not two, on each programme&#151;each will take only 15 young people&#151;have such an acute mental health issue that they need key intervention ... They have gone off the programme, had treatment and come back six or nine months later to a similar programme. That is all before they could think about sitting down and starting a pre-apprenticeship programme. You are looking at that kind of need with some of the young people who we work with&#148;. .&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Education and Skills Public Bill Committee, 22/01/08; col. 17-18.]</ul>
<a name="80610-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="080610117000016"></a>We have to recognise this. It raises the question of whether local authorities, which will have this responsibility, will be able to meet these needs, especially if they are required to go on providing support for those young people until they are 25. Given the failures of the children&#146;s and adolescent health services and the incredible shortage of educational psychologists which appeared when we were debating the Children and Young Person&#146;s Act, one really has very great doubts as to whether local authorities have the capability of providing the mentoring and key support services that are going to be required if we are to turn these young people around. It can be done. The Prince&#146;s Trust shows that it can be done, but it needs an enormous amount of resources.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="080610117000017"></a>I must move on. I should like to mention two further issues. The first is work-based learning and apprenticeships. In many respects apprenticeships are the ideal training route for these young people, as was emphasised in the excellent report by the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs. Although companies such as Rolls-Royce still keep this route open, they have become the exception rather than the rule. The Leitch report adopted by the Government aims to reverse these trends and put industry in the driving seat with a target of 500,000 apprenticeship places by 2020. However, I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Layard, that it is not by any means clear where these apprenticeship places are necessarily going to come from. There are a large number of firms that are somewhat unhappy about the training requirements of these Bills. Again, I refer to the report produced by Professor Alison Wolf, which indicates that there is a danger that compulsion will drive away the very training opportunities available to those who, fed up with school at 16, leave to take on a job which does not having any training. Nevertheless, they learn a lot in these jobs and it is these jobs which will disappear completely and go to the over-18s and very often to foreign workers prepared to take the relatively low wages. It is very important that the national apprenticeship programme should be up and running as quickly as possible and that there are enough of  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_550"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 550</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them. At the moment there is a great dearth of apprenticeships and many colleges have great difficulty in finding places.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="080610117000018"></a>Finally, I should like to say something about careers guidance. We have all recognised that, with the complex choices that have to be made, careers guidance is absolutely vital. We talked about the Connexions service and the mentoring of the NEET programme but careers guidance to our young people in schools, who are making choices at the age of 12 and 13 between apprenticeships, diplomas and GCSEs or A-level, is absolutely vital. Yet, because of the degree to which the Connexion service has shifted from providing careers guidance to the mentoring service, we have reached a situation in which the careers guidance service has effectively collapsed. We have, more or less, to establish it from scratch.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="080610117000019"></a>I was very surprised to see that only &#163;38 million has been assigned in the impact statement for the development of careers guidance services. That is, roughly speaking, &#163;10,000 per secondary school, which is remarkably little if we want to create a proper careers guidance service for these young people with the impartial advice required by Clause 66. We are going to have to develop this. The Government have rejected advice from various groups that we should have an all-age careers advice and guidance service. Information about careers is increasingly available on the internet and the sort of service that has been provided by Learn Direct can be expanded. One would expect to see, particularly for these young people, the development of a fairly creative web-based service. As well as the information, you need very clear advice and guidance and it is not available at the moment. We are going to have to create it and train these people and it is not at all clear where all the resources are going to come from.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080610117000020"></a>I must finish now. I am sorry to have gone on for quite so long. It is clear that this is a very important Bill. Its aims and aspirations are admirable and, as has become very clear in this debate, in one way or another we all share its hopes and ambitions. However, it is clear that the devil is in the detail and I foresee many long days and evenings when we shall be debating our way through these labyrinths.</p>

Of course we all want our young people to stay on in education and training until at least the age of 18. I start by referring to my noble friend Lord Elton&#146;s speech. Why do we look for complex, one-size-fits-all solutions? Encouraging young people by participation, regardless of what that activity might be, will get those young people involved. We will discuss many of the things that my noble friend spoke of in greater detail at later stages. I go back to the concerns that my noble friend Lady Morris highlighted. I emphasise again what an opportunity we have with this Bill. However, that will require hard work on our part and a willingness to listen on the part of the Government for us to make the Bill as sure in its outcome as it is desirable in its goals. Our aim must be, above all, to use the chance  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_551"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 551</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>afforded to us now to ensure that we equip young people in this country with the necessary education and skills for a fulfilling long-term future.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="080610117000022"></a>As my noble friend Lord Pilkington of Oxenford, with his huge wealth of experience and knowledge, said, we must ensure that there is no single, dogmatic approach. Young people are different, with different abilities. My noble friend Lady Morris and others on all sides of the House, whose experience and expertise in these matters is highly regarded by us all, raised the troubling issue of compulsion. It must be clear to the Government now that there will be serious debate in the coming stages as we examine the best way of achieving the aims of this Bill. Other noble Lords have spoken forcefully on this issue. It is not just a matter of ideology, although I am not alone in being concerned about another authoritarian measure being imposed by this Government; it is a matter of practicalities.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="080610117000023"></a>How will the Government enforce the duty to engage in continued training or education up to the age of 18? What benefit will be gained from criminalising the young people whom our schools have let down? How will fines be collected from young people with no means to pay? What happens in the justice process when the young person facing sanctions turns 18? The tenets of the Bill will no longer apply, but the young person will still face criminal penalties. Despite the Government&#146;s assurances, could people end up in prison because of this Bill?</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="080610117000024"></a>The Minister&#146;s argument on compulsion does not stack up. Tens of thousands of young people are already in compulsory education but they do not participate. How will parents be expected to ensure that their 16 and 17 year-old children comply with the Bill? I have spoken to young people about this. They told me that, if they see that there is a point to their programme, they will take part but that, if they are told by their parents, teachers or the state that they have to participate, they will most likely turn around and do the opposite. That is simply the nature of teenagers. It is unrealistic to expect parents to rein in or change the behaviour of 16 or 17 year-olds who have decided to opt out of education and training unless, as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, argued, there is a real change of culture, attitude and approach so that young people and those who shape their thought processes change their outlook on education and training.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="080610117000025"></a>There will be teenagers from some communities, as the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, said, for whom participating beyond 16 will be difficult. This is particularly true of girls from certain communities. I know of many families in which girls going on to further education beyond 16 is a complete no-no. The Government will have to show us that they have thought through all these measures and that the measures will be workable. To make them workable, we will need to see that the training and education on offer is appropriate, necessary to future employment and flexible enough to respond to the needs both of young people and of employers.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="080610117000026"></a>My noble friend Lord Lucas is right: this is a centralised Bill that glosses over the real symptoms of young people&#146;s disengagement. The Government can argue for compulsion only if, in return, we offer people  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_552"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 552</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provision that will enable them to learn skills that will genuinely make them more employable. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, set out forcefully through his four points the challenges that we face and the need to move away from the concept of compulsion and to concentrate far more on young people being motivated to engage and to learn. We must also, of course, consider how new ideas can engage young people.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="080610117000027"></a>We have spoken to representatives of colleges, small businesses and industry, as well as to groups that work with young people, many of whom are disadvantaged. They have all expressed concern. One of the most alarming things mentioned was the fear that these new provisions will simply encourage employers not to take on 16 or 17 year-olds. I have personal experience of running a small business and I know that one of the biggest obstacles is red tape. We do not want to add to the new duties on employers, who will have to know the guidance to the Bill inside out to ensure that they are not falling foul of the rules. They will have to spend time working out complicated rotas to allow time off for their employees to attend colleges or training courses. None of this will be easy and it could incentivise employers to look elsewhere for their staff. We should not glibly dismiss the worries of the very businesses on which we will rely to employ our newly educated workforce. We must be sure that the new regime is as flexible for employers as we can make it, or we run the risk of undermining our own good intentions from the start.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="080610117000028"></a>The courses that are to be offered must be useful. They must be practical and deliverable. The Government assure us that they are tying in the provision of courses with the overarching responsibilities of local authorities, although, as others have pointed out, it will take the next education Bill as well as this one to achieve it. We will ask the Minister to show that these plans, too, are fully thought out. What of the young person who moves from one local authority area to another? Who will keep track of him or her? It is naive to expect young people to live their lives neatly within the lines drawn on a civil servant&#146;s map. If information is to be shared around to help to keep track of all these individuals, we must ensure that there are appropriate safeguards on that information sharing. The Bill appears to take a somewhat careless approach to the protection of personal and sensitive information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="080610117000029"></a>My noble friend Lady Morris talked about the gender disparity in apprenticeships. We must avoid entrenching poverty among the most vulnerable young women by shoehorning them into limiting apprenticeships and training. Many people, in your Lordships&#146; House today and outside, have emphasised the great importance of providing good, impartial and constructive careers advice, so that all young people are aware of their options and can realise their potential. This ties in with another point that has been made: planning what happens to 16 to 18 year-olds is important, but just as important, if not more so, is what happens to children before they reach that age. The education, support and advice that they receive up to the age of 14 will have a huge impact on their future prospects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="080610117000030"></a>Our children must have the very best start in life. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans spoke of the importance of well-being and happiness.  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_553"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 553</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Those are indeed important factors, which have an impact on how young people react to learning, but they cannot be acquired through a paper qualification. Our children must be numerate and literate, or they will lose out on many opportunities. As my noble friend Lady Morris said, we must be mindful of the distressingly high number of young people who suffer from mental health problems and we must be sure that we make adequate provision for them, or they will continue to be failed by the education system. We on these Benches believe that lifelong learning and acquiring new qualifications, either to help with better employment prospects or for general well-being, are excellent and admirable goals. This is why we have deep concerns about the Government&#146;s policies on equivalent-level qualifications. We will return to this matter.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="080610117000031"></a>My noble friend Lady Morris spoke of our concern about Part 4, which will transfer the regulation and registration of independent schools from the DCSF to Ofsted. Our independent schools are recognised by the OECD as the best schools in the world. At a time when they are forging closer links with other sectors, it is unfortunate that their very good working relationship with the DCSF will be disrupted. I hope that the Minister will recognise the strength of feeling on the opposition Benches about this issue and about the proposed changes to the Section 347 schools.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="080610117000032"></a>As my noble friend Lady Morris said, during our consideration of the Bill we will return to the issue of compulsion, to the concerns surrounding some of our most vulnerable young people, to the unnecessary changes to independent education and to proper scrutiny of the revisions to the admissions code. We shall also seek to add new clauses on the establishment of new schools other than community schools, on restrictions on special school closures and on the teaching and recognition of IGCSEs and the teaching of science, about which the CBI employers&#146; survey showed that there was still a great deal of concern. We shall also seek to add a new clause to ensure that those with special needs are properly helped.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="080610117000033"></a>The Bill should be a wonderful opportunity for us to develop an education and training system that benefits young people, the employers who are desperate for a skilled, well trained and educated workforce and, above all, the country as a whole.</p>

I have found it incredibly stimulating and very interesting, and I very much look forward to the future stages of the Bill. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, who suggested that the Bill addresses a fundamental and perhaps almost moral and social need to respond to the needs of the most disadvantaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="080610117000035"></a>In winding up for the Government, I will try to address the main points made by noble Lords. However, there is a strong chance that I will not have time to address all the detailed points that have been made, so my noble friend and I undertake to write to all those who have taken part in this Second Reading. We can  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_554"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 554</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>then begin the process of the Bill as we mean to continue it, sharing information and answering points as fully and in as timely a fashion as possible.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="080610117000036"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Blackstone for her warm welcome. I particularly note her call and that of others to be bold about adult education, perhaps more radical, and more aspirational. This is a joint Bill between the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. I hope that we can be bold and will convince noble Lords that we are taking the ambitious measures that they would like to see. We have a shared goal to improve education outcomes for all, at whatever age. Raising the participation age, together with the age 0 to 19 reforms set out in the Children&#146;s Plan, will ensure that the future workforce will be more skilled than ever.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="080610117000037"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, that we face an urgent task now. As we have heard, of the 2020 workforce, 74 per cent have already left education, many of whom still lack the skills for success in life that they so badly need. We have made real progress in improving the skill levels of the UK&#146;s adult population. Since the Skills for Life strategy was launched, 4.7 million adult learners have taken up 10.5 million skills for life learning opportunities, with more than 1.76 million adults gaining a first qualification since 2001, and 1.34 million adults have up-skilled to level 2 since 2002, thus meeting the department&#146;s interim target of 1 million by 2006.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="080610117000038"></a>However, in taking up the gauntlet laid down by my noble friend Lord Leitch, we have set ourselves a challenging ambition, which is not to remain in the middling rank of nations for skills, below our European and our global competitors, but to have world-class skills by 2020. Our progress to date is laudable, but it is not enough and we are in no way complacent. For the first time, the Bill will give adults the right to free provision for basic literacy and numeracy qualifications. As many noble Lords have highlighted, these are the skills required to function in everyday life. As we have heard from my noble friend Lord Adonis, individuals with level 2 qualifications are proven to have better employment prospects and improved life chances. This Bill will give everyone the chance to gain skills that are a platform for employability.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="080610117000039"></a>If we compare ourselves with other countries, up-to-the-age-of-16 participation and achievement rates are good. But as individuals get older other countries begin to catch up and to overtake the UK, which is particularly evident when people are in their early 20s. Currently, the UK stands still while young adults across Europe improve their skills and gain level 3 qualifications. To address that, the Bill gives 19 to 25 year-olds a right to free tuition for their first full level 3 qualification, which is equivalent to two A-levels. I hear what noble Lords are saying, but I am delighted that we are making this commitment. The duties will ensure that the Learning and Skills Council, providers and everyone in the system are focussed on meeting individuals&#146; needs.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="080610117000040"></a>As with the raising of the participation age, I am clear that legislation is not a panacea. It is a chance to see the culture change we need, to which many noble Lords have referred. Legislation will not win the battle  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_555"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 555</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>alone. As my noble friend Lady Morris pointed out, much of what needs to be done is not in legislation. The signal sent by the legislation will be disseminated to potential learners through our marketing campaigns, which are proving hugely successful in winning interest, and hearts and minds on this story. Once we have the attention of learners, they need to be supported into learning. As the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, said, continuing in education post-16, including vocational education, should command much more respect. This Government are committed to making that happen.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="080610117000041"></a>Skills accounts will provide individuals with a virtual voucher of state funding to purchase learning at a quality assured provider of their choice, which is new and very important. They will also offer a route to further support through a new adult careers and advancement service to be fully operational across England from 2010-11. Together, with the continuing growth of Train to Gain, we will see a radically different model of organisation in the skills system where the role of Government is to ensure that learners and employers are empowered, well informed and well supported, so that demand can lead supply.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="080610117000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Layard, and others suggested that apprenticeships possibly would be the single biggest step to achieving the aspirations of this Bill. The Government entirely agree with noble Lords that apprenticeships should be a choice route for young people and adults. We have committed to providing an apprenticeship to all suitably qualified young people by 2013. The Bill signals our intention by placing an explicit duty on the Learning and Skills Council to secure apprenticeships, alongside other further education courses. I am delighted at the profile that apprenticeships have received in this debate.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="080610117000043"></a>Earlier this year, we set out our detailed proposals to ratchet up the quality and quantity of apprenticeships, an area where we have a very strong record. Later in this Session we will publish a draft apprenticeship Bill. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, will be reassured by the emphasis, interest and investment that the Government are making. Noble Lords will see that this Bill is merely a first legislative step on our way to world class skills in 2020, which I believe will meet the ambitions set out by many noble Lords today.</p>

<a name="80610-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="080610117000044"></a>I want to pick up on some of the concerns highlighted today. The noble Baronesses, Lady Morris of Bolton and Lady Walmsley, and others mentioned concerns regarding the changes to the inspection and registration regime for independent schools. The Government are committed to reducing bureaucracy. The transfer of the registration and regulation of independent educational institutions to Ofsted will not only release efficiencies in the public sector, but reduce the burdens. Here, we are particularly talking about reducing burdens on smaller independent schools, which will have to deal with only one regulatory body. Overall, 2,019 out of 2,359 independent schools will see a reduction in bureaucracy. The remaining schools will see no increase in burden, so will not be disadvantaged. It is far from the case that we want to cause any concern or disaffection to any independent school. We want to reassure them that we are taking very seriously their concerns about how the process is taken forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="080610117000045"></a>I should like to reassure the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans that nothing about the right of faith schools to have faith criteria will be able to be changed by the move of the duty to consult from primary legislation to regulations that he was so concerned about. The right reverend Prelate also highlighted the importance of ensuring that our education system properly prepares young people for adult life. I hear his comments, which we take very seriously. The non-statutory framework we are developing to meet spiritual, moral, social and cultural needs will involve working with key sector stakeholders to make clear the importance of this aspect of education, to highlight good practice and to make support available. We are also involving Ofsted so that it can consider how to reflect this work through the inspection process. We do not have any plans to introduce a duty to promote spiritual, moral, social and cultural development in FE. We believe that it is right to leave it to each institution to determine how best to meet student needs.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="080610117000046"></a>Many noble Lords raised questions and concerns about the careers advisory service for young people. Good quality information, advice and guidance is essential for ensuring that young people are able to make the right choices about the options available, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, rightly stressed towards the end of her remarks. Careers advice is a central part of the Connexions service and of schools&#146; duties, and will remain so. We are working to improve quality, and as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, suggested, it means addressing quality and taking seriously concerns about gender stereotyping, and I do not just mean in terms of careers advice in schools.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="080610117000047"></a>We need also to act on the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Low, in developing the apprenticeship matching service. A lot of work is going on to make sure that apprenticeships are not perceived as conforming to stereotypical sex roles. It is a difficult challenge, but exploratory work is going on to develop what might be called non-traditional apprenticeships. Many young people also have issues in their personal lives that can be barriers to effective participation in education or training. Integrated support co-ordinated by local authorities and drawing on the expertise of professionals can help them to address these.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="080610117000048"></a>Many noble Lords spoke eloquently about the needs of specific groups of young people. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, directed his remarks to the needs of looked-after and foster children. I assure him that my noble friend Lord Adonis has agreed to discuss the review he referred to once it is finished to see how his concerns can be taken forward. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, asked specifically whether we had taken into account Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I can confirm that we have, and noble Lords who have joined in the debate may wish to see the letter written by my honourable friend Jim Knight to the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I shall make it available to all noble Lords. Thinking further about the needs of vulnerable groups, we believe that all young people stand to benefit from participation in education and training until they are 18 and we do not believe that any specific groups should be treated differently from the outset as this would risk them being given a second-class offer.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="080610117000049"></a>However, we know that young people&#146;s lives do not run along the lines designed by civil servants, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, observed, and in some cases it may be difficult or even impossible for a young person to participate. Flexibility is built into the system so that cases can be judged individually and appropriate allowances can be made. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said that that was an important point.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="080610117000050"></a>My noble friend Lady Massey highlighted her concern that the Every Child Matters agenda should be fully understood and taken into account. She drew attention to the need for safeguards and personal support. The focus will be on the need to provide help and support, and first to address barriers by tailoring programmes to aid the progress of young people back into learning in a way that is right for them. Local authorities will provide targeted youth support&#151;those words are written in capital letters&#151;to help young people address barriers to learning. A flexible set of learning options will be available, including the type of informal learning courses provided by the voluntary sector to help young people participate in ways that fit around their specific needs. A series of safeguards are built into the system. For example, the Bill requires local authorities to take all reasonable steps to ensure that relevant support is offered to a young person, and we all understand the importance of the words &#147;reasonable steps&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="080610117000058"></a>I want to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Low, on his appointment to Skill, and to offer him some reassurances on the strategic questions he put to me. We believe strongly that the culture change we are expecting as a result of this legislation, which makes a commitment to have young people in education until the age of 18, will be a positive step forward for all young people, including those with disabilities. We welcome the support given, for example, by Barnardo&#146;s on the need for an enforcement process. We also want to give a reassurance that we will consult on the level of any penalty notice and ensure that the amount should reflect the financial support available to young people&#151;a point the noble Lord was concerned about. I am only picking up on one or two of his points, but when we raise the participation age, it is essential that we look at financial circumstances and ensure that they are not a barrier to participation. As my noble friend suggested earlier, we will be looking at EMAs and the financial support available to young people over the age of 16.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="080610117000059"></a>I am close to running out of time, but I want to address compulsion, which was a central issue of our debate. The noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley, Lady Sharp and Lady Verma, and the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, all expressed their concern that perhaps we are being too coercive. Of course we want as many young people as possible to continue their learning voluntarily. We believe that our current reforms can get us to 90 per cent of 17 year-olds participating by 2015&#151;up from 77 per cent now. This will still mean that some of our most marginalised young people will be left behind. This is unacceptable. Compulsion is a way to go further. The experience of other countries suggests that enforcement is necessary to make that requirement meaningful. My noble friend Lady Morris of Yardley spoke eloquently about the dilemmas about compulsion and highlighted the fact that, if we are talking about compulsion as a means of going the extra mile, we need to ensure that it works to best practical effect. I stress that enforcement is a last resort. The system is designed so that young people get the support they need first. If there is good reason why they are not participating, the enforcement process will not come into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="080610123000005"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Section 26A(3) of the Immigration Act 1971 introduced criminal offences relating to falsifying or amending registration cards issued in connection with asylum claims.

The offences currently apply to cards issued by the Secretary of State to a person in connection with a claim for asylum, but not to cards issued by the Secretary of State to a person in connection with a claim for support under Section 4. This support is intended to be limited and temporary, for people who are expected to leave the United Kingdom but are unable to do so through no fault of their own because of a temporary barrier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="080610123000007"></a>The UK Border Agency issues all asylum applicants and their dependants with an application registration card&#151;an ARC&#151;in connection with their asylum claim. The application registration card contains an applicant&#146;s personal details, including the name that they have given to the UK Border Agency and a photograph. The ARC serves a number of purposes. In particular, it is produced on reporting and when collecting asylum support at a post office. It is a valuable weapon against the fraudulent collection of support, ensuring that only those eligible receive it. In limited circumstances, failed asylum seekers and their dependants may be eligible for support, under Section 4(2) and 4(3) respectively, provided that they are destitute and meet the eligibility criteria.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="080610123000008"></a>Under Section 4(1), the Secretary of State can also support persons who have been temporarily admitted, released from detention or released on immigration bail. Currently, those applying for support under Section 4 may not have an ARC. The card may have been mislaid, or it may have been retained by an immigration official because the details on the card are no longer accurate or because misuse has been suspected. Furthermore, individuals applying for support under Section 4 may not have an ARC because the original asylum claim predated the issue of application registration cards. It is clear that, by not having a uniform photo ID check for identity confirmation on collection of support, the potential for abuse of the Section 4 support regime is increased. The use of an ARC will also support identity checks at reporting events for individuals at the end of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="080610123000010"></a>The UK Border Agency will arrange for ARCs to be issued to all those applying for, or currently in receipt of, support under Section 4 if they do not already have one. The power to issue a registration card is administrative and does not depend on this order. The order purely extends the definition of &#147;registration card&#148; so that the offences apply to cards issued by the Secretary of State to persons in connection with a claim for Section 4 support. It is important to ensure that the existing criminal offences extend to all ARCs. To do otherwise would create an unnecessary anomaly and possible opportunities for criminal activity. Extending the definition of &#147;registration card&#148; will enable criminal offences relating to abuse or misuse of registration cards to apply to any cards issued to a person in connection with a claim for asylum, and to cards issued to a person in connection with a claim for support under Section 4.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="080610123000011"></a>The offences include: making a false registration card; altering a registration card with intent to deceive; possessing a false or altered registration card without reasonable excuse; using or attempting to use a false registration card or an altered registration card with intent to deceive; making an article designed to be used in making false registration cards or in altering registration cards; and possessing such an article without reasonable excuse. The offences can be tried either in the Crown Court or magistrates&#146; court. They carry a maximum penalty of 10 years or a fine on indictment, or six months or a &#163;5,000 fine summarily, save for the possession offences, which carry a maximum penalty of two years on indictment. In 2006, the last year for which we have published data, there were 34 prosecutions for these offences, resulting in 21 convictions. This demonstrates the importance of these provisions in maintaining the integrity of the immigration system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="080610123000015"></a>I understand from the debate in the other place that there are about 300,000 asylum registration cards in issue, of which only about 11,000 apply to Section 4&#151;and 700 of those will have to be replaced. What has brought about the replacement of those 700 cards? The Minister says that there have been a limited number of prosecutions. Is it just because there have been a small number of prosecutions among the 300,000, or because those on Section 4 have been found to be fraudulently using the cards? As I read it, Section 4 is for failed asylum seekers; there is a limited number of

Can the Minister tell me why they are still in this country? He says that there are temporary barriers to their removal. What are they? Do they include difficulties in returning them to their country of origin because of persecution, or are the barriers more prosaic? Following that, what is the average time that somebody on Section 4 remains there? Are they ultimately deported, or is there some other outcome?</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="080610123000016"></a>I am seeking to understand a little more about Section 4. This is the first time since the 1971 Act that Section 26A has been amended at all; it has not been necessary to amend it for 38 years. Can the Minister tell us what has now brought this about, particularly when these orders will shortly be superseded by the UK Borders Act 2007 and secondary legislation arising from it? We have no particular objection to the order, but it would help our understanding to have a response to those questions.</p>

<a name="080610123000017"></a><a name="80610-0013.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80610-0013.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="080610123000072"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My Lords, I am feeling quite nostalgic for the many hours that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, and I have spent arguing with each other across the Floor of this House and the Moses Room on primary legislation. Although this order is not in quite the same league as most of the matters we have discussed, there are nevertheless one or two points on which, like the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, I would be grateful for some clarification.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="080610123000018"></a>Section 26A of the 1971 Act deals with the registration card issued in connection with a claim for asylum, but subsection (7) also provides that the definition of the card, and hence the purposes for which it can be used, can be amended by order. The Explanatory Memorandum says that this is the first time that that power has been used. The first question&#151;it may be fairly obvious, but I would be grateful for confirmation&#151;is whether the same card is to be used for both purposes now defined in the amended subsection 1(b). As I read it, there could be two separate registration cards: one to be used in connection with the claim for asylum, and the other in connection with a claim for Section 4 support. Presumably an individual will be given only one card, whether she is an asylum claimant, a claimant for Section 4 support, or both. Can the Minister confirm that?</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="080610123000019"></a>As the Explanatory Memorandum says, destitute asylum seekers, their dependants and most unsuccessful asylum seekers with dependent children under 18 are eligible for support under Section 95 of the 1999 Act. They are all issued with an ARC under the existing Section 26A. Those who apply for accommodation under Section 4 of that Act&#151;mainly people who have exhausted their claim to asylum but cannot be returned to their country of origin for the time being&#151;may not have an ARC, as the Minister explained, because their asylum application predated the 1999 Act, because the card was withdrawn because support was no longer required, because there was a potential for misuse, or because the holder had lost the card. It is estimated that 9,500 persons, not counting dependants, were getting Section 4 support in September 2007 and, of those, perhaps 500 currently have no ARC.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="080610123000020"></a>The BIA could issue ARCs to these 500 persons administratively, but the order is needed to activate the criminal offences in Section 26A(3) relating to fraudulent  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_562"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 562</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>production and use of an ARC in connection with a claim for Section 4 support. The Minister will no doubt say whether there is any reason to think that individuals have in fact been forging ARCs to get Section 4 support, or whether he can imagine situations where somebody who is not entitled to Section 4 support would go to the lengths of forging an ARC to access the very minimal assistance it provides. As an aside, where an ARC has been withdrawn because of potential misuse, are those individuals nevertheless now to be issued with a new ARC, irrespective of whether potential misuse is suspected?</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="080610123000021"></a>The people who qualify are in desperate need, and Refugee Action published an assessment in January this year of the problems they encountered. It found that between September and December 2007 its &#147;One Stop Service&#148; offices in the south-west, south central, north-west and east Midlands had 3,612 visits from asylum seekers who were looking for Section 4 support, and of those, 1,350 were assessed as being destitute.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="080610123000022"></a>The number of people eligible for Section 4 support increased dramatically in the early months of 2005 from 500 to 5,000, and now, according to the Explanatory Memorandum, it has almost doubled again. May we have an analysis from the Minister of the reasons for this increase, and how far it is accounted for by failed asylum seekers who cannot be sent back to their countries of origin? The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, mentioned the number of failed applicants. Could the Minister give us a breakdown of the numbers by country and in each case a summary of the reasons why those persons cannot be returned? According to the Public Accounts Committee in another place, there could be as many as 283,500 failed applicants in the UK, though most of them presumably would be returnable if the BIA could identify them and they had not put down roots which made it unreasonable for them to be returned.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="080610123000023"></a>The National Audit Office estimated that it would cost &#163;3.2 billion to remove these people, who mostly fled violent situations such as those in Zimbabwe, the DRC or Somalia, even though an immigration judge found that they did not meet the strict criteria of the 1951 convention. In practice it may be extremely difficult to remove people to countries where the Government are uncooperative or there is an internal conflict. Only five people were compulsorily sent back to Somalia in 2005, for instance, and presumably&#151;perhaps the Minister will confirm this&#151;nobody is being sent back to Zimbabwe when the country is on the verge of an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

<a name="80610-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="080610123000024"></a>While we have to give minimal support under Section 4 to a few thousand people in situations of this kind, there should be a systematic review periodically of the likelihood of ever being able to return them, and where the odds are against it, to give those people indefinite leave to remain so that the taxpayer can be relieved of the burden of supporting them and they can start contributing to the economy. Otherwise the taxpayer is saddled indefinitely with the steadily increasing numbers of beneficiaries. It would be good if the Minister could tell us what the latest figure is, perhaps at March 2008, to see what the rate of increase is since the figure of 9,500 given in the Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="080610123000025"></a>Whatever the figure is, there seems to be a deliberate policy of slowing down both the consideration of applications and the award of Section 4 support once it has been decided that a person is eligible We do not agree with the policy of forcing failed asylum seekers into destitution, but if the Government persist with that policy, they should at least ensure that the victims get the support to which they are legally entitled. The Refugee Action study to which I referred a moment ago showed that despite increased BIA staff, the average time taken to decide priority A applications&#151;that is, from people who were street homeless, pregnant or suffering from physical or mental health problems&#151;increased from 8.5 days in September 2006 to 9.6 days in July 2007. The average time for priority A cases to be accommodated increased over the same interval from 12 days to more than 20 days. In a judicial review application which was dismissed last December because the applicant had been accommodated before the hearing, the judge nevertheless said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="080610123000063"></a>&#147;It is incumbent on the Secretary of State to put in place a system which deals specifically with the problem&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610123000058"></a>of delay. The judge continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="080610123000064"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State, through her officials, must act properly and promptly. It is the duty of Government to ensure that happens&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610123000059"></a>What has the Secretary of State done to comply with that judgment, and will the Minister now request a weekly return from the BIA, to be placed in the Library, so that your Lordships can see what progress is being made?</p>

As always, they are very assiduous in these matters and take great care in framing their points and questions. The noble Baroness expressed support for the order, for which I am grateful. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, as ever, asked useful and valuable questions.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="080610123000027"></a>The order intends to ensure that the criminal offences contained in Section 26A(3) of the Immigration Act 1971, as amended, apply to failed asylum seekers supported under Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. As I said, these offences relate mainly to the falsifying or altering of registration cards and currently apply to asylum seekers supported under Section 95 of that Act.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="080610123000028"></a>I appreciate the views expressed particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, who is, as ever, very critical. The questions he asks are important. I turn first to the points that both noble Lords raised. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked what has brought about the order. We are trying to improve the level of compliance and achieve a technical alignment. In a sense we are trying to improve and simplify how the scheme works. The noble Baroness also asked what the barriers were to the removal of asylum seekers who may be assisted by this process and asked for statistics on the length of time they might be on support. I do not have statistics on the length of time they may be on support but I will ask the department to see what data we can find. I fully accept that it is important that we understand the quantum of the issue.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="080610123000029"></a>Barriers to removal can fall into a number of categories. Although failed asylum seekers are taking reasonable steps to leave the UK, it may well be that they are unable to get travel documentation that fully complies with their departure. It may well be that they have a physical impediment and are unable to travel because of ill health or for some other medical reason. It may well be that no viable route of return is available. That does not happen often but it can happen. It does not seem to apply at present but there have been instances when it was the case. It may well be that an application and a judicial review are being considered, perhaps in Scotland or within our own jurisdiction, and that application has been given approval to proceed. Or it may well be that we have to take steps to ensure entirely that there is an avoidance of a person&#146;s convention rights within the terms of the Human Rights Act.</p>

As he goes through the list of reasons, perhaps he can address that point.</p>

I was going to say that when I turned to the noble Lord&#146;s questions. I am sorry that that is the case, but I will again endeavour to write. I understand the reason for the question. I think that we all share concerns about the situation in Zimbabwe. We have to be optimistic but clearly we have to be realistic as well.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="080610123000032"></a>The noble Lord asked whether we would issue one card to an individual. That is the case. We would not issue more than one because that would undermine the principle of ensuring that there was the minimal prospect of abuse. The noble Lord asked whether there was any reason to suspect that a person has been fraudulent who is in receipt of Section 4 support. Not necessarily, but the aim is to ensure that we have a sufficient criminal penalty in place to deter fraudulent abuse. That is a very important principle.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="080610123000033"></a>In general, the noble Lord was concerned about the impact of the order on those supported under Section 4. Offences in Section 26A(3) will apply to those supported under Section 4, bringing them into line with those supported under Section 95. I think that we have made that clear. The new Immigration and Asylum (Provision of Accommodation to Failed Asylum Seekers) Regulations, which will replace the existing Section 4 regulations, will have a greater impact on individuals supported under Section 4. The new regulations will enable the Secretary of State to impose a condition for the continued provision of accommodation that the Section 4 recipient is subject to. For that reason he will have to produce a registration card.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="080610123000034"></a>I am familiar with the statistics that the noble Baroness quoted and in rough order they are accurate. She asked how many individuals receive Section 4 support. At the end of March 2008, statistics indicated that there were some 9,365 individuals excluding dependants supported under Section 4. Management information suggests that there are somewhere in excess of 10,000 principal cases supported and some 11,811 including dependants. As the noble Baroness

I will write to the noble Lord and will of course share that information with the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="080610123000038"></a>I have an answer here on the Zimbabwean question. The Home Office has been successful in a recent case but my understanding is that that is being appealed against. The permission-to-appeal hearing will be heard in July. Removals of failed asylum seekers are generally deferred pending application. We maintain the position that the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal was right in the first instance that it was safe, at that point, to return to Zimbabwe. That is the current situation. Of course these things have to be kept under review. No doubt that review will focus clearly on the issues which are currently a matter of public debate.</p>

Today, in an effort to further improve international cooperation, we are seeking to add the United Arab Emirates to the schedule of territories designated as extradition partners under Part 2 of the Act. We are concerned here with further secondary legislation required to amend the Extradition Act 2003 (Designation of Part 2 Territories) Order 2003. This instrument affects the UK&#146;s extradition arrangements with the United Arab Emirates. The order reflects the fact that the UK and UAE signed a bilateral extradition treaty on 6December 2006 and exchanged instruments of ratification on 3 March this year. Designation of the UAE as a category 2 territory will enable the advantages of this treaty to be given full effect in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="080610123000043"></a>The treaty between the UK and UAE signed by the then Home Secretary and the UAE Minister of Justice in December 2006 is one of a package of measures designed to increase cooperation between the law enforcement agencies of our two countries. Besides the extradition treaty, we have also concluded a treaty on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters and a treaty on judicial co-operation on civil and commercial matters. The extradition treaty allows extradition to be requested for any offence that attracts a maximum penalty of at least 12 months&#146; imprisonment in both the UK and the UAE. The evidential requirements set out in the treaty mean that both the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates must provide a prima facie evidential case against any person whom they wish to extradite.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="080610123000044"></a>There are currently no formal extradition arrangements between our two countries outside a number of international conventions to which we are both parties, which deal with a limited number of specific offences concerning serious criminal conduct, such as terrorism or drug smuggling. The introduction of a formal basis for extradition for conduct covered by the bilateral extradition treaty will lead to a more efficient and effective process for extradition between our two countries. That is preferable to relying on the ad hoc provisions in domestic extradition law for the many serious offences, such as murder and rape, that do not fall under the international conventions that I have referred to. One of the advantages of the new arrangements is that we will improve our ability to achieve justice for British victims of serious crimes.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="080610123000045"></a>The extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates will provide both Governments with a sound formal framework for future co-operation. The UAE is a key partner for the UK in work on financial crime and counterterrorism. We are clear that we will not allow criminals who evade our borders to escape justice and we are committed to assisting our international partners in doing the same. The order is necessary to ensure that the United Kingdom is able to comply with its obligations under the bilateral extradition treaty with the United Arab Emirates. That is what the order seeks to achieve and I hope that noble Lords will give it their full support. I beg to move.</p>

Again, I have one or two questions. The order seems to me to extend the areas where the Extradition Act 2003 has bite. I ought to ask about the number of days&#151;65&#151;that are to be allowed for the designation. As I understand it, there are 60 days for the United Arab Emirates to provide the information required to enable the extradition warrant to be put into force, with five days allowed for that to be passed on to the judiciary and the appropriate judge. Is that similar to every other extradition treaty with other countries or is there something different about this, given that the number of days is being mentioned? I want to make sure that we are talking

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="080610123000048"></a>Presumably, the extradition facility will be available to the United Arab Emirates for and against British citizens, if that is required. What protection do British citizens have against that? Presumably, the appeal system will be the same, but will they have protection against the extradition warrant or, as with the other countries, will they not be able to resist it? I have nothing more to say about the order, but it would be helpful if the Minister could reply to those questions.</p>

As the Minister pointed out, for countries that perhaps have particular attractions for criminals dealing with financial matters, it is important that the extradition treaty is concluded. I have a couple of concerns. The treaty allows the UK Government to extradite any of its citizens for a crime which is punishable by one year or more in prison, as the Minister said, as long as the request for the citizen is made by a competent court in the requesting country. First, how are we to judge a competent court? The US State Department's latest annual human rights report stipulates that the judiciary of the UAE is not fully independent. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="080610123000065"></a>&#147;The constitution provides for an independent judiciary; however, in practice it was not independent, as decisions were subject to review by the political leadership&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610123000060"></a>The report also states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="080610123000066"></a>&#147;Current law permits indefinite, routine, incommunicado detention without appeal&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610123000061"></a>I have had a few cases brought to my attention. I will just quote one for the record. Amnesty has outlined a recent appeal from 30 May this year which relates to a Pakistan national, Rafat Usmani, who was arrested and detained on 28 May and says that he was tortured the same day. The authorities have denied holding him in custody, but there are concerns that he has been subjected to enforced disappearance. He lived and worked in the Emirate of Dubai for more than 12 years. Over the course of 2008, he had been in communication with the Office of the Auditors&#151;a quasi judicial body under the control of the ruler of Dubai, which deals with financial offences&#151;in relation to financial irregularities that are alleged to have taken place at his former workplace. His representative in these procedures has been an American lawyer.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="080610123000050"></a>He was summoned to the Office of the Auditors on 28 May. He was told that the summons was for him to collect his passport and sign a number of forms in connection with the application to change his employment sponsorship. He went to the office with his wife&#146;s brother and wife who are American citizens. One hour after their arrival the two women were told that they must leave&#151;they had waited outside&#151;but that Rafat Usmani must remain. They were told:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="080610123000067"></a>&#147;We will teach you Americans a lesson&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610123000062"></a>Later that day Rafat Usmani was brought home by a group of men. He was in a very emotional state and claimed that he had been tortured. At that point he was taken away and was therefore not able to provide further details. His family has since made extensive inquiries of the authorities, but they have denied having

He has medical conditions including high blood pressure. Naturally, his family are very concerned about him. I quote this case to illustrate that there are matters of arrest, detention and trial that need careful, case-by-case assessment. These matters are very serious and examination, if an extradition was to take place to the UAE, should take place against a background of the knowledge of the sort of thing that is alleged to have taken place there.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked about the number of days. Part 2 of the Act provides for 45 days for the receipt of documents. It is certainly the case that some treaties require a longer period. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked whether we are satisfied that there are sufficient protections. We think that there are sufficient protections here and that the UAE is a competent judicial authority. It ought to be remembered that there are a number of safeguards which must be considered before extradition can be ordered. They relate to identity; extradition is barred if the judge is not satisfied that the person in front of them is the person sought. They also relate to dual criminality; extradition is barred if dual criminality is not established. There has to be competence there. Extradition is barred if prima facie evidence is not included; for example, evidence that would justify the person&#146;s trial if the offences had been committed in the United Kingdom. It also has to be the case that no request can be made for improper reasons; extradition is specifically barred if the judge decides that the request has in fact been made to prosecute or punish the person on the ground of race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation or political opinion.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="080610123000052"></a>Extradition can also be barred where it is felt that there has been an injustice due to ill health or the passage of time and/or where it would be oppressive due to the passage of time since the offence was committed, or due to that person&#146;s physical or mental health.</p>

<a name="80610-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="080610123000053"></a>I cannot speak with any knowledge of the issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raised. I recognise that it is an important issue. I would not in any event want to comment on an individual case; it would be wrong and improper of me to do so. I take her point and will ensure that we properly review the position with regard to the case. I can do no more than that.</p>

I asked about the situation in which a request has been made for a British citizen to be extradited to the United Arab Emirates.

<p><a name="08061085000009"></a>The noble Lord said: The wording of the amendment is clearer than the wording in the Bill and that is all I have to say about it. It says what the Government want to say but in better English. We are concerned that if government Amendment No. 74 were to be passed today it might pre-empt discussion on important points in the planning part of the Bill at a later stage. It would be useful to know the Minister&#146;s views on that. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08061085000010"></a><a name="80610-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08061085000137"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> The clause refers to regional authorities, with which I have a slight problem. In the past we have spoken about local views being valued, but the decisions by regional authorities are anything but democratic because the authorities are unelected. The electorate can just about grapple with parish, district and county councils, but regional authorities are beyond their radar. Is it not time that they were elected so that they can be accountable to the electorate for the decisions they make?</p>

The Committee will be aware that we are running out of time in which to consider the Bill and we need to give it fair consideration across the piece. If noble Lords enter the debate in that spirit we will make greater progress and still try to answer the points. If any points are unanswered in our responses we will, of course, fulsomely correspond with noble Lords to ensure that questions are answered.</p>

<p><a name="08061085000012"></a>We are grateful for the amendment. I can see that the noble Lord is trying to make the language clearer, which does not conflict in any way with our policy intent. If he is happy with that observation, I should like to give a little thought to the wording of the amendment and come back to this issue&#151;perhaps with some jointly agreed words&#151;at a later stage.</p>

<p><a name="08061085000013"></a>I should say to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, that I am intrigued by this new development in Conservative Party policy and thinking and the call for elected regional assemblies. I shall await developments with great interest. It is, of course, our party&#146;s policy to try to ensure that we have democracy at each tier and level of government.</p>

Sorry; I was so enthused by the question. Our Amendment No. 74 clarifies the circumstances in which a regional planning body might be required to seek the advice of the Homes and Communities Agency. We intend that it be only when the agency has had the functions of local planning authorities conferred on it in relation to all or part of the designated area that its advice should be sought by the regional planning body. As the Bill is drafted, that would not be the position&#151;the regional planning body would be required to seek the advice of the HCA in relation to any designated area, irrespective of whether local planning authority functions had been conferred on it in relation to that area or any part of it. That is not our intention. The HCA&#146;s advice should be sought only where the functions of a local planning authority have been conferred on it. That is the proper position and it is what the amendment achieves.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000017"></a>Like everyone else, I was intrigued to hear what the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, said about elected regional authorities. I am a passionate believer in regional government in England with a great deal of devolution from this place and the centre generally. I think that that is still the policy of my party, although the whole thing is a bit on the back burner now. I look forward to debates on the subject.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000018"></a>I am in some difficulty about whether we can accept the government amendment today, because I am speaking on behalf of my noble friend Lady Hamwee, who is detained at some conference that she is chairing. She will be along later and apologises for not being here. It is her suggestion that, were the amendment to be carried, debate on some planning aspects of the Bill on Report or at Third Reading would be pre-empted and we might be in some difficulty. On that basis, she asked me to indicate that we did not support it today. However, perhaps I can have a clear assurance that there would be no pre-emption of any debate at all on the planning aspects of the Bill, other than the details of this provision. I think she is worried that if Amendment No. 74 were passed today, it might pre-empt discussion on amendments on Report to take out the whole question of the HCA taking over from a local authority in an area as the planning authority, if there were any. If I have an absolute assurance that that is not the case, I will proceed on that basis.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08061085000116"></a>&#147;Any person authorised by the HCA may, at any reasonable time and subject as follows, enter any land&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061085000105"></a>Subsection (2)(b) says that they,</p>
<ul><a name="08061085000126"></a>&#147;must not demand admission as of right ... unless the HCA has served notice of the intended entry on every owner or occupier of the land not less than 28 days before the making of the demand&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061085000106"></a>That is quite plain but I wish to make two points. First, it should be obligatory on the person intending to enter the land to carry a copy of the notice. That really is the subject of the amendment. Also, if it is a large plot of land in multiple ownership, how on earth is the person whose land is about to be entered to know whether everyone else has received the notice? It seems to me that if he does not have that knowledge, he has a perfect right to refuse entry. Secondly, how will the Government be sure that notice has been given to all the appropriate people? I beg to move.</p>

However, the noble Lord&#146;s questions are right and proper, and I am sure that with his long involvement in the farming industry and so on he is very familiar with landowning. Of course, he is right that people should be clear about why they are on someone else&#146;s land and for what purpose, and I had better write to him on that and explain how we see the authorisation working.

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000029"></a>The clause allows an authorised person to enter a person&#146;s land in connection with a proposal by the agency to acquire land. There are only two reasons why the agency is empowered to enter a person&#146;s land: the first is to carry out a survey and the second is to value the land. In both cases, it may do so only in connection with a proposal for it to acquire that or other land or to assess the amount of compensation to be paid in respect of the acquisition.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000030"></a>The clause has been amended since it was debated in another place. The phrase &#147;and subject as follows&#148; has been added to make it clearer that Clause 19(1) is to be read in the light of what follows. Clause 19(2)(b) now refers to &#147;land&#148; rather than &#147;occupied land&#148; and to both owners and occupiers, making it clear that the provision applies to all cases of intended entry. Clause 19(3)&#151;a new subsection&#151;requires that a notice of intended entry must,</p>
<ul><a name="08061085000127"></a>&#147;state the purpose for which entry is required, and ... inform the person to whom it is given of the person&#146;s rights under this section&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08061085000038"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 21 allows the HCA to serve a connection notice on a local highways authority requiring it to connect a private street to the highway network. The private streets in question are new streets and roads being constructed. This is an amendment to probe the circumstances in which serving a notice might happen. First, why are connection notices required? Why cannot the normal procedures take place which happen when any sort of development is built? It is not unusual for streets to be connected to the highways network and there are well established procedures for this, involving the highways authorities and the planning  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC137"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system. Secondly, why does the HCA require these powers, when it is not a developer? Why cannot a developer who is building new roads that need connecting simply do what every other developer does everywhere else? It is not clear at all why this clause is required. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08061085000039"></a><a name="80610-gc0001.htm_spnew27"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0001.htm_spnew28"></a><a name="08061085000149"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> This amendment seeks to restrict the power of the HCA to serve a connection notice on the local highway authority to require that authority to connect a private street to an existing highway only to those circumstances in which the HCA has carried out the development which includes the private street.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000040"></a>Clause 21 enables the HCA to serve a connection notice on the local highway authority which will require it to connect a private street to an existing highway. There are several reasons why the HCA may require this. The local authority may be undertaking a major regeneration project and may be working in partnership with a private developer and the HCA. To secure the full regeneration potential of the project it may well be necessary for highway networks to be linked. In those circumstances, I am sure that all noble Lords want the HCA to be able to exercise its power to require the local highway authority to connect the private street to an existing highway.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000041"></a>In reality this power provides a means of certainty whereby road networks can be linked where necessary, and that would almost always be done by negotiation. Subsection (4) requires that before serving a connections notice the HCA must consult the highways authority on the contents of the notice, and subsection (5) provides for an appeal procedure. The HCA will be required to consult the highway authority on the connection. The role of the HCA in such circumstances will generally be to facilitate the development by working in partnership with the local authority, the private developer and other agencies.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000042"></a>Even in cases where the agency served a notice on the highway authority, Clause 21 sets out the requirements of the notice, who should be consulted and how appeals can be made to the Secretary of State. These requirements, consultations and the ability to make appeals would apply whether the HCA undertook the development or not. Given that those safeguards are in place and given the fact that the requirement to connect a private street to a local highway authority would usually be expected to result from a major regeneration or housing project led by the local authority itself in order to build a sustainable community, I hope the noble Lord will be reassured that this power is designed to facilitate a local authority&#146;s objective.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000043"></a>I turn to the amendment. There will of course be circumstances in which the HCA may undertake a development which results in a requirement for a private street to be connected to a local highway. However, the agency would most likely undertake such a development in partnership. It would be unwise to restrict the power of the HCA to request the connection of a private street to an existing highway in those limited circumstances rather than those that I have described.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000044"></a>It may be suggested that the HCA could, in theory at least, seek to connect all private streets to existing highways, whether or not they were involved in activities near those streets. It is perhaps worth taking one&#146;s attention to Clause 21(8), which states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061085000128"></a>&#147;the local highway authority ... may recover ... expenses reasonably incurred&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08061085000108"></a>by making the connection. It would serve no practical purpose for the agency to seek connection of a private street in which it had no interest as it would be paying for connections which were not linked to any of its development activities. In practical terms, we expect the HCA to seek connection only where it would provide a benefit that contributed to regeneration overall.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000045"></a>This is a reserve power; first and foremost, matters will be sorted out by agreement. In a very few cases, this procedure might be necessary. A right of appeal for local highway authorities is built in. We do not expect the power to be used very often, but it is needed to ensure that developments give a full return to potential.</p>

The Minister confirmed the circumstances in which it could be used, but it is difficult to envisage them. How are developments connected now with the highways network without these powers? Well, it happens. Huge housing estates, new towns, eco-towns, new factories, power stations, bus stations and railway stations are not built without a connection to the highways network; they are all connected to the highways network without these powers. I do not understand why they are needed. I assume that they are legacy powers carried forward from previous Acts. How often have they been used within living memory? If the Minister cannot tell me now, perhaps somebody can write to me with the answer. The Bill is full of stuff carried forward from the past which does not represent the real world today.</p>

<p><a name="08061085000047"></a>The Minister talked a lot about projects working in partnership with the local authority for regeneration, even those led by the local authority.

It is similar to an amendment that was the subject of considerable discussion on Report in the House of Commons along with a number of other amendments, some of which we will discuss in a batch later on in the Bill. Basically, it is about council housing, whether it has a future and whether the Labour Government believe in it any more and are prepared to treat council housing on the same basis as social housing of other kinds. In that sense, it is what might be called a &#147;level playing field&#148; amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08061085000054"></a>I do not want to repeat a great deal of what was said in the Commons. Rather, I want to lay out the basic case, which is, essentially, about the treatment of local authorities that still have traditional council housing, as opposed to ALMOs or housing that has been transferred to housing associations and so on. The Prime Minister raised a lot of hopes when he said,</p>
<ul><a name="08061085000129"></a>&#147;councils will be allowed to build homes again&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061085000109"></a>In a sense, there is nothing to stop councils building houses now; it is just that, because of the way the system is operated by the Government, most councils do not find it possible. Specifically, they are not provided with the resources to do so.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000055"></a>At present the Government prohibit local authorities from applying for a social housing grant to help build new council homes. Again, when I talk about &#147;council homes&#148; here, I am talking about traditionally controlled and organised council stock, not ALMOs. Registered social landlords can apply, local authorities with ALMOs or special purpose vehicles can apply, but not traditional council housing with secure tenancies at traditional council rents.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000056"></a>This is an extremely controversial issue in the country, in local government and in those areas that still have council housing, which, increasingly, are places where tenants have had the option of various kinds of stock transfers but have opted to stay with their local authority. As a result, the Government carried out what I understand was called the opt-out pilot. The result, published in March 2008, shows that councils that are still running traditional council housing will have a 43 per cent shortfall in funding for management, maintenance and repair of their homes in the next 30 years, which is clearly a very serious matter. Council housing is being underfunded. Those of us who believe in council housing think the system is unfair in the use of receipts and in funding, particularly the fact that those local authorities are not eligible for the social housing grant. At the moment, a majority of councils with traditional council housing are in a position of so-called negative subsidy, meaning that there is a subsidy paid to the Exchequer by council tenants. Continuation of the present system would increase that; it is suggested that if the system were to continue&#151;which is unlikely without some changes&#151;there would be a subsidy to the Exchequer from council tenants of something like &#163;1 billion by 2022.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000057"></a>The current financial regime, as I have just said, sees a majority of housing authorities with traditional council housing in negative subsidy. Between 1990 and 2003, some &#163;13 billion has been taken from rents to

The Government brought in the major repairs allowance to address part of the problem&#151;that traditional council housing was simply not kept in a proper state of repair, other than day-to-day repairs. It has gone some way towards solving the problem but nothing like far enough.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000058"></a>This is all ironic really because, traditionally, going back many years&#151;as, regrettably, some of us can&#151;the debates about subsidising or funding council housing were all a question of the balance between rent and rate levels. Every year, every housing authority had the debate, which was often politically controversial and controversial locally in other ways, and people made those decisions locally. The position has been very different for quite some time, as it is a long time since councils were able to set their own rent levels. In effect, the system is now determined from above, and councils operate it. Some of us may think that that is deplorable as a matter of principle, but it is the position that we are now in.</p>
<h5><a name="08061085000131"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000059"></a>In 2008-09, it is estimated that council tenants will pay around &#163;6.1 billion in rent and, of this, &#163;3.4 billion will be returned to the councils and kept by them for management and maintenance, while &#163;1.3 billion can be spent on repairs through the major repairs allowance. That still leaves a &#163;1.4 billion subsidy to the Exchequer in a single year out of the rents paid by council tenants. In addition, capital receipts from the right-to-buy system simply have not been ploughed back into council housing or, indeed, into social housing; &#163;45 billion has been raised and only one-quarter of that has been recycled into improving public housing, according to a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in December 2005.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000060"></a>We all know that a substantial subsidy is being paid through stock transfer. I have talked in the House previously&#151;and I shall not repeat it now&#151;about what happened in my own authority in Pendle when the council decided, against my wishes, and the tenants voted for a stock transfer to a housing association called Housing Pendle, which is nevertheless doing a good job. A large amount of money was spent on that, a lot of which did not go into housing. For example, Pendle Council is now a debt-free authority as a direct result of that stock transfer. That does not seem a sensible way in which to run the public finances, whatever short-term advantages there are to some parts of the system.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000061"></a>Debt write-off in the past seven years has resulted in &#163;2.5 billion on stock transfers. An increasing amount is spent on gap funding, with an estimate of &#163;387 billion by 2012. As we all know, if you do not transfer, you do not get anything like the same amount of money to spend on your houses. In Pendle&#146;s case, it was a comparison of &#163;45 million with &#163;10 million up to 2010; without the transfer it would not have been possible to maintain houses of a decent standard beyond then, which is why people went for it. So it is bribery, blackmail and bullying&#151;but it is astonishing the number of places in which the tenants are not accepting that and are voting to stay with their local authorities in traditional council housing.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC141"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000062"></a>The present system cannot go on. The Government&#146;s answer is to put more pressure on councils to transfer but, whether we like it or not, there will be a lot of places in which the tenants do not agree with that and the councils do not agree with it&#151;and good luck to them, I say. But the management and maintenance allowances of &#163;1.3 billion are too low; the major repairs allowance, at &#163;950 million, is too low; and, in particular, the inability to apply for the social housing grant is a substantial barrier to the expansion of council housing in those areas&#151;which means, effectively, the expansion of the main system of social housing in those areas.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000063"></a>The present state of the housing market may be temporary or medium term, but it is probably not long term. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that if the Government are to meet their target of 3 million new homes by 2020, they will have to bring on board the 200-odd local authorities that still have traditional council housing in areas where that is seen locally as the future and where the tenants will continue voting for it. Unless the Government are able to bring local authorities into the system, they will not build all the new social housing required and will certainly not meet the target of 3 million new homes.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000064"></a>By and large, council housing has been a tremendous success in this country in the 80 years or so&#151;it is rather more than that&#151;since it was introduced. It has a real future in those areas where people want to continue it. The way in which the Government are discriminating against it now is a cause for great concern. Without trying to be party political about the issue, I hope that they will be manage to change their policies significantly over the next couple of years. I beg to move.</p>

This is a classic example of the increasing and increasingly detailed interference that has occurred for local authorities over the past decade in particular; in fact, it began before that. I do not like the term &#147;council housing&#148; in the modern context&#151;it is discriminatory&#151;but the issue behind all this is that of whether council housing is social housing. It is, and there is no getting away from that. In other respects, we will look later in the Bill at creating what is called the single domain, under which housing, whether owned and managed by councils, ALMOs or housing associations, will all be subject to the same regulatory regime and we will get some unification. I well understand that that is complicated because the basis of funding for local authorities is dramatically different from anything else. However, we are talking about social housing and there is a case for having all social housing treated in the same way, with regard not just to regulation but to access for funding. There is a quid pro quo to that argument, which is that some of the privileged positions that council houses might enjoy&#151;there have been such constraints that they no longer enjoy them&#151;would have to go, even if they are only theoretical advantages. I am not sure whether the amendment would get us to where we probably need to be, but it is certainly a subject worthy of further exploration.</p>

It is not something that has simply divided parties; I acknowledge that some people in my own party take a similar view to the one that he took today. I agree that council housing, or social housing as we now know it, has been a fantastic success without which we would never have been able to house the sorts of people who could not have afforded a home of their own. It is a very proud tradition. We must recognise that, but times and aspirations change, as do challenges. The increasing challenge on the Government to enable people to buy their own homes and provide additional social housing has required us to look at things in a different way. I will come on to that.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000067"></a>There are a lot of issues in and around the future of social housing and the issues raised by the Hills report and so forth that are worthy of a serious and long debate. They are outside the scope of this Bill but nevertheless relevant. I will address the wider issues raised by the noble Lord before I get on to the amendment. He raised many issues about the funding of the HRA system such as the implications of incomes, transfers, rents and so forth. I would like to put on record that we are presently engaged in a major review of council housing finance as a whole. It is looking at all aspects of this area, including issues around investment. I will write to the Committee with details of that review&#151;its terms of reference and the issues that it is addressing. Without going into a detailed response to those parts of the noble Lord&#146;s speech, I can answer many of the issues or at least address them in the context of what we are doing in that review.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000068"></a>The amendment itself needs to be addressed because the notion is that it might clarify the issue or at least prompt a change by making it clear that local housing authorities may be given financial assistance by the HCA. Quite simply, the problem with the amendment is that Clause 22 is drafted broadly so that the HCA may provide financial assistance to any person, in any form, with Secretary of State consent. By &#147;any form&#148; we mean grants or loans. If we were to name local authorities and specify them above any other body or organisation, that could lead to the beginning of a list with all sorts of other bodies attempting to add themselves to that privileged position. We all know how we feel about lists in legislation. The broader point of whether local authorities themselves should be eligible for social housing grants, for the reasons given by the noble Lord, goes to the heart of the debate that we have had over the past few years.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000069"></a>Because local authorities have not been treated as eligible for social housing grants, the bare numbers are rather dramatic. It is undoubtedly true that the vast majority of new social housing has been built by housing associations, and local authorities have built fewer than 300 new council homes in England in each of the past nine years. Part of the context is that the housing authorities and local authorities themselves have become different sorts of agencies, moving away from providing and managing to becoming place-making  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>organisations where housing policy&#151;the assessment of need and the distribution of resources&#151;has become a more important and clear role.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000070"></a>The reason why we have looked to housing associations for investment in social housing has nothing to do with ideology or discrimination. The noble Lord said that we have treated local authorities unfairly, but we have been fair to those people who need homes. The simple fact is that housing associations have been able to deliver 30 per cent more social housing for the same amount of public grant because they have been able to lever in private borrowing and reserves. That is not to do with excluding local authorities from housing, but about getting value for money and getting the maximum output for the people in need. Indeed, that ambitious target of 70,000 more social homes by 2010-11, would be at risk without that leverage.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000071"></a>The noble Lord may ask why the Government do not do both. Why do they not enable local authorities to build and at the same time develop the housing association sector in that way? However, with scarce resources and with another major investment in the Decent Homes funding, for example, one has to get as much impact for limited resources as possible. Using the RSL sector in this way has been hugely effective.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000072"></a>Things have recently changed. We have changed the bidding rules so that, last year, for the first time, 10 ALMOs and other local authority companies prequalified to bid for social housing grant. Three ALMOs&#151;in Derby, Sheffield and Brent&#151;were among the successful bids announced in February. But we still believe that value for money is critical in these expensive areas of policy. While the rules were changed to allow bids to be made, we did not change the criteria for assessing them. ALMOs and SPVs have to compete on the same value-for-money criteria within the same bidding competition as housing associations. That ensures that we support the best schemes for public money.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000073"></a>I have been talking so far about social housing grant, but we need to look wider than that. If council schemes involving housing association partners were to be replaced with in-house schemes, the question that those who oppose this policy have to answer is: where would the additionality come from to get the extra resource that builds the houses that people need? In addition to social housing grant and partly to answer that question, the Bill also removes financial disincentives to local authorities building traditional council housing within the housing revenue account. The noble Lord referred to the Prime Minister's words on that. When we come to Clause 312, I am sure that we will have another lively debate on this. Clause 312 exempts new supply from the HRA subsidy system. It allows councils to keep the rental operating surpluses from these homes that are currently redistributed nationally. We expect that to make a small but significant increase in the number of homes built via this route. It will rise from the low hundreds to perhaps several thousands. We will announce separately plans to consult

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000074"></a>Because of the explanation that I have given in terms of the resource that we have and the challenges that we face, we are not currently proposing to invite councils to bid for social housing grant in their own right. We need to consider the question of additionality, but we also need to evaluate how some of the reforms that we are proposing will impact and we need to see how they might be promoted and assessed. By setting out the simple set of principles that have guided us, I hope that housing associations will continue to play a key role, but that we also see housing authorities playing an important and growing role in helping to deliver the objects of the HCA. It is a question of being pragmatic and of assessing how we can best do this. It is also, genuinely, a reflection of the changing role of local authorities in terms of assessing the housing needs of their local communities and the many roles and challenges that are on them in providing for the various needs of the whole community, not just in housing but in community development. I appreciate the opportunity to put that on record. I do not expect the noble Lord to agree, but I hope that he will be able to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the argument.</p>

The Minister referred to subsection (1), which relates to a very wide power to give financial assistance to any person. I have been brought up on the assumption that in such circumstances Treasury approval would be required. I have pursued this briefly in other Committee sessions and I dare say that I shall pursue it again. Where has the Treasury gone?</p>

<p><a name="08061085000076"></a><a name="80610-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08061085000155"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> As a result of what the noble Baroness said, perhaps I may raise a point that I have raised previously. As one stage she definitely implied that some of the funding allocated by the Government was competed for by the local authorities or housing associations. I have no difficulty with that as a means of selecting those who will make the best use of that funding. But what happens next? In other words, presumably they cannot apply again for similar funding for the next 40 or 50 years, or however long it takes, to give all the other authorities who might have failed at first a chance to get access to that funding. Otherwise, if funding goes only to the most efficient, smartest and&#151;perhaps I will not say most loquacious&#151;most plausible authorities, you could have a situation in which some social housing was extremely well maintained and some, through no fault of those who managed it, became effectively neglected. I am sure that the Government have thought that through, but I would like the noble Baroness to tell me how they have done it.</p>

The answer to the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, is exactly the same as the answer we gave in our previous discussion. Modern advice from parliamentary counsel on legislation is that we do not need to specify the Treasury on the face of the Bill, because that is implicit in the whole business of accountability.</p>

On the second matter, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, which I was not trying to evade, I was not certain whether he was talking about housing associations bidding for Housing Corporation funds or local authorities, which, as I said, are not eligible to bid for social housing grant funds; but we have changed the conditions&#151;</p>

<p><a name="08061085000080"></a><a name="80610-gc0002.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0002.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08061085000159"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> The question related to funding for social housing.

Some housing associations bid very regularly for the funds as they come forward. Local authorities have not been eligible to bid for social housing grant, which was a change in policy. However, we have made changes to allow ALMOs and local companies to bid when local authorities are working through them, which is slightly different because they are at arm&#146;s length, and that is why we are piloting such schemes. The other money available to local authorities has been for the Decent Homes programme for the repair and modernisation of council housing stock. Perhaps it would help if I set out these processes, which are complex, and how they relate to each other, in a letter to the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="08061085000082"></a><a name="80610-gc0002.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0002.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08061085000161"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I am grateful to everyone who has taken part and to the Minister for setting out government policy. I did not expect her to do other than that, but she rightly reminded us that a major review is taking place, which is precisely why I used the phrase &#147;in the next couple of years&#148;, during which there may well be changes in policy. There is an increasingly major debate taking place on this matter and, as the Minister said, it is taking place very much within the Labour Party, as it is everywhere else. There is hope that perhaps minds are being changed a little and my reason for tabling the amendment was partly to contribute to that process and to the debate. I accept that for technical reasons the amendment cannot be accepted in its present form; it is a means of facilitating our debate.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000083"></a>I deliberately moved it in a fairly low-key and non-political way. In other forums, we might have had a bit more of a go at one another&#151;I would certainly have had a go at the Government and the Labour Party&#151;but this is not the place to do it. Nevertheless, expectations have been raised by what senior politicians have said, particularly the Prime Minister, and there is considerable dismay among people who are finding out that it perhaps does not mean what they thought&#151;I shall put it no more strongly than that.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC146"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000084"></a>The fundamental question is: will it be possible for local authorities that still have traditional council housing to build new council housing to contribute to the 3 million target? At the moment, the answer appears to be, &#147;No, it will not, except in very special circumstances in a very few places&#148;.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000085"></a>The Minister spoke about additionality that comes from building by RSLs and housing associations, and there is no doubt that there are schemes where that is the case. There is no doubt also that finding it is more difficult for them and that, in many cases, housing associations cannot build without social housing grant as part of the package. It is therefore quite clear that local authorities, too, will not be able to build without social housing grant.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000086"></a>The Minister raised a much wider debate about local authorities and what she called place-making&#151;it is not a word that I would use, but I recognise that it is part of the new Labour jargon. I think that I understand what it means; that is: &#147;rather than being providers&#148;. This is a much wider debate about the role of local authorities, which some of us think that Nicholas Ridley started off a long time ago when he thought that local authorities should have just one meeting a year to enable everybody else to do things. I am not suggesting that the Government are in any way going as far as that, because in many areas they are giving local authorities more powers and resources.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000087"></a>Enabling and providing are not alternatives; it is possible to do both. The mix should depend on what the people in each area&#151;that is, the electors, the residents and the elected councillors&#151;want. That would differ, which is fine. However, that is part of a much wider debate into which I shall not go any further.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000088"></a>The Minister touched on the important issue of where the extra resources would come from. If the social housing sector is going to make a significant contribution to the 3 million houses, and perhaps an increasing proportion given the state of the private housing market, extra resources will be needed. That is a question to which the Government will simply have to face up. If they do not provide the extra resources, they will not get the extra houses and many of us think that they will not hit the 3 million target.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000089"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for what she said. We look forward to her detailed explanation of how the system and the financing will work. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000092"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is an attempt simply to tighten up the wording of this section of the Bill. The clause is uninformative. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08061085000124"></a>&#147;The HCA may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, give financial assistance to any person&#148;.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08061085000093"></a>In fact, if people are going to accept money through the HCA, they need to know in full and complete detail&#151;as I am sure that they probably will in practice&#151;exactly what those terms and conditions are, particularly those that relate to repayment and recovery, which are implied but certainly not spelt out. The wording is inadequate because it does not really require the provision of full details, although I am moderately confident&#151;and the Minister may reassure me&#151;that, with the actual business of making a financial contract between the HCA and a recipient, all the terms and details of that contract will be spelt out in detail. But that is not necessarily so, from what we read in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="08061085000134"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

I thought that that was the intent behind his proposal, because of the changes that would be introduced by the amendment. I understand why he has pressed the point, but I shall explain why we need the flexibility that we have.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000095"></a>The wording of the amendment is largely taken from the corresponding power that was given to the Urban Regeneration Agency in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. That provision, by the use of the term &#147;may&#148;, allowed the URA to attach specific terms and conditions when providing financial assistance. This amendment, by changing &#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148;, does not give that necessary flexibility.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000096"></a>Why is it important to have that flexibility? First, Clause 22(1) requires the HCA to obtain the consent of the Secretary of State to the giving of financial assistance, which is taken over from previous legislation. We need flexibility in practice because, when one considers the great spread of RSLs and housing associations&#151;some of them very small and specific, catering for special needs and communities, while others are extremely large operations&#151;we need to be able to cover all eventualities in contractual arrangements that reflect special circumstances, objectives and tasks. Clause 22 allows the necessary flexibility for those terms and conditions to be tailored to the different circumstances in each instance.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000097"></a>The noble Lord asked me whether I could assure him that the contractual arrangements that would be made would specify and address the particular issues&#151;and I can. I am sure that my noble friend Lady Dean has had a lot to do with the contractual arrangements  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC148"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the Housing Corporation and could confirm that they are not entered into lightly and are specific and clear.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000098"></a>The second reason is that we have moved away in drafting legislation from including items that amount to standard terms and conditions that would be enforceable under contract anyway. This is in fact a matter of good practice in framing legislation.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061085000099"></a>Finally, the agency is accountable to the Secretary of State. That has always been clear. I have just spoken on how it handles the finances; it is expected to account properly for its financial transactions. That, together with the requirement to obtain the Secretary of State&#146;s consent, is the safeguard that we build into the Bill.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080610110000052"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by order amend subsection (1) so as to specify a greater amount than that for the time being specified there&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610110000043"></a>The limit can be increased to &#163;3,000 million. Nowadays people refer to that as &#163;3 billion. I am not sure that it should be, but that is being old fashioned.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000007"></a>Is it appropriate for specified amounts to appear in primary legislation that may last for considerable time, during which inflation may occur? People try to keep inflation down to what is thought to be a reasonable level but some of us can remember when it was over 20 per cent. I am not suggesting it will get back to that level but many people feel that it may run at 4 or 5 per cent for a while. You would soon run away with large amounts of money if inflation stayed at that level for a number of years. That is the basic question.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000008"></a>A subsidiary question is to probe how &#163;3,000 million, or &#163;3 billion, compares with the current borrowing levels of the component organisations of the HCA. It will be interesting to know the amounts if the Minister can give them.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000009"></a>Finally&#151;this is a more trivial probing&#151;it is not clear how subsections (1), (2) and (3) relate to each other and why they are necessary. Why cannot the Secretary of State simply have the power to make an order stating what the maximum amount is at any given time? It is clear that, at some time or other, the amount will have to be increased if this legislation and the HCA survive for a reasonable time. If the HCA does not survive, the legislation will not have succeeded anyway.</p>

<p><a name="080610110000010"></a><a name="80610-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080610110000064"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am happy to respond to this because one needs to explain why it is important to have this in primary legislation. In principle, it is important that Parliament understands what is proposed when one is discussing the borrowing powers of any public agency. This provision has been inherited from the Housing Associations Act 1985 and the limits are set at the same level as those available to the Housing Corporation. It is very much a standard provision for contingency powers. The current level is up to &#163;2,300 million unless the Secretary of State provides for an increase to this limit, by order, up to a maximum ceiling of &#163;3,000 million.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000011"></a>These amounts were increased from those originally allowed in the Housing Associations Act 1985 by the Housing Act 1988. Essentially, the reason for the increase is because the Homes and Communities Agency will be bigger than the Housing Corporation for all the reasons that we know. It does not seem reasonable to expect the new agency to do more than the combined roles of its constituent parts while restricting its ability to borrow to less than one of its constituent parts, so, as I have said, the amounts are those applicable to the Housing Corporation. Retaining access to this amount of borrowing would seem reasonable, given the breadth and wide variety of the work that the agency will undertake. Those limits will provide the scope for the agency to borrow such amounts as it considers appropriate, but it will be restricted to the terms of Clause 23; that is, the agency can borrow only from the Secretary of State or the European Investment Bank over the longer term, or from any person over the short term, in order to manage its finances. We expect amounts such as these to be borrowed over the longer term rather than the shorter.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000012"></a>I hope that clarifies why the clause is there and what it is intended to do, and that the noble Lord will be able to reassure his noble friend that everything is above board.</p>

<ul><a name="080610110000060"></a>&#147;shall not exceed &#163;2,500 million or such greater sum not exceeding &#163;3,000 million as the Secretary of State may specify by order made with the consent of the Treasury&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080610110000044"></a>The value of money in 2008 is not exactly the same as it was in 1985. I would have thought that any modern calculations about financing would have to take into account where we are today and the experience of the Housing Corporation over that intervening period when circumstances have dramatically changed.</p>

It will be able to purchase and sell property. In a sense, if we are not careful, we will be establishing a plc&#151;by which I mean not a private limited company but a government-supported company&#151;with a capitalisation of up to &#163;3 billion. If it was used in that way, that would be quite extraordinary, but I know that that is not the Government&#146;s intention. However, I am not wholly convinced of where the safeguards are, even in this Bill, that will prevent it happening. They may exist, but I am not sure that I detected them in the form in which I have put the question.</p>

The organisation is going to be huge and it will need some clear traffic lights about how it does its business. It will be a public organisation, although it is going to work with the private sector, so it has that kind of accountability. Clause 2 says that the Secretary of State may, by order, specify a greater amount from time to time. So there is a minimum, but there is also the coverage. To take the whole clause out of the Bill would take away one of the compasses that the new organisation is going to have. It is sound to have that clause in. I question whether &#163;2.3 billion is going to be enough in the future, but I am consoled by the fact that subsection (2) will cover that. The Secretary of State still has to have a handle, even though it is at arm&#146;s length, on an organisation that is going to be investing substantial amounts of public sector funding.</p>

We might have had a bit more argument in Committee if we had come back with a greatly inflated attempt to borrow. As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, says, &#163;3 billion is an awful lot of money, however you describe it&#151;for example, &#163;3,000 million. In answer to the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, I say that the borrowing limits seem to us to be sufficient. Our assessment is based on the experience of the past 20 years, and there is no need to change the limits; they are proportionate and right. The arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, were very sensible in that context. But accountability is built in, not only in how we inherited powers from previous organisations and how they operate but in the set of relationships that we have between the Secretary of State, the corporation and the new agency. Indeed, if the HCA wants to borrow on a long-term basis, it can borrow only from the Secretary of State or the European Investment Bank. Short-term borrowing can come from any person if it should be needed, but it is short-term borrowing only. So we have checks and balances in the borrowing arrangements there, which are very sensible.</p>

<p><a name="080610110000022"></a>Amendments Nos. 76A and 104C will not, I hope, need to detain your Lordships for very long. The first of the amendments is about the HCA, while the second is about Oftenant. Both those organisations will be subject to the freedom of information legislation. My amendments seek for reassurance that the charging powers in the two respective clauses will be subject to regulations made under the Freedom of Information Act, which itself sets charges for providing information in the circumstances with which it deals. I beg to move.</p>

I am sure that she drew on the forensic scrutiny of this Committee to impress her conference.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000024"></a>I can give the noble Baroness a short answer on the FOI point. She has drawn attention to the regulations made under the FOI Act, which applied to the provision of information under the Act by public authorities. Those regulations cover how a public authority should estimate the cost of complying with a request, for example, for a piece of information. These regulations include provision as to what a public authority can take into account in determining charges for dealing with an FOI request, and include, for example, how easily or not the public authority could determine whether it held the information, how it could take account of the costs that it expected to incur to locate or retrieve information and so on. These are very sensible principles in relation to charging for the provision of information when responding to a request under the Act.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000025"></a>The regulations will certainly apply to both the new HCA and the regulator, so the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments are redundant in that sense. There are consequential amendments in Clause 87 and Schedule 8, which also provide for the FOI Act to apply to the HCA and the regulator. I hope that she will be satisfied with that.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080610110000054"></a>&#147;Business</p>
</ul>(1) The HCA may carry on any business.(2) In subsection (1) &#145;business&#146; includes undertaking&#148;.

<p><a name="080610110000046"></a>means, why it is necessary and what the drafting purpose is of having it in the Bill. When I read the words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080610110000056"></a>&#147;The HCA may carry on any business&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610110000047"></a>I am reminded of Clause 3 concerning principal powers, which we debated several days ago. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080610110000057"></a>&#147;The HCA may do anything it considers appropriate for the purposes of its objects or for purposes incidental to those purposes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610110000048"></a>We had quite a debate about the words &#147;anything it considers appropriate&#148;. Nevertheless, there the HCA is clearly constrained by,</p>
<ul><a name="080610110000061"></a>&#147;the purposes of its objects or for purposes incidental to those purposes&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080610110000049"></a>whereas here we are saying that it can carry out any business at all. I am intrigued by this and look forward to the Minister&#146;s explanation.</p>

Some years ago, when my wife and I were in Sri Lanka, there was a hotel which had been run by the Dutch for well over 200 years. My wife asked whether she could see the literature advising potential clients of the facilities at the hotel and was given what appeared to be a cricket fixture card. It stated the name of the hotel, which was the New and Oriental Hotel, on the front cover. On the inside page, in the bottom right-hand corner of what I think is known as the centrefold&#151;there were only two pages&#151;was a notice saying, &#147;Prices may be secured on application to the management&#148;. However, the best sentence of all was the one just inside the second page which started with the words, &#147;The New and Oriental Hotel is neither new nor oriental&#148;.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000035"></a>I anticipate the Minister&#146;s response with some curiosity. His fellow Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, has alluded to changes in references to the Treasury that are now contained in all legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, is, again, unusually not in his place on this occasion, but it looks as though we may be looking at a new form of legislative architecture&#151;a fashion trend within the Government towards minimalism in legislation. I have no problems at all with the nature of it&#151;it may well be a good thing&#151;but I think it is better that it happens with an explanation from the Government rather than by sleight of hand.</p>

I can tell good Conservatives who are concerned about this that these powers are modelled on those of the Urban Regeneration Agency, which was established by their own legislation back in 1993.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000038"></a>These powers will be needed to allow the agency to carry on any business, including commercially established partnerships or funds or other such activities currently undertaken by English Partnerships, and to allow the HCA to continue to develop similarly innovative schemes, perhaps with the private sector, to support its broader objects. We do not want to inhibit the activities of the HCA when it works in the commercial field by failing to give it adequate powers. The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, who is not here today, asked of this Bill at Second Reading:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080610110000058"></a>&#147;Will it make the job of those of us who are seeking to innovate and enable residents to take more local control of their destinies easier or harder?&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/5/08; col. 99.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610110000050"></a>That was a good question. This clause is part of the way that this agency through this Bill is empowered to make it easier. The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, also stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080610110000059"></a>&#147;If the Government are serious about regeneration, then innovation, entrepreneurs and business are key components&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/4/08; col. 101.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080610110000051"></a>I do not think that anyone in this Room would disagree with that. We certainly do not, and this clause, along with Clauses 32 and 46, forms an important part of our empowerment of the HCA to innovate and engage with entrepreneurs and businesses to help deliver its objects.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080610110000039"></a>Will the agency be able to operate any business that it sees fit? No, it is not intended through this provision to authorise trading activity on the open market in competition with private sector operators or suppliers, and the activity must fall clearly within the objects of the agency. So the agency would not be able open a fast-food restaurant, a new oriental hotel or any other sort of organisation, but the provision is intended to ensure that the agency can secure regeneration purposes and those involving community activity and innovation. That is what this is about. It is not a wider, more sweeping power. I hope that that helps the noble Lord, Lord Greaves.</p>

The power seems very sweeping indeed. Time and again we have Ministers who say, &#147;It is not intended to do this or that. We are a benign Government and we have benign Secretaries of State and we do not do things which all you people with your inquiring, occasionally cynical, minds might think might happen&#148;. We are making legislation, which is not for the present Government. The present Government may last for ever, or they may not. Who knows? The response of Ministers that, &#147;We do not intend to do this or that&#148;, goes a certain distance in reassurance, but only that distance, because the legislation will be on the statute book for someone else to come along and perhaps do other things.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000004"></a><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0806115000442"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Clause 32 concerns the power to form companies and, to a degree, I understand more why this is in the Bill than the previous wide clause. Nevertheless, the noble Lord referred earlier to believing the HCA will be a plc, and one wonders whether the clause would allow it to convert to a plc. It will be interesting to hear from the Minister the extent to which the Government believe it will be involved in the corporate sector and in forming companies. Perhaps he will give two or three examples of where this might be a sensible way forward.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000005"></a>Part of my concern, again, is that this is minimalist legislation, to use the terminology of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke. The clause consists of two lines. It is the kind of legislation that used to be passed 70 or 80 years ago when Bills consisted of five or six pages. Nowadays we expect to see laid out the circumstances in which the provisions can be used. I accept that the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="0806115000419"></a>&#147;with the consent of the Secretary of State&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0806115000271"></a>is used, but we expect to see phrases such as &#147;regulations will determine it&#148;, &#147;they will set out the principles in which it will happen&#148; or &#147;some of the principles set out in the Bill&#148;. There is nothing here; it is more minimalism. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000006"></a><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0806115000443"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has anticipated, the explanation in this case is similar to the previous one. The ability to establish a company or to acquire an interest in one is subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s consent. That ability is required to enable the agency to operate more effectively in implementing a policy or innovating activity through the medium of a company to which it, central government or other agencies could give financial assistance. It would also enable and allow the agency to participate indirectly in joint ventures if that was the most effective method of delivering its objectives.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000007"></a>Again, these powers are modelled on the Urban Regeneration Agency powers. The ability of the agency to establish or acquire an interest in a company will be important in allowing the agency to operate as an  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC155"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>equal partner in its dealings with the private sector when undertaking housing and regeneration work. The company would operate as a separate entity. As I am sure the noble Lord will know from his work in local government, such special purpose vehicles can often provide the most effective route for implementing commercial schemes. The greater flexibility and separate accountability that this allows are very useful in enabling effective negotiations with private sector partners.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000008"></a>Before the agency can establish a company or acquire an interest it will need the Secretary of State&#146;s consent and the agency will have to demonstrate why a company or an interest in a company is needed. The functions that the company will have will relate directly to its objects. For example, the current arrangements under which the Urban Regeneration Agency works as English Partnerships have enabled it to carry on a business by virtue of Section 160(1)(g) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Development Act 1993. So this is not a new power; it was there previously. Using these powers, English Partnerships currently runs joint ventures including the English Cities Fund, the Priority Sites Limited and Network Space. English Partnerships is joining with the Housing Corporation to form one single entity and these powers will be required for that work to continue. The joint ventures that I have described have enabled English Partnerships to carry out its work.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000009"></a>The power is there for that practical reason and the need to create special vehicles to fulfil the agency&#146;s objectives in the future.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000010"></a>Clause 32 agreed to.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000011"></a>Clause 33 [<I>Community services</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="0806115000012"></a><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0806115000444"></a>Lord Greaves</b> moved Amendment No. 77A:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0806115000286"></a> Clause 33, page 15, line 11, at end insert &#147;take any reasonable actions either directly, or by supporting or facilitating the actions of other persons or organisations which are designed to&#151;&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000013"></a>The noble Lord said: We now move on to a bit of the Bill in which the Government are in favour of lists. The Minister referred earlier to lists, suggesting that they do not like them, but sometimes the Government like them and sometimes they do not&#151;and I suppose that we will have to live with that. But here is a list of community services that the HCA may carry out or facilitate the carrying out of.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000014"></a>Amendments Nos. 77A and 77B, which sit together, have a twofold purpose. The first is to produce better working; I think that my wording is neater and clearer. But the second and more important purpose is to draw attention to a little bit of the Bill which is complete nonsense. Occasionally, we have the duty to prevent the Government legislating nonsense.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000015"></a>The substance of the clause is that the HCA may,</p>
<ul><a name="0806115000420"></a>&#147;encourage or develop existing or new businesses ... provide employment ... provide business or employment services ... provide safe and attractive environments&#148;,</ul>
<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000016"></a>all of which are clear, practical, positive things that it can do. Indeed, it can help other people to do those things. Skipping a bit, it can,</p>
<ul><a name="0806115000421"></a>&#147;provide ... transport services ... health services&#148;</ul>



<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0806115000272"></a>and, indeed, &#147;cremation or burial services&#148;. This is the bit of the Bill where there is actually an undertaker. It can assist in the movement of us all into the next world or wherever we may or may not go. So &#147;undertaking&#148; was quite right. It can also &#147;provide other community services&#148;. Some of us may think that perhaps the HCA will gallop to the rescue and keep all the local post offices going that are closing down, but I do not think that the Government would let it do that.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000017"></a>However, the middle bit of the clause is nonsense. It says that the HCA may,</p>
<ul><a name="0806115000422"></a>&#147;prevent or reduce anti-social behaviour or crime&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806115000273"></a>Then it says, even more ridiculously, that it may,</p>
<ul><a name="0806115000423"></a>&#147;reduce the fear of anti-social behaviour or crime&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806115000274"></a>Many of us spend a lot of time trying to do both those things and the HCA is welcome to do the same, but to legislate and put on record that those are things that it may do&#151;comparable with providing employment or health services, which are practical and tangible things&#151;is nonsense. If it said that the HCA may employ local community support officers or things like that, that might be too much detail but it would be sensible.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000018"></a>One thing that is sometimes useful to see whether wordings make sense is to turn them around and turn them into a negative. If the Bill said that the HCA may not provide employment, that would be a sensible thing to say in terms of making sense; it might not make sense from the point of view of policy, but it would be clear what it meant. But if you said that it may not prevent or reduce anti-social behaviour or crime, that would be complete nonsense.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000019"></a>The reason why I have tried to juggle with the wording in the clause is to make it make sense. Under my amendment, the clause would read that the HCA may,</p>
<ul><a name="0806115000424"></a>&#147;take any reasonable actions ... which are designed to&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0806115000275"></a>prevent or reduce anti-social behaviour or crime.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000020"></a>Whenever people said that they were going to do something or that something was going to happen&#151;that people would be able to go to Morecambe for their holidays next year or whether it was going to be a nice afternoon with the sun coming out&#151;my grandmother used to say, &#147;It might or it might not&#148;. That was one of her stock phrases. Well, I say to this clause that the HCA might or might not prevent or reduce anti-social behaviour, but the legislation ought to be sensible and say something along the lines of, &#147;it will take steps aimed at doing that&#148;. As it stands at the moment, it is legislative nonsense. I beg to move.</p>

Essentially, Clause 33 is in two parts, but paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (g) of subsection (1) very much parallel the functions of the regional development agencies and I wonder what the relationship between those bodies and the Homes and Communities Agency will be. On paragraphs (e) and (f), the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is perfectly correct in saying that the wording is slightly peculiar. I assume that the Homes and Communities Agency itself will probably do neither of those things, and the wording permits housing associations or ALMOs to do them. But we should not have to assume anything  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC157"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about legislation; the legislation should be clear so that we can understand it. The wording, particularly of paragraphs (e) and (f), is flawed.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000022"></a><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0806115000446"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> The one word in the long list of provisions in Clause 33 that mildly surprises me is &#147;religious&#148;, with reference to services. I can see that the other services concerned could well fall under a body of this sort, but religious services imply that some outside organisation would be involved in providing that particular activity. I ask about this only in order for the Minister to tell me that my fears and apprehensions are totally unfounded and it is quite appropriate for the organisation to be providing that service as against enabling somebody else to do it.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000023"></a><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0806115000447"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> What an interesting short debate that was. I take the noble Lord's point. It takes us back a little to some of the debates we had&#151;it seems a lifetime ago&#151;in the opening stages of our deliberations when we discussed the ability of the HCA to provide directly and the need for it to have that power, as opposed to simply enabling other people to do things. In a way, this is partly a continuation of that sort of debate. One of the objects of the HCA, which makes it clear and different from the Housing Corporation, is the explicit requirement for the agency to support regeneration, the development of communities in England and their continued well-being.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000024"></a>We have a clear idea of what we mean by community services and I know that the noble Lord knows that extremely well. Some of those ideas are clearly set out in this list, such as &#147;new businesses&#148;, providing &#147;employment&#148;, providing &#147;business or employment&#148;, providing &#147;safe and attractive environments&#148; and so forth. I will return to anti-social behaviour and reducing the fear of crime in a moment. This is a necessary power and this is a necessary way to express that power in the form of the HCA&#146;s ability to provide directly, because it will be able to do that. Those types of services, essentially created by the HCA but in partnership with local authorities, will make communities viable, sustainable and indeed enjoyable in the future.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000025"></a>I understand on one level, quite rightly, that the noble Lord wants to make it clear that these services are provided appropriately and where reasonable either by the HCA or by any other person or organisation. To address the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, the provision of religious services means communities and community facilities rather than buildings for worship, as I understand it. But when we come to how these services will be provided, what is important is that we must be realistic. We want to retain the power to provide, hence the direct language in the clause, but no community service will be imposed on any local authority. It will be part of the partnership about which we have already spoken a great deal in this Bill between the HCA and the local authority. What does the community need in order to be regenerated, renewed and properly planned and resourced for the future?</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000026"></a>It is important that the HCA has the ability to provide directly, because we know that the capacity of local authorities and local agencies will simply not be  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sufficient for the task in hand. It is therefore perfectly appropriate for the HCA to boost local resources and provide directly what the local authority agrees will make a difference, be it to young people or others. That is very much at the behest of the local authority.</p>
<h5><a name="0806115000433"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000027"></a>It was asked how one realistically imagines the HCA preventing anti-social behaviour or crime. There is a whole range of practical measures, some of which I am fairly sure have been supported in the past by English Partnerships. I think of what we have seen in disadvantaged areas in our regeneration work&#151;for example, community wardens and better street lighting provided directly. We are talking, essentially, about designing out crime. Some of the housing estates that I have seen during the past couple of years, where we are addressing dysfunctional design, lead one to wonder what the architects were thinking of in the beginning. Narrow alleyways, for example, are perfect territory for the runaway vandal or petty criminal. It is impossible either to catch or contain them. We have learned much in recent years about how one can make places safer and design in safety. That is the outcome that we are looking for in those clauses.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000028"></a>Nevertheless, this is a really interesting debate. I am sure that the noble Lord agrees with us that we are right to give such priority to community services and the need to provide. I hope that he will agree that the language is appropriate for the reasons that I have given and that, through the close working relationships between local authorities and the HCA, we will see the changes that we both want.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000029"></a><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="0806115000448"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I wonder whether I can press the Minister a little further. She has not explained the need to provide or facilitate religious services. She has not justified the inclusion of cremation and burial services. I am confused by the term &#147;social&#148; in this context&#151;&#147;recreational services&#148;, one understands. Does &#147;social ... services&#148; mean social interaction or social services in the sense to which we are all accustomed in the local authority context?</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000030"></a>We might be told that English Partnerships had some of these powers and that they should therefore be translated to the new agency. As my noble friend asked, what is the justification for a list rather than a well-being power similar to that held by local authorities? The list is a mixture of services and presumably the physical environment for them&#151;I do not think that it is suggested, for example, that the HCA will undertake or facilitate health, district nursing or chiropody services. Yes, it will facilitate the provision of buildings for them, but why not mention also, for example, buildings for educational services provided by other authorities? It is a very peculiar clause.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000031"></a><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="0806115000449"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> Perhaps I may add to the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I apologise if drawing on one&#146;s personal experience is not always a brilliant idea; it is better to get on to the general propositions. I have been the chief executive of a sizeable non-departmental public body and the chairman of a similar body. When you look at an Act of Parliament,  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC159"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>particularly as a chief executive, you do not want to read things and then go to your board and say, &#147;I hope you will forgive me, chairman, but I won&#146;t be able to do this. This is an aspiration of a department, of the Secretary of State or of a political party, but frankly I will not be able to do it. If, as the months roll by, you find that I am not doing it, I hope you will understand&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000032"></a><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="0806115000450"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am beginning to wish that the noble Baroness had been detained longer at her conference. She has certainly raised some interesting issues. Again, the problem of having a list has arisen. The overriding principle behind these items is that, when there has been question of partnerships building regeneration across the country&#151;that is, in the work of English Partnerships in relation to local authorities and in other ways&#151;these are the sorts of things that local authorities have said they want and they are things that make a real difference. They are clearly not to do with statutory services or providing educational institutions; rather, they are about putting in place things that make a real difference to a place. They are what makes a place safe, attractive and thriving.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000033"></a>The term &#147;social&#148; does not mean social services; it means social provision. That could be community provision; for example, a community hall or somewhere for the voluntary sector to meet and get on with the things that it can do best. It fits alongside recreational activity. In that context, &#147;religious&#148; does not mean building places of worship; it means enabling religious organisations, which sometimes need space for religious community activity. There are many examples of that. Again, it is about meeting the needs of the local community and about what can be agreed between the local authority and the HCA in its partnership.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000034"></a>On that basis, the list is both flexible enough to allow for the sort of innovation and social enterprise that the HCA would be very good at encouraging&#151;that is, providing employment or training opportunities&#151;and broad enough to be able to do the sorts of things that I suggested in terms of the environment, such as attending to proper design. Frankly, people will always be able to point out flaws and criticise this type of set of definitions, but here we have something that is fairly robust and flexible.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000035"></a>With regard to cremation or burial services, my understanding is that, when you are involved in shaping places, whether they are new or old, you have to think of those essential parts of community provision. It may look a bit odd to include that type of service but I think that it makes sense if you are looking at the needs of the whole community.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000036"></a>I am afraid that I cannot do better than that. I suspect that we will have a long debate on this matter at some other point. If I were to write to noble Lords, I could explain in a little more detail some of the rationale behind this provision and the way in which we expect these elements to combine together to fill the picture of community provision.</p>

Notwithstanding what the Minister said, that term continues to contain a serious ambiguity, at least to a man from Mars.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000038"></a>As to religious services&#151;the gravamen of my observations&#151;I should be entirely content if the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, felt any inclination to intervene to say whether he regards what is currently in the Bill to be entirely normal or whether I am being unduly pedantic. If the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is considering bringing forward amendments on Report to tighten up this language, I would be happy to co-operate with her.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000039"></a><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0004.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="0806115000452"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> The more I listen to noble Lords the more I believe there are curious things in this clause that I did not understand when I tabled my amendment. There are some curiosities in it which need bottoming.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000040"></a>There is no fundamental difference between the Minister and other Members of Committee on the need for the HCA to do some of these things or, preferably, to facilitate and support other people to do them. Although there are questions about the religious side of it, I do not believe there is a problem about cremation or burial services. If the agency is going to be involved in building a new town, it may need a burial ground, a cemetery and a crematorium. These are expensive to produce and, left to its own devices, the private sector will not provide them. Local authorities are usually shocked by the cost of providing crematoria nowadays.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000041"></a>There is no argument about the basic need for a clause which allows the HCA to provide or support a broad range of services. Whether the list is correct&#151;or whether putting &#147;community services&#148; down as a catch-all is more minimalist&#151;I do not know, but there are some curiosities in relation to religion and social services. The wording has a meaning. It is okay for the Minister say, &#147;It does not mean social services; it means social provision&#148;&#151;but it says &#147;social services&#148;.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000042"></a>Returning to paragraphs (e) and (f), I am not sure whether the Minister picked up the point I was trying to make. Some of the activities on the list are practical things to do which also provide outcomes. For example, if you provide employment you are doing something actual and practical and you have the outcome of more people in jobs. But with health services&#151;if that is not a statutory service I do not know what is&#151;you are providing something that is not the outcome. If you were putting the outcome in the Bill you would not write &#147;health services&#148;; you would say, &#147;The HCA may improve the health of people in an area&#148;. The point I am making about anti-social behaviour or crime is that what is written down is just the outcome and not the process or the practical action which has to be taken. That is why it is a nonsense to put those two paragraphs into legislation.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000043"></a>I am not arguing about the need to tackle these problems or about some of the things that work that the Minister mentioned&#151;although if anyone knew how to do this perfectly we would be a much better society than we are&#151;but huge and increasing work on the ground is going on to prevent and reduce anti-social behaviour and crime and to reduce the fear of them.

The point I am trying to make with the amendment is that the clause should be rewritten to refer to the process and practical action rather than the predicted outcome.

</ul>
<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000053"></a>The noble Lord said: It sometimes appears that the Bill does not reflect the fact that housing associations are not-for-profit corporations. So if they have a surplus of funds, and many of them do, that money is recycled into additional social housing and provides a useful supplement to any money that they would get, which in future will be through the Homes and Communities Agency. Essentially, this is government funding.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000054"></a>Clause 34(1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0806115000288"></a>&#147;Subsection (2) applies if the HCA acquires, constructs or converts any housing or other land for use as low cost rental accommodation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000277"></a>Amendment No. 79A is somewhat similar. Subsection (2) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0806115000289"></a>&#147;The HCA must ensure that a relevant provider of low cost rental accommodation is the landlord of the accommodation&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="0806115000279"></a>There are circumstances in which there is one type of ownership, but someone else is doing the management. If the housing association is the owner, but someone else is managing, matters could fall between two stools. Both ought to be mentioned in the clause.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000055"></a>On Amendment No. 98, we have to whip through the Bill a long way to reach Clause 71, where we find a somewhat similar situation. That clause defines the categories of low-cost home ownership that require regulation; namely, accommodation for the elderly and so on. We need to pick up this matter and define the low-cost accommodation more fully, because the definition in the Bill is not satisfactory to cover all the appropriate categories.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000056"></a>We then whip through the Bill with a vengeance and proceed to Clause 191 on social housing at page 81, line 22. Amendment No. 109, also in this group, relates to definition. We think that,</p>
<ul><a name="0806115000427"></a>&#147;low cost rental accommodation and regulated low cost home ownership accommodation&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0806115000280"></a>would be more appropriate wording.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000057"></a>These are not attacking amendments intended to limit the Bill; they are intended to make it more precise and more understandable, and make sure that both categories&#151;social ownership that is tenanted and social ownership that involves part-ownership by the tenant&#151;are included in all the relevant parts of the Bill. These are not huge changes, but the Bill would be better if they were written into it. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000058"></a><a name="80610-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0806115000456"></a>Lord Best:</b> Until now I have taken a vow of silence to hasten the passage of the Bill, but this is a point on which I wish to express some views and, indeed, some support for these amendments. At the moment, the Bill distinguishes between low-cost rental housing and low-cost home ownership housing. If a non-profit-making organisation is doing either of those it gets regulated but, if a profit-making body&#151;a developer or a housebuilder&#151;is doing the low-cost home ownership schemes, a much lighter touch regulation follows from the role of the HCA in this clause.</p>
<h5><a name="0806115000434"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000059"></a>I am not happy with grants going to private developers and house-builders. They may do a good job but, if the same grants go to non-profit-making housing associations we get a double whammy or benefit, because any profits that are made are recycled to produce more low-cost rental housing or amenities in the neighbourhood. If over time the asset appreciates&#151;the part that is for rent appreciating as well as the part for personal ownership&#151;that extra appreciation and the equity gain is locked in for social purposes, so long as a not-for-profit organisation is the owner and provider. That does not happen if the provider is a profit-making company or housebuilder. I have always been unhappy with social housing grants being paid to developers and housebuilders in preference to housing associations. For that reason, I would not like to see a special treatment with a lighter touch regulation and less control by the HCA of the product when the developer is a profit-making company.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000060"></a>I have one other reason to throw into the pot why the distinction between low-cost rental and low-cost home ownership may not be quite as clear-cut or permanent as it appears. The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, chaired an inquiry into the future of low-cost home ownership. One of its chief recommendations  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was that in cases in which the occupiers of low-cost home ownership&#151;shared owners and first-time buyers in one of these schemes&#151;ran into financial difficulty, it was often a very good idea to allow them to become tenants and to switch from owning to renting the same property. To make them homeless and throw them on the mercy of the local authority, which would then be required to house the family as a homeless family when they had got into mortgage arrears, would be a roundabout and painful process for the family, compared with allowing them to stay put in the same home and become a tenant.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000061"></a>We call that scheme&#151;that opportunity for people to staircase down and become a tenant&#151;flexible tenure. The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust has been doing that for many years, with all its shared owners. If shared owners and their properties get into difficulty and they cannot remain there as owners, it has been possible not to have to evict them but to keep them as tenants. That way, you do not have the problems that mortgage repossessions, of which I fear we will see a lot more, bring for families who have to move their children out of the school and move away to try to create a new life after the collapse that has happened because their home has been repossessed. So this is a prevention of repossession, with the family then able to get housing benefit to help them to pay rent.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000062"></a>The distinction between low-cost home ownership and low-cost rental housing becomes blurred, in that regard; in good practice, you would allow the low-cost home ownership to become low-cost rental property and not think of them as quite distinct, with two regimes and two different ways in which to work with them. It is a very good idea to bring the two together and, if we are to have a light-touch regulation at all, the proposal in these amendments is that that would apply only for schemes in which nobody was elderly or vulnerable in any way. I would not even go that far but simply put the two together and regard low-cost home ownership and rental as products that are best done by bodies properly and fully regulated. In my book, that would be only the housing associations and those who will come under the full weight of regulation. However, if the profit-making bodies needed to be included, they should be subject, if they have received a grant, to just the same regulatory powers as the non-profit-making organisations.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000063"></a>I support the sentiments behind the amendment and hope that the Minister will be able to look again at this one.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000064"></a><a name="80610-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0806115000457"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My proposal to oppose Clause 34 is included in this group. Some of the comments made just now by the noble Lord, Lord Best, are valuable because there is no doubt that the renting and home ownership markets are closely interrelated, particularly in low-cost property, whether it is designed as low cost or whether it is low cost because of local market conditions. I have two points to make. The first concerns the definition of low-cost rental accommodation in this clause.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000065"></a>What is low-cost rental accommodation as opposed to rental accommodation generally? The housing market is not as buoyant in some parts of the country as in  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>others&#151;I am talking not about the past few weeks, but generally&#151;and market rents are not all that high. People having to pay them may think that they are high, but compared with other parts of the country they are on the same level as the rent you would pay as a tenant of a housing association or local authority. The difference between those rents and private sector rents may not be great or exist at all. If &#147;low cost&#148; is being defined according to the circumstances of the local housing market, there may be a problem. What is desperately required in some of these areas is decent rented accommodation as opposed to a lot of the rented accommodation that exists in the private sector. Some of it is okay and there are good landlords and property companies, but a lot of it leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000066"></a>For people who need to rent, the real need is not necessarily low-rent accommodation in the local market, but decent accommodation. That means housing associations and local authorities, because the housing market in these areas is simply not going to provide a lot of rented accommodation&#151;certainly not that people can afford. There may be a small amount of more expensive accommodation catering for a different market altogether. Coming from an area where the housing market has been depressed for a long time, I am wary of talking about low-cost accommodation. Decent accommodation is required for renting.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000067"></a>My second point relates to one made by the noble Lord, Lord Best, about the relationship between renting and buying, particularly in the case of individual households and individual houses. In some areas, complex regeneration partnerships or packages&#151;call them what you will&#151;are being put together to regenerate the area. They might be regenerating existing properties or clearing properties and building new ones. In many areas, you will be involved in the private sector with development companies. That may be desirable or undesirable but that is the real world we live in and therefore you have to put together partnerships or packages. The houses that they provide will be for sale; whether they are low-cost accommodation for home ownership is a matter of opinion, but some of it will be deliberately low-cost accommodation in relation to the local circumstances. In any case, because of the market it is aimed at, it will have all to be sold at a reasonable price.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000068"></a>My problem with the clause is that public subsidy will in many cases go into those regeneration packages. It will go directly to the developer in return for their selling the houses for less than they would have to if they were funding them themselves. It might be the land or, in some cases, the houses and the land to be regenerated which is provided either for less than market price or for nothing. That is not a grant in the sense that the noble Lord meant it, but it is a direct public subsidy which will come from a public body. That might be English Partnerships and therefore the HCA under the new legislation. In some circumstances, it might be sensible for some of those houses to be provided for rent rather than for ownership. It might be sensible for the development company to be the body which rents them out. The clause might get in the way of that.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000069"></a>It may be a case of the clause being designed for very specialist situations in some parts of the country or of me asking too many &#147;what if&#148; questions, but I can see some problems here. I know of at least two circumstances in which development companies are coming in on exactly that basis; that is, they are being subsidised so that they can provide the houses at a price which might be saleable in the local market. If one does not provide that subsidy, it will be a case not of their trying to sell the houses for a lot more money but of their not coming in, because they would not be able to sell them at what would be the commercial price if they were doing it just as a spec builder. There may be a problem which the Minister might look at.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000070"></a><a name="80610-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0806115000458"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> I broadly agree with almost everything that the noble Lord, Lord Best, said and a lot of what my noble friend Lord Greaves said. The Minister knows of my concerns. I hope that we will have an opportunity to reflect on this matter and that she will come back with her views slightly changed.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000071"></a><a name="80610-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0806115000459"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> The amendments have important implications. I shall break the golden rule that seems to have been adopted today and speak at a little greater length than has been the case to explain the background and implications of the clauses and the amendments.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000072"></a>The amendments are technical and deal with a complex issue. I stress that we share the objectives that they underpin. In response to the question whether Clause 34 should stand part of the Bill, I say that the effect of the clause is to ensure that low-cost rental accommodation provided as a condition of Homes and Communities Agency funding, infrastructure provision, land disposal or direct provision is owned by a relevant provider&#151;which means a registered provider of social housing, an English local housing authority or a county council in England&#151;when it is made available for rent. The clause ensures also that, where the landlord is not a local authority, the tenants and the stock are protected by the stock being subject to regulation by the regulator of social housing. That is a bald statement of what the clause does.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000073"></a>Perhaps I may define low-cost rental accommodation, because it is important to provide a context to the rest of what I am going to say. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked what the definition was. It is set out in Part 2 of the Bill, in Clause 70, and includes not just rent being below the market rate but refers also to the other defining characteristics of social housing; that is, that it,</p>
<ul><a name="0806115000428"></a>&#147;is made available in accordance with rules designed to ensure that it is made available to people whose social needs are not adequately served by the commercial housing market&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806115000281"></a>He is right that the value of homes and the market rate vary a lot according to which part of the country one is in, but that definition essentially serves the purposes of all forms of low-cost rental housing, irrespective of the relative differences in the market.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000074"></a>The noble Lord raised general issues concerning what is required in decent rented accommodation. He argued that decent rented homes are needed and I take  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC166"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>his point entirely, which is why we are increasing the number of affordable homes that will be available over the next few years. We have made a commitment to do that, and a large proportion of them will be social homes for rent. However, I should like to read what the noble Lord said in that general debate and think about some of the issues that he raised, because they certainly go wider than the amendment per se.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000075"></a>Amendment No. 78, together with amendments to Clauses 71 and 191 which address regulations, deals with complex issues. Essentially, our joint objective is that everyone who provides low-cost homes is encouraged to do so&#151;not dissuaded&#151;within a regulatory framework that is absolutely appropriate. Together, the amendments seek to achieve what has been described as a level playing field for private providers and RSLs in the provision of low-cost home ownership accommodation. They change the definition of social housing&#151;the noble Lord spent some time talking about the significance of the change in definition&#151;so that a different subset of low-cost home ownership accommodation becomes subject to regulation. They do that by requiring the HCA, first, to ensure that, once the Bill is in force, any new low-cost home ownership accommodation intended for elderly or vulnerable purchasers is owned by a registered provider and, secondly, to ensure that other new low-cost home ownership accommodation, provided after commencement of the Bill, is not subject to regulation.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000076"></a>I listened closely to what the noble Lord, Lord Best, said, and it is worth setting out the current position before I respond because, as I said, this is a complex matter. At present, all homes owned by housing associations are subject to regulation by the Housing Corporation. As we know, increasingly many housing associations provide both rented accommodation and LCHO but, in practice, the great majority is rented. Rightly, the corporation has taken a much closer interest in rented homes than in low-cost home ownership schemes. For the latter, it simply oversees the sales process, which sets the terms of the relationship between the purchaser and provider, and ensures that purchasers have access to the Housing Ombudsman scheme.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000077"></a>Therefore, my first point is that there has always been a practical recognition that the two sectors need a different weight of regulation, reflecting different circumstances. In future, the regulator will have explicit powers to set standards, and these will be limited to social housing, as defined in Clause 69. Social housing may be either for low-cost rent&#151;&#147;social rent&#148;&#151;or for low-cost home ownership. This means that low-cost home ownership accommodation owned by registered providers will also be subject to the regulator&#146;s standards.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000078"></a>My second point is that the regulator also has powers to set different standards for different types of accommodation and therefore, following the traditional practice, we would expect the regulator to set much lighter standards for LCHO than for low-cost rental. If necessary, this expectation could be reinforced by the Secretary of State through her objective-setting power. Those objectives could, for example, emphasise the importance of the ability of registered providers to provide low-cost home ownership products at competitive prices to meet growing demand. Therefore, although I  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC167"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Best, I think he will agree that there is already some flexibility in the system.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000079"></a>I was asked why we did not take the opportunity to take LCHO away from the full regulation framework. We considered that as a possibility but the vast majority of homes are existing stock. Their regulation can be achieved only through the regulator and we could not retrospectively impose contractual terms. That was obviously a problem, as is recognised in the amendments tabled by noble Lords. But, as several noble Lords have said, low-cost home ownership has already been provided in recent years by the profit-making housebuilding sector&#151;many well known housebuilders, such as Persimmon, Taylor and Wimpey. In the current funding round, Bellway Homes has accepted grants to both build and retain ownership of low-cost home ownership properties on the condition that the company accepts contractual terms that replicate the key features of LCHO regulation.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000080"></a>The Committee knows that we are not requiring the profit-making sector to register with the regulator unless the companies concerned provide rental accommodation. When funding new low-cost rental accommodation, the HCA is logically required to ensure that the landlord is a rental provider&#151;either a registered provider of social housing or a local authority. The same, by definition, is not true for low-cost home ownership, which can be provided by an unregistered provider. The reason is logical. Given that there is successful established practice in the field, given that in the area of ownership more people are able to exercise choice and given that we want to expand to help meet national needs&#151;but also to provide mixed communities, so that some people may rent and some people may own and you will not be able to tell the difference in tenure&#151;we believe that there are sensible grounds for continuing with the light-touch regulation that is now required for low-cost home ownership and which could continue to be replicated through contractual arrangements with the HCA. We think that would provide sufficient protection for purchasers in the vast majority of cases. It does not mean lower standards or fewer controls; it simply means that this is an alternative&#151;and, we think, appropriate&#151;route for the delivery of similar standards.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000081"></a>I recognise, however, that there has been a wide debate about this in the sector, and there are concerns in the RSL sector about the implications. We do not want in any sense to disadvantage registered providers. We recognise that by recycling the profits from their low-cost home ownership into social housing, the housing associations make an invaluable contribution to the expansion of social housing. We do not want to jeopardise that and I am satisfied that the Bill does not do so, for the reasons I have set out. I have, however, asked officials to see what might be done to address the concerns that have been expressed by the stakeholders and have been raised by the amendments. I will look hard at this issue and come back to the House on Report, and hopefully we will have something to offer in that context.</p>

I am sure that on careful inspection there will turn out to be some tweaks and improvements to be made to what we have at the moment, not least bearing in mind my point that sometimes there is a need for flexibility to move from one kind of housing, low-cost home ownership, to another, low-cost rental. Drawing that distinction may prevent that, which would be disastrous for people, particularly if we are moving into an era of a lot of mortgage repossessions.</p>

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and particularly the noble Lord, Lord Best, an acknowledged expert in this field, for his support in principle for what I was rather inadequately trying to describe. It is important that we optimise every possible avenue to get both flexibility and a broad spectrum of choice in this field. We do not like to hear that awful segregationist term &#147;council housing&#148; nowadays. One of its problems was that it was seen as a form of tightly defined community within a community that was different and not bound with the wider field. Although one could perhaps regret the reduction in the number of council house sales, it has been a great social opening for the whole of that community and the community at large has benefited as a consequence.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000084"></a>I am grateful for what has been said. On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about &#147;low cost&#148; as a local definition, it had jolly well better be a local definition. Pendle and Paddington are worlds apart, but both have a need for social housing. Not least of the difficulties for this big national organisation will be that it has to make that kind of differentiation and to make what it does in Paddington relevant to Paddington and not to Pendle, and vice versa. That is one of the big difficulties for the organisation we are creating.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000085"></a>I am particularly grateful to the Minister for what she has said. It seems that we have struck a chord. If she is now going to consider this field to see whether she can come back to us on it on Report, that is be enormously encouraging and helpful. I draw strength from that. I hope that she will take the suggestion that when she has come to a conclusion it might make the proceedings on Report easier if she wrote to us to let us know what is going on, otherwise we might feel tempted to return to the subject unnecessarily and we have spent long enough on the Bill in Committee. In my view&#151;wholly to the benefit of the subject with which we are dealing&#151;when we reach the next stage we should be rather more expeditious, in large part because of the work we have done at this stage.

<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC169"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0806115000092"></a><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0806115000462"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton</b> moved Amendment No. 87:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0806115000290"></a> Clause 35, page 17, line 4, leave out &#147;to the person&#148; and insert &#147;in respect of that grant&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000093"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment makes a technical correction to Clause 35, which gives the HCA powers to recover the financial assistance given by it to the provision of social housing. Clause 35 also gives the HCA powers to direct the social housing provider to reinvest that assistance rather than repaying it. These are powers which have been held by the Housing Corporation since at least 1988 in respect of grant to registered social landlords and are currently found in Section 27 of the Housing Act 1996.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000094"></a>Turning to the remainder of the government amendments in this group, Amendment Nos. 88 and 89, together with Amendments Nos. 91 to 94, which relate to Clause 36, clarify that the HCA has the powers to enter into equity-sharing agreements with providers of social housing. Again, these powers are held already by the Housing Corporation under Section 27 of the Housing Act 1996.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000095"></a>It is mainly through the provision of funding that the agency will drive forward its regeneration and housing delivery, facilitating work between partners and undertaking projects that make the building of homes in some areas attractive to and possible for developers. The agency will seek to build on the success of the investment programme of both English Partnerships, the Housing Corporation and, importantly, the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000096"></a>The ability to enter equity-sharing agreements with providers of social housing is an important part of this and a part of the HCA&#146;s ability to use funding arrangements in creative and innovative ways. But I should be clear that this is not a power that will allow the HCA to share uplift but not downside. As currently drafted, the powers already allow the HCA to recover less than the original amount of grant. These amendments are required to make clear that it may recover more. But this is not just about the agency being able to take advantage of an uplift in value; it would be expected to share a proportion of any downturn as well.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000097"></a>This is not a new power. The Housing Corporation is already able to enter into equity-sharing agreements using its powers. In 2006 the National Audit Office published a report into low-cost home ownership, <I>A Foot on the L</I><I>adder</I><I>, </I>which has already been mentioned, and which recommended that the Housing Corporation could achieve better value for money from its investment in low-cost home ownership if it made use of this power. The report recognised that housing associations do not distribute surpluses and that proceeds of sales were therefore reinvested in the affordable housing sector. However, it recommended that the amount recycled through the recycled capital grant fund, in accordance with a determination by the Housing Corporation, should be linked to the value of the property, not just the sum of the original grant. That is designed to ensure that reinvestment of the full value of taxpayers&#146; contribution was focused on national and regional housing priorities.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC170"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="0806115000436"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000098"></a>Following that recommendation, the corporation consulted with registered social landlords on establishing that link to value and it was subsequently agreed by the corporation&#146;s board that such a link should be made. However the introduction of the link was suspended in the context of the excellent value bids for developing shared ownership homes in the 2008-11 funding round and the introduction of new equity loan products with registered social landlords and private finance partners. While these powers have not yet been used by the corporation, the concept is well established and has been discussed in detail with the RSL sector.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000099"></a>It is also worth bearing in mind that in future the HCA will not be dealing only with housing associations, as it will have powers to enter into funding agreements with profit-making bodies which are not under the same limits as housing associations in terms of how they can spend any surplus. This power will therefore be an important tool for the Homes and Communities Agency to ensure that it achieves value for money from its investment in social housing through profit-making providers.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000100"></a>Amendment No. 90A is also in this group and I should briefly describe its effect. It gives the HCA powers to reduce, suspend or require repayment or reapplication of grant in specified circumstances. These existing powers are used by the Housing Corporation and are in Section 27 of the Housing Act 1996. They will give the HCA important powers to invest flexibly, as well as ensuring that it can achieve value for money by enabling it to suspend or reduce grant payments if a provider does not deliver.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000101"></a>We concede that in this area the relationship between regulation and investment is complex and we propose in these amendments to make absolutely sure that the regulator and the HCA work well together. It is possible that use of the HCA powers under Clause 35(2) and (4) could cause or reflect financial difficulties for a registered provider. If a registered provider is failing to deliver on its investment programme, that could indicate some wider problems and a subsequent reduction of grant could cause further difficulties. It is important therefore that the regulator is fully aware of the HCA&#146;s use of these powers, as it would have been when regulation and investment functions were located together in the Housing Corporation. That is why Amendment No. 90A is needed. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000102"></a><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0806115000463"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I wonder whether I could ask about the direction, which is the subject of the amendments and of Clauses 35 and 36. I find it a curious term, and I should like to understand whether it is intended that the HCA can give a direction retrospectively. I am not quarrelling with the concept of a deal between the HCA and a recipient which enables the HCA to share in the uplift in value and so on. However, I argue that it is improper for the HCA to come back five years later and say, &#147;Do you know? This parcel of land is proving to be much more valuable than we thought when we did the original deal. We direct that&#148;. I think that, as in the fully private sector, two parties should make an agreement whereby one provides finance to the other and, as part of that  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>agreement, the provider of the finance says, &#147;We will have interest. We will have a share of the capital when the property is disposed of&#148; and so on. That is a matter for agreement between the parties when the finance is made available. It is perfectly proper that they should come to whatever agreement suits them both but, frankly, for there to be any lack of certainty about what the HCA will require at the end of a process of development seems wrong.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000103"></a><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0806115000464"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> We also have concerns, in particular with Amendment No. 91. If the Homes and Communities Agency is planning to take part in enhanced values, presumably it is planning to pay the increased subscription if the values go down. That might be rather interesting in the present circumstances. You cannot have one without the other. If there is to be a system of grant which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, is fixed and finite at the point it is agreed, that is fine, but if a grant is subsequently variable if values are enhanced in one direction, there has to be variability if the values happen to go the other way, and that is certainly not written into this provision. That situation would be very dangerous and I do not think that we should go down that road. So far as I can see, it would create a whole new architecture for grants in this field. We know that if housing associations find themselves with surpluses, those surpluses are reinvested in more housing, which is surely what one wants. If there were a threat of some of the value being creamed off and being put back into the middle again, that would destroy any incentive that associations might have to try to produce a surplus for more housing. Therefore, we cannot agree to this group of amendments and to Amendment No. 91 in particular.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000104"></a><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0806115000465"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> It seems rather curious that the Bill as it stood went through the other place and then Amendment No. 91 came up. The amendment seems to have been thought of at a time when the financial situation for housing associations, and indeed for anyone who was involved with housing, was rather different from how it is now. As my noble friend Lady Hamwee said, the principle that the taxpayer should get an equitable return is perfectly fine and fair. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that there had been discussions with the RSL sector, but those discussions certainly do not seem to chime with discussions that some of us have had with the same sector, in which concerns were raised.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000105"></a>The attitude of those in the sector is that they take a risk at a given point in certain circumstances in the financial environment that exists at the time of taking the risk. If, many years down the road, there is a change in the climate, that will not necessarily have been predictable at the time that people were deciding what risks to take. You find yourself in a situation where there is a target of 3 million homes by 2020. It is going to be a jolly difficult target to achieve in the present climate, we all know that, but the idea that we then hamper the ability of a sector that provides nearly half of that housing&#151;social affordable housing, the housing that the Government want to put through with the Bill&#151;and create a hurdle for it, or at least

You cannot ignore the principles and do something completely different which is thought to be appropriate in a particular case. The amendment seeks to bring subsection (7)(b) into line with subsection (7)(a) so that it should not be seen as an alternative. That seems to me to be the principle of how things should happen. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000127"></a><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew34"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0006.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="0806115000479"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I shall deal with the amendments together. As the noble Lord has explained, Amendment No. 90B would require the HCA to consult on the events which might lead it to exercise its powers in relation to the recovery or recycling of social housing assistance and to publish the outcome of that consultation at least one month prior to it taking effect. The same requirements for consultation and publicity apply to the principles under which the HCA will act in dealing with these issues. The amendment is not necessary. Consultation arrangements in relation to general determinations under this clause are set out in Clause 37.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000128"></a>The HCA is required to consult the regulator and other interested parties and to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s consent. &#147;General determinations&#148; is defined in the clause as a determination which does not relate solely to a particular case. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would apply his proposed consultation procedure to all determinations, both general and those relating to a particular case. A three-month consultation period and a month-long pre-implementation publicity requirement is perhaps over the top and rather extreme in relation to a determination affecting one provider. It would be unduly bureaucratic and an inefficient use of time and resources.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000129"></a>The current arrangement for the Housing Corporation enables it to issue special determinations that relate solely to a particular case. However, they are rare, and are generally in response to a request from a provider, usually because it wishes to use recycled funds for a scheme that is broadly in line with the general determination but which in some way does not meet the precise requirements. In those circumstances, providers have to apply to the corporation for a special determination. Current practice is for that approval to be signed off by the corporation's board. The Bill provides for a suitable level of consultation on general determinations. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would be unduly burdensome as it would apply to the smallest of determinations made under this clause, which would be unreasonable.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000130"></a>I now turn to the other two amendments and will deal with Amendment No. 94B first because that deals with a point similar to the one made by the noble Lord. In circumstances where interest is a relevant matter relating to a determination made under Clause 35, this amendment would require the HCA to consult for three months, again, on rates of interest, payable dates and provision for suspended or reduced interest rates, publicising the outcome from such a consultation at least one month prior to it taking effect. This amendment is similar to the earlier one and it may not surprise the noble Lord to hear that we do not agree in similar terms. The consultation arrangements in relation to general determinations under this clause, like Clause 35, are set out in Clause 37. The same safeguards apply: the  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC175"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>HCA is required to consult the regulator and other interested parties and to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s consent. Again, the amendment would apply to all determinations, both general and those relating to a particular case.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000131"></a>It might help if I outline the type of event which currently occasions the Housing Corporation&#146;s use of a special determination relating solely to a particular case. These are made rarely and are generally in response to a request from a provider. It will normally be because a provider wishes to use recycled funds for a scheme which is broadly in line with the general determination but has a small variation. In order to use recycled funds for such a scheme, the provider would have to apply to the corporation for a special determination. Again, current practice is for that approval to be signed off at board level. As with the previous amendment, a three-month consultation period and a month-long pre-implementation publicity requirement would be overkill in relation to the level of determination affecting an individual and particular provider. It would engender an unnecessary level of bureaucracy in relation to the issue that it seeks to deal with.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000132"></a>Amendment No. 94A would prevent the HCA from specifying matters in a specific determination made under Clause 36 which conflicted with principles which are applicable in the case of a general determination made under that clause. We can understand the motivation behind the amendment but we want to see the new agency acting in a consistent fashion. The amendment is perhaps an overreaction to the wording of subsection (7)(b).</p>

<a name="80610-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000133"></a>Specific determinations to a provider will, by their very nature, be out of the ordinary. A specific determination is therefore likely to be required precisely because the circumstances are unusual and consequently it is possible, although unlikely, that the HCA will in these limited cases need more flexibility than would be provided for by the principles set for general determinations.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000134"></a>As was referenced in the debate on Amendment No. 90B, these determinations are made rarely and are generally in response to a provider&#146;s request. Where a provider wishes to use recycled funds for a scheme that is broadly in line with the general determination but is not precisely the same, it will have to apply to the corporation for a special determination to use the recycled funds. Current practice is, as I said before, for that to be signed off by the corporation's board.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000135"></a>The reassurance that I offer the noble Lord is that subsection (7)(b) is not a charter or a blank cheque for setting aside the principles governing determinations made under Clause 36; it is a means of providing for flexibility to be exercised in relation to specific determinations that are few and far between. I hope that the noble Lord will find that arrangement and the way in which it operates to his satisfaction.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC177"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Reading speech but try to address my remarks specifically to these amendments. In summary, their basis is the 2005 Draper report. It looked at 29,000 UK childhood cancer cases from the past 40 years and reported that children living within 200 metres of high-voltage power lines from birth had a 69 per cent increased risk of developing leukaemia in childhood.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000164"></a>However, the biological mechanisms by which electromagnetic fields actually cause leukaemia are not clearly understood. It may be that the fields attract particles or viruses into that range. It is not certain. So the amendments seek to apply a precautionary approach, in line with the cross-party inquiry into childhood leukaemia, whose main recommendation was that there should be a moratorium on building new homes and schools within at least 60 metres of existing high-voltage overhead electricity lines. These amendments aim to ensure that the Government issues guidance on this, so that planning decisions are not made that may put children at risk or that may need later to be revised.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000165"></a>Given the estimates in the SAGE report, 25,000 new homes are likely to be built in close proximity to high-voltage power lines on top of the 25,000 existing homes situated near such power lines. Yet expansion of the National Grid through the Planning Bill and the Energy Bill will increase even further the number of households near high-voltage power lines.</p>
<h5><a name="0806115000438"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000166"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 95F is to supplement the power given to the Secretary of State by Clause 48 to issue guidance to the Homes and Communities Agency on the exercise of its powers. It does not oblige the Secretary of State to give such guidance but instead seeks to impose a duty on the HCA to consider public health. Amendment No. 96A is similar to the previous amendment. It would ensure that a direction from the Secretary of State was complied with by the HCA.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000167"></a>Amendment No. 103A deals with the functions of the social housing regulator, whose responsibility it is to regulate the provision of social housing and ensure a supply of good-quality housing. Objective 2 in Clause 88 is widely drafted. Without the amendment, it would not encompass any measures to address risks to public health arising from electromagnetic fields. My amendment would put the issue in the Bill and is specific to the protection of children from extended exposure to those fields as a result of being housed in zones of electric and magnetic field exposure. It is worth noting that the dangers relate to children, so there is nothing to prevent high-quality retirement homes and retirement community facilities being built in those areas because there is no evidence of a danger to people as they grow older.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000168"></a>Linked to the amendment is Amendment No. 110B to Clause 191, which relates to the standards which may be set by the regulator for registered providers of social housing. It gives scope to the regulator to restrict building of social housing within 60 metres of overhead transmission lines, consistent with the recommendation of the cross-party inquiry. Amendment No. 111ZA adds the definition of &#147;overhead transmission line&#148; referred to in the amendments.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000169"></a>The intention of Amendment No. 104A is to enable if necessary the regulator&#146;s objective to be widened to encompass measures which the Government may bring forward in future; for example, any recommendations from the Health Protection Agency. It would avoid the need for primary legislation to amend the objectives. It is a general amendment which goes far beyond the issue of EMF exposure.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000170"></a>Amendment No. 104B would widen the scope of the annual report, which is intended to relate mainly to financial performance, required by Clause 94. It reflects the recommendation of the cross-party inquiry that new housing and schools should not be built within 60 metres of high-voltage transmission lines and vice versa.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000171"></a>The purpose of all the amendments is to ensure that the Government have the tools they need to put in place precautionary measures to protect children from the risk of leukaemia at the earliest opportunity. I beg to move.</p>

I had to negotiate with Northern Electric for the removal of pylons and the undergrounding of cables to create a site suitable for family housing on the edge of York. I discovered to my astonishment that is perfectly possible to build right underneath power lines despite the risks that the medical evidence has shown. It means that any other developer&#151;not a social landlord such as Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust&#151;is able to pay a higher price than we in the trust might be able to pay for the same piece of land. We need to create a level playing field in which everyone understands that risks are involved, even if the science does not absolutely prove the connection between those overhead lines and childhood leukaemia. It is an anomaly in the system that it is extremely important to remedy at this stage of the Bill. I appreciate that it is possible that either the Planning Bill or the Energy Bill will take this matter on board, but, wherever it appears, I think that there will be considerable support for an amendment to this effect.</p>

It is a change from what we have been discussing so far in this Committee and it is none the worse for that. It is a pleasure to see the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, dignifying the Committee&#146;s proceedings, even on an occasional basis.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000174"></a>We take this matter very seriously, and I cannot possibly improve on the summary that the noble Baroness gave of the Draper report and the research. She was clear that the biological mechanisms are not understood but that nevertheless there is sufficient evidence to give pause for thought about what exposure implies. As the noble Baroness knows, guidelines are already in place in this country to protect people from exposure to ELF EMF, and they are based on the established effects of exposure in these fields. In addition, we are currently considering the need for additional practical precautionary measures to reduce exposure to ELF EMF. I shall say a little more about that but, first, I shall set out the background to this issue.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC179"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000175"></a>As noble Lords know, we take our advice from the Health Protection Agency, including on the matter of limiting exposure to ELF EMF. In 2004, following a comprehensive review of the available scientific evidence, the National Radiological Protection Board&#151;the NRPB, now part of the Health Protection Agency&#151; recommended the adoption of guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, known as the ICNIRP guidelines. They are based on the established health effects of exposure to ELF EMF and set values for workers, building in a significant level of protection. The guidelines for public exposure to power frequency magnetic fields incorporate a further fivefold safety margin from those for workers in recognition of the fact that the general population includes individuals who may be more sensitive to adverse health effects than the working population.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000176"></a>In addition to the established health effects of exposure to ELF EMF, there is also some scientific evidence to suggest a link between childhood leukaemia and EMF exposure below the guideline levels, although, as the noble Baroness said, there is no accepted consensus on a plausible biological mechanism to explain the association. In view of those uncertainties, the Health Protection Agency also recommended that the Government should consider the need for further precautionary measures in respect of people&#146;s exposure to ELF EMFs.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000177"></a>We have a stakeholder advisory group, known as SAGE, which includes academics, people from the electricity industry and pressure groups. It reported in April 2007, setting out what it thought were practical precautionary measures to reduce exposure to ELF EMF. One option was to introduce a moratorium on the building of new homes and schools within at least 60 metres of high-voltage overhead lines and on the building of new high-voltage lines within 60 metres of existing homes and schools. That is known as the &#147;corridor approach&#148;.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000178"></a>The HPA responded to the SAGE report, noting that the corridor option that SAGE considered for separating new dwellings from high-voltage power lines and vice versa was not supported by the cost-benefit analysis, even assuming a causal link between exposure to ELF EMFs and childhood leukaemia. Therefore, it is sensible that a decision to implement this precautionary option should be weighed against other health benefits obtainable from the same resources. Nevertheless, the HPA recommends that, within the existing government planning framework, the attention of local authority planning departments and electricity companies be drawn to the evidence for a possible small increase in childhood leukaemia which may result from siting new buildings very close to power lines or new power lines very close to existing buildings. I am referring to the report there.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000179"></a>Noble Lords can be assured that we are giving careful consideration to the HPA&#146;s advice in conjunction with other government departments and the devolved Administrations. We expect to respond to the SAGE report, and later this year will set out any practical precautionary measures that we think are justified. We believe that any measures which are appropriate in limiting the exposure of the general public to ELF

It is not appropriate in this Bill to place individual responsibilities and duties on the HCA or the regulator, as they will be subject to the same statutory controls, regulatory frameworks or guidance concerning exposure to ELF EMFs as any other body.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000180"></a>I hope that with those assurances regarding our intended response to the report and the inappropriate nature of the amendment in relation to the Bill and the agency, the noble Baroness will be able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

To put it bluntly, what good would that do? If a local planning authority turned down an application because it was concerned about it would that stand up on appeal? I assume not. Will the Minister explain what she meant?</p>

It is only in relation to children, schools and social housing into which families may be housed that there is a concern. Those who wished this amendment to be tabled will be reassured by the Minister's remarks, but I am sure that they will want us to take this further and we will probably do that on another Bill.

In Chapter 5 of the Bill, the heading to the section that includes Clause 49 is headed &#147;Certain supervisory powers of the Secretary of State&#148;.

<p><a name="0806115000190"></a>We have been told that some of the powers in the Housing Association Act 1985, which introduced the Housing Corporation, and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 were followed as a model for the Bill, but in neither of those Bills are the powers as extensive or phrased in the same way. To someone who has worked under Acts of Parliament, they read very differently.</p>
<h5><a name="0806115000439"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000191"></a>We are also facing a circumstance in which Chapter 5 includes arrangements for the merger between the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships. Mergers can be, and often are, complicated and disruptive, particularly if they take place between unlike bodies. Indeed, the Housing Corporation, losing its powers of regulation to Oftenant, is left essentially as a facilitator, historically, with a great deal of money and the ability to make significant grants. It is also the larger body of the two. However, it does not have a balance sheet and is entirely dependent on cash flow, the incoming of public money and the provision of grants. English Partnerships, already itself the result of a merger, is a more executive agency, albeit much smaller. It has significant income and a significant balance sheet, with assets approaching &#163;1 billion, I believe. It is used to dealing on both sides of an expenditure and an income account.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000192"></a>The HCA appears to be designed to achieve the best of both worlds&#151;the world of the facilitator and the executive agency&#151;and it is to be strong and independent. Everyone in the social housing sector will be watching to see whether the HCA will be able to become, and remain, strong and independent. That is even more relevant at a time of housing market difficulties. Yet the powers&#151;guidance in Clause 48, directions in Clause 49 and consents in Clause 50&#151;confer the power on the Secretary of State to exercise the closest form of control that any of us could imagine.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000193"></a>The question arising out of my amendment to leave out the words &#147;general or&#148; in front of &#147;directions&#148; and to retain, at least for the time being, &#147;specific&#148;, is: what is the Government&#146;s intention towards their supervision of the HCA? What is the historical evidence of their use, under the existing legislation, of powers of direction? Indeed, what directions have been given to the Housing Corporation? There is none in its latest reports and accounts other than the standard direction about the preparation of the accounts themselves. What directions have been given to English Partnerships in its annual report and accounts? There is none, other than the directions to do with the formal administrative matter of the preparation of accounts. Do the Government have any other circumstances in mind already that might require the use of the power of direction? If so, what might they be? In short, the general question that arises is: is the regime under which the HCA will be supervised intended to be light-touch or, right at the other end of the scale, heavy-handed&#151;or somewhere in between?</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000194"></a>I have a strong preference for a light-touch regime, and I shall explain why. New towns&#151;indeed, the Commission for the New Towns is part of English Partnerships and is to disappear&#151;and eco-towns are the subject of much discussion. That discussion takes  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC182"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>me back to Middlesbrough, which came up in another part of our Committee proceedings. In 1820, Middlesbrough was a hermit&#146;s chapel on the bank of the River Tees. There was nothing else. There were some surrounding villages such as Linthorpe. Then coal was found in County Durham&#151;coking coal, which was suitable for smelting iron&#151;and iron ore was found to the south in the Cleveland hills. The two came together on the River Tees and created the iron industry, and subsequently the steel industry, of Teesside. Middlesbrough grew apace as a massive housing estate and there was a great deal of housing management to handle the expansion of the coal-mining and iron ore industries and the subsequent metal-making industry. Therefore, there were very strong economic reasons why that town and many others were in particular places.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0007.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000195"></a>Now, the advance of technology is making it much less certain that there will be strong economic reasons for a town being in a particular place. In addition, much of the brown-land regeneration that followed the drastic change in the structure of our industrial economy, in particular, has been done. We have already had examples of that, such as Docklands, Teesside and Gateshead.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80610-gc0008.htm"/>


<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000196"></a>Therefore, in my view, the way forward will consist of a multitude of smaller schemes, some of them very small. If they are to produce the answer of 240,000 houses a year&#151;or should I say more accurately the HCA&#146;s contribution to that 240,000 houses a year&#151;imagination and decentralised partnerships are bound to be the way forward, not a route closely supervised by central government. That is not a party-political point but an absolutely general point. I do not think that any Government could possibly successfully control the creation of enough partnerships and deals in order to create the kind of flow of housing, and particularly social housing, that we need. Therefore, there does not seem to be any strong argument for being able to send down the line to the HCA general directions on top of guidance and alongside consent. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000197"></a><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0806115000489"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> We very much support what the noble Viscount just said. I simply make the point that providing for general directions seems to us to be very close to providing an order-making power without calling it that.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000198"></a><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0806115000490"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This is an important debate and I hope that I can reassure the noble Viscount and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. The description that the noble Viscount gave of the HCA&#146;s character and of its separate paths coming together to form the new body was absolutely right. He was also right to conclude that, as we have said many times, essentially we hope to create an agency that helps other agencies to do their work better. Therefore, one is looking for facilitation and balance in the use of powers and in the enabling mechanisms that are available. This is not a top-down agency with powers to impose or direct. We have had many variations on that debate as the Committee has proceeded.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000199"></a>Perhaps I may address the central point about the power of direction. Essentially, we are looking at powers which are similar to those that were available  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC183"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the Urban Regeneration Agency and the Housing Corporation. Indeed, as the noble Viscount knows, similar powers are in place for the vast majority of non-departmental public bodies. The power of direction is a necessary safeguard to ensure that the agency delivers its objects effectively. However, as the noble Viscount will also know, the important point is that the power of direction, whether it is specific or general, is likely to be used sparingly because it is such a powerful tool for ensuring that the agency delivers effectively against its objects.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000200"></a>Although related to the powers of the Secretary of State to issue guidance, there is an important difference in how this power will be used. The power of direction is separate and independently necessary. While the guidance that the Secretary of State is likely to issue will probably be mainly about how the agency works, directions are more likely to be about what tasks the agency carries out. Both powers should be able to be used generally or specifically; the Secretary of State should be able to specify the general set of circumstances in which the HCA would have to abide by directions. The amendment would restrict the ability of the Secretary of State to influence the behaviour of the HCA by requiring her to issue only specific directions.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000201"></a>The majority of direction issued is likely to be specific in nature, but even those specific directions have been extremely sparing; there are no more than a handful. The noble Viscount has identified some used by the Housing Corporation to dispose of certain loans and to issue an annual accounts direction, which directs the Housing Corporation to include certain financial information within its annual accounts, over and above that required by the Companies Acts.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000202"></a>Directions have also been issued to English Partnerships in the past&#151;and I have four examples of how that has happened, but only four since 1997. There was the direction to English Partnerships to purchase land on the Greenwich peninsula; in July 2000, the direction to dispose of relevant land, together with the Millennium Dome; in 2001, there was the direction revoking the July 2000 direction and instructing English Partnerships to enter into agreement with Legacy plc; and, in November 2005, the direction to purchase the freehold of the Stratford City site, to comply with the terms of agreement with the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000203"></a>Those directions are very specific indeed. The noble Viscount is right in the sense that issuing a general directive would be extremely rare. The Secretary of State is likely to issue specific directions in fairly limited circumstances, as I have suggested, to focus the agency on a particular government priority in a more immediate, formal and public manner than would be achieved through adjusting the agency&#146;s tasking framework. It may be that these circumstances will always be addressed perfectly well by a specific direction; however, there may be occasions and circumstances in which there would be a need for a general direction.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000204"></a>The noble Viscount asked me whether there have been historical instances, whether I could name them and how we envisaged that power being used in future. To my knowledge, the general power of direction has not actually been used, but the sort of thing that we  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC184"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>might see&#151;and it is extremely important that we keep the power&#151;is a general direction that is necessary so that a Secretary of State could envisage the HCA exercising specific powers contained in the Bill. That might be a use of a general direction, but I assure the noble Viscount that we have no current plans to issue any general directions. As I have said, the power that the general direction implies is an important safeguard for the Secretary of State, but it does not imply that there is in any sense a top-down overriding intention to use this in such a way that would be undemocratic or inappropriate. This was a useful opportunity to clarify that and put it on the record.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000205"></a><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0806115000491"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I would not contest for a moment that there have been similar powers in many Acts of Parliament. However, there is a creeping process going on; powers of direction are being added in a way that moves them from purely administrative matters on the one hand and moments of crisis on the other to being drafted so as to enable their use for other things. I was concerned when the Minister mentioned tasks, as the minute you get into tasks you are moving from policy into day-to-day management. If one goes right the way back to Herbert Morrison, that was the greatly beneficial distinction that he drew in the difference between the Government&#146;s role in the public sector and the role of non-departmental and other public bodies. I shall read the examples very carefully. It sounded to me as though English Partnerships had asked for directions in these situations. It said, &#147;The Dome is not really our problem. Perhaps you had better direct us as to what to do about it because we do not know&#148;.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000206"></a>On a general point, if an organisation such as the HCA is to make the best of the task assigned to it, then it and all the people who deal with it need as much certainty as possible. They do not need to be faced with the thought that &#147;If we get a new Secretary of State, we shall get a new set of guidance and directions and our life will become uncertain&#148;.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000207"></a>Perhaps I may give a short illustration of a housing circumstance where uncertainty prevails. As it happens, it does not involve directly either the Housing Corporation or English Partnerships, but it might well do. The complexity of getting through the bureaucracy inevitably involved in an application for public money has certainly, to my knowledge, impeded the conversion of quite a number of buildings in the north of England. I re-emphasise that if we are to meet the housing needs that are clearly there&#151;and all the statistics show that they are there&#151;we shall have to be very imaginative and not sit on the heads of those bodies entrusted with Acts of Parliament and with getting on with the job.

Clause 50 is another example of belt and braces. In Clause 10, consents are needed for compulsory land purchase and disposal and a consent is needed for disposing of things for less than best consideration. In Clause 22, a consent is needed for the making of financial provision. The HCA is primarily attractive because it has a great deal of money, and that is why people will go to it and want to deal with it. We had a debate on Clause 32 and the HCA&#146;s interest in bodies corporate and a debate on Clauses 35 and 36. I confess to the Committee that I do not understand Clauses 35, 36 and 37, and I cannot see what they are trying to do.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000214"></a>When I was striking deals as the chief executive of a public body, we tried to think what was going to happen or what could happen and we put in rise and fall clauses. We had no power to renegotiate contracts except where we could achieve agreement; we could not change them in any other way. In Chapter 5, headed &#147;Supplementary&#148;, Clauses 48, 49 and 50 provide a belt-and-braces circumstance which will not be good for the index of confidence among those who recognise that they need successful partnerships with the HCA.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000215"></a><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0806115000493"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> I support my noble friend. Clause 50(2) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0806115000297"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may vary or revoke any such consent&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0806115000284"></a>which really means that any consent given may be worthless because it may be varied or revoked&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0806115000431"></a>&#147;except in the case of anything already done, or agreed to be done, on the authority of it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0806115000285"></a>That would cover things that had already been done, but if aspects of the consent remained, they could be changed. The consent could be half implemented and, all of a sudden, the other half made invalid. My noble friend has a point. The wording needs to be thought about. I shall be very interested in what the Minister says.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000216"></a><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0806115000494"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I can see how the debate fits in with that which we have just had on directions. I stress to the noble Viscount and the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that this is an important clause. It gives the Secretary of State the power to grant consent to the HCA when it proposes to exercise sub-powers that are subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s consent; for example, giving financial assistance, forming or acquiring companies, or the disposal of land for less than best consideration.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000217"></a>The safeguard is necessary to restrict or control certain important activities. Similarly, we would want to ensure that the financial assistance, for example, was invested only in activities that warranted it. However, we could issue a general Secretary of State&#146;s consent that provided that financial assistance below a specified limit did not need specific Secretary of State&#146;s consent. This limit has not been determined, but we would expect it, if issued, to be contained in the agreed financial memorandum of the agency. I hope that that would introduce proportionate control.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000218"></a>In another place, general consents&#151;particularly, as we anticipated the other day, in relation to the disposal of land at less than best consideration&#151;were the subject of extensive debate. It is entirely sensible to  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC186"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>give the HCA sufficient freedom to operate in the way it considers will best deliver its objects. That includes having the ability to sell land at less than best consideration as long as the transaction is to the public benefit and delivers good value for money.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000219"></a>We want to ensure that the HCA seeks the Secretary of State&#146;s consent when it matters, but not on every occasion that it wants to sell land at under-value. Therefore, we intend to issue a general consent to enable the agency to act without having to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s consent for every disposal and to consult stakeholders about the terms of that consent.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000220"></a>We have begun working on the consent. We will consult on the detail but it has to meet the following tests. First, it has to meet the objects of the agency, which incorporate a public benefit test. Secondly, it must under land-value sales meet the value-for-money tests set out in <I>Managing Public Money</I> and the <I>Green Book</I>, which are Treasury publications. Thirdly, the disposal must not constitute state aid under Article 87 of the treaty of the European Community.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000221"></a>To provide further protection for the public sector, I am minded to suggest that the consent should require the HCA to obtain the permission of the Secretary of State if the unrestricted market value of the land in question is above a certain limit and that this limit should be lower where the land is not to be disposed of through an open and transparent bidding procedure. Those are the principles on which we are working in relation to that specific issue.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000222"></a>The noble Viscount also referred to the ability to vary or revoke consent. The Secretary of State needs that ability, otherwise we will not be able to take account of changing circumstances&#151;we need that flexibility. Subsection (3) makes it clear that variation or revocation does not have effect until a notice has been given to the HCA. That safeguard is built in. Therefore, we do not expect to withdraw or change consent without consulting the HCA. I dispute that the balances are belt and braces; they are absolutely necessary. However, there are conditions which reflect the necessary flexibility without being too onerous or too easy to introduce.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000234"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am grateful for the co-operation of the Committee in enabling us to get to this point today. I appreciate it, and I know we can start our debates on Part 2 tomorrow refreshed and ready to engage in another battle. This group of amendments is minor, technical and consequential. I will not go over them in detail, but I am happy to write on specific points of concern. I shall draw up the main principles.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000235"></a>On receiving Royal Assent, the creation of the Homes and Communities Agency will be brought about, together with the subsequent abolition of the predecessor bodies. Those are the Urban Regeneration Agency, the Commission for the New Towns&#151;English Partnerships by another name&#151;and the Housing Corporation. A significant proportion of the amendments in this group update references in other legislation to those predecessor bodies and make similar consequential changes to a wide and varied list of legislation. They are important and necessary but they are technical and do not contain any statement of policy. Essentially, they tidy up the statute book.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000236"></a>A number of the amendments relate to tax legislation. Like most of these consequential amendments, they seek to provide for the references to those bodies that will be abolished&#151;should Royal Assent be granted&#151;to be replaced by reference to their successor bodies. Our intention is to ensure that the current tax position will be maintained once the new bodies come into being. The amendments do not impose new burdens or lift old ones; they simply reflect the changes in structure that the Bill will bring about.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000237"></a>There are also some amendments to planning legislation; for example, clarifying that the HCA cannot be the hazardous substances authority for land that is used for the winning or working of minerals, or, in England, for land that is used for the disposal of refuse or waste materials. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 is clarified to provide that where plan-making functions are conferred upon the HCA, they may not be conferred concurrently with the existing local planning authorities. Some of the other technical amendments in this group are designed to smooth the transition between the predecessor bodies and the HCA; for example, in relation to the transfer of property between the bodies and board arrangements during the transition period.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000238"></a>Amendments Nos. 118A and 118B relate to the Bill&#146;s territorial extent. On the second day of our deliberations in Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked about the application of Part 1 of the Bill to Wales. She noted that Clause 2 refers to England only, whereas Clause 322 states that the Bill extends to  


<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC188"></a><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column GC188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>both England and Wales. Perhaps I can clarify. The effect of Clause 322 is to limit the territorial extent of the Bill to England and Wales only, except for some consequential matters that may extend to Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, the application of certain individual parts of the Bill is limited further to England only. Part 1 applies mainly to England only, but consequential amendments apply in Wales. Part 2 applies mainly to England only, but again consequential amendments apply in Wales. As I mentioned in my initial response to the noble Baroness, Part 3 applies to both England and Wales. I hope that that is a helpful clarification.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000239"></a>Amendments Nos. 118A and 118B, which amend Clause 322, are purely technical. As I have said, some of the consequential amendments that we are making in the Bill are to legislation that also extends to Scotland. As it currently stands, Clause 322 essentially states that any consequential amendments to legislation that extends to Scotland will also extend to Scotland. It lists one exception: Section 5 of the Mobile Homes Act 1983. The purpose of Amendments Nos. 118A and 118B is to add several other exceptions, drawn from the additional consequential amendments that we are seeking to add to the Bill. Since your Lordships&#146; House is always concerned about workability, the amendments are necessary to ensure that the changes in this Bill work in practice. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000241"></a><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80610-gc0008.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="0806115000498"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> He has got you there. I am sorry, but I have some short questions and if they cannot be answered now perhaps they can be answered later. On Amendment No. 97A, there should be some justification for reducing the numbers. The Minister introduced Amendment No. 97G as simply substituting the new agencies for those that are going, but I have a question about the tax provisions. On page 13 of the Marshalled List there is a reference to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, and I have a similar point that I will explain separately.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000242"></a>I was not clear why it was necessary to substitute the HCA for the Housing Corporation rather than adding it. A similar point arises on page 17 of the Marshalled List relating to omitting provisions in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. The short point, which may come up in other places, is that in tax legislation one is often able to offset payments and use them to reduce tax liability in years going forward as well as in the year of payment. This is a technical point, but I want to be assured that there is no prejudice to anyone by omitting the old agencies rather than simply adding the new ones.</p>

<a name="80610-gc0008.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="0806115000243"></a>Amendment No. 97P relates to making the HCA a local planning authority, which was a point made earlier. I would be happier if that were not proceeded with at this stage. Clearly, we will have a debate about the role of the HCA as a planning authority or not at the next stage. This is an old point about pre-emption.</p>

We need Amendment No. 97A, simply because many of the functions and assets of existing bodies will be transferred to the HCA. We anticipate that only a skeleton body may be left in place pending dissolution, so there is not much point in having a fully staffed board in those circumstances or requiring the Secretary of State to replace members who have resigned or left the board. Therefore, we seek to include a provision to reduce the minimum number of members of the board of the URA. It currently consists of such a number as the Secretary of State appoints and has to have a minimum of six. I ask Members of the Committee to agree that we may reduce the minimum number of members required to two. That is the logic.</p>

<p><a name="0806115000247"></a>On Amendment No. 97P, I think that the noble Baroness&#146;s noble friend Lord Greaves made the same point while she was not in her place, and that we gave assurances then that there was no issue about pre-emption. Actually, we will take her advice and not move it, just in case we accidentally disadvantage noble Lords by leaving it where it is.</p>

I simply record my disagreement about reducing the number from six to two, even though the body is on its way out. Any residual public organisation should have more than two members, but there we go; I shall not pursue it further.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08061086000002"></a>Armed Forces: Personnel</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08061086000011"></a><a name="80610-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80610-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08061086000070"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> Members of the Armed Forces who die on operations or in training are remembered on the new Armed Forces memorial in Staffordshire which was dedicated by Her Majesty The Queen last October. For some months now the military Chiefs of Staff have been giving careful consideration to how the nation might give additional recognition. </p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08061086000012"></a>The chiefs have concluded that the time is now right to recommend a new national award for the families of those personnel who die on operations or as a result of terrorist action while on duty.  This award will recognise their terrible loss and the sacrifice made by their loved one while serving their country. The chiefs&#146; recommendations have been welcomed by MoD Ministers, endorsed by the cross-Government Committee on Honours and Awards and been approved by Her Majesty The Queen.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08061086000013"></a>The recognition will be in the form of a memorial scroll and an emblem for wear.  The scroll will be similar in concept to those that were issued to the families of those who died in the two World Wars and in Korea in the early 1950s.   The introduction of an emblem for the families of those killed is not something that we have done as a nation before but similar recognition already exists, for example, in Canada and New Zealand.  The Chiefs of Staff have also recommended that the award should be retrospective.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08061086000014"></a>Much detailed work will now be required to consider what the criteria for the award should be, how far the award should go back, who will receive it along with other issues such as the design and production of the scroll and emblem.  A team has been established and is pressing ahead with this work.  This is a sensitive and complex subject and we must take time to get the details right.  It will therefore be some months before the award will be ready for issue and I expect to be able to announce more details later this year.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08061086000015"></a>I pay tribute to the bravery and courage that the families of all our serving men and women show and I hope that the new award will provide a more visible form of recognition from the nation for those who pay the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their country.</p>

In June 2007, we launched an extensive consultation process.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08061086000018"></a>We have consulted more than 4,000 carers, adult and young, during a comprehensive six-month consultation process.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08061086000019"></a>Today we are announcing our new 10-year carers strategy, <I>Carers at the </I><I>h</I><I>eart of 21</I><sup><I>st</I></sup><I></I><I>c</I><I>entury </I><I>f</I><I>amilies and communities.</I>&#148; The strategy sets an ambitious vision focusing on providing greater services and support for carers over the next 10 years. Specifically, in the short-term to kick-start the process of improving support for carers, we are investing an additional &#163;150 million in providing breaks for carers, up to &#163;38 million in helping carers combine paid employment and caring and over &#163;6 million in support for young carers. Furthermore, we are committed, in the longer-term, to reviewing the structure of the benefits available to carers in the context of wider benefit reform and the fundamental review of the care and support system. In total, we are investing &#163;255 million in the short-term commitments included in the strategy. This investment builds on the annual carers grant provided to local authorities to support carers (this stands at &#163;224 million in 2008-09).</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08061086000020"></a>This process, although led by Department of Health, has involved work across a number of government departments, reflecting the fact that this strategy sets the agenda not simply for health and social care but across government.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08061086000023"></a>The Economic and Financial Affairs Council was held in Luxembourg on 3 June 2008. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury attended for the UK. Items on the agenda were as follows:</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08061086000024"></a><I>Implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact</I></p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08061086000025"></a>Ministers agreed to the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedures for Italy, the Czech Republic, Portugal and Slovakia. The recommendations for the abrogation were based on the Commission's spring 2008 economic forecasts which confirmed that the deficit to GDP ratio for these member states would fall below the  3 per cent reference value and remain below it in future years.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08061086000027"></a>The council held an exchange of views on the basis of the recent Commission communication marking the 10th anniversary of European monetary union. The communication reflects on the success of the single currency over the past decade, including its contribution to macroeconomic stability, cross-border trade and investment, financial integration, and its role as a world currency. It also highlights future challenges, citing globalisation, climate change mitigation and financial market turbulence as particular examples.</p>

On the basis of the report Ministers noted that Slovakia had met the criteria for entry into the euro on 1 January 2009, pending a discussion by heads of state and government at the European Council on 18 and 19 June 2008.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08061086000031"></a>As formally requested by the UK at the May ECOFIN, member states held an exchange of views on the issue of food prices in the context of recent commodity price inflation. This debate, and the council note which resulted, will prepare the forthcoming discussion at heads level at the June European Council. The UK welcomed the opportunity to discuss this important issue at European level, and looks forward to the European Council discussion producing a strong set of conclusions outlining short-term and mid- and long-term measures at EU and international level.</p>

The council noted and agreed to the progress report from the Commission on the state of play of the Solvency II directive on insurance and reinsurance. Further discussion of the directive will now take place under the French presidency. The UK supports work to ensure more effective supervision of pan-European insurance groups.<I>Deposit Guarantee Scheme</I>Ministers held an orientation debate on deposit guarantee schemes, on the basis of an initial discussion at the April Informal ECOFIN on the functioning of such schemes for cross border firms. The debate gave a political steer for the official level work on guarantee schemes. The UK views this work as very important and has offered to share expertise with other member states based on our own experiences.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08061086000044"></a>Language analysis carried out between February and June for some Somali and Eritrean asylum applicants demonstrated that significant proportions of those tested had claimed to be of a nationality, or from a region or grouping, that was not their own in order to try to gain residence in this country.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08061086000049"></a>I am today launching the National Challenge: a detailed strategy to make sure that parents and pupils experience good standards in all secondary schools, with the expectation that, by 2011, every school will have at least 30 per cent of its pupils achieving five or more higher grade GCSEs, including both English and mathematics. This takes forward a key Children&#146;s Plan commitment. I have placed copies of the relevant documents in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08061086000050"></a>Every child deserves a school where there is effective leadership, with a strong focus on the basics: excellent teaching and learning with good discipline. Schools should have a strong ethos which promotes high aspiration and a love of learning. They must develop the talents of all their pupils and be resolute in raising standards, while supporting the needs of every child. The barriers to learning, both inside and out of schools, need to be overcome by excellent co-operation between schools and wider children&#146;s services, working seamlessly together.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08061086000051"></a>The National Challenge will help make this a reality for all schools. It will end a culture of failure and low attainment. It will confront complacency and provide incentives for every secondary school to improve.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08061086000052"></a>The National Challenge is founded on the principle that schools themselves must lead the changes necessary to meet the 2011 goal by working effectively, and with other schools, local partners, as well as parents, carers and communities, to make sure every child is supported in a way that secures educational success.</p>

Each local authority will need to provide support and challenge to the efforts of schools and take bold steps where necessary to ensure success.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08061086000054"></a>National Challenge schools will be strongly supported. The Government will now deploy&#163;400 million of funding to secure extra support and, where needed, transformational strategies for the most vulnerable secondary schools, with solutions matched to schools&#146; individual needs and the level of risk that they will not meet the 2011 target. National Challenge schools, that is, the 638 currently below the 30 per cent threshold, will be able to draw additional resources, for example in English, maths or behaviour support, to meet their needs. National Challenge schools will also be among the first to benefit from our policies to make teaching a Masters level profession.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08061086000055"></a>The National Challenge will draw on lessons we have learnt from the success of the London Challenge programme, which has already been extended to Greater Manchester and the Black Country. This has given us experience of working with large numbers of schools in challenging circumstances in some of the most deprived areas of the country. It will also be an opportunity for national leaders of education and other strong heads to play a key role in mentoring and in leading partnerships with weaker schools.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08061086000056"></a>The National Challenge will involve the creation of more partnerships between schools, where a strong school may be funded to drive improvement in a weaker one, developing and sustaining a new culture of excellence. Experience shows that such partnerships&#151;usually cemented as trusts&#151;can deliver substantial and rapid improvements in weak schools. Some National Challenge trusts will involve closure of a weak school, linked to a plan to reopen as a new trust school. Alongside the closure plan, we envisage an improvement partnership led by a strong local school, to build capacity and share good practice. In many cases, a powerful external partner such as a local business or university will also add energy to the trust. National Challenge trusts will receive appropriate additional funding to enable the new school to make a fresh beginning.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08061086000057"></a>In addition, the National Challenge will facilitate an acceleration of the academy programme in areas where it is most needed, and particularly in those schools where previous interventions and support have not worked.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08061086000058"></a>The National Challenge will be supported by a panel of expert advisers, under the chairmanship of Sir Mike Tomlinson, formerly Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Schools. They will provide independent expertise in relation to the most significant problems faced by local authorities with National Challenge schools.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08061086000059"></a>The National Challenge is a vital step towards the Government&#146;s ambitions to achieve world class standards in all our schools, to put an end to all low educational expectations and complacency, and to enable every child to achieve success and fulfil their potential.</p>

The review was commissioned in March 2007 by the former Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith, and the former director of the Serious Fraud Office, Robert Wardle.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08061086000061"></a>To support her review Ms de Grazia compared the SFO with two prosecutor&#146;s offices in the USA. Her analysis and recommendations cover the internal workings of the SFO in some detail, and she has also covered a number of external factors which she sees as having an impact on the SFO&#146;s effectiveness. We are very grateful to Ms de Grazia for the extensive work she has put into preparing this detailed report.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08061086000062"></a>Tackling fraud effectively is a matter of the highest priority. The new director of the SFO, Richard Alderman, is taking forward a programme of significant reforms to the SFO, addressing issues of leadership, skills, structures and working practices. He is grateful to have Ms de Grazia&#146;s detailed analysis of the internal workings of the SFO as background to his change programme.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="08061086000063"></a>Ms de Grazia&#146;s recommendations about external factors affecting the prosecution of fraud go wider than the SFO, and provide an interesting perspective for the development of policy in this area, based on US experience.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="08061086000064"></a>Some of her recommendations can be accepted or are already in hand; for example, the Crown Prosecution Service has now adopted the practice of speaking to

The Government intend to extend means testing for legal aid to the Crown Court and agree that legal aid payments should be for outcomes not time spent.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="08061086000065"></a>Not all of Ms de Grazia&#146;s recommendations can be accepted. In particular, the prosecutors do not share Ms de Grazia&#146;s conclusion that the way to address concerns about the disclosure regime is to return to the position prior to the Criminal Procedures and Investigation Act 1996. We keep the disclosure regime under active review and will work with practitioners and stakeholders to identify and implement improvements.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="08061086000066"></a>The Government are committed to ensuring that the legal framework as a whole allows fraudsters to be brought to justice, and have a number of relevant reforms in hand as part of the national fraud programme, implementing the recommendations of 2006&#146;s fraud review. For example we are consulting on proposals for a framework for plea negotiation in fraud cases. A working group is examining Crown Court powers to see whether they are sufficient in relation to fraud; and a separate working group is examining whether there should be a specialist financial court.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="08061086000067"></a>These initiatives are part of a wider programme, financed by an additional &#163;29 million from the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007, including the establishment of a national fraud strategic authority; a national fraud reporting centre; and a lead force for fraud.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="08061086000068"></a>Under Richard Alderman&#146;s leadership the Solicitor-General and I expect the SFO to play a full part in tackling fraud effectively as part of this wider programme.</p>

<a name="80610-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="08061086000069"></a>Copies of the report will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="08061093000021"></a>Lambing can be a source of environmental contamination, as infectivity has been detected in the foetal membranes. However, farmers are obliged under the animal by-products regulations to collect these membranes and dispose of them as category 2 animal by-products in order to reduce the risks presented by transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and other animal diseases.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>Further to the Answer by Lord Rooker on  28 April (<I>Official Report</I>, House of Lords, col. 1), why the Veterinary Products Committee recommended that they continue to license diazinon sheep dips when the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority suspended authorisation for all sheep dips and jet sprays containing diazinon in May 2007 following evidence showing these practices may affect the occupational health and safety of rural workers.

<a name="80610w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="08061093000024"></a>The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) assessed the Australian preliminary report in relation to veterinary medicinal uses of diazinon. It concluded that the report contains nothing to suggest diazinon sheep dips should be banned in the UK. The Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) and the Medical and Scientific Panel (MSP) reviewed the APVMA documents and commented on the VMD report and its conclusions. Both independent committees agreed with the analysis provided by the VMD.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="08061093000025"></a>The primary reasons to conclude that the APVMA's review gave no reason to change UK Government policy on OP sheep dips were:</p>
<I>a</I><I>cceptable daily intake (ADI) for diazinon</I>&#151;concern was raised that the authors of the report had added an additional uncertainty factor into both the internationally accepted ADI and also their margin of exposure determinations and had based their conclusions on the reduced numbers. It was felt that the extra uncertainty factor was not justified and that the standard internationally agreed default values should have been used;<I>differences in personal protective equipment (PPE)</I>&#151;there are significant differences in the PPE required in Australia and the UK. In particular PPE for the torso and legs differs significantly. In Australia, this consists of cotton overalls and water-resistant footwear/boots. The UK requirements are a boiler suit and bib-apron or waterproof coat, and waterproof trousers/leggings worn over Wellington boots. The report does not include sufficient detail to make an estimate of differences of total body exposure due to these differences in PPE;<I>e</I><I>xtrapolation of experimental data</I>&#151;the Australian study was conducted by exposing workers to the various application methods by treating 50 sheep. This exposure was then extrapolated to a total of 2,000 sheep for dipping and 500 for jetting (assuming a linear relationship for exposure). This extrapolation in itself brings a degree of uncertainty into the final results;<I>application methods</I>&#151;the report gives no specific detail of the methods used to apply the diazinon in the study. Therefore, it is not clear if additional worker protection such as splash guards around dips and races were used as required in the UK; and <I>closed </I><I>t</I><I>ransfer </I><I>s</I><I>ystem</I><I>&#151;</I>one critical difference was that in 2000 in the UK the sheep dip packaging was redesigned to prevent operators being exposed to the concentrated product.
<a name="80610w0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="08061093000026"></a>All of these comments were passed back to the AVPMA in response to their public consultation on their diazinon review.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a><a name="08061093000027"></a>The Government are and always will be guided by the best scientific advice. The MSP is tasked with the responsibility of continually looking at scientific papers worldwide and advising the VPC of appropriate action. The VPC has recently confirmed its advice that there is no reason currently to take any additional regulatory action on these products, provided they are used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

These investigations also include another Phytophthora pathogen, recently named P. kernoviae. Only discovered four to five years ago in Britain, both pathogens are considered recent introductions. Both attack the foliage of certain ornamental and understorey shrub species such as Rhododendron, where they produce spores. When heavy infestations of these &#147;foliar&#148; hosts occur, nearby trees become infected, resulting in extensive bark killing and even mortality. Beech is very susceptible and is most at risk from both pathogens, but P. ramorum is capable of causing potentially lethal cankers on various trees including southern beech (Nothofagus), turkey oak (Quercus cerris), red oak Q. rubra and sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa). Native oaks show low levels of susceptibility only in laboratory tests and only one individual of sessile oak (Quercus petrea) in woodland has succumbed to a natural P. ramorum infection. Currently, more than 150 P. ramorum outbreaks have been detected on shrubs in gardens and woodlands, mostly in England, but infected trees have only been found at about 10 of those sites. There are about fifty P. kernoviae outbreaks (mainly in Cornwall with a small focus in Wales) but about 20 per cent have affected trees. Efforts at eradicating or containing the disease in woodland concentrates on destroying infected foliar hosts&#151;mainly R. ponticum. However, Forest Research work shows that even when foliar hosts are removed, both pathogens can persist for at least one to three years in soil and litter layers. FR scientists have also shown that both pathogens can be found in debris on footwear, and probably on vehicle tyres, thus providing a mechanism for local spread into new areas.</p>
