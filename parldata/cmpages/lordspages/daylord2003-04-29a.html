<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Addington </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress has been made by the Adult Basic Skills Strategy Unit in ensuring that the appropriate assessment processes and materials for dyslexic learners are being commissioned to allow access to the core curricula for literacy and numeracy, as stated in Skills for Life.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, Skills for Life is the national strategy for improving adult literacy and numeracy. The Adult Basic Skills Strategy Unit is responsible for delivering the strategy. Learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, including specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, are a priority group for the Skills for Life strategy. In order to improve the quality of teaching and learning for dyslexic adults, the unit has commissioned diagnostic assessment materials and learning materials guidance to improve access to the core curricula for literacy and numeracy skills.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her Answer. Is she aware that I have had passed on to me by the British Dyslexia Association an example of one of the people who operate the helpline saying that the courses provided were not for dyslexics but for those who had missed schooling through ill health or for similar reasons? The effect of one such comment was compounded by an operator saying, &quot;You do not need to worry about it anyway. My wife is dyslexic and runs her own business". Will the Minister assure me that that level of ignorance among the operators of the helpline will be dealt with forthwith? What process is in place to ensure that it does not happen in future?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am very disappointed to hear that example. The British Dyslexia Association is part of the reference group that supports us in our work. As the noble Lord is aware, the purpose of the strategy is to ensure that we assess, diagnose and work alongside dyslexic people, enabling them to be supported as they develop their skills. I shall investigate the particular incident, if the noble Lord will pass on the details. I share his dismay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I understand that representation has been made to the department about the difficulty of taking up to five AS-levels on one day. The example discussed in this Chamber was 23rd May. <P>


<a name="column_568"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 568</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Dyslexic pupils have particular difficulty in that they need assistance while sitting AS-levels. Taking five subjects in one day physically cannot be managed. It means that dyslexic pupils will be exempt from a normal part of the examination process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, that is slightly different from the adult basic skills strategy. I heard about that case over lunchtime. I have asked for a written submission in order to ensure that we can deal with the query. In supporting dyslexic children, we ensure that they have additional time to take examinations. If, as the noble Baroness points out, what was proposed in the course of one day was impossible, it would need to be investigated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, with reference to the core curriculum, is there still a serious dearth of dyslexic teachers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I gather that the noble Lord refers to teachers who can support those with dyslexia or dyscalculia. I did not mean to raise a laugh; I was trying to be clear. It is important that those who have dyslexia can become teachers.
<P>

<a name="30429-01_para0"></a>We are trying to ensure that in education broadly, and in the adult basic skills strategy in particular&#151;the basis of the original Question&#151;all teachers can diagnose and support dyslexic children. We endeavour to do that by working closely with the Dyslexia Institute and the British Dyslexia Association, in particular in the earlier part of education, to ensure that materials are available in schools, and that teachers' training enables them to support children.
<P>

<a name="30429-01_para1"></a>One of the most interesting pieces of research that I have seen recently in this area demonstrates the absolutely critical importance of parental involvement. Students who are supported by parents working with them progress more quickly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, the original Question asked whether processes and materials were available for dyslexic learners. Can the Minister tell us more about adults, particularly those involved in the Skills for Life exercise, who failed to learn basic reading and writing skills, often because they had dyslexia that was not recognised? Are materials available to them under the programme to enable them to pick up skills at a later stage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, it is nice to return to the original Question. In May this year we will publish the diagnostic assessment materials. They are specifically designed to identify adults who may have dyslexia. There are many different reasons&#151;a factor to which the noble Baroness alluded&#151;which explain why adults do not have the literacy and numeracy skills we wish them to have. I understand that an estimated 7 million adults do not have the literacy skills of the average 11 year-old. Many different reasons can prevent their acquiring them, including other forms of learning difficulty or other specific disability. In addition, for various reasons, some adults simply have <P>


<a name="column_569"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 569</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not received from the education system the skills they need. It is very clear that we want to ensure that those involved have the diagnostic skills.
<P>

<a name="30429-01_para2"></a>We are also producing guidance on how to ensure that the Skills for Life materials are more accessible to adult learners and how to recognise learners who have dyslexia or dyscalculia. Materials are available. I planned to send the noble Lord, Lord Addington, a set; I shall also send them to the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Blatch.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Warnock: </B>   My Lords, as president of the British Dyslexia Association, I am particularly anxious for the Minister to reassure the House that the materials will be available to prisoners, many of whom are diagnosed as dyslexic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, we estimate that 80 per cent of prisoners have poor writing skills, 50 per cent have reading difficulty and 65 per cent have number difficulty. Indeed, the materials will be available. We are working very closely with the Prisoners Learning and Skills Unit. It is represented on the dyslexia reference group and we are represented equally on the Prisoners Learning and Skills Unit looking at special educational needs.
<P>

<a name="30429-01_para3"></a>All the courses are available to teachers in the full range of settings, including the Prison Service.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spopq1"></A><B> Baroness Whitaker </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What they hope to achieve for their extractive industries transparency initiative at the G8 summit in Evian in June.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  My Lords, we hope that G8 will endorse action on reporting of revenues and payments in the extractive industries under a voluntary compact being promoted within the initiative as part of a wider agenda on transparency and corruption. G8 endorsement would strengthen the commitment of stakeholders to the principles underlying the initiative and encourage governments and companies to come on board.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Whitaker: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that positive Answer and I congratulate her on her work on the initiative. Does she agree with me, I wonder, that, although this is a relatively narrow and focused initiative, it can have a most powerful impact on enabling political stability and attracting foreign direct investment to developing countries?
<P>


<a name="column_570"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 570</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-01_para4"></a>But initiatives need exemplars to show the way. Can my noble friend say what progress is being made to identify pilot governments who will stick their heads above the parapet and take part; such as, perhaps, Botswana or Azerbaijan?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, first, I should like to thank my noble friend for her comments about my own role. I entirely agree with my noble friend that, although this is a very focused initiative, it is one that could have considerable impact, not least because it would mean that the citizens in the countries that were making these payments transparent would then have an opportunity to hold their governments accountable.
<P>

<a name="30429-01_para5"></a>We are holding a seminar in June. There was one in February. A number of governments, companies and NGOs were involved in that seminar. A number of countries have expressed interest in being pilot countries. At this stage I am unable to tell my noble friend which those countries are; we are still at the discussion stage. But once we have agreement, which may be in June, I shall be happy to write in further detail to my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Sharples: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness please explain in plain English what the extractive industries transparency initative means?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030429/text/30429-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with the noble Baroness; it is rather a mouthful. The complementary initiative to this is called Publish What You Pay, which I think is much clearer. It is about ensuring that those companies in the oil, mining and gas areas which receive payments from governments&#151;that those payments are published so that it is absolutely clear what payments those companies are making to those governments. At the moment those payments can go anywhere and may not actually be used for the good of the country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, but at least there was some tentative suggestion that the oil companies might admit what they had been paying to the Angolan Government and that the Angolan Government might admit how much money they had received. Does this agreement or the discussions include, for example, diamonds? We know that for years the north of Angola has been raped by unscrupulous people mining diamonds and transferring them through Brussels or elsewhere as diamonds from somewhere else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the compact and the current discussions cover the oil, gas and mining industries. In that sense, diamonds would be covered. With respect to the specific question asked by my noble friend about Angola, he will recall that BP tried to encourage greater transparency in its business with Angola some time ago. It was rapped over the knuckles by the Angolan Government for doing that because it was breaking a local contract.
<P>


<a name="column_571"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 571</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-02_para0"></a>The situation in Angola has changed since then with the war having ended. Indeed, Angola attended our seminar in February. Therefore, I am hopeful that Angola will be one of the countries that wants to take part in this initiative in a fuller way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, we discussed this in the debate on Angola in December when the Minister told your Lordships that she had already raised the initiative with not only G8 but also with NePAD. Is it possible that at the summit in Evian there will be not only an endorsement from the G8 but that it will be presented with a draft statement on best practice for transparency and disclosure of payments, involving extractive companies, contractors and host governments? Will the noble Baroness consider extending her remit to cover the international financial institutions, because if they were to sign up to the initiative it would give it an enormous boost?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, first, I should like to say to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that the international financial institutions are involved. It is a multi-stakeholder initiative and part of the criticism of the initiative from the NGOs is that we have gone for a voluntary rather than a mandatory compact. But the reason that we have gone for a voluntary compact at this stage is so that we can keep all those stakeholders on board. We have not ruled out the possibility of going down the mandatory route at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="30429-02_para1"></a>With respect to whether we can go further at the G8 meeting on endorsement, it is partly a matter of timing. It is important to get endorsement from the G8. The further meeting of the multi-stakeholder group will happen after the G8 meeting. It is at that point that we should like to see agreement to the principles, agreement to the action that would then follow and a number of countries coming forward to pilot the initiative.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Greengross: </B>   My Lords, which of the developing countries and the industrialised nations is supporting this initiative?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I have an extensive list of those countries which attended our workshop in February and I shall be happy to send it to the noble Baroness. I shall list a few examples: the governments of Angola, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Botswana, France, Germany, Netherlands, Russia, ourselves and Venezuela were represented, to name but a few. Companies represented included AngloAmerican, the BG Group, Chevron Texaco, Marathon Oil and Rio Tinto. A range of NGOs attended, as well as representatives from international financial institutions. NePAD and UN representatives also attended.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, would it be fair to say that the buzzwords for the Evian summit are &quot;mutual accountability" between north and south? Can it be presented that we have taken forward initiatives on accountability, as have African governments&#151;for example, in the case of NePAD, which was just mentioned? Does it follow that this <P>


<a name="column_572"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 572</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could form part of the menu for strengthening and deepening the NePAD concept between African countries?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the G8 Africa Action Plan will be one of the topics to be discussed at the G8 meeting, and the issue of mutual accountability is at the core of that. Considering the Evian summit overall, responsible economy rather mutual accountability will be the term that the French would prefer to use. However, as regards the Africa Action Plan and the New Partnership for Africa's Development, I agree entirely with my noble friend that those are good examples of us working together.

<A NAME="30429-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether it is their policy that public transport fares by bus and train should rise faster than car running costs.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, improvements to transport depend on sustained investment year on year. That investment will come from both public funding and fares from passengers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, in spite of and, in part, as a result of these adverse price movements, it is a fact that the increase in use of public transport has had only a marginal impact on total transport demand as the economy continues to grow. The nation will therefore have to rely on and continue to expand road transport. What plans do the Government have further to expand and accelerate the use of alternative and less polluting fuels and technologies in order to reduce pollution?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, cares to look at the recent Budget, he will see that very substantial concessions have been made to less polluting fuels. Furthermore, a cut in the duty on bio-ethanol has just been announced. Additionally, changes have been made in regard to ultra-low sulphur fuels. The Chancellor recognises the value of low-polluting fuels and has acknowledged that in his Budget.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, it is an established fact that, as fares rise, one sees an almost linear fall in the use of public transport over the succeeding years. Technically, a fall in use of around 0.8 per cent is observed for each 1 per cent rise in fares. What specific plans have the Government made to ensure that fuel for bus operators is less expensive, and are they planning to do anything to help the industry to help itself, albeit that the investment comes from the private sector?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that sounds like a statistical fallacy to me. I do not deny the <P>


<a name="column_573"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 573</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>statistical relationship cited by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, but the market and activity we are concerned with here is movement. Movement can be by private car or public transport or, indeed, by bicycle and walking. As the Question rightly implies, it is the balance between use of the private car and public transport which is determined by the costs of motoring and the costs of public transport. Therefore the relationship between fares and public transport use is merely a sub-set of that wider correlation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, is not one of the main problems encountered by public transport operators in attracting business the perceived level of their fares against the apparent cost of petrol to cover an individual journey? Is not one of the ways of redressing that balance of perception, therefore, to encourage the expansion of congestion charging and motorway tolling?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure about perceived costs. While it is certainly true that public transport fares, in particular bus fares, have increased in real terms over recent years, that has taken place because we are committed to very heavy increases in transport expenditure as a whole. The 10-year plan discusses expenditure of &pound;180 billion, of which public transport is to take up &pound;120 billion. Thus, as I implied in my first Answer to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, passengers have to play some part in that. However, of course there are exaggerations in the public mind about the extent of fare increases. That is particularly the case in regard to the January increases. The newspapers always choose the particular routes and journeys on which the fare increases in percentage terms are largest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   My Lords, is it true or false that the United Kingdom has the highest costs of transport for the individual by bus, by rail and by car per mile and per minute of both the European Union and the United States?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I think there could be some dispute over what is meant by &quot;costs". The costs cover both fares and the cost to the taxpayer. I would be very surprised if we bear the largest cost, but it is true that we do have higher fares than is the case in many European countries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware of recent reports stating that the Strategic Rail Authority is considering raising commuter passenger fares by 20 per cent? If so, will that encourage people to use the railways?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030429/text/30429-03.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not comment on speculation of that kind. The fact is that public intervention in fares consists of regulated fares. Around 44 per cent of all fares are regulated, and by law regulated fares are available on all routes. Such fares are extremely helpful where there is captive <P>


<a name="column_574"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 574</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>demand, such as for commuter journeys. Regulated fares apply in particular to weekly season tickets. So we do take action on the issue referred to by my noble friend Lord Berkeley.

<P>
<UL>What changes will be introduced in the management of the Government Information and Communication Service following the recommendations made in the ninth report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 5775).

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster   (Lord Macdonald of Tradeston): </B>  My Lords, the Government will give careful consideration to the report produced by the Committee on Standards in Public Life entitled Defining the Boundaries within the Executive, including the recommendations in respect of the Government Information and Communication Service, and will respond in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that that sounds very much like kicking the report into the long grass, as was the case with the preparations of the former Cabinet Secretary for a Civil Service Act? What has got into this Government when they receive a sober and constructive report from a well-respected public servant like Sir Nigel Wicks, yet they continue to prevaricate and stall on something which is blindingly obvious; that is, our public service needs to be underpinned by a Civil Service Act? As Sir Nigel Wicks warned so profoundly, the Government will either go to this by way of legislation or they will be dragged to it by scandal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, the report from Sir Nigel Wicks was delivered to the Government only three weeks ago. It was one and a half years in the making. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, will be aware that when a Select Committee report is produced, a government reply would be expected within a couple of months. So far we have had three weeks. We shall give the report due consideration.
<P>

<a name="30429-03_para0"></a>As regards the noble Lord's concern for the Government Information and Communication Service, he should be aware that, in response to the Select Committee on Public Administration, we have set up a review of government communications to be chaired by Bob Phillis. That review group is inviting evidence. If the noble Lord wishes to submit written evidence, I am sure that it will be happily received.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend said that we may be getting a Civil Service Act, but the ninth report of the Wicks committee pointed out quite clearly that we should not undermine the impartiality <P>


<a name="column_575"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 575</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Civil Service. This echoes the views of the Fulton committee, on which I was privileged to serve some 35 years ago, that there was this kind of danger and that it needed to be taken into account. The blurring of the line between the Civil Service and the Government is a matter of enormous concern. Thanks to Northcote-Trevelyan we have in the Civil Service an institution of outstanding value. Will my noble friend ensure that a Civil Service Act is introduced to deal with this immediate and pressing problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the sentiments expressed by my noble friend. The Government have made clear that they welcome the contribution made by the Wicks committee. Indeed, it is extremely important to us that we uphold the values of the Civil Service, particularly its impartiality. As to the concern for the Government Information and Communication Service expressed by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, I stress that all recruitment to GICS is carried out on the basis of open competition. Appointments are made on merit and on the ability of the civil servants involved to serve any government impartially.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hurd of Westwell: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support what has been said to the Minister. He speaks as if these issues came to the Government's attention like a thunderbolt out of the blue three weeks ago. They have, of course, been tossed around for ever and Ministers must have known what was happening. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, and I belong to a time when there were a good deal fewer and humbler special advisers than there are today. Does the Minister agree that it is one thing for Ministers to have help from special advisers on the political side of their work and quite another to blur the distinction and to put special advisers in charge of civil servants&#151;thus, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, clouding the line of the direct responsibility of civil servants to Ministers and Parliament?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, the House may recall the contribution made by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, on this issue when he explained that his interpretation of the decisions of 1997 to give executive authority to three special advisers under a Civil Service order was a welcome clarification of the pragmatic system that had existed under previous governments. We have been quite open in our dealings on such issues. We have opened up, in a way that was not done before, the appointments system for special advisers. People now know how many there are and how much they cost. We have also opened up the lobby system so that if the Prime Minister's special advisers are involved with civil servants that fact is on the record wherever possible. Through the efforts we have made the Government have gone a long way towards ensuring that transparency becomes the ally of good government and offers continued protection for the Civil Service.

<FONT SIZE=3>Civil Service Act, the Minister came to the Dispatch Box and gave the same kind of dead-bat replies that the Government were considering and looking at the matter. What have they now done? They have appointed another committee to look at it. And yet, on the day that the Wicks committee reported, Downing Street immediately hit back by suggesting that it would be unrealistic for Mr Campbell to stop directing different parts of the government machine. That is exactly what the Wicks committee recommended he should stop doing, and the Government took minutes to reject it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, I do not recognise that interpretation of the Wicks committee report. I stress again that we received the report exactly three weeks ago after it was one and a half years in the making. The noble Lord will be aware that the Public Administration Select Committee has promised that it would evolve a basis for a way forward in legislation, which we have said we would welcome and consider. We await its report in the weeks and months ahead.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, the Government may have received the report only three weeks ago but the section on the Government Information and Communication Service is only five and half pages long, in my copy anyway. The Minister made much of the fact that all was well with recruitment into the Government Information and Communication Service. Why then does he consider the committee felt it necessary to specify in recommendation 26 that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An individual should only be recruited to a senior post in the GICS where the selection panel has a high degree of confidence that he or she will be a leader in upholding the impartiality of the GICS"?

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="30429-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, we believe that that situation exists at the moment and we will continue to support it. I made clear in my Answer that we will give due consideration to the recommendations&#151;34 in total&#151;of the Wicks committee. On other issues we await the report of a Select Committee which has promised to delve in even greater detail into the issues raised in May last year in the debate to which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   My Lords, I was a member of the Wicks committee and we received a great deal of evidence which showed much greater disquiet about special advisers, the GICS and many other aspects of government than the Minister seems to suggest today. Will he keep an open mind when looking at the recommendations, which I believe offer great protection for government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, I hope that there has been no misinterpretation of my views on this issue in the answers that I have given. We sincerely welcome the contribution made by the Wicks committee. My fellow Ministers and I appeared before it. In the weeks that we have available to us we shall give the report the due consideration I have promised. As I said, we will take it into account, along with the <P>

<P>
<UL>Why so many schools find it impossible to fund current staffing levels next year in spite of promised increases in government funding.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the Government have increased funding for schools this year by &pound;2.6 billion&#151;&pound;250 million greater than cost pressures. The Government have cushioned the introduction of new funding arrangements by ensuring that every authority receives a minimum increase of 2.3 per cent per pupil in addition to provision for increased pension contributions and grant changes. However, while central government provides most of the funding, it is for local education authorities to decide education budgets and to allocate funding for schools.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. She is inclined, as is the Secretary of State, to blame local authorities for the failure of the money to reach the schools. Is that fair? Did we not pass an Act last year which passported the money directly through to the schools and gave local authorities very little discretion? Can the Minister really assure the House that, in doing its sums, the DfES made proper calculation for the increase in national insurance contributions, for the increase in pension contributions, for the transfer of pension contributions and for the increase in costs as a result of performance-related pay? Is she sure that this is not another example of a mess of the Government's own making, where the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing as a result of the redistribution exercise pursued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister? As I said, the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing and this is a mess of the Government's own making.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, this is not about the Government blaming local authorities but about a shared responsibility. We provide most of the funding for education but it is for the local authorities to decide the budgets that go to the schools. They decide by how much to increase council tax, if they feel that that is appropriate, how much to spend on central education services and how much money to allocate to individual schools. The point made by my right honourable friend was about shared responsibility. While we have made clear that we have put within the system the appropriate amount of money&#151;including an increase above cost pressures&#151;we recognise that we have to work closely with local education <P>


<a name="column_578"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 578</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authorities to ensure that the money reaches the schools. On Friday, my right honourable friend will be publishing information to help to inform the debate more appropriately.
<P>

<a name="30429-04_para0"></a>Perhaps I may comment on a couple of the points that the noble Baroness made in what was a very long and wide-ranging question. There have been many changes within the system; we believe that we have a fairer funding system. In making calculations, the department looked at all the pressures we knew were under way this year&#151;I have mentioned pensions&#151;national insurance contributions, the shortening of the pay scales, non-teacher pay and so on. Having calculated those pressures, which we reckoned were about a 10.5 per cent increase, we then put in 11.6 per cent over and above the pressures that we had calculated. We are confident that those figures are correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has defended the Government very well on that point. However the truth is that Mr Miliband and Mr Charles Clarke have quite overtly blamed local government. Regarding the pressures that the noble Baroness has referred to, does she agree that national insurance, pensions, threshold and incremental increases for teachers and classroom assistants, the effect of the recent special educational needs provisions, in addition to the Government urging local authorities to spend more on social services and more policemen on the beat, have made the pressures on local government impossible? The local government award to local authorities has not kept pace. Does the Minister also accept that local authorities are in fact passporting &pound;100 million more than the Government say they should in terms of schools funding?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I do not accept the analysis of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, about the way that we are treating local authorities. We are clear that this is understood to be a joint responsibility. What we are aware of, and noble Lords will see for themselves on Friday, is a huge variation, not only in the way that local education authorities work out the formula for themselves, but also variation between individual schools within local education authorities. There may be perfectly valid reasons for that, but I think that is right and proper, with the comments and questions that are coming forward about funding, that we ask those questions. That is very important, when one sees the breadth of the variation. I have the figures from this morning, and I say to the noble Baroness that the number of children with a statement of special educational needs remains constant from last year. The number of children with special educational needs without a statement has actually fallen from 16.8 per cent to 14 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said in her first Answer that the majority of the money comes from central government. Has she just heard it illustrated that in letting that come about the Government have pickled not merely a rod but a cat-o'-nine-tails for their <P>


<a name="column_579"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 579</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>own backs? Would it not be better to go back to local government? After all, were we not once rather good at it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I believe that most noble Lords would accept that it is the job of central government to ensure that we fund education appropriately. I think that that is the right way to proceed. What we do, of course, is to allow local education authorities to determine the way in which they pass money down. Certainly, in my discussions with schools in different parts of the country it is clear that there are different ways of approaching it. They are not good or bad, they are simply different. The impact and effect on schools, when one has the kind of changes seen with the new funding formula, have therefore been different in different parts of the country. That is what local government is entitled to do and there to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say what proportion of the money that goes for education to local authorities actually finds its way into the schools?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, again the information will be available on Friday. Certainly my right honourable friend tells me that more authorities than expected appear not to have passported the 100 per cent through to education, even though in February we were hearing that the vast majority would. Obviously we will have to explore with them why that has happened because I appreciate that there are pressures on local government. They are trying to do the best within their budgets. This is not about saying that they are wrong to do it. None the less, we are clear that the money is for education and needs to reach the schools. That is what we will endeavour to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, over the whole piece, can the Minister tell the House, so that we can be clear about this issue, what proportion of the school budgets has to cover salaries, national insurance and pensions? Those are figures which are determined by the Government centrally. Can she tell us what the proportion is, because that would give us some idea of the discretion that local authorities have?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, it is very difficult to give the noble Baroness those details, because this is about individual schools. They employ different numbers of teachers; they have different cost pressures as a consequence; they have different numbers of classroom assistants. We do not collect the kind of detail that would give me the snapshot that the noble Baroness would like. If I have more information I will write to her and place a copy in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30429-04_para1"></a>The critical factor is to make sure that within the education budget the money reaches schools. We know that, on the current information on the local authorities available, &pound;339 million has yet to reach schools. My right honourable friend has been using a <P>


<a name="column_580"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 580</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>figure of &pound;500 million across all education authorities, which is about right. Maybe that is yet to get through to schools. We are keeping a careful watch to ensure that money is reaching schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that they do not collect the statistics. Every single year at about this time of year there is something&#151;I think it is the Form 7&#151;which gives exactly and precisely the information to which my noble friend referred. The department has that information in great detail for every local education authority in the country.
<P>

<a name="30429-04_para2"></a>Regarding something else the Minister said earlier&#151;the Secretary of State said on 13th February in a DfES press release:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The great majority of LEAs have passed on the increase in schools funding, and we welcome that."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-04_para3"></a>
That does not fit with what the Minister has just told us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-04_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, it is exactly what I have just been telling noble Lords. I said that as late as February my right honourable friend had understood that that was the situation. However, the information that is currently coming through seems to suggest that it is not. When noble Lords have the opportunity after Friday, after the local elections, which is the appropriate time, to look at the figures, they will be able to judge for themselves and come back to your Lordships' House and decide. We have to publish after the local elections, because that is the appropriate way to behave as the Government. It would be completely inappropriate to publish before then, and I am astonished that noble Lords opposite should think otherwise.
<P>

<a name="30429-04_para4"></a>If the noble Baroness is correct about the figures I apologise unreservedly. The information I thought that she wanted now was the full funding formula that we have just put into the system and whether I have an absolute analysis of the percentage that goes on wages and national insurance. The answer to that is no. If I have that available shortly, I will of course produce it for the House.

I would ask the House to return its attention to this Bill only briefly. As noble Lords may remember, we made a moderate number of amendments to the Bill as it passed through its stages in your Lordships' House. The other place yesterday agreed to our amendments and we can feel confident that our scrutiny has left the Bill a better piece of legislation.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para4"></a>It has emerged, however, that there was a minor technical error in the drafting of the new specific clause on jurisdiction that we inserted into the Bill by our Amendment No. 13 in Grand Committee.

<a name="30429-05_para13"></a>The draft of the Bill was sent to the National Assembly for Wales, which consulted widely throughout Wales and considered representations by members of the public, consumer and professional groups, broadcasters and regulatory broadcasting and communications bodies. Wales' specific concerns are the language, culture and technical problems which hinder the viewing and broadcasting of Welsh programmes, particularly in the marches of Wales.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para14"></a>We are therefore grateful that the Bill provides that there should be offices in Wales for Ofcom, but a number of National Assembly recommendations do not appear in the Bill before us. We will come to those issues in due course, as amendments are debated, in particular the establishment of the Ofcom Wales communication council to advise on content and consumer and technical issues to replace the existing consultative bodies; power for the National Assembly to appoint the Welsh representatives on the content and consumer panels; a general duty on Ofcom to consult with and give due consideration to representations made by the National Assembly; and an obligation that Ofcom will ensure that audience research is carried out on a Wales basis and that it will publish an annual report on its activities in Wales. We shall debate those recommendations, but unlike that in Clause 1(6) they do not appear on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para15"></a>It is essential that the principles of the Bill and its provisions reflect the spirit of devolution.

It is hoped that the first amendment will provide an unambiguous basis on which Ofcom can address even the most complicated issues falling within its remit, most particularly those which touch on the public interest.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para22"></a>The Government have gone a long way in meeting many of the suggestions for improvement set out in our report and I am sure that the Committee will join me in recognising that. But at the same time they have <P>


<a name="column_584"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 584</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tied themselves up in knots in persisting with a number of unfortunate notions, among them being a belief that one can legislate for, at all times, giving equal weight to the imperatives of the citizen and the market. It is precisely this issue&#151;the competing claims of the citizen and the market&#151;that lies at the heart of these and many other amendments the Committee will be considering in the coming weeks and months.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para23"></a>This notion of the Government tied up in knots will attract differing levels of sympathy within the Committee, but the job of this group of amendments and others that follow is to ensure that Ofcom is itself saved from being bound up in similar knots.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para24"></a>Governments come and go, but in the coming weeks, if we in this House do our job well, Ofcom can look forward to a secure and productive future. That is why it is so important that we prise the Government&#151;and from time to time the Opposition Front Bench&#151;away from some of the more unnecessarily destructive positions that they appear to have adopted.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para25"></a>Let us start with the concept of co-equality. When looked at objectively it is honestly little more than a seductive chimera. It even has the potential to be positively dangerous. It would, over time, be surprising if many, if not most, of the challenges facing Ofcom do not present themselves as being capable of commercial or market-driven solutions. In fact, the entire Bill is predicated on that assumption.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para26"></a>But not all of Ofcom's decisions can or should be dealt with in that way. This first amendment is intended to give the clearest possible signal to Ofcom that when the public interest finds itself even marginally at variance or in conflict with the workings of the marketplace, it is the public interest test that must be judged not as co-equal but as being of paramount importance.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para27"></a>In a well-run world, it might be unnecessary to insist on any such clear distinction. But such are the powers of persuasion available to the marketplace, and so fragmented and under-resourced are the public interest voices raised in its defence, that it is vital that any unnecessary ambiguity becomes impossible and that a clear distinction finds its way on to the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para28"></a>These arguments were fairly well rehearsed on pages 11 and 12 of the report of the joint scrutiny committee. We pointed out that the self-same Minister who guided the Utilities Act through another place bore the burden of this present Bill, and that in referring to Section 9 of the Utilities Act, which sets out the principal objective of gas regulation, he made it clear that this principal objective was:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to further the interests of the persons who are customers . . .  wherever appropriate, by promoting effective competition".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-05_para29"></a>
Members of the Committee will note the use of &quot;wherever appropriate"; none of this &quot;co-equal" stuff found its way into the utilities legislation.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para30"></a>Dr Howells made it crystal clear&#151;and quite rightly&#151;that it is the customer&#151;or in this case the citizen&#151;who counts. In fact, the Minister went even further at the time of the passage of the Act, saying that:
<P>


<a name="column_585"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the duties form a hierarchy which is designed to assist regulators in resolving potentially conflicting regulatory objectives".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-05_para31"></a>
I am forced to ask the Minister the same question as was asked by the joint scrutiny committee. Can she explain why the common-sense approach that the Government brought to bear in achieving the passage of their utilities legislation has been abandoned, when surely it must have been apparent to Ministers and their officials that Ofcom was likely to be confronted with similar, and I would suggest even far greater, conflicting regulatory objectives?
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para32"></a>It is all too reminiscent of that short-lived concept of &quot;light touch". It might have served its purpose as a headline grabber, but when things got serious the Government got real and sensibly decided in favour of seeking legislation that was appropriate and proportionate. That was probably what they meant all along, but I guess they just needed to hear the argument.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para33"></a>So it is, or ought to be, with &quot;co-equal". It should go the way of &quot;light touch". Bin them both, I say, because both are confusing, both invite dispute and both, as I have suggested, have the potential to be dangerously misunderstood, even so far as leading to the possibility of judicial review.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para34"></a>The Government in their communications Green Paper of July 1998 stated, without caveat, that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The regulatory process starts with government. Regulators must have a clear legislative framework within which to operate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-05_para35"></a>
Surely, all the more reason to listen, as did the joint scrutiny committee, to the advice of the regulators themselves. We were extremely fortunate to have that doyen among regulators, Sir Bryan Carlsberg, advising us throughout the whole of our deliberations. We found ourselves in unanimous cross-party agreement with Patricia Hodgson, the chief executive of the ITC when in evidence she advised that failing to achieve such a hierarchy&#151;the same one which was recommended by Dr Howells&#151;may,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"have a danger of paralysing decision-making".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-05_para36"></a>
This is an area in which speed of intervention is important. A constant theme of the evidence presented to the joint scrutiny committee was that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"slow regulation is ineffective regulation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-05_para37"></a><P>

<a name="30429-05_para38"></a>I beg Members of the Committee to listen, as we did, to Mr Nick Lovegrove, head of McKinsey's telecoms, media and technology practice, who, writing in the Financial Times of 26th November, said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"All of us care as consumers and citizens what happens in these sectors . . .  These sectors really matter to our everyday lives, and OFCOM will need to connect with citizens and consumers across the range of issues".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-05_para39"></a><P>

<a name="30429-05_para40"></a>He added,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"OFCOM will need to remind itself of its primary objective, to protect the interests of citizens and customers. That will require constant vigilance over market structure and conduct since consumers are always the [first] and most direct victims of monopoly abuse or dysfunctional competition".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-05_para41"></a><P>

<a name="30429-05_para42"></a>That is not the plaintive voice of the consumer lobby, but hard-edged, practical advice from someone who spent every day of his working life immersed in <P>


<a name="column_586"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 586</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>these complexities and on behalf, primarily, of commercial interests. Indeed, the Secretary of State herself, in a briefing before the House of Commons Second Reading, made it clear in her own words that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Consumer interests remain at the heart of OFCOM's focus".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-05_para43"></a><P>

<a name="30429-05_para44"></a>So why this lingering and unnecessary ambiguity when it is clearly not intended to be such? It is possible that the Minister and the noble Baronesses on the Opposition Front Bench will find entirely persuasive these and other arguments advanced in favour of these relatively simple but important amendments. I sincerely hope so. Should the Government decide otherwise I am sure that the Committee would be grateful if the Minister were to spell out in some detail the way in which the Government imagine that their doctrine of co-equality might work in practice. One or two hypothetical cases with clear, unambiguous resolutions may well go some way towards reassuring the Committee that the day-to-day, week-to-week functioning of co-equality is in fact possible. What is certain is that she is likely to be offered any number of, I hope, useful hypothetical cases from all parts of the House, which I anticipate will establish that the Government will be doing few favours to themselves and even fewer to Ofcom if they press ahead with this clause unamended. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30429-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   I begin with an apology to the Committee that I rise to speak in connection with the very first group of amendments when I did not do so at Second Reading. I was prevented from doing so by a family funeral. I have another declaration of interest to make. I have a daughter who is a member of the management of the BBC as well as myself being president of IBA and ITC Pensioners Association. I hope that due impartiality between the two main broadcasting organisations may be some evidence of that on my part.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para45"></a>I am happy to follow the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, in what he has said. It is particularly appropriate that this very important Committee stage of a major Bill should begin with a group of amendments that go to the heart of the challenge in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, spoke about making effective arrangements for co-equality. I use a gentler metaphor and say &quot;to contract a happy marriage" between the interest of Britain's global telecommunications industry on the one hand and its essentially domestic broadcasting services with the major core of public sector broadcasting on the other, which, I believe it is fair to say, is the envy of the rest of the world.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para46"></a>As recently as the 1980s, when I was chairman of the IBA, telecommunications and broadcasting lived reasonably happily and largely in separate houses with neighbourly but distant relationships. Now the walls are totally down. Under the Bill, the board of Ofcom will be simultaneously responsible to two Secretaries of State for major departments with important, different and sometimes conflicting interests. Indeed, that is reflected in the rather unusual wording of the clause, in my experience of legislation.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30429-05_para47"></a>It is a case of two cooks in the same kitchen. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Currie, and his colleagues will have their work cut out. It is for that reason that I believe there is immense force in the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, for very serious reconsideration by the Government of their attitude to this matter.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para48"></a>There is now a global market place in telecommunications and some stunning communications technology is competing there. As I know very well from my own experience, that offers very seductive temptations to government. I was a member of a government which trusted too much in what was called, in a famous phrase, &quot;the white heat of the scientific revolution". A lot of good it did for us in the end. I believe that a greater and, I hope, more enduring British achievement lies in our public broadcasting system, from its birth in the BBC, with the creation of a publicly-funded organisation, to an advertising-funded ITV and on to a fourth channel. They are all creations to the credit of the Opposition Front Bench and Conservative governments.
<P>

<a name="30429-05_para49"></a>From these Benches we strongly support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. In a media-dominated age the quality of our lives in the 21st century will be greatly affected by the quality of our media and the degree to which we can, in the words of my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"uphold the principles of public service broadcasting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-05_para50"></a>
I hope that the Government will be persuaded to accept the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. It would also be helpful if they were to accept the modest amendment of my noble friend Lord Phillips and to put the words I have just quoted on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   Listening to the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, made me think wryly to myself that it would have been better if there had been two commissions, one dealing with the market place which he so ably described, and the other with the contents side. But we have moved on from that point.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para0"></a>My noble friend Lady O'Neill had hoped to be here to join in this part of the Committee stage, but she cannot be present for the summing up and therefore decided that she could not speak today. I hope that she will have an opportunity later.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para1"></a>Considerable concern has been expressed in the other place about the wider needs in the interests of the citizen. We have all used that word to great effect to differentiate it from the word &quot;consumer", but for legal reasons it could not appear in the Bill. But there was wider concern that insufficient attention was paid to the needs and the interests of the citizen. These two amendments give the Minister the opportunity to expand on how the Government expect Ofcom to interpret these vitally important general duty clauses as currently drafted. As the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry herself said at the Bill's Third Reading in another place,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Ofcom's general duties are crucial in determining how it will operate".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 4/3/03; col. 777.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-06_para2"></a>
So where better to spell those out&#151;if I may disagree slightly with the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam&#151;than right at the top of this all-important Clause 3?
<P>


<a name="column_588"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 588</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para3"></a>Perhaps the Minister will also explain why the Government felt it necessary to table the amendment which now forms Clause 3(1)(b) when their original view was that the Bill as first drafted was satisfactorily even-handed as between the consumer and the citizen. The government amendment is certainly in my view a step in the right direction but it is still not thought by all to be explicit enough to meet the concerns expressed.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para4"></a>The amendments that I propose spell out in much more detail than the Government's current wording relating to furthering the interests of the wider community that one of the Bill's specific duties will be to promote the communications industry's ability
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to contribute to public, civil and cultural life"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-06_para5"></a>
as well as
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to uphold the principles of public service broadcasting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-06_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30429-06_para7"></a>In this rapidly changing world&#151;above all, it is rapidly changing in communications&#151;it is surely important to remember, and help to retain, the reason why British broadcasting has such a high reputation both nationally and internationally. To inform, educate and entertain is second nature to most UK terrestrial channels even if the highest quality is not always achieved in every programme. But we owe that whole approach to our broadcasting history and to the standards then set. As has just been said, from the early days of the BBC through to the introduction of commercial channels right up to today's interactive, electronic means of communication, as we must now call them, there has been the general expectation from UK citizens that public service broadcasting would form the backbone of what we see on our various interactive screens. That quality of this kind has survived owes a considerable debt, I would argue, to the regulatory framework within which British broadcasting has operated ever since. That expectation is with us still. Indeed, it is here in this very Bill where the proposed regulation for quality as well as the quantity of what is expected from our broadcasting channels is set out. Contrast that with the United States. There, regulation of broadcast content is minimal. If the Government succeed in their policy to open ownership of certain UK broadcasting channels to foreign owners, it will be even more important to have this requirement, this additional safeguard, right up there specifically spelt out as a paramount duty of Ofcom. I hope that the Minister will feel able to respond positively to these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Alli: </B>   The notion of co-equality as between the consumer and the market is one that we have never really carried through in practice in this country. In fact, we have so distorted the market towards the consumer by the very existence of the BBC that it is a nonsense in terms of concept. My only contribution to the amendment we are discussing is to talk about the practicalities of it.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para8"></a>For some time I have worked as a senior executive of one of the major broadcasters. The effect of the measure we are discussing will be to allow me as a <P>


<a name="column_589"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 589</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>senior executive of a broadcasting company to look for a chink in the Ofcom armour and say, &quot;You have to treat my commercial concerns in the same way as you do the consumer. As an executive in a broadcasting company I would not be afraid to take the Government to judicial review". In fact, Ofcom is more likely to be frightened of judicial review than I am as a commercial entity.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para9"></a>It seems to me that the amendments we are discussing would take away the risk of judicial review when the consumer and the market are in conflict. For that reason I believe that the Government should think very carefully about this set of amendments to save Ofcom being tested time and time again by clever executives such as myself.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_time0"></a><H5>3.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I intervene at this point having listened to the two speeches that have just been made. I particularly take the point about judicial review and the point made by the noble Baroness about what has happened in the United States. I shall speak to later amendments on the subject of ownership and other matters in relation to the American experience and shall produce some striking evidence of what has happened there as the monopolies have taken over&#151;those vast companies with their commercial priorities and their ability to dictate events&#151;as regulation has been relaxed in the United States. Therefore, it is important that we give the regulator very effective tools to tackle these extraordinarily powerful international organisations who perfectly reasonably have one overriding objective; that is, the commercial success of their companies. Often they originate in parts of the world where the public service principle has been less well developed than it has in this country.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para10"></a>I believe that the Government have made great progress in accepting many of the suggestions of the Joint Committee on that point. We now have spelled out the importance of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the interests of the community as a whole"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-06_para11"></a>
which I believe is intended to absorb the citizen and makes clear that that is the paramount objective. But we need to give the regulator the tools to do the job effectively. Although the statement about the function,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to further the interests of consumers . . .  and . . .  of the community"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-06_para12"></a>
appears right at the top of Clause 3, the fact is that the clause covers two whole pages of the Bill and contains many qualifications, sub-qualifications and interpretations that will have to be addressed by the regulator. As subsection (6) of Clause 3 spells out, where it appears that any of Ofcom's general duties conflict with each other in a particular case,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"they must secure that the conflict is resolved in the manner they think best in the circumstances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-06_para13"></a>
That indicates the kind of difficulty the regulator will be in in such cases. It will be a fiendishly difficult task. I have been a regulator in a slightly easier field than I think Ofcom will operate in. I certainly would have <P>


<a name="column_590"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 590</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>liked to have spelt out by government and in legislation what the primary responsibilities were. I hope that the Government will listen very carefully to the arguments because I do not think that they are quarrelling with the principle that the consumer and the community interest is paramount. It is only a question of how we best achieve that. The Government would do well to take the advice that has just been given by a practitioner in this field of huge experience and consider particularly the experience of the United States and what has happened there, about which we shall hear a good deal more in this debate. I hope that they will take account of that and move appropriate amendments in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bragg: </B>   I, too, wish to support the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Puttnam and by other Members of the Committee, some of whom were members of the much admired scrutiny committee. My noble friend Lord Puttnam is absolutely right on two vital counts. Our task must be to make sure that Ofcom is founded on an unambiguous basis. For want of a nail finally the kingdom was lost.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para14"></a>As for the phrase &quot;co-equality", it must be put aside&#151;as my noble friend suggested&#151;for wording that, in any essential conflict, loads the argument on the side of the public interest. We will hear the words &quot;public interest" many thousands of times in these discussions&#151;and so we should. We must never lose sight of the fact that the massive majority of people in this country get their news, entertainment and education from television and radio. As my noble friend Lord Thomson pointed out, public interest broadcasting in the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 has been at the heart of our system. It is the way we do it. No fashionable financial flurries, jezabel trends or talk of greener grass elsewhere should shift us from that ground. For most of the British public, for most of the time, for almost 70 years, public service as the character of the British system has delivered.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para15"></a>The sudden arrival of multi channels and the clatter of mega corporations should not break our lines. Just because something is there does not mean that it is good or helpful. Volcanoes and earthquakes come to mind. Both are good metaphors for what has happened in television over the past 15, 10 and especially five years, from four to about 500 different channels&#151;new money, new technology, new impatience, new lamps for old.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para16"></a>The landscape may have changed but the people have not changed much. Not in terms of public interest&#151;which, if anything, is even more precious than before. That is why I so emphatically support the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para17"></a>I wish to bring forward a rather unexpected witness. Mr. Barry Diller may be said to have started Paramount Studios in the USA when he produced &quot;Saturday Night Fever"&#151;which broke all box office records at the time. He went on to become&#151;according to my noble friend Lord Puttnam, who knows about these things&#151;the single most successful American media executive and entrepreneur in history. He seems to be the embodiment of market man and the new&#151;<P>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 591</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the old Adam Smith unleashed. His stake in one of his companies stands at 3 billion dollars and he is the thirtieth richest man in America.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para18"></a>Where does this supreme American entrepreneur feature in debates about British broadcasting in your Lordships' House? He brings a warning. He is the Cassandra that some of us need to jolt us. In a speech to the American National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas on 17th April, Mr. Diller made several observations about what has happened to American broadcasting since it slipped the harness of regulation and went whole hog for the market. I am fully aware that Mr. Diller speaks out of our context and circumstances. Like all warnings, this one may seem overdramatic, but I believe that the Bill might fall into the trap of the unintended consequences that lurk in wait if we do not get the legislation right.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para19"></a>I hope that I shall not tax your Lordships but I would like to quote rather amply from Mr. Diller's speech. First, he referred to America's regulated face until quite recently. It sounds like Eden. He commented that broadcasters were unique because their influence on society probably had no equal:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The houses of broadcasting had to be made of glass because broadcasters were given a free licence to operate, 'in the public interest, convenience and necessity'. That was a source of pride. It was also a source of fear because somebody could come in and take away those licences away. Everyone took those obligations pretty seriously and out of it came a truly remarkable balance between a great business model and servicing the public trust . . .  But in an age when the free market has been the prevailing model this, like every other industry, wanted as much relaxation of the rules as possible so as to free the 'invisible hand' that Adam Smith envisioned, bringing us the wondrous benefits of unfettered capitalism. 'Laissez nous faire'. Get off our backs . . .  We got the Communications Act of 1996. When it was passed, FCC Chairman Hundt said, 'The new law is intended to end the era of big government in communications and begin the era of genuine competition'. And it was embraced with enthusiasm and hope for real competition. What actually happened?"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-06_para20"></a>
Mr. Diller goes into detail but I will pick up on only one or two points:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Today . . .  the great big beautiful tomorrow has dawned. The 500 plus channels that were going to turn the old, heavily regulated world upside down is a full-blown reality . . .  The unintended consequence of deregulation is that the government has inadvertently allowed to happen the exact opposite of what it intended to do . . .  Are we going to get real diversity? The programme departments of these businesses are now so far down the chain of life in these giant enterprises that it is a miracle that all shows on the air aren't about rejection. Conglomerates buy eyeballs. That's it. And they leverage. Oh do they leverage. They leverage their producing power to drive content, their distribution power&#151;such as retransmission consent&#151;to drive new services, and their promotional power to literally obliterate competitors".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-06_para21"></a>
He spoke about local broadcasting, which will strike a chord with many of your Lordships:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Local broadcasters should not be simply the distribution arms of monolithic enterprises. [They] have too much importance in [their] communities. [They] are the foundation of the whole edifice that is television".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-06_para22"></a>
Finally he commented:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The public interest is about promoting diversity, localism and competition. The old paradigm is gone. Now we are in a new universe and the question&#151;is what to do? There are real dangers in complete concentration. The conventional wisdom is wrong. We need more regulation, not less".

<a name="30429-06_para24"></a>Perhaps that seems too heavy a warning. I do not think that it really is. The plotline of those remarks is already recognisable over here.
<P>

<a name="30429-06_para25"></a>I quoted Mr. Diller at length partly to emphasise that we are playing for very high stakes. In our country and culture, I trust that when there is a head-on crisis your Lordships will make it clear that the public interest must always carry greater weight. There is no co-equality. To this and many other amendments, I lend my complete support and I hope that those points will be taken into consideration by the Government.

<A NAME="30429-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   As my name appears against Amendments Nos. 3 and 4, I rise briefly to support all that has been said by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and other speakers. I congratulate in particular the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, on his opening remarks. He struck at the heart of the inadequacy of a Bill that, in many respects, is well judged and well framed, but Amendment No. 1 refers to a mighty and gaping void.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para0"></a>I confess to a little confusion in trying to equate the noble Lord's remarks generally about Clause 3 with Amendment No. 4, which would put the promotion of competition back into Clause 3. The noble Lord seeks to remove competition from Clause 3(1)(a) and to restore it in Clause 3(1)(b). I must be honest and say that I do not see the logic of that, especially in light of the noble Lord's remarks when moving Amendment No. 1.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   The key word is &quot;principal". The intention of the three amendments is to establish a clear hierarchy. The principal objectives are those of the citizen and the consumer but we are not pretending for one second that the interests of competition are non-existent. They have a legitimate place within the hierarchy, but a subsidiary place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I thank the noble Lord very much for that clarification. The problem is, that would leave the provision in the key or foundation clause, in terms of the tenor of the Bill. I urge the noble Lord to consider Clause 3(3)(a), which gives him exactly what he wants&#151;a reference to competition but in a clearly subsidiary place. It refers to Ofcom's duties as being
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the desirability of promoting competition in relevant markets".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-07_para1"></a>
Granted that does not deal with regionality but a subsequent paragraph does so. I flag that up because the noble Lord may on reflection see some merit in my remarks. I will refrain from further comment until moving the next amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Fowler: </B>   If I may say so, I rather hope that the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, does not take the noble Lord's advice. He has well applied the logic of what he has been saying in the Bill. The Bill gives Ofcom a number of functions and duties. As my noble friend Lord Crickhowell said, that list goes on for about two pages. In the words of Dr Howells in another place:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The duties form a hierarchy, which is designed to assist regulators in resolving potentially conflicting regulatory objectives".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee A, 29/2/00; col. 234.]

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 593</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
In other words, one somehow needs to order the duties and obligations.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para3"></a>The point that the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, correctly addressed is this: what are the principal aims, duties and obligations? Then one goes on to some of the others, which are important but not the overwhelming ones. For all the reasons that he and others have advanced, the fact is that the public interest&#151;that of the consumer, the ordinary man in the street&#151;must be the paramount, overwhelming and principal interest so far as the duties placed on Ofcom are concerned. I was also very struck by the words of Nick Lovegrove of McKinsey's&#151;it is not renowned as some curious left-wing organisation&#151;who says that Ofcom will need to remind itself of its primary objective to protect the interests of citizens and consumers, and that that will require constant vigilance. As the noble Lord said, that is not a plaintive voice from the consumer lobby, but hard-edged practical advice.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para4"></a>Basically, I agree entirely with what the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said. The public interest is paramount. His proposal is sensible. It clarifies the position so far as Ofcom and the public are concerned, and conceivably so far as the courts are concerned if there is any challenge of that kind. I very much hope that the Government will listen to what he said.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-07_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   The Bill grants extensive powers to Ofcom, so it is of paramount importance to try to get the general duties of Ofcom right from the start. I therefore entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that any ambiguity should be dealt with now. To that end, although it is key for Ofcom to further the interests of consumers, sometimes the market comes up against the wider interests of citizens. The general duties of Ofcom should, we agree, take account of that as a priority.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para5"></a>With regard to Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4, I believe that in practice any court would find that the duties as a whole set out in Clause 3 were by definition &quot;principal", because Clause 3 sets the scene and everything flows from that. I note what, for example, the noble Lord, Lord Alli, said in relation to judicial review. It is important to negate so far as we can at this stage any question of ambiguity. I therefore see that it would be preferable for the Bill to ensure&#151;it would assist not only lawyers, but all of us and the board of Ofcom in particular&#151;that Ofcom has a clear steer in its remit that &quot;effective competition" should not simply be considered in the round, but qualified to ensure a clear focus on specific national, regional and local communications markets throughout the UK.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para6"></a>Serious questions and points have been raised by Members of the Committee from all parties for the Minister to answer. Given that much of the sentiment and principle behind what they have said today was set out in their speeches at Second Reading, it is hoped that the Minister is ready to answer them this afternoon.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-07_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   The quality and depth of the debate on Ofcom's general duties is a strong indication of their importance to Ofcom, its stakeholders and, of course, the public. The Government have therefore continued to look at the duties to ensure that they are right, and that they give a clear direction to Ofcom and some certainty to its stakeholders. The Government do not accept that what we have ended up with is ambiguous in the way implied by some speakers.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para7"></a>The clause looks different from the one published in draft last year. We have worked very hard to take on board concerns that its drafting did not fully reflect our policy intentions. We have listened and responded. I tell my noble friend Lord Puttnam that that is why we have changed the clause. The Bill in its totality delivers for both consumers and citizens. It reflects our view that the market does not always deliver in the public interest. That has been the underlying position taken by most speakers in the debate. We of course accept it, and the Bill as currently drafted reflects that there are circumstances in which consumer interests are outweighed by the interests of the wider community.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para8"></a>We wanted to be sure that the general duties reflected that more fully, so that Ofcom would be able to make decisions for consumers and for citizens, and would not be open to challenge if, in any particular case, it decided that the interests of people as citizens outweighed those of people as consumers. Clause 3(1) puts that policy intent into legal drafting. Although my noble friend Lord Alli raised the spectre of judicial review, I am not sure of the legal basis for his argument.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para9"></a>It is of no practical significance whether the drafting gives Ofcom a &quot;principal" duty or not. Accepting Amendment No. 1 would make no legal difference whatever. I will resist it, because it would only confuse and not simplify. The clause is complex. Its subsections, particularly subsections (1) and (2), are very closely interwoven. Of course, the provisions need to be seen alongside other specific duties set out throughout the Bill. In some cases, balancing or reconciling the duties will be a difficult task for Ofcom. I accept that entirely, but we should set out the overarching principles and specific objectives and let Ofcom weigh them up as it sees fit in each case.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomson, referred to two cooks in the kitchen. I am tempted to try a pun on the subject of curry, but I will not go down that particular road. I honestly believe that the noble Lord, Lord Currie, and his colleagues will be perfectly able to handle the overarching principles and specific objectives that have been set for them in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para11"></a>I think that it would be helpful if I tried to explain briefly how the first three subsections of the clause worked. Subsection (1) sets out the general principles that will apply when Ofcom will carry out its functions. Subsection (2) gives more detailed objectives in the specific areas of Ofcom's responsibility, covering the breadth of the Bill to which the general duties apply. Subsection (3) then lists those other issues to which Ofcom must have regard in performing its duties.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para12"></a>Having set out how the clause is structured, I would like to explain why I feel that I have to resist the other amendments. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, does not like the formulation of &quot;community as a whole". Amendment No. 3 proposes a different form of words. I am also aware that others believe that the Bill should refer to &quot;citizens", but it would not have been right to do so. In UK law generally, references to &quot;citizen" are invariably bound up with the concept of nationality, as in Clause 4. However, that is not what is meant in Clause 3. We would get into an awful legal confusion if we were to go down that route, because &quot;community as a whole" is right legally. It may appear somewhat dry, but quite often legislation does.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   Would the Minister accept that the Government have recently legislated and used the word &quot;citizen" time and again in relation to citizenship education, which came into schools last autumn? There is absolutely no confusion as to what &quot;citizen" and &quot;citizenship" mean when used in that legislation.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_time1"></a><H5>4.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   I believe that in that legislation, the term &quot;citizenship education" is used as a term of art to describe a particular part of the curriculum. I do not believe that there is particular reference to &quot;citizens" in that legislation. We refer to pupils and students. The noble Lord's intervention does not therefore alter the validity of what I said.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para13"></a>The fact that &quot;community as a whole" may appear somewhat dry does not mean that anything other than an important duty is involved. In practice, it means that Ofcom will be able to consider some of the issues that impact on us as part of a much wider community.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para14"></a>The Bill will deliver in the public interest in terms of, for example, standards and quality, ensuring universal service, maintaining a strong public service tradition and promoting media literacy. All of those are enormously important objectives.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para15"></a>In response to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, Clause 3(1)(b) gives Ofcom the means to consider the public interest in carrying out its functions. In legislative terms, it makes explicit the commitment to the citizen, as well as to the consumer, that the Government have always considered to be central to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para16"></a>That leads me to our concern that the amendment does not adequately express the full range of issues that &quot;community as a whole" does. By explicitly referring to &quot;public, civil and cultural life", it restricts Ofcom to considering only those issues. They may be broad, but they are not necessarily broad enough. We could have a lively and interesting debate about what could be included in such a list and that, I am afraid to say, is where the danger lies.
<P> &quot;Community as a whole" encapsulates the ideas of &quot;public, civil and cultural life", but it is not restricted to those concepts alone. It is about those issues that can impact on society. We will touch on those issues on many <P>


<a name="column_596"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 596</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>occasions in our discussions of the Bill; I refer, for example, to standards, quality, democratic debate and universal service.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para18"></a>We also question the focus of Amendment No. 3, which would require Ofcom to support the communications industry in contributing to public, civil and cultural life. Ofcom's duty under Clause 3(1)(b) is to further the interests of the community as a whole. In doing so, of course, it may require business to do something new, or differently, or to stop doing something altogether. However, business should focus primarily on providing for the market. There may be other means, beyond what business can do, of furthering the interests of the community as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para19"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 follow the drafting proposed by the joint scrutiny committee. I hope that your Lordships recognise that we have taken on board if not the words of the joint committee then much of their spirit.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para20"></a>I regret that I have to say to my noble friend Lord Puttnam that we must go our separate ways on the amendment. The Government have underpinned the duty to further the interests of consumers by promoting competition. The two are closely linked. Consumers benefit from fair, open and competitive markets. I am not sure that there is the same link between competition and the community. Indeed, the wording of Amendment No. 4, by referring to &quot;wherever possible" instead of &quot;where appropriate", would give competition a primacy over everything else in furthering not only consumers' but also the community's interest. Sometimes competition may not be in the interests of consumers or the community as a whole and &quot;where appropriate" gives Ofcom the flexibility to consider what is the best approach in each circumstance. &quot;Where possible" does not enable the same freedom of action. It is important that we maintain that flexibility for Ofcom to operate and interpret the legislation effectively.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para21"></a>I say to my noble friends Lord Puttnam and Lord Bragg&#151;and to the noble Lord, Lord Thomson, who partially supported their comments&#151;that I am extremely puzzled by the references of several noble Lords, including both my noble friends, to the term &quot;co-equality". We do not use that phrase in the Bill or refer to it as a concept. Clause 3(1) creates a single general duty to further the interests of &quot;consumers" and of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the community as a whole".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-07_para22"></a>
The rest of Clause 3 merely expands on that.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para23"></a>I say to my noble friend Lord Bragg, who quoted extensively from Barry Diller's speech, that I agree that there must be a balance of regulation in the market. There is no question in the substantial Bill of abandoning that balance. We are not the United States. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who referred to the United States, that we shall hear more about that in relation to the Bill. However, this is not the United States; this is the United Kingdom. Nor does the Bill introduce a United States model to the regulation of United Kingdom communications. I do not believe that he or any other serious commentator would say that the regulatory framework that the Bill will introduce reflects a commitment to unfettered capitalism, to use Mr Diller's <P>


<a name="column_597"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 597</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>terms to describe some of the developments that have taken place in the United States. More regulation, not less, may be needed in the United States but, fortunately, I am not sitting in Congress defending United States legislation. We must be careful throughout our consideration of the Bill about making direct comparisons that really do not apply.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para24"></a>My noble friend Lord Alli is absolutely right that clever executives&#151;indeed, he is one of them&#151;and lawyers will try to challenge the regulator. However, it does not follow that the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Puttnam would make the situation any better. Nor do I accept his contention that we have created an equality of interest between consumer and market interests, for reasons that I have already given. Equality of interest is, if anything, between the consumer and the community. That is what Clause 3 states.
<P>

<a name="30429-07_para25"></a>I have more or less answered all of the questions that were put to me. I conclude by saying that I do not believe that the effect of the amendment is, as the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said, to create a hierarchy in which competition is subordinate. Indeed, the actual effect is the reverse, because Ofcom would be under a duty to discharge its duty to consumers and the community as a whole by promoting competition wherever possible. Although some have argued for that, I do not believe that that is what my noble friend intends. In light of that and of my arguments for the Bill as it stands, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   Perhaps I may speak for the first time during the passage of the Bill. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Thomson, I feel no need to apologise for not having taken part in the Second Reading debate. Indeed, I have probably placed myself in the debt of your Lordships' House for having kept silent on that occasion.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para0"></a>I agree with those who have acknowledged the debt owed to the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, for explaining an extremely complicated subject and producing a report of the scrutiny committee which clarified issues. That is an almost unprecedented exercise during the litigation process. The noble Lord is to be warmly congratulated on having achieved what verges on a miracle. I am grateful to him.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para1"></a>My point is simple. The Minister did not refer to Amendment No. 3, to which the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, referred. I wonder why the noble Baroness has not said that Amendment No. 3 makes the position much clearer. The Bill as drafted states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to further the interests of the community as a whole in relation to communications matters".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para2"></a>
Hardly a Bill that passes through your Lordships' House is not sprinkled with unarguable pieties. I rather believe that this is one of them. If the Minister has in her brief a fairly extended explanation of what those words really mean, it would be much appreciated. I, for one, would welcome the opportunity of learning. What <P>


<a name="column_598"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 598</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would the noble Baroness say to a member of the board of Ofcom if he or she were to ask what the Government meant by those words?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   First, I welcome the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton. Coming afresh to any issue can often give rise to a greater understanding than by those who have become over-immersed in the detail.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para3"></a>I endorse everything the noble Lord said about the huge contribution made by my noble friend Lord Puttnam to our understanding of these issues. I was also grateful&#151;I do not think that I said so&#151;for his recognition of the extent to which the Government have listened to his words of wisdom and those of the members of his joint scrutiny committee.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para4"></a>In response to the debate, I spoke about Amendment No. 3 for quite some time. Rather than repeating my remarks, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, will be able to note what I said when he reads Hansard tomorrow. I agree with him. I have made clear why I do not think that the amendment helps very much.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   The substance of my question is this. What is meant by the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to further the interests of the community as a whole in relation to communications matters"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para5"></a>
There seems a potential conflict in those words. I should like to know whether the Government have any view. If the Government are unable to explain what those words mean, I shall drift in the direction of assuming that it is just one of those mild pieties which do not mean very much.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   As joint author of Amendment No. 3, I support what the noble Lord says. I find it difficult to understand why our phrases were rejected. They were far more explicit than the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to further the interests of the community as a whole".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para6"></a>
The wording of the amendment may not be perfect. It may not include everything that should be included. I had hoped for a fuller explanation of why the words in the Bill as drafted are preferable to those we suggest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   I think that I have given as full an explanation as I can of why the words on the face of the Bill are preferable to those of Amendment No. 3. The words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to further the interests of the community as a whole in relation to communications matters",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para7"></a>
are used to restrain Ofcom from attempting to further the interests of the community in matters which have nothing to do with communications. I think that everyone can see the common sense of that. Confident as I am in the ability of the chairman of Ofcom, the noble Lord, Lord Currie, and his colleagues to do their <P>


<a name="column_599"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 599</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>job in a sensible way, it is important that we restrict in legislation the extent of their operation. That is what those words are meant to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   To say that I am disappointed would be an understatement. With the agreement of my colleagues on the joint scrutiny committee, we shall not press any amendments to a vote today. However, it begs enormous questions. First, the issue is relatively simple. I hope that the situation is not indicative of an overall government obduracy when dealing with the many amendments that will emerge over the next dozen days in Committee. That worries me.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para8"></a>Secondly, where do the Government obtain their advice? I have talked to every industry professional I could. I have talked to every regulator who I believed had experience of this area. The advice is consistent. It is all of a piece with the amendment. I have also talked to a number of lawyers. The Government's record in taking on legally the commercial sector is not strong. Perhaps it could be said that the Minister is praying in aid the noble Lord, Lord Currie. I should be impressed if the Minister can assure us that the wording of the Bill is that which the noble Lord, Lord Currie, would most like to enable him to deal with vexatious, difficult and conflicting issues as they arise. I doubt it. So from where are the Government getting their advice? I am happy to withdraw the amendment and look forward to returning to the issue on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

I was struck by the fact that the noble Lords, Lord Puttnam, Lord Bragg, Lord Thomson of Monifieth and Lord Crickhowell, stated explicitly that they wanted the principles of public service broadcasting to be upheld. I confess that those of us who bat on this side of the argument need to get our act together before Report.

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 600</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para17"></a>Clause 3(1) seems to me to be the foundation clause of the Bill. To insert in the Bill the words in Amendment No. 5 would have great merit. Clause 3(1)(b) would then read as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to further the interests of the community as a whole in relation to communications matters and to uphold the principles of public service broadcasting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para18"></a>
I should like to think that in the long dark nights during which he or she, the director-general of Ofcom, will have to construe this mammoth work&#151;500 pages of dense parliamentary drafting&#151;it will be of great help to have more specific general guidance in so doing. I agree with those who said that the phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to further the interests of the community as a whole",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para19"></a>
in relation to communication matters is not nearly as helpful as it could and should be. The sense I have so far is that people would like to see the time-honoured phrase, &quot;public service broadcasting", find a place at this particular juncture in the Bill bearing in mind that the preamble refers to the Bill making provision,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"about the regulation of broadcasting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para20"></a><P>

<a name="30429-08_para21"></a>There is very little in the Bill which goes further than that. Even Clause 3, over 100 lines of print, has virtually no further light to cast upon the tender subsection 3(1)(b). I could not see any reference to it at any point in the remainder of this long clause. The whole bias and balance of the clause, and, indeed of the Bill as a whole, concerns technicalities of broadcasting, the mechanics of broadcasting, market force considerations and competition considerations. I do not think anyone will say that those are not vitally important, but those of us who support the previous set of amendments and, I hope, this set of amendments will say with a loud voice that there has to be a hierarchy of values, at the head of which should be issues concerning public service broadcasting.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para22"></a>What about public service broadcasting? It is interesting that on 5th May 1999 in this House we had a debate entitled &quot;Public Service Broadcasting", advanced, I believe, by my noble friend Lord Falkland.

<A NAME="30429-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   It is interesting that in the course of that debate the good Lord McIntosh, who I am delighted to see in his place, speaking for the Government, said:

<a name="30429-08_para24"></a>
That is crucial to the sense of the amendment. This is not a set of value issues to be confined to the BBC and those other parts of the broadcasting empire which have express statutory public service duties cast upon them. This is for the whole of broadcasting.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para25"></a>I share the fear expressed in the first group of amendments about the way the world is going and the inexorable commercial pressures that bear down on <P>


<a name="column_601"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 601</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the commercial producers, whether of sound or vision. One has only to consider the decline in advertising revenue to appreciate what further pressures they are under. In a sense, not only would it help the director-general to have something more crisp and understandable at the heart of the Bill, such as is proposed by the amendment; it would help those within the commercial radio and television world who care about standards, the product and original material to stand up to some of those who would simply have them follow the short and brutal course.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para26"></a>I am also confused as to why the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, whose own cultural credentials are impeccable, was so unsympathetic to the first set of amendments. On 26th November the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport issued a landmark press notice which summarised the provisions of the Bill and stated four &quot;key principles", the fourth of which is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ensuring that public service principles remain at the heart of British broadcasting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para27"></a>
The noble Baroness, in responding to the amendment may say, &quot;Of course, that is exactly what we want". Why not say that? Why not put it there flat on the face of the Bill with no ifs and buts and no wishy-washy language such as one can describe the language in Clause 3(1)(b)? Let us have it plain and simple.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para28"></a>Clause 12 deals with the content board. There may be some little solace in that. Clause 312 deals with the standards code, which is an important provision in the Bill. However, without Clause 3 being absolutely firm in both what it says about values and in terms of the hierarchy of values as expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, those clauses are not adequate. As it stands, Clause 12 is a broken reed. I believe that the flag of public service broadcasting should fly from the masthead of the Bill very clearly.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para29"></a>I draw attention to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, at Second Reading. He is someone who understands the realities of modern broadcasting and he put in rather chilling terms the extent to which the commercial pressures on the commercial sector are driving content, quality, originality and so forth&#151;the breadth of cultural output&#151;down and down. He said, in effect, &quot;Do not rely upon the commercial sector to go on providing even the level of broadness and quality output it does currently". That is why, again, surely we must have at the heart of the Bill something unequivocal and legally enforceable so that the director-general does not have to scrape around to find justification for what could be a very unpopular measure with commercial broadcasters but has something quite clear.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para30"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, referred and I believe will again refer to the Professor in Colorado who has done a great deal of work on the whole issue of what happens in America. I notice that the noble Baroness said, &quot;Well, America is America and we are different". What is said by Professor Michael Tracey in his book on public service broadcasting in the States in 1998 and in his recent essay commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust&#151;if noble Lords do <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>not have a copy I suggest they obtain one&#151;is of the greatest purport to what we are trying to achieve in the Bill. He quotes Ted Turner, scarcely a wimp, who refers to the loss of &quot;so much diversity of thought" as a result of the way American broadcasting has gone. Walter Cronkite, one of the great names, refers to America,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"producing a population of political, economic and scientific ignoramuses at a point in time when a lot more knowledge, rather than less, is needed for the survival of democracy".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para31"></a>
Dan Rather of CBS states that &quot;we are less" because of the way that modern television is going. That is one of the great broadcasting statesmen of America stating that we are less because of what has happened and we want to ensure that there is more.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para32"></a>The amendment would go some way towards shoring up the values I believe everyone in the House and the Government want to see shored up. We are dealing with cultural goods, not goods at large. To try to apply to the cultural goods of television and radio the same sort of competitive framework that might apply to beans or hamburgers is not good enough. The noble Baroness will berate me roundly for that somewhat over the top description of what the Bill does, but presently it does not do enough. It does not signal clearly and with acclamation the importance of public service standards.
<P>

<a name="30429-08_para33"></a>I should like to mention just one more quote before I conclude. It comes from one of the real elder statesmen of the industry, Sir Denis Forman, who gave the McTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh Festival nearly 20 years ago. He ended his speech by saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the top people in broadcasting become organisation men, if they become professional managers, if they are solely interested in profit or in efficiency"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para34"></a>
that is a word that one finds endlessly in this Bill&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"they will fail. For the laws governing the production of good programmes are mysterious and demand from time to time that efficiency should take second place . . .  There is an unbridgeable gap between the logic of business management and the laws of the creative world . . .  For efficiency is the enemy of originality and it can smother talent, which is of its nature non-conformist".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-08_para35"></a>
As Members of the Committee will know, he was the most distinguished head of Granada Television for a long time, during which he worked in close partnership with the noble Lord, Lord Bernstein, who I hope will contribute later to the debate. For all the reasons that I have outlined, I hope that the Government will allow my amendment to find its place on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30429-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   I did not take part in the firing of the opening salvos for the soul of Ofcom simply to avoid prolonging the debate unnecessarily. I trust that my amendments, Amendments Nos. 7 and 8, will indicate that I am broadly in support of the amendments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and others. However, the noble Lord might be wise to reflect on the observation made by the Minister that &quot;appropriate" is a better word than &quot;possible" in terms of the promotion of competition.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para0"></a>I should declare an interest in that I am chairman of Scottish Radio, a non-executive director of Johnston Press, and chairman of RAJAR, which is the joint <P>

With the permission of the Committee, it is not my intention to reiterate that declaration of interest before every intervention that I may make. It could all too easily sound like a boast of experience, rather than a declaration of interest.

<P>

<a name="30429-09_para2"></a>In an age of many services, all of which are serving niche markets, I fully recognise that it is unreasonable to impose the obligation to provide a programme catering for a wide range of tastes on an individual station, or television channel, and that that obligation is properly transferred to the regulator as set out under this clause. However, my amendments would transpose the phrase in brackets&#151;namely, &quot;taken as a whole"&#151;so that it qualifies only the necessity to provide a wide range of programming. It is still perfectly possible, and, in my view, desirable, to demand that individual services achieve high quality. Therefore, my amendment is mainly syntactical but with a philosophical undertone.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has rendered us a service by drawing our attention to one of the strangest features of this Bill&#151;this vast two-volumed Bill&#151;that it is not until we reach Clauses 260 and 261 that we find mention of &quot;public service" broadcasting in any detail. Those clauses are most important. For the first time in any Bill we now have a definition of &quot;public service" broadcasting; indeed, a very detailed definition and one which we shall no doubt debate at greater length in due course. I am sure that Ministers will be glad to hear that I do not wish to pursue too many of those issues at this stage.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para3"></a>It is curious that we do not see public service broadcasting mentioned in the duties under the Bill because it is a key component of the whole legislative machine, so to speak, that is now under consideration. Another feature of those clauses identifies a subject widely misunderstood by the general public. The latter normally assume that public service broadcasting equals the BBC. But the Bill actual defines such broadcasting and imposes public service obligations not on the BBC but on Channels 3, 4 and 5 and on the &quot;public teletext service". The obligations imposed on those providers are quite detailed.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para4"></a>The licence holders for Channel 3&#151;I no longer have to declare an interest in this respect, although I was for many years a director of HTV&#151;must provide a sufficient amount of programming that reflects, supports and stimulates the diverse cultural makeup of the UK through music, drama, comedy and other visual and performing arts; that gives a comprehensive and authoritative coverage of news and of current <P>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 604</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>affairs at regional UK and international level; that reflects the lives and concerns of different communities in the UK; and is made outside the M25.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para5"></a>The BBC is required to follow those guidelines as part of its agreement. I have no doubt that that is also a subject to which we shall return later. However, although the public service obligations are very tightly defined for Channel 3 and the other channels, they are not defined anything like so tightly for the BBC. Indeed, if Members of the Committee refer to questions 528 to 530 of the evidence given to the Joint Committee on the Draft Communications Bill, it will be seen that I pressed Mr Gavyn Davies, the chairman of the BBC, very hard to tell me what the BBC understood &quot;public service broadcasting" to be. He was very careful not to give me a clear answer. If he gave a clear answer, he knew perfectly well that he would find himself facing some of the obligations imposed on the other television companies. Indeed, he sought to argue that, as they are obliged to provide entertainment, all &quot;entertainment" actually met the definition of &quot;public service broadcasting"&#151;or, at least that we should not challenge entertainment as not coming within that remit. However, some entertainment clearly does.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para6"></a>It means that the obligations placed on the BBC are rather different from those placed on other broadcasters. These are also topics to which we shall want to return. Surely the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is right to say that public service broadcasting is one of the jewels in the crown of British television that we ought to be addressing right at the start of our consideration of the duties of Ofcom. It is quite extraordinary that we have this Bill with no reference to the latter being a primary purpose until we come to those clauses to which I referred and the particular application of those concerns. I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment moved by the noble Lord. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister why Ofcom has not been given the task of upholding this important part of our broadcasting arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bragg: </B>   I have a few brief points to make following the magnificent rallying cry for public service broadcasting made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. I do not believe that my first point has been mentioned, so I shall be brief. In the run-up to the BBC's charter renewal in a few years' time, the media environment taken as a whole is likely to be very hostile. It is even more important for the BBC, which is the cornerstone, but not the sole guardian, of public service broadcasting, that we accept the suggestion put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that public services should, for the sake of clarity, be placed at the top of the hierarchy and put on the face of the Bill as soon as possible. That will be a great protection for the BBC. Indeed, the British public would not forgive us if we did not protect them in that regard at the start of what will be a most difficult renewal process.

<a name="30429-09_para7"></a>Secondly, I should point out to my great and noble friend the Minister that she will dismiss American experience at her peril! Barry Diller saw the future, and he said, &quot;avoid it".

<P>
<A NAME="30429-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   I had added my name to the first group of amendments, but like the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, I shall restrict myself. However, both sets of amendments cover the same kind of thoughts. I shall lead on to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. Many interest groups outside the industry, such as the Voice of the Listener and Viewer, the National Consumer Council and other such bodies, expressed the concern that the balance of the Bill between the interests of the citizen and the marketplace was wrong. It is wrong not to recognise that imbalance.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para8"></a>It would also be wrong not to recognise that the Government have tried to meet those concerns. I echo&#151;I do not think it was a warning; it was certainly not a threat from such a gentle creature&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that the way the Bill goes through Committee will depend a great deal on whether ministerial responses comprise &quot;No, no, no, no", with little regard to the fact that, as far as I can see, these amendments are tabled constructively to make a good Bill better rather than to snarl at the Government's timetable or anything like that.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para9"></a>If the idea of the Ministers or Whips is some exercise in macho whipping, they will run into trouble, which will be of their making and not of those of us who are trying to make a good Bill better. To echo the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, it is not the Bill's critics who have been saying that what is missing from British broadcasting is the wonderful, entrepreneurial, dynamic skill of American management; it is the Bill's promoters who have said that across the Atlantic there is a better world. Tessa Jowell said that by bringing in the Americans we would obtain the best of both worlds. The Minister has to listen to some of the wise words of those who have gone through the American experience.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para10"></a>My noble friend Lord Thomson referred to the two cooks. The Minister was tempted to try the curry pun. I warn her that the origin of curry, so I am told, is to mash certain tainted meat. One of the worries about the Bill is that although, as my noble friend Lord Phillips said, the Minister has impeccable credentials in defending public service and public enterprise, many of the arguments for the Bill, certainly in the other place by Kim Howells&#151;that new convert to the perfection of the market&#151;have been about rigorous competition. It is no good the Government at the other end of the building having Kim Howells and John Whittingdale marching arm in arm towards the Adam Smith Institute while the Minister at this end says all the right conciliatory things because she knows that there is not the same reception at this end of the building for that kind of tosh.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para11"></a>She must realise that a matter of genuine concern is the commitment to what was a stroke of genius in the development of public service broadcasting. Reading <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>a history of the BBC I was told that the mantra, &quot;educate, entertain and inform" as a kind of job description for the BBC was Lord Reith's invention. Thank God he came up with it, because from it grew a concept of broadcasting not only for the BBC but also for the commercial broadcasters when they were introduced, that has done us a great service.
<P>

<a name="30429-09_para12"></a>The real concern is that when Tony Ball of Sky gave evidence to our committee and was asked what his ideal of public service broadcasting was, he referred to Australia. That is normal, he being Australian, but it gave the game away. We fear that without the protection provided by the amendment there are forces at work that wish to drive the public service commitment into the ineffectual ghetto it occupies in the United States, Canada and Australia, where that battle has already been lost. We can still win the battle by putting such amendments into the Bill. I hope that the Minister, about whose interests and priorities I have no doubt, will see the logic of what we are trying to do.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Fowler: </B>   Having slightly disagreed with the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on his previous intervention, I shall put that right immediately by agreeing strongly with his proposal in this amendment. If we accept the concept of a hierarchy of duties to assist the regulator, it seems that, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said, one of the most fundamental is to uphold the principles of public service broadcasting. That is a fundamental value that we should hold dear.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para0"></a>That is something we will want Ofcom to continue to value. For once public service broadcasting is not, in the immortal words of my noble friend Lord Peyton, &quot;a mild, unarguable piety"; its remit is set out in great detail in Clause 260. The only difficulty, as my noble friend Lord Crickhowell said, is that it comes very late in the Bill. It seems that whatever else the amendment does, it puts public service broadcasting at the beginning of the Bill and states the value that we place on it. That is fundamentally important.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para1"></a>Public service broadcasting is not just a pseudonym for the BBC. The BBC does uphold those principles, but so do other television broadcasters. One might say that those principles are, and should remain, the characteristics of British broadcasting. That is my view. The principles are fundamental values: the dissemination of information; the provision of education and entertainment; the broadcast of cultural activity in the United Kingdom; and what I perhaps value above all as an ex-journalist, comprehensive and authoritative coverage of news and current affairs with an overarching provision within the legislation that such broadcasting should be impartial.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para2"></a>It seems that that is what we should be aiming to achieve. We do not always do it, but those are the values we seek after. It is important that we have objective reporting. We do not try to force some editorial line down the throats of the public. We set out the facts and the position as best it can be seen and allow the public to make up their minds on that presentation. There has been some criticism of the coverage of the Iraq war&#151;particularly that of the <P>


<a name="column_607"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>BBC; less so that of ITN. For my part, we in this country appear to have become a nation of armchair editors rather than armchair generals. Obviously, mistakes are inevitable. But, overall, both the BBC and ITN provided reasonably balanced coverage of the conflict. I shall not try to defend every part of it, but it seemed to adhere to the best traditions of British broadcasting.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para3"></a>I speak as a strong supporter of the action taken. But I do not want my news accompanied by flags waving in the corner of the screen, let alone background music, which was the case in one or two other broadcasts. There is a contrast between news coverage or objective reporting and propaganda. We should be very clear on the distinction and very protective of our traditions in that regard. One can get the balance wrong, but that should not prevent us aiming for such a balance.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para4"></a>I strongly support the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and the other comments made. We would be fools to downplay the principles of public service broadcasting in this country. It is worth fighting for. We should put it at the top of the page as one of the principal aims of any government with any sense in this country.

This is therefore my opening salvo. The noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, said that he had been at a funeral. My noble friend Lord Peyton, like the 18th century Margrave of Baden, said that by his absence he was doing a service to your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My noble friend has entirely misheard or misunderstood me and does me great injustice.

<A NAME="30429-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I was absent. I offer an apology to my noble friend Lord Peyton. Due to a particular application of Murphy's Law, whenever the Department for Culture, Media and Sport wishes to bring forward a Bill for Second Reading in this House, the business managers always schedule the debate for a time when I am attending a <P>


<a name="column_608"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 608</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>meeting of the British-Irish inter-parliamentary body. It happened with the Licensing Bill and again with this one.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para5"></a>While my noble friend Lord Peyton was doing a service to noble Lords by remaining silent, I was in Kilkenny and Tipperary doing a service to myself. I learnt for the first time that, in another application of Murphy's Law, when in 1495 one of my direct ancestors burnt down the cathedral on the Rock of Cashel, his explanation to King Henry VII was that he had been misinformed that the archbishop was inside it.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para6"></a>I speak from an extremity of the House, topographically rather than politically. It may be due to that topographical quirk that I happen to be personally nearest the grave of Lord Reith. As someone concerned to remain audible to the Committee, if we were not going to discuss public service broadcasting until Clause 260, the noise of Lord Reith turning in his grave would become extremely trying to Members as far from the main business of the Committee as I am. Therefore, I support the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. I particularly congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, whose rearrangement of a particular parenthesis was exceptionally helpful and would have been approved of by Lord Reith, for whom I am temporarily speaking .
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para7"></a>For the remaining stages of the Bill, I have no interest to declare. But I was twice resident in the United States for a total of nearly four years. I recall very vividly how much the public sector broadcasting channel meant to exiles from this land in the United States.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para8"></a>As I recall, in a recent poll on what this country means abroad, the largest percentage&#151;13 per cent&#151;said that it was represented by British broadcasting. There is no question that the BBC plays a significant part in that reputation being enjoyed across the world. Its role is superior to anything else, including, obviously, the influence of the parliamentary tradition.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para9"></a>For understandable reasons, American Bills have double-barrelled names. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, implied that the Munroe doctrine was becoming the Jowell-Munroe doctrine. The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, said that it was a British Bill rather than an American one. I join the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and his other supporters in hoping that we can have the reference to public service broadcasting included in the Bill at the earliest opportunity and prove that it is British rather than American.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   I am sure that noble Lords do not wish me to probe at any depth or to seek to penetrate the murky ancestral past of my noble friend. But, as the debate continues, I feel that my status as someone wishing to gain understanding rather than to impart it is quite safe and almost unique in the Committee. Everybody else has so much knowledge.

<a name="30429-10_para10"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and congratulate him on producing something crisp and understanding&#151;those were his words. Unlike so <P>

I wish that he would go a little further&#151;he will have other opportunities&#151;to say what he means by the principles of public service broadcasting. Not only would I like to see the term in the Bill, I wish to have a clearer understanding of the principles. Perhaps for reasons of vulgar curiosity, I wish to know who are ideal exemplars of the principles. As yet, that has been hidden from me. I hope to be told during the debate who is regarded as a perfect exemplar.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para11"></a>I echo the words addressed to the noble Baroness by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, about not saying &quot;No, no, no" throughout. If she stuck to that negative attitude&#151;I am sure that she will not&#151;it might provoke even reasonable, patient people like me to protest. There is a deplorable tendency, once a Bill is launched, for the Minister sponsoring it&#151;the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, knows this very well&#151;to develop a maternal love for it. They will not have anybody peeping into the perambulator and saying, &quot;What a hideous baby".

<A NAME="30429-10_spnew7"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Manchester: </B>   I express great sympathy for the points made about public service broadcasting and its importance. I have made similar comments in earlier debates on the subject. We must never take public service broadcasting for granted in this country. It is good to see in this Bill that this is the first government to try to define public service broadcasting. I look forward to the more detailed debates on that later. For the moment, I support what has been said about the need at the very beginning to strengthen our definitions, statements and the order regarding public service broadcasting.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para12"></a>I also want to express sympathy with the concerns voiced today by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. I am sure that noble Lords will agree with me in the hope that, as Committee stage develops, the very helpful and wise interventions made by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, are not always responded to in a negative way from the Government Front Bench.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para13"></a>Perhaps I may turn briefly to Amendments Nos. 7 and 8, to which the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, has referred. These amendments seem to me to restore what must have been intended by the Government all along. Given that there are quality thresholds for the granting of broadcasting licences, legislation ought not to open the door to the suggestion that achieving the necessary quality is a question of average performance or that the better programmes in some way make up for the less adequate ones.
<P>

<a name="30429-10_para14"></a>Quality is a subjective word, but one which regulators have had no difficulty in embracing in the past. I suggest that it is logical for the range of programmes taken as a whole to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests which are represented in a great variety of the populace, whereas it does not seem so logical for quality to be determined by an average. In any case, where would this stop? Would the appearance of programmes judged to have reached <P>

<A NAME="30429-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hussey of North Bradley: </B>   I have listened with great interest to this debate. I intervene with some hesitation having spent the whole of the holiday in bed. I hope that the Committee will excuse my somewhat halting few words. I declare an interest, having been chairman of the BBC for 10 years. I think that that is the longest anyone has ever done it and I do not suppose that anyone will ever try to do it for longer. During most of that time I tried to uphold public service broadcasting, which I thought was the hallmark of the BBC and which is what the audience&#151;the subscribers, the people who pay the licence fee&#151;expect.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para0"></a>So how does one define public service broadcasting? Speaking from memory, Lord Reith defined it as providing the best of all types of broadcasting, of whatever nature, that raised standards and tempted the audience to reach, in what they watched and what they enjoyed, higher standards than they would otherwise have reached had they concentrated entirely on the less exciting or less honourable parts of the national press.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para1"></a>I think that we more or less succeeded in doing that. I hope that we did. In some ways, it can be seen more clearly in the World Service, which I think is generally acknowledged to be the highest level of broadcasting&#151;no longer only on radio but on television too. But that, to me, is what public service broadcasting should be. It is about higher standards across the whole range of output and about tempting audiences to look at and enjoy programmes which they would not otherwise have done. In that way, not only is the worth of the BBC increased, but also, through the audiences, the value of the BBC is increased and its important hold on the British public.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I support these amendments. I am tempted to ask myself whether the reason that this important duty for Ofcom to uphold the principles of public service broadcasting is not on the face of the Bill in the early stages, under the general duties for Ofcom, is that somehow the Government have taken it for granted that these principles would be upheld.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para2"></a>I hope that the Government will realise&#151;indeed, noble Lords have made the point absolutely clear today on all sides of the Committee&#151;that nothing can be taken for granted. In a sense, the words that I was going to say were taken from me by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester. Nothing can be taken for granted. There is a need for flexibility from the Minister and each of these amendments can do no harm but a great deal of good.

<FONT SIZE=3>approach of abandoning the principles of public sector broadcasting in favour of American or Australian broadcasting and have been warned about the danger of a culture of saying, &quot;No, no, no" to amendments.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para3"></a>None of that represents the position of my noble friends Lady Blackstone and Lord Davies or myself in the way in which we address this Committee. We are looking at the amendments objectively. We are trying to understand what they mean and what they intend. We are trying to make an objective judgment on whether they improve the Bill. If they are defective but their intention is to improve the Bill, certainly we shall look at any alternatives that we can think of or, in discussion with anyone who is proposing amendments, we shall seek to find a way forward. Our attitude is not simply to oppose every amendment on principle.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para4"></a>It may be that the number of resists is more than the number of considers. It is because when we look at the amendments we find that, in our view, they do not make any improvements to the Bill. But if that is the case, we shall say so and will explain why. If there is disagreement about a matter on which we have sympathy we shall try to pursue it and make any improvements that are possible.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para5"></a>I turn now to these amendments. I have particular difficulty with Amendment No. 5. That is because of the wonderful phrase which the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, introduced into the debate; that is, &quot;unarguable piety". I think that phrase will occur over and over again in our debate&#151;at least I shall find myself using it.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para6"></a>What the Bill would propose is a duty to uphold the principles of public service broadcasting in the general duties of Ofcom. What the principles of public service broadcasting are, the amendment does not say. Yet, in introducing it, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said that these would be legally enforceable on Ofcom. I simply do not understand that. I do not understand how a statement can be made about the principles of public service broadcasting without ever seeking to define what is meant. How can such a statement be other than simply a statement of principle&#151;a wish&#151;rather than of actual content and improvement?
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para7"></a>In saying that, perhaps I should explain something about the structure of the Bill because a number of noble Lords said that it is terrible that the real consideration of public service broadcasting occurs only at Clause 260 and that it should be higher up in the Bill. That suggests that what comes earlier in the Bill can be in conflict with or more important than what is later. That is not the case.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para8"></a>Part I is about the functions of Ofcom&#151;not just the functions in relation to broadcasting but the functions in relation to the whole telecommunications area. There is reference in Clause 3 to quality broadcasting. Clause (3)(2)(c) refers to the requirement on Ofcom to secure,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the availability throughout the United Kingdom of a wide range of television and radio services which (taken as a whole) are both of high quality and calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-11_para9"></a>
The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, called that &quot;wishy-washy". I am sure that Lord Reith would not have thought it good enough as a definition, but it is a flag <P>


<a name="column_612"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 612</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for the more detailed consideration set out later in the Bill. While it may be wishy-washy, it is better than the absence of anything at all, which is what we have in this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I am genuinely puzzled by the noble Lord. He has asked how it is possible to include a statement when there is nothing to explain what it means. However, as he pointed out himself, it does not matter whether something is set out at the beginning or the end of the Bill. Later we have a clear statement that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The purposes of public service television broadcasting in the United Kingdom are&#151;".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-11_para10"></a>
Those purposes are then set out in detail. Furthermore, a clear statement is made on the manner of fulfilling those purposes.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para11"></a>I do not understand why it is so difficult to link the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, with what is set out so clearly later in the Bill. Surely it would be perfectly possible for the noble Lord to do that if he was so minded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   If the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, had been patient for a moment longer, I was going to say what the Bill does.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para12"></a>Part 2 of the Bill is not the appropriate place since it covers network services and the radio spectrum. However, Part 3 covers radio and television services. We must look in some detail at what is set out in Clause 260 and the subsequent clauses. If any accusation has been made&#151;and by implication that was the case&#151;that somehow the Government are being soft on the principles of public service broadcasting, then this should answer it.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para13"></a>Clause 262 requires public service broadcasters to produce &quot;statements of programme policy". They must do so at the outset and then at regular intervals. It may be said that a statement of policy may or may not be worth the paper it is written on. However, Clause 260 requires Ofcom to report on the fulfilment of the public service remit. Subsection (6) in particular sets out in great detail the requirements of public service broadcasting. Those requirements are detailed in such a way that, taken together with the powers conferred to enforce the principles, they provide exactly the protections for public service broadcasting which all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate are seeking. The subsection provides specifically that Ofcom should have backstop powers to enforce these principles for all broadcasters except the BBC, and that the Secretary of State shall have powers under the agreement with the BBC to enforce those principles for the BBC itself.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para14"></a>So not only do all public sector broadcasters have to undertake a form of contract with the nation about public service broadcasting, but Ofcom has the responsibility and the power to see that that is enforced. That is what I call a commitment to public service broadcasting. Simply to insert it as a part of the general duties of Ofcom does not seem to add anything of any significance whatever.
<P>


<a name="column_613"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 613</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para15"></a>I turn now to Amendments Nos. 7 and 8, which seek to amend Ofcom's duty to imply that each individual television and radio service must be of high quality. Of course we want to see consistently high quality programming made available throughout the United Kingdom by all broadcasting providers. However, we provide for that, first, through the provision of high quality public service broadcasting&#151;I have talked about that&#151;and, secondly, we have provided for that through the licensing of other broadcasters, taking into account the overall responsibilities set out in Clause 3, including those relating to quality and diversity. But where there is no constraint on spectrum&#151;I say this to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester, who appears to think that we should award restrictive licences to all broadcasters; that is not the case where there is no constraint on spectrum&#151;we would be wrong to set a threshold of high quality for all new entrants.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para16"></a>For example, I cite community radio and television, as well as radio and television services for particular minorities. There is a sense of trade-off between high quality and diversity; that is, services that appeal to a variety of tastes and interests. If we are considering community and ethnic minority radio and television services, I do not think that we would wish to impose the kinds of standards of quality intended by these amendments. Surely the right approach is to seek high quality across broadcasting services taken as a whole rather than to impose it on every single provider.
<P>

<a name="30429-11_para17"></a>For those reasons, I hope that the amendments will not be pressed.

<A NAME="30429-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   I had a lump in my throat, as I am sure did most of the rest of the Committee, when I listened to the Minister's opening declaration. But I should tell him that the three specific criticisms to which he alluded were all made by me. I stand by them.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para0"></a>I wish to say only this. So far we have considered seven amendments, all seven of which have been rejected. If Peter Snow were commentating on election night, he would already be predicting a landslide. When are we going to see flexibility?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I should like to respond first to the noble Lord, Lord McNally. What the noble Lord should recognise&#151;I know that my noble friend Lord Puttnam would do so&#151;is that this Bill is profoundly different as a result of the changes made to it by the joint scrutiny committee. We have made huge changes&#151;I shall not say &quot;concessions"; they would be concessions only if we did not agree with them&#151;in response to informed criticism. We have done so after proper debate and discussion and we will continue to do so.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para1"></a>However, as is the case with these amendments, if we think that it would not serve any valuable purpose to include them in the Bill, then we will resist them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   At a later stage of the Bill, perhaps my noble friend on the Front Bench will <P>


<a name="column_614"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 614</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reconsider his judgment on the two amendments tabled in my name. I should remind him that their effect would not be to require high quality from all services. It would simply ensure that one of the obligations of Ofcom would be to secure a wide range of television and radio services that are of high quality. If Ofcom is not in place to do that, why bother with it? If it is to aim at mediocrity, then we can do without it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-12_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I have listened with care to the debate and I wish to put one question to the Minister. I think it is important that the general duties of Ofcom should be set out clearly in Clause 3(1), as is the case with regard to the interests of consumers and the community. However, the details of those interests are spelt out only later in the legislation. Therefore I fail to understand the Minister's argument why it is not possible to include a phrase such as the &quot;principles of public service broadcasting" which are then detailed later in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para2"></a>The duties of Ofcom are not spelt out in Clause 3(1), but the basic principles are. If you can have one, then I do not see why it is not possible to have the other.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Clause 3(1) sets out the general duties across the range of responsibilities of Ofcom, whether it be broadcast or other telecommunications services. Public service broadcasting is enormously important, but it is a specific element of that and thus is best covered in the part of the Bill dealing with radio and television services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   I am immensely grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this penetrating and stirring mini-debate. I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hussey, who has come from his sickbed to make his contribution. That is greatly appreciated. Turning to the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, at least I can give him this 1924 quotation from Lord Reith, in which he described the responsibility of public service broadcasting as the need to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"carry into the greatest possible number of homes everything that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-12_para3"></a>
The reason I did not use the quotation earlier was that it lacks &quot;entertainment" as an important element of what today would be part of anyone's definition of public service broadcasting.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para4"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, for pinning the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, to his Bench where he should be pinned on his principal objection to the amendment; namely, that it lacks definition. If the Minister could tell me how much less defined it is than the phrase contained in the Bill&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to further the interests of the community as a whole in relation to communications matters"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-12_para5"></a>
I would be deeply obliged. But, of course, he cannot do so. The reason he cannot do so&#151;and the reason I did not&#151;is that this is a general duty clause.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para6"></a>My second point is that Clause 260 is not part of the general duty clause on the obligations of Ofcom. The point made by every single speaker bar none is that public service broadcasting standards must be at <P>


<a name="column_615"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 615</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the flag, at the head, at the heart of the Bill. However admirable Clause 260 may be on its own, it is not part of the general duties. The mood of the Committee, as I apprehend it, is that public service broadcasting standards should be a general requirement to which the Director General of Ofcom should have regard.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para7"></a>Having gone that far, this is not the moment to vote on these issues. I am sure that a great deal of talking will take place before Report, when the Government can be assured that we will be back. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30429-12_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-12_para9"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;( ) In conducting their duties under subsection (1), OFCOM shall have a primary responsibility to ensure that their actions are, at all times, governed by the principles under which regulatory activities should be transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only at cases in which action is needed."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-12_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 6, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 15, 18 and 19. The amendments focus on the general duties of Ofcom and the need, in our view, to have on the face of the Bill an increased emphasis on the principles of better regulation.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para11"></a>In setting out the key principles of the Bill, the Government have expressed their aim to create the most dynamic and competitive communications industry in the world. To that end, they have highlighted the need for deregulation to promote competitiveness and investment, together with self-regulation where appropriate. We support the Government in these aims.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para12"></a>However, we want to be sure that in practice Ofcom will, as it becomes established, adhere to the principles of better regulation; that the regulatory activities of Ofcom will be transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted. To that end, it should be a primary duty on the face of the Bill and not only something to which Ofcom should have regard when it appears to be relevant in the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para13"></a>The Bill grants extensive powers to Ofcom as a regulator to intervene right across the economy. In that case it is essential that it should not only have regard to, but adhere to at all times the principles of better regulation that are consistently championed by the Government's Better Regulation Task Force.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para14"></a>The chairman of the task force, David Arculus, when appointed last year, was reported in the Financial Times as having warned that civil servants are drowning small businesses in a wave of regulation because they have little understanding of business. He went on to say that,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-12_para15"></a><P>

<a name="30429-12_para16"></a>While we are confident that the noble Lord, Lord Currie, will not fall into this trap, we nevertheless wish to protect the future and thereby make adherence to better regulation principles a primary duty for Ofcom. I can assure the Committee <P>


<a name="column_616"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 616</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that we are supported in large part across the broadcasting and telecommunications industries in this aim.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para17"></a>We are disappointed therefore that the Government have seen fit to place a less than wholehearted commitment to the principles on the face of the Bill. I recognise that, like the remainder of Clause 3, these principles are to be disapplied when Ofcom carries out its concurrent competition powers. I have no dispute with that. Similarly, there may be instances where it is not appropriate for Ofcom to behave in accordance with all the better regulation principles but with only some of them. Someone has suggested, for example, that Ofcom cannot be too transparent in advance when it is carrying out a raid on a pirate broadcaster. That kind of situation must of course be respected.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para18"></a>We have tabled two alternative amendments for the Government's consideration, both of which would achieve this aim. The first would simply delete the provisions in Clause 3(3) and amend Clause 3(1) to ensure that in conducting its duties under the subsection Ofcom has a primary responsibility to ensure that its actions are at all times governed by the principles.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para19"></a>The second amendment would amend Clause 3(2) to provide Ofcom with a duty in carrying out its functions and in performing its duties under Clause 3(1) to act impartially and transparently and to comply with the other principles of good regulation.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para20"></a>The issue was raised briefly in another place. Amendments seeking this increased emphasis were rejected by the Government, even though they failed to provide much reasoning for doing so. It was an insubstantial and unsatisfactory debate. The Government's refusal to adopt these amendments is even more difficult to understand given the importance that they appeared to attach to the principles of better regulation during the consideration of the Bill in another place. The Committee stage debates recorded in Hansard illustrate how often the principles were prayed in aid by the Government as a reason for rejecting amendments that went to the heart of many of the most important debates.
<P>

<a name="30429-12_para21"></a>I ask the Government to think again on this issue. In their exposition of the Bill in Committee they have shown how important the principles will be in underpinning and informing Ofcom in the way that it goes about its work. This sits very uncomfortably with the less than wholehearted commitment to the principles currently given in Clause 3. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30429-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   In its report, Champions of Better Regulation, the Better Regulation Task Force claims to have the support of the Prime Minister and that that is one of the great reasons for its success. It states that several themes underpin its work and that the most important consideration of whether it is successful is to look at the themes, to judge their success over the next few years and to see whether they have been accepted and applied by policy makers and regulators. This is a very good example of how we can apply them as policy makers by incorporating them higher in the clause than the position they currently occupy.
<P>


<a name="column_617"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 617</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para0"></a>The Minister has already explained that Clause 3 divides conveniently into three units. Clause 3(1) refers to general principles; Clause 3(2) refers to detailed objectives; and Clause 3(3) refers to matters to which the regulator must have regard. Of the two alternatives offered by the amendments, the one I prefer is to incorporate the principles of better regulation into Clause 3(1). That subsection is concerned with principles and therefore, as the noble Baroness said, if we are to divide the general duties of Ofcom into these three hierarchies, the principles of better regulation belong in Clause 3(1) and not down at the bottom in Clause 3(3) as matters to which the regulator must only have regard.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para1"></a>We acknowledge that the issue of the principles of better regulation is mentioned in the Bill. But we believe, as does the noble Baroness, that it should be up in Clause 3(1), which deals with general principles. Alternatively, Amendments Nos. 15 and 17 offer the option of incorporating it at the beginning of Clause 3(2), where it would be at least in the detailed objectives.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para2"></a>I hope that the Minister will have regard to what the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said about the Government being flexible and that she will consider the various options put forward by noble Lords. We have suggested two different ways of achieving the Better Regulation Task Force principles, either one of which can be discussed with Ministers during the course of the next few weeks before Report. It is important at this stage that the Minister and her colleagues should accept that the better regulation principles should come higher up in the objectives set out in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful that both noble Lords who have spoken to these amendments have acknowledged that none of us is against the principles of better regulation. The issue here is where in Clause 3 is the right place to put it? We have put it in subsection (3), and it is proposed that it is put in subsection (1). The reason that it is not in subsection (1) is very simple.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para3"></a>The general principles set out in subsection (1) apply across the range of Ofcom's functions. They are a furthering of the interests of consumers in relevant markets&#151;and that is all telecommunications markets&#151;and a furthering of the interests of the community as a whole in relation to communications matters. That again is across the whole range of Ofcom's functions. Regulation is only one part of Ofcom's functions. There are many other functions, as set out in subsections (2) and (3). In upholding the principles of regulation, when we are concerned with only one part of the functions of Ofcom, it is right that it should be set alongside the other functions such as the promotion of competition in relevant markets, the desirability of facilitating self-regulation or encouraging investment in innovation. None of those is a regulatory activity. It is right that regulatory activities should be alongside those others, as referring to only part of the range of Ofcom functions.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para4"></a>Let me give an assurance that the words &quot;have regard to" do not mean that Ofcom can simply ignore it. If there were any question of Ofcom going against regulatory principles there would rapidly be legal challenge to it. If that were found to be the case I am sure that such a legal challenge would be upheld. We are not in disagreement on principle. It is simply a matter of the way in which the Bill is structured and where it is right to refer to a principle which refers to only part of Ofcom's activities.

<A NAME="30429-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response. The words that I have just written down are &quot;lack of confidence". The difficulty that we have relates to the previous amendments in relation to upholding the principles of public broadcasting as a primary duty, and there is a similar argument here. There is a lack of confidence. It probably rests as much as anything with the wording in Clause 3(3), to which the Minister referred:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In performing their duties under subsection (1), Ofcom must have regard, in particular, to such of the following as appear to them to be relevant in the circumstances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-13_para5"></a>
There is a lack of confidence in the marketplace that Ofcom could use that wording to exit itself in a sense from the need to adhere to the principles of better regulation. There is a real concern that if we do not ensure that at all times the general principle of better regulation is adhered to, the regulator will, as I have already expressed and others have said beyond your Lordships' House, take every opportunity to do as the&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   Perhaps I may help the noble Baroness on the issue of a lack of confidence. When taking evidence in the Select Committee, it became very apparent to us that for the most part regulators had tended to act too little and too late. That was principally because they found themselves to be under-resourced and unable to grasp market realities as they emerged particularly into a fast-moving marketplace. I think that one of the confusions and one of the problems is the different perspective from the point of view of the dominant provider and the market entrant. The market entrant tends to feel that the regulator acts far too late. The dominant provider tends to feel that the regulator is interfering. Squaring that circle is not easy, but I have total sympathy with what the noble Baroness is trying to achieve.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, for his intervention. There is no question that there is a concern beyond your Lordships' House in the marketplace, as I have already said, because there is perhaps an opportunity for regulators&#151;using the words in subsection (3)&#151;to act too little and too late. That is something that could and should be corrected in the Bill. That is what we are seeking to do. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, for that assistance. We are not intending to press the amendment today, but we believe, as was stressed briefly in committee in another place, that the importance that the Government have always attached to these principles should be reflected in the Bill.

<A NAME="30429-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Perhaps I may try to be helpful. I am hearing concern about the preamble to subsection (3). I am hearing concern about whether &quot;have regard to" is strong enough, and whether the flexibility left to Ofcom is strong enough. I suspect that that applies not only to regulatory principles, but to many other issues. I suspect that it relates to the issue of the distinction between the items in subsection (2), which are matters that Ofcom can control, and matters in subsection (3), which on the whole it can only influence. Between Committee and Report stage perhaps we can talk about the wording in the preamble to subsection (3) and make sure that we agree that it is as strong as we intend?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-13_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that suggestion. I think it would be extraordinarily helpful if we could have a discussion between Committee and Report stage about the wording of the introduction to subsection (3), because there is no doubt that we have been lobbied at enormous length right across the industry on this issue. We believe that if we can get this right now it would make a great deal of difference. On that basis I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30429-13_para8"></a><P>

<a name="30429-13_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: In rising to speak to Amendment No. 9, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 313.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para10"></a>During the Bill's Report stage in another place, the Government brought forward amendments which substantially revised Clause 3. One of those amendments introduced a completely new duty for Ofcom&#151;now subsection 3(2)(d)&#151;to secure,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the maintenance of a plurality of providers of different television and radio services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-13_para11"></a>
During the Report stage debate, my colleagues on the Opposition Front Bench pressed the Government to explain their reasons for introducing this new duty, and how they intended it to be used by Ofcom in carrying out its functions.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para12"></a>In particular, concerns were expressed that the new duty could have a considerable impact on the way in which Ofcom deals with proposed mergers and acquisitions within the sector in the future&#151;that Ofcom could intervene in any merger between any individual TV and radio providers simply on the basis that this reduced plurality. Very specific questions were put to the Minister at the time. Would, for example Ofcom be able to prevent the creation of a single ITV, even if the Office of Fair Trading were content for that to happen under general competition law? Would it be able to prevent mergers between other existing providers such as Disney, Viacom or BSkyB, simply on the basis that this reduced plurality? What if a merger were to reduce plurality&#151;that is the number of different providers of television and radio <P>


<a name="column_620"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 620</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>services&#151;but improve the quantity, quality or range of programme content? Might not the inclusion of this new duty encourage Ofcom to value plurality for its own sake, and to temper the priority that it would have previously given to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the availability throughout the United Kingdom of a wide range of television and radio services which (taken as a whole) are both of high quality and calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-13_para13"></a><P>

<a name="30429-13_para14"></a>The answer provided by the Government in response to those questions was unsatisfactory. I will, if I may, read it out to your Lordships now. The Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The media ownership rules in the Bill will ensure that there are a number of different providers of TV and radio services. The amendment"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-13_para15"></a>
introducing the duty to maintain plurality&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will mean that Ofcom will take plurality as well as diversity into account in carrying out its functions, including reviewing the media ownership rules. That is the key significance of the amendment: it ensures that OFCOM will be able to consider plurality in reviewing the rules".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-13_para16"></a><P>

<a name="30429-13_para17"></a>I regret that the Government have until now shed little light on the scope and purpose of the new duty. I hope that the Minister will be in a position to clarify matters for us further today. Given that the key significance of the new duty is its role in the review of media ownership rules, I should be grateful if the Minister could explain why it has not been placed in the relevant clause which relates to this review; that is, Clause 384.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para18"></a>The fact that the duty has instead been placed in Clause 3 suggests that Ofcom would be required to ensure that it is fulfilled in exercising all of its functions&#151;a much wider purpose&#151;and not just specific functions that relate to plurality, such as the media ownership review. Indeed, the Minister appeared to confirm this by indicating that the purpose of the duty includes, and is therefore not limited to, the review of media ownership rules. Yet the Government have not provided any explanation of what other purposes they intend for the new duty, beyond its role in the review of media ownership rules.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para19"></a>As I have already reminded the Committee, there is significant concern that the new duty could afford Ofcom considerable new powers to intervene in media acquisitions and mergers on the basis of plurality alone. For example, under Clauses 344 and 346, Ofcom would have to be notified of a change in control of Channel 3 or Channel 5 licensees respectively and would have to satisfy itself that the criteria in those clauses were satisfied.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para20"></a>However, with the addition of the plurality general duty in Clause 3(2)(d), Ofcom would now also have to ensure that plurality was maintained. Accordingly, if Ofcom concluded that plurality would not be maintained consequent upon a change in ownership of Channel 3 or Channel 5, it might seek to prohibit the acquisition under its general duties even though all other criteria&#151;regarding, for example, the amount, range and quality of original productions, news, current affairs and regional programmes, and competition considerations&#151;had been met.
<P>


<a name="column_621"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 621</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para21"></a>It is not clear to me how one could claim that plurality had been &quot;maintained" in any merger of the ITV licensees or in the acquisition of Channel 5 by any existing television provider, since it would, de facto, represent a reduction in the number of existing providers, irrespective of the benefits a merger might bring.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para22"></a>It would therefore be helpful if the Minister could explain how real these concerns are and how we can be assured that there is no problem. Perhaps that could be done by reference to the examples already provided. If the real purpose of the duty is to assist the review of media ownership rules, it would in our view seem sensible for the duty to appear in the relevant clause; that is, Clause 384. That approach is suggested by my amendment.
<P>

<a name="30429-13_para23"></a>If there is a wider purpose to the duty which prevents this, the Government should be clear about what this is and how it will impact on the sector. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   I tabled Amendment No. 9 during the Recess, unaware that the noble Baroness had also tabled an amendment to the same effect. I hope she will forgive me if I confine my remarks in support only to Amendment No. 9. I will study her remarks on other amendments and it may be that I shall support some of them.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para0"></a>When I was checking that my amendment was correct, counting the lines and so forth, I mistakenly picked up my original copy of the Communications Bill as it was published in November 2002. I searched in vain for the provision&#151;it is not there. It is not even in subsection (1), which is a subordinate consideration. It suddenly appeared when the Bill left the House of Commons.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para1"></a>Had it been a reaction to the recommendations of the committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Puttnam, it would have appeared in the November version. It did not. I believe that far too much status has been given to plurality. I do not want to sound like a monopolist&#151;you cannot be a media monopolist nowadays, however benevolent you might be&#151;but I simply ask: in whose interest is plurality of ownership? If it is given equal status, as this does, to the preceding provision seeking a wide range of programming, what happens if enforcing plurality diminishes the range of programming, as I believe it inexorably would? As I mentioned at Second Reading, if one owner has two services, it is within his interest to make them different. Two competitive owners are likely to compete for the most lucrative audience and the wide range of programming will be reduced.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para2"></a>Furthermore, the same owner can amortise the inevitable overheads of any business over two services, leaving more to go into programming rather than accounts, administration and sales. In addition, competition will lead to more funds being diverted from programming into advertising and marketing against the competition without improving the quality. I therefore ask: in whose interest is plurality? It certainly is not the interest of the listener.
<P>


<a name="column_622"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 622</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para3"></a>Arguably, the advertising industry might say, &quot;We want plurality because we can play one against the other". In fact, no media owner enjoys monopoly of a particular market. If people do not like local radio, they can go to television which subdivides their signal so that, as in my case, STV can offer Glasgow or Edinburgh, and they are increasingly subdivided even further. Even advertisers are sufficiently catered for.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para4"></a>Furthermore, how many of your Lordships live in areas in which there are two local newspapers? There are few indeed&#151;if any. The reason is that they are serving markets so small that there is no room for two. Yet, if we are to make achieving plurality a major objective of Ofcom, it cannot ignore that. It may refuse mergers that would otherwise be sensible and pass other tests.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para5"></a>Diversity of content and a wide range of content is important for the listener; plurality of ownership is not. This paragraph should go. It was not in the original Bill. I do not know its history of introduction. It cannot be traced to the acceptance of a Puttnam recommendation, otherwise it would have appeared in November. I hope that the paragraph is deleted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I oppose both amendments, despite the fact that my noble friend Lord Gordon, with whom I normally agree on such matters, has spoken in favour of the first of them.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para6"></a>The combination of the two amendments means an unfortunate downgrading of the objective of plurality from the general part of the Bill&#151;in Clause 3&#151;to Clause 384 which deals with the review by Ofcom of ownership matters. I believe that plurality&#151;multi-ownership&#151;is highly desirable in all forms of media, including the forms especially mentioned here; television and radio services.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para7"></a>That is not to say that all mergers are undesirable and that small is always beautiful. It is to say that diversity and plurality are powerful objective goods for a democracy because of the range of opinions and views that should be available. A lesser argument, but none the less important in the broader terms of Reithian objectives of public service, is that a broader range of entertainment possibilities of highbrow, lowbrow, middlebrow and so forth, is also desirable. It seems to me that diversity is more likely if there is some degree of multi-ownership. There is a severe risk to diversity if there is no multi-ownership.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para8"></a>Since the 1960s, the laws relating to newspaper mergers have had in their legislative embodiment objectives enshrined in law which says that both diversity and plurality of ownership are to be taken into account as part of the broad public interest objectives that the competition authorities should ensure. There is nothing new in the combination of diversity and plurality in the realm of legislation. As regards newspaper mergers, in the past 20 to 30 years it has been desirable to have those provisions. Indeed, I take the view that the more they are used now in a broader way to cover radio and television services, the better. I say to my noble friend Lord Gordon that we need not concern ourselves overmuch with the specific <P>


<a name="column_623"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 623</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>objectives of Ofcom on their own because it is not the final decider in these matters if there is a proposed merger between the different owners of radio and television services: that is determined by the Competition Commission. The desirable objectives of diversity and plurality are there as part of the public interest&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-14_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   Does the noble Lord agree that there is an enormous difference between taking into account plurality of providers and the fact that this Bill is asking that Ofcom be required to secure the maintenance of plurality of providers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   The noble Baroness is right. I was referring specifically to the problem to which she referred, namely, mergers, how Ofcom would deal with them and whether the Government intended that the objective of the maintenance of plurality would be present in those circumstances. I was saying that it would be an objective for Ofcom in those circumstances. But in a merger issue the final decider is not Ofcom, but the Competition Commission. It would weigh up the kinds of points made by the noble Baroness and by my noble friend Lord Gordon of Strathblane; namely, whether the desirability of achieving plurality be countered in some way by the view that a merger would be much more effective and allowable even though the number of owners was being reduced because entertainment, information and various other services would be improved. That would be weighed up. No doubt consideration would be given to the number of different owners left in the market place in determining that issue. In other words, each case would be dealt with on its own. But to have the statement in Clause 3(2)(d),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the maintenance of a plurality of providers of different television and radio services",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-14_para9"></a>
is highly desirable as an objective for Ofcom. I would not wish it to be downgraded as suggested in the second amendment by tucking it away in the fairly narrow clause as regards Ofcom's review of media ownership matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, replies to this mini debate because I want him to resist this amendment. I promise that I shall not hold it against him in the tally which I am keeping. He can have this one free.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para10"></a>Whatever its parentage&#151;perhaps the Minister can tell us where it came from&#151;I consider it the kind of good, robust amendment that should be within the general duties of Ofcom. As regards local radio, and a great deal of the argument which the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, advanced, I even know the jargon. I was told that it is called &quot;hotelling" when two radio stations put out exactly the same programming to capture the same market.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para11"></a>One of the paradoxes of the new technologies is that when they appeared on the horizon we were promised genuinely local radio, which the communities would own. Indeed, I remember when the cable service <P>


<a name="column_624"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 624</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>started in Greenwich we were told that we would get, God help us, direct broadcasts from Greenwich town hall with the local authority in action! That is a ratings winner if ever there was one. But in radio and television one has to look at the American example. Massive media conglomerates hoover up stations and concentrate power. In the face of that reality a healthy democracy puts plurality as well as diversity as real objectives. I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, with all his experience, and I am even more reassured that this is an amendment which, with a clear conscience, the Government can resist.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, replies, I find myself very much in agreement with what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has said. With apologies to my own Front Bench, I do not quite understand the purpose of knocking out the duty in Clause 3 and in a sense re-inserting it again in Clause 333. If there is a difference here it is that Clause 3, under the heading of &quot;General duties of OFCOM", refers to securing the maintenance of a plurality of providers of different television and radio services. I believe that one must accept that that is stronger language than that which appears in Clause 333, which refers to having regard to the need for the maintenance of plurality.
<P>

<a name="30429-14_para12"></a>In my experience and as one involved in the drafting and preparation from the Home Office, which was then responsible for the Broadcasting Bill 1990&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I hope that my noble friend will not mind me intervening. The second amendment relates to Clause 384, which deals with the review of media ownership. As the Minister has already said, the fact that it is further down the Bill does not make it any less important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </B>   I appreciate what my noble friend has said. I meant page 333 (Clause 384). I return to Amendment No 9. One of the great things which we set out to do in the Broadcasting Bill 1990 was to try to provide for the continuance of plurality of different radio and television services. I remember it very well. Our aim was to try to keep going, particularly in ITV, the 13 or 14 different regional television companies. We failed. One looks at the history of the 10 to 12 years since then and realises that the market forces were too great. Obviously, with the proposed merger now between Granada and United News, the amount of plurality in ITV and Channel 3 is likely to be greatly reduced. But that appears to be a very strong reason for putting an objective to Ofcom to do its best to secure plurality.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para0"></a>I believe that the key words here are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of different television and radio services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-15_para1"></a><P>

<a name="30429-15_para2"></a>One is not asking for the maintenance of two or three identical television and radio services. Although it might have been desirable, I believe that the days of that being possible have gone. One is saying that when, later in the Bill, we reach the clauses regarding ownership and changes there as regards Channel 5 or of ITN, it is extremely important that that should be <P>


<a name="column_625"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 625</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>against a background in which one of the aims is to have plurality of different radio and television services so that we do not finish with simply one type of television or radio service, no matter what its name or ownership.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para3"></a>Therefore, I very much agree with what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and others have said. I hope that it will remain as a general duty of Ofcom as well as the specific requirement which appears in the later clauses of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bragg: </B>   I agree very much with what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said but I should like to support the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, on certain particular instances. I believe that those should be mentioned on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para4"></a>I used to be chairman of Border Television and I should like to use that as an example. It is a very small station. It is very difficult indeed to see how another station of commensurate clout and resources in that extremely thinly populated area could be set up. If another station were forced into existence in such circumstances, my experience leads me to believe&#151;I could be wrong&#151;that it would probably be an embarrassing and expensive failure that would end up having to be bailed out.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para5"></a>I have nothing to do with Border Television now but I believe that it would have to challenge a rival company in order to retain its own audience. As the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, said, television companies meet rivals head on, as we see happening most nights with ITV and BBC1 broadcasting popular soaps such as &quot;EastEnders" and &quot;Coronation Street" at the same time. The same thing would happen if Border Television were challenged by a rival company and would lead to a diminution in the quality of broadcasting it offered.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para6"></a>I believe that there is a positive side to the position in which Border Television finds itself. Having worked at Border Television for many years I believe that for such a company to have a monopoly in the tiny area it covers imposes, curiously, an obligation on it to reach as many of the people in that area and as diverse a section of those people as possible. If the company does not reach those people, it has no audience whatsoever. For example, the company cannot target 16 to 24 year-olds when there are only 16 or 24 of them.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para7"></a>The viewing figures of Border Television&#151;which could be described as a monopolistic local station&#151;were phenomenal. It achieved viewing figures of between 65 and 75 per cent for a particular evening slot and when it broadcast local documentaries. A problem might arise if we try to change that situation. I do not want such companies to be steamrollered out of existence. How does one impose plurality when the resources cannot sustain that&#151;I am talking about equality of resources not about running a tube from the town hall&#151;and when citizens are showing through the viewing figures that they like what they have? There are often very good solutions to the problems posed by very local broadcasting. I fear that by forcing <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the measure we are discussing on companies covering very localised areas we shall dilute the strength of local broadcasting.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para8"></a>We have to keep remembering that broadcasting, particularly television broadcasting, despite all the gadgets, widgets and whatnots, is still a very expensive undertaking. People will not be willing to set up broadcasting companies that cover tiny areas. We could rush ahead and steamroller out much good work that has been done in a quiet way in local districts a long way from London.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, for drawing our attention to the fact that the words which we seek to amend were put into the Bill in the Commons. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, also alluded to that process.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para9"></a>I have done my best to identify where they were put in in the Commons. I cannot see any evidence that they were put in in Committee. I have to assume that they were put in on Report, where under Commons procedures new clauses are taken first. When they are under a programme Motion in another place, the only reference to a government amendment that is passed at the end when the guillotine comes down will simply state, &quot;Government amendment so-and-so agreed to". Consequently, unless I am mistaken&#151;I accept that my scrutiny has been rapid&#151;we have no idea why these words were put into the Bill. That puts us at a disadvantage, particularly when our attention is not drawn to the fact that they entered the Bill in that particular manner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   I am tempted to rise by the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, about Border Television and by what he said about the dangers of seeking to impose plurality. There was an example of that in Wales in the early 1960s when the old ITA, as we then knew it&#151;the Independent Television Authority&#151;proposed and, indeed, promoted the setting up of a company called Wales West and North which overlapped the company in which I served, Television Wales and the West. Wales West and North was a financial failure. Television Wales and the West had to take it over and run the services on its behalf and on behalf of the Independent Television Authority which had set them up. Therefore, there is a danger in seeking to impose plurality. As in that case, when the imposition was largely sponsored by the ITA, so here we would appear to be laying a duty on Ofcom to promote plurality which might end up in the same kind of disaster.

But I am afraid that for the sake of the record there are things that I have to say. Having scored two points with the noble Lord, Lord McNally, I am sure he will deduct them from two other &quot;Noes".

<a name="30429-15_para10"></a>The point here is that we are considering plurality not on its own but in conjunction with competition and diversity. Indeed, it is difficult to see how one can have competition in the provision of broadcast services unless one has a degree of plurality. But that apart, diversity is about a range of content and could in principle be supplied by the same provider. To ensure that that is not the only way of achieving diversity and that we get the best degree of diversity, the Bill includes certain limits on ownership. My opposition to the amendments should be supported by everyone who wants to maintain ownership rules and, a fortiori, by those who want to extend them. On that point I look deliberately at the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and his friends.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para11"></a>The Bill enables Ofcom, when it is periodically reviewing the media ownership rules, to take plurality into account. That seems obvious but Ofcom would have to conduct a review to take into account factors such as diversity and competition but not the one thing which the rules are designed to protect. That is why we have given Ofcom this general duty. Previous legislation needed no such duty because the ownership rules were not subject to review by the regulators.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para12"></a>Let me make it clear that this duty does not bite where Ofcom is considering matters unconnected with the media ownership rules. It does not, in other words, give Ofcom a second bite of the cherry where actions or acquisitions are consistent with the media ownership rules. For example, it would not enable Ofcom to include plurality considerations when considering changes in control of broadcasting licences where the factors which Ofcom is to consider are set out in the relevant clauses of the Bill. Nor would it mean that Ofcom could block a merger which was acceptable to the OFT on the basis that it reduces plurality of providers of television and radio services. If a merger is compliant with the media ownership rules a decision to block it could be taken only on competition grounds, and Ofcom is not a competition authority with respect to mergers.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para13"></a>I have listened to the points made about including the plurality duty in Clause 384. That would involve downgrading the duty and making it more limited. That is acknowledged. We considered whether the duty would be more appropriate in Clause 3 or in Clause 384. At present we think that this duty will be relevant only to the ownership review. However, this need not always be the case. Schedule 14 allows the Secretary of State to modify the rules and, in principle, it is possible that the rules could be amended in a way that gave Ofcom a degree of discretion. If that were the case, it is important that in exercising that discretion, Ofcom should have regard to plurality along with its other duties. We have no plans to make such changes but the possibility is there. So we believe that Clause 3 is the right place for the plurality duty because plurality potentially has an application wider than just the media ownership review.
<P>

<a name="30429-15_para14"></a>In response to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, the clause is about maintaining plurality. We are not talking about artificially seeking to create plurality where it does not exist. I hope that the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, can he address the issue of the clause's parentage&#151;bearing in mind that it was not in the Bill when it was introduced in another place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Bills change as time goes on. When we introduced the Bill to another place, we considered in the first instance that the ownership rules would guarantee plurality within and between media markets. We thought that would be enough. We amended the Bill to be certain that in any future decisions when Ofcom is not bound to apply certain rules it can maintain plurality. I have no doubt that the noble, Lord Brooke, is right to say that provision was introduced at Report stage. It may be that it was not debated on the Floor in another place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bragg: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, perhaps I may seek further clarification. I want to make it quite clear that I am all in favour of plurality, but I gave a particular instance of where it would be very difficult to achieve and would do an existing local station great harm and&#151;the only thing that matters&#151;give viewers a worse service. When such occasions arise&#151;we were given a wonderful supplementary example&#151;may we be reassured that there will be no imposition, no &quot;You must", or rule that what must be national must be local? That could do a disservice to many local communities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, answered that point. We do not intend to impose plurality where it does not exist. I take very seriously my noble friend's point about Border Television and the risk of seeking to impose plurality. ITV licences were always allocated on a regional basis. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, that at one stage there was an attempt to make sub-regions for licence purposes. That did not work then and I cannot imagine that it would work now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, for pressing the point that I was trying to make. I am not seeking to argue against the Minister because there is a meeting of minds between us. The problem with the procedure in another place&#151;I am making a plea for change in the procedure&#151;is that when the guillotine falls any outstanding government amendments are immediately read into the Bill. Unfortunately, Hansard does not record their wording. It therefore requires a great deal of research to discover what is new to a Bill&#151;provisions that were not spoken to but were added silently. It would be easier for those of us trying to follow the progress of a Bill in another place if the wording of such amendments were shown. My reading of the Bill's Report stage in another place is that selections consisted entirely of new clauses. Some <P>


<a name="column_629"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 629</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments were added in groupings. If the next group had not been reached when the guillotine fell, Government amendments were added to the Bill willy nilly, without their wording being published.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I cannot take responsibility for the procedures of another place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I made it perfectly clear that I was not complaining of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. I am simply saying that in relations between the two Houses, it would be helpful if another place indicated the text of changes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That exchange is on the record.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I made clear in my introductory remarks that one of the reasons for tabling the amendment was to identify the source and purpose of the new clause&#151;which, to be fair, was briefly debated in another place.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para0"></a>Her Majesty's Opposition are not against plurality. We are trying to understand why the Government chose to add this particular clause at this particular place. We asked whether the clause relates solely to mergers and acquisitions&#151;the review of ownership rules. The Minister replied that one of the reasons for inserting the clause at this point in the Bill is that plurality need not always relate to ownership rules but may potentially have wider applications. The Minister referred to Schedule 14 and I shall certainly consider the clause's wider application.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para1"></a>This debate has been extremely helpful because it was notable that noble Lords spoke about the desirability and objective of maintaining plurality of providers. We have no argument with maintaining plurality but have difficulty with ensuring that Ofcom shall be required to secure the maintenance of the plurality of providers. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, made it clear that in the case of mergers and acquisitions it may be for the Office of Fair Trading to decide whether or not plurality should be maintained&#151;in which case, it will be out of Ofcom's hands.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para2"></a>We made specific reference to Clause 384, which deals with the review of ownership rule. I repeat, with deference to my noble friend Lord Renton, that the review is an important provision and we place equal importance on that part of the Bill in respect of that specific subject.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para3"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Roberts of Conwy and the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, for articulating real examples of where maintaining plurality of providers is not viable and does not make common sense.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para4"></a>I reiterate that we are not agin plurality. Far from it. Perhaps I should return to this issue on Report, by suggesting that paragraph (d) should be inserted instead in Clause 3(3)&#151;depending on the wording that we may devise. That allows Ofcom to take a broader, more flexible and sensible approach in the circumstances. At <P>


<a name="column_630"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 630</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the moment, there is ambiguity. Speaking to Amendment No. 1 the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said that we should do all that we can to negate ambiguity in respect of Ofcom's general duties. The noble Lord the Minister said that there is no question but that Clause 3(2)(d) would require the maintenance of plurality providers where plurality does not already exist. The fact that we are being extensively lobbied and ourselves question the subsection's parameters tells me that ambiguity exists.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para5"></a>Given that the Minister is not inclined to accept our amendment, which would bracket the provision with the review of ownership rules, I ask him to think about the positioning of paragraph (d)&#151;perhaps reintroducing it in Clause 3(3). I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-16_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 23. The amendments consider security, and the need for Ofcom to be involved in promoting open standards for technological security systems, in order to prevent unauthorised use of personal data and copyright content.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para9"></a>Technology is developing rapidly, and with it comes the potential to access sensitive information in both the business and personal spheres; hence the importance of security cannot be underestimated. Personal privacy must be protected, as individuals have the right to ensure that data concerning themselves and their families are not made available to others.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para10"></a>Equally important is the need to prevent children from being exposed to harmful content. Parents struggle to keep their children away from indecent material that is proliferating exponentially, and Ofcom could make their struggle a lot easier if it were to involve itself in security.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para11"></a>Business also has a lot at stake, most obviously the music industry, but increasingly the film industry is threatened by unlawful downloading from Internet sites. That is flagrant violation of copyright law and will, if serious action is not taken soon, lead to the decline of those thriving British creative industries.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para12"></a>Computer crime does not stop there, but threatens all business with widespread incidence of hacking into private systems, spreading viruses and the like. I realise that no one will deny that security is an issue of great importance that must be tackled, but why give Ofcom the responsibility?
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para13"></a>We suggest that Ofcom should have the responsibility because the changing nature of technology means that what is currently primarily an <P>

It is naive to ignore security in the Bill because that is an Internet issue, when it clearly will not remain within those strict confines for long. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-16_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   I will be interested to hear what the Minister says. The noble Baroness raises very real issues. I am not convinced that Ofcom is the right body to deal with them, but I might be convinced in the process. She is right on the issues covering access to pornography and other such material with convergence. Let us remember that, when we started, this was the Bill that was going to accommodate convergence. The capacity to access something on mobile phones, personal computers and televisions is converging, and some of the material will be accessible. I am not sure who should handle that.
<P>

<a name="30429-16_para14"></a>The other issue to which the noble Baroness referred&#151;the capacity of the new technologies to be used basically to steal music, films and so on&#151;is one in which I have taken an interest in the past. It is a real problem. I am not sure whether it is yet another problem that we should give to the noble Lord, Lord Currie, and his colleagues, but it is a definite problem and I would be very interested to hear the Minister's response to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I shall resist the amendments, but the noble Lord, Lord McNally, cannot count that as a no, because I agree about the importance of the subject and shall suggest that there are better ways to deal with it. Of course it is enormously important to protect copyright content and to allow parents to protect children from harmful content, but there are other ways to do so that are better, for reasons that I shall give.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para0"></a>We have regulatory controls elsewhere. We have data protection law, copyright law, and criminal law for the protection of children. The amendments would concentrate on mandatory standards. They would not allow for either the technological change to which the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, referred or the possibility of self-regulation if it were to be the better route. We could have Ofcom in the position of deciding between different standards, giving advantage to some operators over others. New entrants to the market whose contribution could be very valuable could be excluded because of the mandatory controls.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para1"></a>There is another dimension, which is the framework of European directives that will govern regulation of communications networks and services. Those are matters for international bodies. Ofcom will not be able to impose purely national standards on the provision of those networks and services.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para2"></a>There are lots of technical and network-based solutions, such as spam filtering and parental control options, but they are not the answer in themselves. We have to look also to the education of parents and children in the technologies, and how to avoid unsuitable material in the first place. Ofcom's work on <P>


<a name="column_632"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 632</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>media literacy, which is in the Bill, will be important. The Home Secretary has a task force on the protection of children on the Internet, which has advised the Government on public awareness campaigns.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para3"></a>I must resist the idea that we should require all providers of services to use particular standards or conform to particular requirements. No one solution will meet everyone's needs, and it is important that we be able to reflect both the international situation and changing technological developments. In any case, any standards imposed by Ofcom would have to be consistent with the European regulatory regime for electronic communications, including the new directive on privacy and electronic communications.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para4"></a>It is known that the Bill introduces four European directives, but it does not introduce that on privacy and electronic communications, which will be introduced by separate regulations under European communities legislation, precisely because we do not think it an appropriate general duty of Ofcom to enforce that. At the moment, we are consulting&#151;we have been since the end of March&#151;on how to implement the directive. We are also considering the results of a consultation on the implementation of the copyright directive.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para5"></a>We are active on the subject. We think that there are ways to deal with it, but we do not think that the amendment is the right way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving me such a full answer, and I thank the noble Lord, Lord McNally, for sharing my concerns. As to whether the Bill is the right place to deal with them, I do not know. We have had a lot of pressure on the subject, and I am quite concerned about the ways of implementing the directive from the European Union to which the Minister referred. For the moment, I will withdraw the amendment and take time to consider the right place for it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-17_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendments are directed to what many of us still regard as a fundamental flaw in the structure of the Bill. That flaw is the threatened removal of a unique, and uniquely important, feature of our present system&#151;the existence of an entirely independent lay body, which has the duty to consider independently certain complaints from members of the public, either about lapses in standards of taste and decency, or about infringements of privacy or unfair treatment by broadcasters. It is also a body which has the independent power to redress such injustices.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para9"></a>That is what we have now, and we have it not by accident, but as a result of changes deliberately and progressively required by Parliament during the past <P>


<a name="column_633"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 633</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>two decades. Moreover, we have in place today an experienced group of independent people, well served by an experienced staff, who have been doing this job for a number of years and who have won the respect of complainants and broadcasters alike. The amendments are designed to ensure that those qualities and achievements are not lost but are built on and maintained.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para10"></a>The amendment would specifically strengthen the public service aspects of the Bill by setting out in the Bill the remit and powers&#151;neither of which is spelt out in detail&#151;of the content board. Reference is made only to its exercising &quot;influence" over Ofcom's decisions. That, frankly, is not enough. A more specifically defined remit is needed to reinforce the content board's public service obligations and its powers in dealing with any breaches.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para11"></a>As your Lordships know, the Bill seeks lighter touch regulation, with far more onus on broadcasters to self- regulate on content and fairness and privacy. It is, however, unrealistic to suppose that every complainant with a serious grievance will be any more content in the future with answers given by the broadcasters than they were in the past. History clearly points to a likely need for a more structured, independent approach to address at least some complaints when broadcasters and citizens refuse to be reconciled. That is what is proposed in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para12"></a>The history of this issue, as I said, is important and speaks for itself. The principle of scrutiny by lay people, independent of broadcasters and regulators, was first enshrined in the Broadcasting Act 1980, which created the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to deal with issues of fairness and privacy. The Broadcasting Act 1990, which created the Independent Television Commission, not only retained the Broadcasting Complaints Commission but added the Broadcasting Standards Council to handle issues of violence, taste and decency.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para13"></a>It should be stressed that throughout that period broadcasters had their own standards codes. Those codes were required to reflect the statutory commission's own codes. Nevertheless, complaints about taste and decency and fairness and privacy have continued to keep both commissions and the ITC fairly busy.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para14"></a>My experience&#151;I declare an interest as a previous chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council and then of the commission&#151;is that the wholly lay membership of these bodies, which were recently merged into the Broadcasting Standards Commission, introduced a new and important dimension into the resolution, where practical, of complaints. The independence of the adjudicators provided reassurance to many of those complaining. That reassurance can be attributed, at least in part, to the power of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, like its two predecessors, to order the publicising on air or in print&#151;or, indeed, both&#151;of its critical findings.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para15"></a>The Bill currently provides for the application of standards that provide adequate protection to members of the public and other persons from unfair treatment and unwarranted infringement of privacy. Similarly, protection is to be provided from offensive and harmful material. However, in neither case is there any indication of how complaints about those matters will be handled. This is too important an issue to be entrusted to Ofcom if no specific duties or enforcement powers are provided for it in the Bill. The amendment is intended to fill that important gap. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30429-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   I support this amendment. I, too, was chairman of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which dealt with unfairness and infringements of privacy. Enormous distress was caused among many people whose privacy or fairness had been infringed. This amendment is very like the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, about public services, although it involves a more minor situation. Enormous distress has been caused to people who suffered in this regard.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para16"></a>We want a statement of principle like those in written constitutions, but that does not occur. If it does not occur, distress could occur. The body is very amorphous; it deals with competition and commercial matters. We must have in it something that helps individuals. In my four or five years on the commission, I saw people who were enormously distressed by a programme that had caused them trouble. I cannot understand why the Government are not prepared to place in the early part of the Bill a principle that protects individuals.
<P>

<a name="30429-17_para17"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, raises a point of principle, which is related to the individual. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, or the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, will not say no to this amendment; it is most innocuous and it would care for people. We should care for people. In my four or five years on the commission, I saw people whose lives were absolutely destroyed. There is nothing in the Bill that fulfils the aim of the noble Baroness's amendment. Surely the Minister can say &quot;Hello" to this amendment.

<A NAME="30429-18_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Manchester: </B>   I support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. This approach is an essential part of furthering community interests in communications matters to ensure that there is adequate means for the individual&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, said&#151;and the community to express their voice. It is particularly important for the means available for that to be inclusive and not to limit the range of voices heard because of economic or other factors. It also follows from that that the redress for complaints must be provided free to the public by a regulatory body that should not be heard to say, &quot;If you have a complaint then sue". Equally, the potential confusion over which issues are for the content board and which are for the <P>


<a name="column_635"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 635</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consumer panel is answered by this simple amendment, which leaves the means of delivering the redress to Ofcom and its content board. I suggest that that is hardly onerous for either.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para0"></a>The present regulators provide such redress, and it is easily accessible to the public. Indeed, the public clearly feel the need to make use of such an opportunity, as is shown by the Broadcasting Standards Council's own figures, which show an increase in direct complaints to the council of 46 per cent in 2002. The content board will need to win public confidence but it will not do that without a credible and easily used means of accountability for the public, under which it is clear which matters are issues for which body. I hope that the Government will agree to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lipsey: </B>   I, too, sympathise very much with what the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, is trying to do. I want to make a single point. The problem in this context is more cultural than legislative. There was a case in yesterday's newspaper&#151;I shall not go into the details&#151;in which the Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld a complaint against a programme on the grounds that it conducted its dealings with people taking part in the programme under false pretences. The BSC's verdict was that it was guilty. What was the response of the organisation? Did it apologise to the people concerned and say that it would try to ensure that it would never happen again? No. The response was to say that the verdict was disgraceful and that it had done absolutely nothing wrong. I am afraid that that is a problem among broadcasters and in my former profession of journalism. I refer to an unwillingness to admit to error in this regard and a willingness to use total power.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para1"></a>I contrast that&#151;I see that my noble friend Lord Borrie is in his place&#151;with the situation regarding the Advertising Standards Authority, on which I sit under my noble friend's wise chairmanship. The advertising industry often does not like our judgments but it nearly always accepts them without further protest, redress to law or anything else of that kind. The real success of Ofcom in this regard, whatever legislative powers we give it, will be whether it can bring about a cultural change by which broadcasting organisations are prepared to admit for the first time that they are capable of error.

<A NAME="30429-18_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   We on these Benches have just suddenly agreed to follow the views generally of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. We have great sympathy with the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. We have seen her distinguished work on the Broadcasting Standards Commission and the way in which it was carried out. Some years ago, she very kindly gave us the opportunity of spending a morning there; we saw the work that was done and how effectively it was done. What gives us some problems in this regard was well expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey: this is more a cultural matter&#151;I liked that phrase&#151;rather than anything else. Ofcom will <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>have to deal with some objective problems, as did the Broadcasting Standards Commission whose gravest problems involved intrusion on privacy. Decisions on violence, obscenity and so on are largely subjective. They change with time and fashion as they have done since we have had the benefit of the work of the Broadcasting Standards Commission.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para2"></a>The regulatory body will have great difficulty on that issue. I agree that it is healthy for viewers and listeners to have the opportunity to raise issues where offence may have been given&#151;it may be to a minority&#151;through perceived indecency of language or behaviour or by the offending of a moral sense among some of the community. But it is not easy to make such provision in concrete terms on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para3"></a>Ofcom will have clear machinery to deal with issues such as intrusion on privacy or the deceiving of people into programmes on a pretext that is clearly false. The noble Baroness does not seek today to divide the Committee. However, if she were to tighten the provision, the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, and I might come closer to agreement with her. At present, the wording is a little loose. It is difficult to envisage how it could be incorporated on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   I am slightly worried. I understand the noble Lord's point. Privacy and unfairness cause enormous distress. I agree that the amendment may have to be refined. However, I should be sad if it became lost in the idea of a relative morality that we cannot define. I have had to deal with individuals who have suffered infringement of privacy and unfairness. Lives can be wrecked. In considering the amendment, I hope that the Committee will try to escape from the issue of relative morality. I share the noble Lord's view. One has to define it. In a street of 10 houses, one has 10 different concepts of morality. Unfairness and privacy&#151;those were my concerns&#151;need to be enshrined in the Bill. At present, they are not. I hope that the Government will propose an amendment which enshrines them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-18_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord. If the provision can be tightened to the extent he suggests, we would be happy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-18_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I do not know whether it is appropriate for me to speak at this stage. However, it is important to clarify matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Baroness asked the question. If we are to have a sensible debate, it is better for the Minister to reply and for the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, to use her right of reply at the end of the debate. There is no rule&#151;anyone can intervene at any time in Committee&#151;but it makes for a tidier debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-18_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I support the amendment. I agree with my noble friend Lord Pilkington. It is surprising that this important issue is not addressed elsewhere in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My noble friend Lord McIntosh does not act in self-interest when he <P>


<a name="column_637"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 637</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggests that Ministers should speak because it now falls to me to do so. I regret that the attempt by the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, to encourage either the noble Lord, McIntosh, or the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, to say &quot;No" has not been successful. I shall say &quot;No" instead, but he may not regard that as much comfort. However, I hope that I do so while fully understanding the concerns of the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. I respect the roles they have played in their chairmanship of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the Broadcasting Standards Commission. They speak with great expertise.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para4"></a>The Government do not approach the issue in any way but in a considered manner. We do not have the flexible policy framework that the Liberal Democrat Party adopts on occasions, with last minute consultations on the Front Bench during debate. Our position is established over a period of time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-18_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I should like to make clear that ours is not a last minute consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-18_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I had not brought in the Official Opposition but reserved my remarks solely for the Liberal Democrat Benches.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para5"></a>I emphasise that the Bill contains the necessary machinery for dealing with the issues rightly identified in debate today. Ofcom will inherit the function currently undertaken by the Broadcasting Standards Commission to consider complaints of unfair treatment or unwarranted infringements of privacy. This function, and the detailed procedures for considering and adjudicating on complaints, is set out in the Broadcasting Act 1996. We believe that these provisions have worked well in encouraging high journalistic standards in the broadcast media and that is why we have preserved them and passed them on to Ofcom.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para6"></a>They provide a readily accessible route for complainants to pursue their complaint and have the record set straight. They do not provide a right of privacy or a substitute for matters more properly considered by a court of law, such as any claim for damages, but research carried out by the Broadcasting Standards Commission establishes that complainants are more concerned with safeguarding and restoring their reputation than with receiving financial award, and the BSC route provides a good route for addressing their concerns. That framework is enshrined in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para7"></a>As we have provided for an adequate means for considering and providing redress for complaints about the matters, and the duty at Clause 3(2)(f) charges Ofcom with providing adequate protection to the members of the public in relation to the relevant standards, it is entirely superfluous to place a further duty on Ofcom to ensure the availability of that system. The Bill already contains the system.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para8"></a>The noble Baroness may also be interested to note that observance of the fairness code under the 1996 Act will be a condition of broadcasters' licences. <P>


<a name="column_638"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 638</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Where Ofcom considers that a breach of the fairness code includes a contravention of the licence, it may take enforcement action against the licence holder in addition to adjudicating on the fairness complaint.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para9"></a>Amendment No. 51, with Amendment No. 11, appears designed to ensure that the functions of the content board include, to the extent determined by Ofcom, functions in relation to the consideration of complaints about breaches of fairness standards and privacy. Those functions fall within those which Ofcom could give to the content board but we do not believe it right to include them specifically in the legislation. To limit Ofcom's discretion as to how it discharges the responsibilities for which it will be held to account might skew its ability to fulfil them. Ofcom might, for example, feel that the establishment, perhaps in conjunction with the content board, of separate arrangements for handling complaints&#151;for example, through a separate committee of Ofcom&#151;might be a more effective option.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para10"></a>We do not believe it is right to seek to constrain Ofcom's flexibility in that way given that the powers are enshrined in the Bill and given the duties upon Ofcom derivative from the 1996 Act which is the basis on which the substantial work of the Broadcasting Standards Commission was done.
<P>

<a name="30429-18_para11"></a>More generally, on the question of taste, the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, introduced an important point, as did my noble friend Lord Lipsey. These are more difficult areas to identify with some precision in legislation. We all recognise that standards of taste and decency change over time. There needs to be a framework within which these issues are considered. I think I have established that in the&#151;

<A NAME="30429-18_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   I accept what the Minister says. However, I wonder whether he realises the enormous distress caused. I shall give an example. A programme was produced by Carlton showing a murder in Northern Ireland. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission found against that programme. It was a caricature of the truth. What happened? The programme was sold to Australia. One can acquiesce and say that they can go to law, but one has to be very rich to go to law against commercial organisations of the strength of a television company. I fear that the Government are not protecting people who suffer infringement of privacy or unfairness. I hope that they will do so in the Bill. Believe me, gross abuses have occurred. I hope that the Government will pay attention to this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I have some sympathy with the comments of the noble Lord. I served for a time on the Select Committee in another place that considered such abuses of the media, particularly in journalism. I am aware that cases arise which cause the greatest concern to us all. Restitution is not always made in full, although I think it is recognised that the requirements placed on broadcasting in the framework proposed in <P>


<a name="column_639"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 639</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Bill and in that which has obtained in the past are much more stringent than anything to do with the written media.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para0"></a>However, I emphasise that I can imagine the distress caused in the case identified by the noble Lord. The question of whether rights were sold to a company in a foreign country and whether the programme was broadcast there would be very much a matter for the law of that country, not our own in those terms. I recognise and share the concern raised. I seek to reassure the noble Lord that Ofcom inherits the powers and obligations in the Broadcasting Act; they are in the Bill. I hope that on that basis the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   Of course, the Bill could introduce sanctions. Fines could be imposed. The Government have fought shy because the old legislation does not give that power. I do not believe the Government have given thought to this matter. A fine could be imposed if the programme was broadcast in Australia. English law is powerful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I thank all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate on what I certainly regard as a very important issue&#151;both those who have supported me and those who have their doubts. I am particularly glad to have had reassurance from the Minister that Clause 2 does exactly what he says it does; it carries through the same powers to Ofcom and, it is hoped that that will be able to be passed on to the content board or possibly, as he suggested, sub-committees. That would again make the case very strongly, not just about fairness and privacy where grave wrongs have been done in the past, with much greater damage than being taken through a court of law. It is so important that it is spelt out in Clause 3(2)(f)(i) and (ii). I do not think that fairness and privacy was there in the original draft but it is there now. It is good to know that that will be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para1"></a>I hope I can assume from what the Minister said that indeed the Government will expect Ofcom, the content board or a subsidiary to deal with complaints from the public. It will be impossible to have no one ultimately responsible. I regard that as important also for taste and decency. It is all very well the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, referring to a change of culture. Why have we not seen that over the past 20 years with broadcasters being more responsive to the attitudes of the public? Of course attitudes to taste and decency change over time. That is what was so important about a body such as the Broadcasting Standards Commission, because its approach and its membership changed over time, too. Quite deliberately today I did not refer to that which I mentioned on Second Reading and previously. I still do not regard Ofcom or the content board as sufficiently independent to make such judgments, because they issue licences. On that side, I am particularly glad to know that there will be other methods by which these matters can be dealt with.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Alli: </B>   Perhaps the noble Baroness would recognise two matters as regards the broadcasters' <P>


<a name="column_640"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 640</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>position on taste and decency. Long gone are the days when one could test a programme before it was broadcast. Therefore, one of the problems is that condemnation comes only post-broadcast. It is difficult because one is always adjudicating. One does not deliberately put something out that one believes will offend people, but the nature of the system is that it comes through.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para2"></a>As a general point, it is difficult for broadcasters to consider the issue seriously and take on board the regulations imposed on them when the print media has virtually no regulation. There are dual standards. As regards privacy, it is difficult when we are putting into the Bill hoops for broadcasters to go through, yet no such hoops exist for the printed media. That dilemma is at the heart of the attitude referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. It is an attitude of unfairness to one broadcast medium as against another.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I shall reply briefly to the noble Lord. I accept the point he makes, other than that I believe it is more damaging for something to be shown on television and listened to on radio than to appear in the print media. We all know why there is this longstanding element of difference between the print and the broadcast media.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bragg: </B>   It is slightly naive of my noble friend Lord Alli to say that broadcasters do not put out things that they intend to offend against taste and decency. If he trots along the networks and the &quot;this, that and the others" late on any night he will see things that cannot but be there to offend against taste and decency&#151;certainly mine, thank you very much.

<P>

<A NAME="30429-19_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I beg leave to withdraw the amendment but I may return to it at a later stage.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-19_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: Following in the footsteps of the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, and those of my noble friends Lord Peyton and Lord Brooke, I, too, express my apologies for the fact that I was unable to participate in the Second Reading debate. However, I note that, as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, put it, it was an occasion when the &quot;fluffies" crowded out the &quot;techies". I do not consider myself to be a particular expert in the field&#151;if you will, a &quot;techie"&#151;but it is important that some of the technological aspects that underlie the Bill are given a wider airing than they have had so far. Therefore, I hope that Members of the Committee will forgive me if I take a little longer than would normally be appropriate to explain the context of the few amendments tabled in my name.
<P>


<a name="column_641"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 641</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para6"></a>Outwardly, the Bill addresses issues of convergence in the media and broadcasting sector and, as I think we all agree, in an economic sense it makes a good fist of this. There may be more or less tidying up to be dealt with around some of the headline issues&#151;indeed, earlier debates today made that point&#151;but, in essence, both the Government and the Bill team are to be congratulated on having produced a pretty solid piece of drafting.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para7"></a>The Joint Committee, under the astute and invigorating chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, also deserves our plaudits. So I find it disappointing that, to my perception, the Bill is so tentative on some aspects of technological convergence.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para8"></a>However, I recognise the problems involved. I am only too willing to endorse wholeheartedly the Government's oft-repeated mantra that&#151;here I quote directly the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We do not intend to regulate the internet".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 3/12/02; col. 784.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-19_para9"></a>
That is very welcome. While I am acutely aware&#151;noble Lords may be tiring of me beating this particular drum&#151;that there are problems in need of redress as far as concerns IT, I willingly accept that this Bill is not the right mechanism to deal with most of them.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para10"></a>The Minister will no doubt also argue that the Bill has been drafted with &quot;future-proofing" very much in mind. Quite rightly, there is no wish to pre-empt future technological advance by inadvertently favouring a current development over any other on the face of the Bill. But I have a huge problem with the way in which Ministers&#151;possibly the same approach will be adopted in respect of all my amendments today&#151;seek to hide behind the supposed panacea of Clause 3(3)(e) which deals with the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"desirability of encouraging investment and innovation in relevant markets".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-19_para11"></a>
That is not good enough. Nor can I help feeling that, desirable as the Government's aspirations are in their own right, the quest for technological neutrality has resulted in too much timidity, a few blind spots, about the way in which so many of the technological boundaries that once existed within the broadcasting sector are becoming ever more blurred.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para12"></a>Against that background, I turn to the substance of the amendment. As I understand it, the Government are transferring the existing privacy regime&#151;for want of a better way of putting it&#151;from the previous regulators to Ofcom. To that extent, the current drafting of the Bill is, as it were, a direct inheritance. Indeed, the Minister has already said as much when responding to previous amendments. To my mind, the intended purpose is specific; that is, to provide adequate protection from what we could euphemistically call journalistic or media enthusiasm. I have no complaint about that: it is welcome. But there is a big problem here.
<P>


<a name="column_642"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 642</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para13"></a>Technological convergence has meant that the activities of the media are increasingly not confined to the traditional mechanisms of delivery, be they newsprint, television screens or radio. Media interests have been quick to realise and grasp the commercial potential of the new technology, especially the web. The BBC, all the major television companies and major newspapers now have extensive, even lucrative, presences on the Internet. We are all learning new ways of both receiving and imparting information. But I am uncertain that the web and/or Internet-based activities of media enterprises are bound by any constraint on the face of the Bill. In the words of my noble friend Lord Pilkington, the right to privacy does not seem to be properly &quot;sanctified".
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para14"></a>In so far as that interpretation is correct, there is potentially a huge lacuna on the face of the Bill. It is odd that one arm of the media enterprise&#151;that involved in broadcasting by television or radio&#151;should be regulated by the terms of Clause 3(2)(b), while another&#151;its web and/or Internet-based activity&#151;should not. I would go further. There is a legitimate case for arguing that web-based intrusion of privacy represents a more acute risk than that posed by traditional broadcast methods. I acknowledge that this may not be strictly relevant to the amendment as drafted, but we need consider only the modern curse of &quot;spam". Then there is the growing menace of identity theft.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para15"></a>I should emphasise that it is not my intention with the amendment to impose regulation on the Internet. As I have already said, I stand four square behind the Government's position on this issue. Rather it is a case of what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. Surely it has to be the Government's intention that in circumstances where media enterprises &quot;broadcast" material via a new technology, those activities should be subject to the terms of the Bill, as well as those already covered. If not, there is next to nothing gained in having the protection afforded by Clause 3(2)(b), because it can be ridden roughshod over by a savvy enterprise limiting its exposure to those forms of delivery where the regulation does not bite.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para16"></a>There is one other side-bar to the amendment that I should mention. Noble Lords will have noted that it is drafted to be consistent with the existing wording on the face of the Bill. I am sure that noble Lords will also have deduced that this is partly a, no doubt vain, hope that, by so doing, more sympathy for it will be inspired in the minds of those on the Government Benches than might otherwise have been the case. But it also serves another purpose: 3G&#151;third-generation&#151;mobile phones are not yet with us, but 2&#189;G mobile phones are here. Without getting too bogged down in the technicalities, this provides users, among other things, with the facility of transferring images to each other. I believe I am right in saying that a range of establishments have felt it necessary to ban 2&#189;G phones from their premises. These vary from, for example, fitness clubs, because embarrassing and compromising pictures were being taken of individuals and then distributed via the network, to cinemas because of the potential for breach of copyright.
<P>


<a name="column_643"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 643</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para17"></a>It is fair to say that it is simple common sense for such establishments to impose bans; in other words, there is no absolute necessity for the narrow issue, of itself, to be subject to statutory regulation. But it explains why the amendment uses the wording preferred by the Government, especially the phrase &quot;electronic communications network services". It also demonstrates the points that I have already sought to make&#151;namely, that the potential risks to individual privacy and its capacity to be infringed is that much more acute in respect of the new technology.
<P>

<a name="30429-19_para18"></a>The Minister may seek to argue that the purposes of the amendment are already substantially dealt with elsewhere under the umbrella of other legislation. This could well be so, but if there is a single theme that runs through all the amendments tabled in my name, it is that the economic and commercial health of the new technology is dependent upon the degree of trust and confidence that consumers have in it. It has been my experience that among noble Lords, to a greater or lesser extent, there is a wholly natural antipathy towards, even fear of, ICT. It would be inappropriate to define it as &quot;Luddite", but it is a diffidence that has an echo among the wider public. That being so, there are strong arguments in favour of doing what we can to buttress confidence in the technology. Ensuring that consumers have adequate protection against unwarranted infringements of privacy is one of the ways in which this can be done. In this sense, it is my view that it is wholly appropriate that Ofcom's remit should extend in the way suggested by the amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30429-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   I rise briefly on the issue of broadband simply to suggest that, again, we are making a god of competition. I give way to the noble Lord. I apologise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   I have a few comments to make about the noble Earl's amendment. I am most concerned that he should not be allowed to be, or feel, a lone voice. The issues he has raised are of enormous importance. I am sure that other members of the Joint Committee will confirm that when we were confronted with the colossal task that we undertook a year ago we experienced some relief when we were told that we did not have to address such issues. Their inclusion in our work would have greatly increased the burden placed upon us. But these issues must be addressed, though this may not be the Bill within which to address them, nor the moment to do so.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para0"></a>To pretend that because such issues are complex, or in some respects defy our ability to pin them down, is no reason at all to imagine that we shall not have to grapple with them sooner or later and bring them under some form of&#151;here is the dreaded word&#151;intelligent &quot;regulation". It may well be a dotcom, that is a decision for the Government. The noble Earl has <P>


<a name="column_644"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 644</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>done us all a favour by moving this amendment. I hope that the Committee will take his arguments most seriously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I congratulate the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, on introducing this subject and I agree that it is extremely important. If we are seeking to regulate the content of newspapers, but we are not seeking to regulate those newspapers as they appear on the Web, then there is a philosophical inconsistency in our approach to the legislation. Perhaps we will be told by Ministers that what is published on the Web is dealt with in other ways.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para1"></a>However, that seems incongruous. The noble Earl pointed out that much of what is published on the Web is identical to that which appears in other media. He cited the example of the BBC and other television companies which relay identical material on the Web. It is possible to listen to Radio 4 if you so wish, or you can hear the news in real time. Alternatively, you can use a function which I find extremely convenient, that of time-lapse recording. It is then possible to listen to BBC broadcasts or watch transmissions later on.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para2"></a>However, it goes much further than that. It is possible to read almost any respectable newspaper, the text of which is placed on the Web simultaneously with its publication in hard copy. That applies to newspapers all over the world. I do not know whether noble Lords are familiar with a website which offers access to any newspaper published in any country. The website is called www.thepaperboy.com. You are presented with a menu of countries. A click on Pakistan allows you to read this morning's issue of Dawn. Alternatively, the Australian section allows you to read the Brisbane Courier, or in the Thailand section you can see the Bangkok Post.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para3"></a>We live in a global era as regards the publication of newspapers on the Web. The regulations applying to different newspapers in different countries may seem almost irrelevant when it is possible to access all this material in an identical text format via the Internet. Issues of privacy therefore have to be considered in a much wider context than that encompassed by this Bill. I suggest that they must be dealt with on a global basis because the Internet is a global medium. If we ever seek to introduce regulations that apply to the publication of hard copy when it is relayed via the medium of the Internet, then that must be done by means of international agreement rather than through legislation in any one country.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para4"></a>Perhaps the Minister will try to explain how we should deal philosophically with the inconsistency of attempting on the one hand to regulate the print medium, saying that certain things can or cannot be published in that format, while backing off from any attempt to regulate the content of the Internet&#151;a point made by the noble Earl at the start of his remarks. Given that the material may be identical, that would be a hard position to sustain.

<A NAME="30429-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   I shall be extremely brief. I, too, wish to support my noble friend Lord Northesk. From the body language of the Government Front Bench, I detected a sense that we might be drifting away from the text of the amendment. Given that my noble friend has moved the first of a series of electronic and technological amendments, I shall do once what, in a different mode, the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, did when he declared his interests and said that he would not do so again at any stage. I will not repeat the speech I am about to make on any of my noble friend's subsequent amendments.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para5"></a>I share the views expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. I can well recall occasions when in debate between the Department of Trade and Industry and the then Department for National Heritage, some attempts were made to secure rapid decisions favourable to one department by using the complexity of the issue as a way of blinding the other department. I do say that unkindly; it was perfectly proper and understandable. But it means that we must bear the responsibility to ensure that all the technological and electronic flap doors are opened in order to be certain that we are legislating sensibly. We should not pass them by because they are too difficult.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-20_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Northesk. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that we should be grateful to my noble friend for raising this issue. It is a complex subject, one from which perhaps some of us would wish to shrink away, and I must be absolutely straightforward and say that I defer to the expertise of my noble friend. I am grateful to him for raising these important issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene briefly. This is an extremely important matter. I served on the wonderfully named RIP Bill, now an Act. I recall that the interventions of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, then were inevitably correct. Ministers and the department would do well to study carefully his amendments.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para6"></a>The broader issue running through all his amendments is one that cuts both ways. I have heard arguments which declare that technological convergence makes legislation superfluous and unnecessary. I am glad to see that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is shaking his head. As a democrat, that attitude goes against every fibre of my being. Whatever the complexity of the technological issues, Parliament should be able, capable and willing to deal with the problems that arise.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para7"></a>One of those problems is of the kind referred to by my noble friend Lord Avebury; that is, print media on the Internet. Similarly, although we might agonise about taste and decency on television, you can send your nine year-old child to his room, where shortly he could use his 3G telephone to access a Dutch porn channel. It is that convergence of technology which forms the background to the Bill, but which will produce many of the problems that this amendment seeks to tackle.

<P>

<a name="30429-20_para8"></a>All the amendments tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, present the challenge we must face. We are dealing with compartments of communications systems, but convergence is going to render some of the protections we put in place in certain compartments unworkable because of technological change.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-20_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I wish to intervene very briefly because I had intended to bring forward a similar issue under a later amendment. The noble Earl has done the Committee a valuable service with his amendment. He has caused us to think about these matters.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para9"></a>We are being asked to refer to material published by means of electronic media. If you try to look up what that is, it is clarified by subsection (2) as material distributed,

<P>

to members of the public. That is roughly what is meant by this new series of words which seek to incorporate almost all the elements of interactive machinery.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para11"></a>If we follow the paper trail through to Clause 398, which sets out the general interpretations, to Clause 29(1), we are told that it is a,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-20_para12"></a>
I do not know if Members of the Committee are any the wiser for that, but it illustrates how complicated this is.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para13"></a>Although I think I already know the answer, I wish to ask whether it applies to the Internet, however it is accessed&#151;mobile 3G telephones and so forth&#151;because, as we all know, with the advent of broadband we shall be using our computers in all kinds of ways. If the answer is &quot;No, and deliberately so, because that is left to the self-regulation arm of the proposal", is that wise? We are bound to be reaching the point when there should be at least some duty on Ofcom, even if not to regulate formally, perhaps at least to approve codes. I see nothing in this Bill that gives one confidence that the whole area is being looked at in the detail required at this stage.

<A NAME="30429-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My reply to this debate has been anticipated by nearly every speaker, and in every case wrongly. I do not disagree at all with the argument of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk. He is quite right in saying that, if we have provision in Clause 3(2)(f) in respect of radio and television services, there ought to be comparable provision for electronic communication network service users&#151;there is no doubt about that. I shall not rely on Clause 3(3)(e); nor on saying that the matter should not be covered in legislation. I shall rely directly on my response to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, on Amendment No. 10: any standards imposed by Ofcom would have to be consistent with the new European regulatory regime for electronic communications, including the new directive on privacy and electronic communications, to which I referred in some detail.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para14"></a>That directive updates the existing telecom data protection and privacy rules. It will introduce new e-mail and Internet controls. It will not mean us controlling the Internet. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, that that is not our aim. As I said in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, we intend to implement the directive in the UK by means of separate regulations under the European Communities Act 1972 for the reason that I gave&#151;it is wider than the remit of Ofcom. We do not think that an additional general duty on Ofcom of the kind proposed in the amendment is necessary or useful.
<P>

<a name="30429-20_para15"></a>We started consultation on 27th March. As it is a complex issue, we expect a large response. But we shall implement the directive and put in place a set of controls that will have the enormous virtue of covering Europe. It is not a UK matter, it is an international one.

<A NAME="30429-21_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   I am grateful to everyone who contributed to this mini debate. I confess that I am also slightly embarrassed. Normally, when one holds a debate, at least one person opposes the proposal. Curiously, even the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, agrees with the principle of the amendment. There is utter consistency of view throughout the Committee that the amendment approaches an issue of considerable substance that needs to be dealt with. I am grateful for the Minister's response. I recognise that there is an overarching temptation, almost a seduction, to assume that the best way to deal with Net problems is to wait until everyone in the world gets their act together and to do it in that way. I do not necessarily agree with that, but that is by the by.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para0"></a>My real problem with the Communications Bill&#151;and this issue was elaborated upon most perfectly by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury&#151;is that it creates an enormous inconsistency, about which I remain truly concerned. I beseech the Government and the Minister not to have too closed a mind about the matter&#151;if not on my behalf, on that of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, who has much more experience of these matters than me. I am embarrassed that the whole Committee, including the government Front Bench, is happy with the principles underpinning the amendment. For the moment, I am happy to withdraw the amendment. I shall read closely what the Minister has said. But I suspect that I shall return to the issue on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Greengross </B>   rose to move, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the regulations, laid before the House on 11th March, be annulled (S.I. 2003/629).
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I have tabled this prayer to annul this statutory instrument because I think it deserves quite serious scrutiny in this House. I do not intend to divide the House but rather I wish to seek clarification on issues raised by it.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para5"></a>Several organisations have raised concerns about the regulation, most notably Age Concern England, of which I am the vice-president, Help the Aged and the Alzheimer's Disease Society. It is their concerns that I wish to bring to noble Lords' attention today. But, if the impact of the regulations were more widely understood, or if the consultation had been made more public and had lasted longer after the publication of the regulations in mid-March, I am certain that we would also have heard from other organisations. This statutory instrument relates not only to older people but anyone charged for social care&#151;although, we know that the majority are likely to be older people.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para6"></a>As noble Lords will know, the background to this regulation is the Health Act 1999, which gave wide powers to the Secretary of State to define functions carried out by local authorities as health-related functions. That power is being used here to delegate certain administrative functions related to charging for social care to the NHS from local authorities. At first reading, it seems straightforward and uncontroversial. But the main worry is that there could be unintended consequences of what appears to be a minor administrative change but which may take on a wider significance and may be misunderstood by the public.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para7"></a>Given that last month's Budget, thankfully and somewhat belatedly, abolished the very unpopular hospital down-rating rule whereby older people's state pension was docked if they were in hospital too long, I am sure that the Government do not want people to feel&#151;even though that is very much not the case&#151;that the NHS is charging them for something they thought would be free. If that perception takes hold, it could do great damage and confuse an already very confused picture on the still-vexed question of what is healthcare and what is social care.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para8"></a>I understand why the regulation is being introduced. It makes administrative sense. But in what other areas is that likely to happen? I ask the Minister whether the regulations will also be extended to charges under the Supporting People legislation. After all, many local authorities will use the home-care charging policies to charge for Supporting People services more generally.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para9"></a>There are also some specific concerns such as confidentiality. Many more staff will now have access to confidential financial information&#151;people employed by the NHS and social services. I am very much in favour of <P>


<a name="column_649"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 649</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>greater joint working between them, which is an issue that this House debated at length when considering the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Bill before Easter. If they are to work jointly, they must share information. But, given the sensitive nature of financial information, the rules on who will handle it, and how it is handled, may need to be even stricter than they would have been if the information were available only within social services.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para10"></a>I wonder whether it would help to avoid confusion, particularly among older people, about who is levying the charge if all financial information gathering were done only by NHS staff within the finance section of the trust or the partnership, and not by staff who are traditionally seen as health staff, such as nurses or other medical staff. This is often considered to be best practice within social services where it has been found that the collection of information about finances is more accurately and sensibly undertaken by finance department staff. Other staff will not necessarily know, nor can they be expected to know, the full details of social security benefits and the law and guidance on charging.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para11"></a>That brings me to the question of training, specifically of NHS staff whether from the finance department or nurses on wards. The rules are so complicated&#151;we all wish that they were not&#151;but these staff are no doubt already asked by patients about care costs and perhaps may give erroneous information, quite unintentionally but because they cannot know it all. The problem may get worse if NHS staff are actually responsible for providing that information, which is why training of key staff is essential.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para12"></a>I was given a good example of that by Age Concern. Not very long ago, a patient asked a nurse about what would happen if she went into residential care. The nurse said that she would have to sell her house. Fortunately for this patient, the person in the opposite bed just happened to be a local welfare rights officer. Although very ill and on a drip, she was so incensed by this that she jumped out of bed to explain to the lady, who was distraught, that that advice was wrong because the value of her home would be ignored while her husband lived in it.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para13"></a>At Age Concern, everyone said that a PhD was needed to be poor successfully. Such information is very difficult to understand and take in. There is no reason why every nurse on a ward should have access to it. Such situations can easily arise. Luckily for that patient, everything was okay, but it might not have been.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para14"></a>I turn briefly to some areas that are not being delegated to the NHS by these regulations and which could be another problem. I refer first to liable relatives and to the assessment of the liable relative contribution. This was the subject of much debate in the Health and Social Care Act 2001 when I tabled various amendments. The then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was very sympathetic, but it was not possible to end liable relative payments at that time. With this new regulation in place, it may make it more <P>


<a name="column_650"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 650</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>complicated and more bureaucratic for a local authority which collects liable relative payments to work out the total amount to be paid by the family if other parts of the social care charging regime are being handled administratively by the NHS. It could be very confusing for both patients and relatives to have, in effect, one bill arriving from the NHS on behalf of the local authority for the resident and another arriving from the local authority for the liable relative contribution. That is not a fanciful situation; it could happen.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para15"></a>There are a couple of other areas where the regulations have left not delegated powers, such as recovery&#151;I mean financial recovery, not personal recovery where the nurse and doctor are far better qualified than anyone else&#151;where a person misrepresents or fails to disclose income or capital and the fees owed to social services for taking on receivership. For receivership cases, perhaps I may ask the Minister whether she expects one impact of the regulations to be that the NHS takes on receivership cases as, in effect, all the people involved in caring for that person will be within the NHS. That could happen.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para16"></a>I know that the Department of Health has sought to ensure that those interested in these regulations are consulted and well informed. However, I seek reassurance from the Minister that her department will require local authorities to consult with the wider community of service users and their local representative groups about the impact of these regulations. That is very important if partnership working is to be a reality. It may also be important in helping to ensure that the unintended consequences I referred to earlier do not occur.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para17"></a>Finally, I seek clarification on how &quot;local authority discretion" will work in the light of this regulation. The domiciliary charging system is wholly based on discretion. Even following the implementation of the Fairer Charging Framework, there are many areas where discretion is used on an individual basis, such as when something is accepted as a disability-related cost or whether to disregard some capital that has been earmarked for a large item.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para18"></a>In summary, while the regulations appear uncontroversial, they raise some concerns&#151;some of which I covered in my remarks&#151;on which I hope that I can be reassured. I beg to move the humble Address and I hope that it has the support of noble Lords from all sides of the House.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para19"></a>Moved, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the regulations, laid before the House on 11th March, be annulled (S.I. 2003/629).&#151;(Baroness Greengross.)

<A NAME="30429-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, in supporting the noble Baroness, I declare my interest as an employee of Age Concern England. I thank the noble Baroness for introducing this Prayer today. She has brought to the attention of the House a matter of very fundamental importance and not just in the particular terms that we shall discuss it this evening.
<P>


<a name="column_651"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 651</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para20"></a>She has hit upon a theme which has been ever-present in health policy during all the time that I have been in your Lordships' House. That theme can be expressed in one of two ways. Beneficially, it can be described as breaking down the barriers between health and social care. Conversely, it can be viewed as bringing in charging policies by stealth. That arises from the fact that health and social care are covered by two different sets of legislation and that the process to which we turn time and time again is about finding out where the barriers of those two sets of legislation collide.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para21"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, for this because of the nature of the consultation. She said that the nature of the consultation on this matter was somewhat odd: it hit the Department of Health website on 19th December and had a closing date of 31st January. To the best of my knowledge that is the only format in which the consultation was held. During that period I did not pay a great deal of attention to the matter and I am not sure how many others paid attention either. I was somewhat preoccupied with figuring out how the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Bill would work. What was the level of response? What was the nature of the response to the consultation? I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, is right. This looks like a simple administrative function but actually there is a huge underlying question as to what exactly are health-related functions.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para22"></a>I shall concentrate on a couple of areas which are unclear and on which it would be very helpful to have clarification from the Minister. One issue is disputes, a matter about which we have talked a great deal in your Lordships' House in relation to the establishment of care trusts. When someone has a dispute on this matter&#151;where a health body is discharging the charging functions of a social services department&#151;first, as the noble Baroness said, there is scope for confusion that the NHS is charging for NHS services. I agree with everything that she said about the need for clarity on that. But if a person has a dispute about the nature of a charge for a social care service, to whom do they complain? Which complaints procedure do they use? My big fear is that the answer will be that they use the NHS complaints procedure. But, frankly, the NHS complaints procedures are not set up for this. They are primarily geared towards clinical matters. They are not about financial matters. Moreover, as I have said on many occasions in your Lordships' House, NHS complaints procedures take for ever. So that is a very big concern.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para23"></a>My second question relates to the issue of legal enforcement. If a person refuses to pay, will the NHS be responsible for the legal enforcement of a social services charge? If so, will the money obtained be social services or health service money? Will the NHS end up taking people to court over a matter with which it has nothing to do, essentially, because it is a social services matter?
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para24"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, I have many doubts about confidentiality. I have no wish to rehearse the many arguments we had during the <P>


<a name="column_652"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 652</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>passage of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Bill but, for a glorious period of about 10 days, when the issue of consent was contained in a piece of legislation, we spent many happy hours talking about the principles of the confidentiality of patient information.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para25"></a>The noble Baroness is right. There is a great deal of potential for people to be resistant to passing information to the NHS, particularly to people such as nurses with whom they do not associate financial matters. Unless there is a clear explanation, I question whether the process might compromise the integrity of healthcare.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para26"></a>Let me take your Lordships back to one of my favourite documents, Delivering the NHS Plan. Noble Lords will remember that that document contains a proposal that the NHS should be free to set up joint companies with the independent sector to deliver services&#151;for example, nursing homes. If that is to be the case, will the NHS become the body setting the charges, making individual assessments and providing care? If so, what safeguards will there be for individuals? That is not clear from the information before us.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para27"></a>I do not wish to take your Lordship too far down the road of reconsidering the ombudsman's report&#151;we have discussed it at considerable length&#151;but the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, is right: there is still a great deal of confusion about what kind of social care is ancillary to health needs and it would be dangerous to put on top of that confused legislation such as this.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para28"></a>I acknowledge the excellent briefing we have received from the Alzheimer's Society, which sets out in great detail the fears that people have. They already start from a point of confusion. They have expectations that services for people who are severely demented will be regarded as healthcare, but they are not; they are regarded as social care. There is a great fear that charging for those services&#151;and the charging being carried out by the NHS&#151;will put people off.
<P>

<a name="30429-21_para29"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and the Government that there is a need to break down the barriers between social services and health and that it should be done in an up-front and transparent manner. That cause is not helped by actions that can be perceived as being at best confused and at worst an attempt to alter policy by stealth. If the Minister can assure the House that front-line staff such as nurses will not be sidelined into doing this kind of work, we will have achieved a great deal today.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-22_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, on initiating the debate and for drawing our attention to some issues of considerable interest and importance. I confess that I sat down and read these regulations and the Explanatory Note which accompanies them and felt little the wiser at the end. It is fairly impenetrable. Having listened to the noble Baroness today, I feel that I am now a good deal wiser. But it will, I am sure, be of considerable assistance to all of us to hear in the <P>


<a name="column_653"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 653</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister's own words what she regards as being the sense and purport of the regulations and the reasons why they have been introduced.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para0"></a>We are all familiar with the idea of partnerships between the NHS and local government. On the whole I believe that we regard such partnerships as a good thing. The Health Act 1999 ushered in the legal powers to enable such joint working to occur, not least in the form of pooled budgets. The regulations in front of us flow at least in part from that Act. Broadly speaking, where local authorities perform functions which affect people's health, then the Secretary of State has the power to define and influence those functions.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para1"></a>My first question to the Minister is whether collecting information about people, issuing invoices to them and making sure that they pay those invoices constitute a set of activities that can be said to have an effect on those people's health. At first sight, I am not at all convinced that they do. None of those activities is a service delivered to individuals; they are a series of administrative processes. So I question whether the wording of the Act was meant to cover the kind of function that these regulations encompasses.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para2"></a>That is my first, rather technical, observation. My second one is that for a local authority to delegate certain functions to the NHS carries with it two kinds of risk. The first kind of risk is that the barrier between local government and the health service will be bridged too easily. The second kind of risk is the opposite, which is that important issues will not get properly across the bridge but will instead fall between the cracks.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para3"></a>In the first camp lies the noble Baroness's concern about confidentiality. It is all very well to envisage local government passing some of its functions to the NHS for reasons of convenience or expediency, but what kind of say does the patient have about who can have access to the information collected? I do not know how I would feel if I were quizzed by NHS staff about how much money I had or what my house was worth. I might see the need to divulge this kind of information to a local government official in certain circumstances, but would I feel comfortable disclosing it to a nurse or to a hospital manager? I doubt it&#151;which is why I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that there need to be strict, tightly-defined procedures for dealing with this kind of process, where informed patient consent plays a central role.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para4"></a>The second camp contains most of the other points so cogently put by the noble Baronesses, Lady Greengross and Lady Barker. Breaking down the barriers between local government and the NHS should not leave any room for either ambiguity or unprofessionalism. Local government staff who have to perform the sensitive job of explaining the charging rules to service users and exercising discretion where that is required&#151;as it often is&#151;about what charges are appropriate to someone's domicilary care, are experienced and trained in those roles. If NHS staff are to be asked to take over those roles, then they have to know what they are doing. That is not meant to sound disrespectful to NHS staff, but the <P>


<a name="column_654"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 654</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fact is that none of us could perform those tasks without being suitably trained, any more than a nurse or a hospital administrator can be expected to do them. It would be most helpful to hear from the Minister how the delegation of tasks by local authorities to the NHS is to be accompanied by the necessary propagation of skills.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para5"></a>We also need clarity about where the buck stops. When local government functions are performed by local government there is no ambiguity on that score. When local government functions are delegated to another public body, where does the responsibility lie in both practical and legal terms? The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, made the point very well. If the NHS sends a bill to someone and that person does not pay, whose responsibility is it to take enforcement action? Who is the arbiter of disputes? Everyone involved in a partnership arrangement needs to be absolutely clear about where responsibilities ultimately rest, not just legally but practically.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para6"></a>I share the noble Baroness's view that we can talk positively about partnership arrangements and wish those arrangements well when they happen. But when they do happen, people have got to know what the full implications are; and that means consulting beforehand those directly affected. I hope that such consultation will be automatic in each instance, because these are not necessarily straightforward matters. It is very helpful that the Minister has an opportunity to allay the concerns that the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, has identified, for I believe that they are concerns that are shared around the whole House.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, for creating an opportunity for the House to discuss these regulations in terms of the Prayer that she has laid. I am even more grateful that she has not only advised me of some of her concerns, but also that she has said that she will not be praying against the regulations this evening. However, it is a useful opportunity that has been taken by noble Lords to explore some of the issues that are raised in the regulations, and we should be grateful for that. I will try to deal with as many of the questions that have been raised as possible. There is a consensus among noble Lords about some of those issues, and I hope that I can give fairly full answers.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para7"></a>I will start by explaining what the original legislation was intended to do. I will also start by saying something about the consultation period, because I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, was concerned about the short period of time. We did notify the local authorities and the voluntary organisations and we did actually use e-mail. So it was not quite as slow as she implied. We did not just put it on the website, we did actually invite a positive response. But she is right, the responses were low and we had only approximately 15 responses. They were from a mixture of local authorities and voluntary organisations and so on. We opted for a six-week <P>


<a name="column_655"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 655</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consultation period because two of the three amendments were uncontroversial, and I shall explain at the end of my speech why they were so uncontroversial.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para8"></a>The third option, the controversial one which we are discussing, Regulation 5, is in fact a voluntary choice, but even so, it was something that we certainly wanted to consult on. We did want responses and we received very well-informed responses from the people who replied. The original legislation was essentially designed to address the issues that were covered by the original regulations. The focus of the original partnership arrangements were set out in the NHS Bodies and Local Authority Partnerships (England) Regulations 2002. As noble Lords know, that was designed to encourage joint working between the NHS and local authorities; and it has been warmly welcomed, because to be against joint working is like being against sin. We cannot be anything other than in favour of it.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para9"></a>These regulations introduce new ways for agencies to work together to provide the best possible service for local people. Using the powers of Section 31 of the Health Act 1999, local authority and health partners can now pool different pots of money. They can make better use of resources. They can try better and more ambitious projects and essentially they can put their staff teams together under the same managers so that social workers, district nurses and care assistants can work from day to day in the same teams. I am pleased to say that since those powers were introduced we have seen a flourishing of over 200 new projects notified to the department, ranging from the very straightforward such as integrated community equipment to multi-million pound joint ventures.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para10"></a>The amendments before us are essentially designed to make some necessary changes and clarification; and I hope that that the noble Baroness will be pleased with the clarification. First, in relation to Regulation 5, which primarily concerns us, I wish to reassure noble Lords that the changes proposed are for a very specific purpose and will only be needed and used by a very small number of care trusts and large-scale NHS-led partnerships which are transferring substantial sections of their administrative arrangements from local authorities to the NHS. The proposed amendment ensures that councils can only delegate charging for the particular care services which the partnership is delivering. They are very specific and they can only do that under the conditions set out in these amendments and the forthcoming guidance, which I want to spend a little time describing.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para11"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked whether the collection of administrative tasks that he identified really do affect health. Section 31(a) to the Health Act 1999 defines health-related functions, not only in terms of the effect on health, but whether they are connected with any functions of NHS bodies. So the technical answer is yes. However, I add from a more personal point of view, that the collection of this kind of financial information can be stressful, and can have an impact on health. So in the broader context I would say yes to that, too.
<P>


<a name="column_656"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 656</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para12"></a>Let me deal with some of the concerns that have been raised. One of them is obviously that, because this involves a transfer to an NHS-led partnership, NHS staff may take over the new tasks and there may be some ensuing confusion. It is a serious issue, but it is an issue which might be raised wherever joint working takes place. As I have said, joint working has been welcomed, and is one of the things which we all agree provides an opportunity to create new approaches to the way in which we provide services. It also creates an opportunity to use new language, to develop new roles for people across services, and will deliver better services. That is what these regulations exemplify.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para13"></a>Regulation 5 simply means that if a local council decides to transfer some of its staff to the NHS to work in integrated teams in relation to care trusts or NHS-led partnerships, it can now also choose to transfer those functions and the staff who work on charging for those services alongside them. There is an element of continuity here, because those staff who have been transferred will carry on with the work that they have always done&#151;but now within the integrated team.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para14"></a>The kinds of tasks that are involved&#151;assessing an individual's ability to pay, collecting charging and monitoring how charging is working&#151;will be the things that are important to the client. It has not been possible until now to do this. It means under the current legislation that council staff are still required to make decisions about people for whom all other services are being handled by the new partnership teams. I will give noble Lords a practical example of the impact of that.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para15"></a>I believe that this brings a better service and I want to reassure the noble Baroness that under the new arrangements the charging administration is likely to involve the very same council staff, such as finance assessment teams who have transferred into the NHS under partnership arrangements. At this stage, it is unlikely that new people will be involved. Therefore, we are not assuming that there will be any change or confusion for clients.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para16"></a>However, these are evolving projects; these are evolving and developing institutions. Over time, they may come to involve new people; either new recruits for the NHS team or existing NHS staff such as care managers. That involves retraining. In fact, they might involve the finance staff. It would be up to the partnership to decide who is best placed to deliver that.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para17"></a>Let me stress the evolving nature of the role. We believe that it will allow time for adjustment, particularly for proper training. I want to pick up and reinforce everything all noble Lords said about the importance of appropriate training. We see it as extremely important, but the case which the noble Baroness cited was a good example of bad practice. I am sure it is not the kind of practice to which we would want to expose any patient in any situation.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para18"></a>In a new framework, with new languages and opportunities, it is important to recognise that staff have a changing and expanding role. They will be trained in different ways for different purposes. We are bringing together health and social care for the first <P>


<a name="column_657"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 657</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time. We have lessons to learn, but training sits at the heart of that, particularly in response to the complexity of information, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, pointed out.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para19"></a>I can assure noble Lords that there will not be a sudden shift from care responsibilities to financial responsibilities; nor will there be a sudden shift to new staff. That is where confusion could occur. As regards the training that is provided, I put it to your Lordships that few people could be better suited to providing advice on benefits or charges than those people who will have the day-to-day contact with clients, wherever they are. A person involved in arranging someone's care, properly trained, will be in a good position to put the whole picture together and give the right information.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para20"></a>Therefore, rather than undermining or changing the relationship between the NHS and clients, we see this as a way of supporting and growing close and confident relationships for the future.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para21"></a>I turn to the issue of confidentiality. As the noble Baroness said, we have addressed this many times in this House in recent months. When Age Concern, for example, responded to consultation, obviously it wanted to ensure that there would be clear arrangements about which staff should be able to collect financial information. We share that concern. But, in the first instance, all organisations operating in partnership are required to adhere to strict protocols on information sharing and confidentiality and that includes the Data Protection Act and the Caldecote principles. We will reiterate that in the guidance that we will prepare.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para22"></a>In the second instance, I would argue that in practice the fewer people who are involved in managing the process of information and the support that is given, the more likely it is that confidentiality will be protected. I completely take the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that if one knows the person involved, it is more likely that one will obtain more personal, sensitive and effective support. Therefore, all information about the person's care and financial arrangements under the new arrangements may be kept within one organisation and team instead of continually trafficking between the NHS and the local authority.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para23"></a>Under these regulations, care managers, who know the service users well, will be able to undertake those sensitive financial assessments while they are arranging their care package. It means fewer people being involved and fewer visits being made. But, again, it is imperative that those working in the field and the service users are clear about the changes involved and what they must do to communicate their impact.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para24"></a>That is why we have put the requirement for information to be provided into regulations rather than into guidance. Regulations 6 and 7 cover that point. It means that partnerships must explain to service users which services they are being offered, which elements of a care package are the responsibility of the NHS, which are the responsibility of the local authority and what the charges are for. Those regulations will be backed up by <P>


<a name="column_658"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 658</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guidance. I want to emphasise that we will be consulting with all interested parties on that guidance. The regulations and the guidance will therefore deal with the other major concerns which were raised in conversation and which were referred to by noble Lords today.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para25"></a>However, the amendments have the potential to cause confusion for service users; that somehow NHS services free at the point of use and local authorities will be conflated and that NHS services might incur a charge.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para26"></a>Let me be absolutely clear about this: the legislation in no way alters or compromises the overriding principle that NHS services are free at the point of use. There are no loopholes that will enable charging to creep into NHS services. The amendment is focused on the local authority functions that have already been delegated. The only services that can be charged for are the social care services that carry charges at the moment such as home care or residential charges. The partnership could not decide to move outside the framework already set by the council. Those changes do not represent in any sense a take-over of local government powers by the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para27"></a>Two other points have been raised. Locally accountable councils remain firmly responsible in law for charging policy, determining which services incur a charge, what they should be and the eligibility criteria for a service. Nothing changes that overriding principle or shifts that responsibility. I hope that answers the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I can also reassure noble Lords that these amendments do not enable the delegation of the legal enforcement of payment. I hope I can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, on that point. That must remain with the council.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para28"></a>I now deal with a specific point which goes to the heart of some of the issues. When Age Concern responded to consultation it raised the prospect of a service user receiving a bill for care on NHS headed paper. It expressed fears that it had the potential to cause confusion and upset. We do not want that. Our response is that the key to avoiding service user confusion is a very clear information policy which sets out which services are being offered, which organisation is legally responsible for which services and which charges apply to the local authority services within the package. We agree that branding issues are very important. That is what people see and make a judgment on that basis. We will specifically mention this in guidance as something which partners should consider carefully.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para29"></a>The guidance will reflect and reiterate many of the issues that we have talked about today. It will emphasise the importance of appropriate training for all staff involved in charging administration. Councils will be required to ensure that any NHS-based team taking on charging administration and a delegated authority includes people with appropriate financial expertise. It will emphasise that partnerships must explain clearly to service users exactly what service is being received, where the responsibility falls and so <P>


<a name="column_659"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 659</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>forth, and what charges, if any, they may expect to receive for the social care element of their package, as already set out in Regulations 6 and 7.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para30"></a>The guidance will also require councils to ensure that they can monitor the effectiveness of charging policy across the whole of the local authority. I reiterate that we shall be consulting with interested parties on all these matters and what the guidance will contain. We shall be listening carefully to what people tell us.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para31"></a>I now take up a few of the specific questions raised by the noble Baroness. Liable relatives will not be included because that function is not delegable. I reassure the noble Baroness about that. The question of receivership will not be delegable. That is outside the scope of the provisions. Where there is an element of discretion about individual cases, it can be applied under the amendment, but only within the parameters set by the councils themselves. How to handle some of the issues that involve elements of discretion will be a matter for negotiation between the council and the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para32"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked me whether the regulations applied to supporting people on home care. The short answer is no. It is rather a technical judgment so I shall write to the noble Baroness to give her the background to the issue.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para33"></a>Perhaps I may say very briefly why we have introduced these regulations and what has inspired them. I shall be frank with the House. They are necessary because they correct a legislative error that has led to some inconsistency. It is already legally possible for councils to delegate charging functions to the NHS where these relate to home care services and non-residential services. That was an unintended consequence of the Care Standards Act 2000, which redesignated charging for home care services as a social service function and therefore made it delegable under Section 31. Our changes close that loophole and ensure that charging for home care services is treated now in the same way as any other service delegated under the principal Act. So home care and residential services will be brought into line now. But there is the positive change that I have been arguing tonight. It means that if you delegate the service, you can delegate the charging that relates to it. Local authorities who responded to our public consultation on the amendment supported that change. One care trust, Northumberland, was very proactive in initiating the change. Northumberland argued that it needed the amendment as it would give it increased flexibility with regard to how it arranged its services with NHS partners and in considering how they could best be provided. That case study says much that is rather hard to explain in a more abstract way. Northumberland explained that without the amendment it would face some serious practical difficulties.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para34"></a>Early last year there were some changes to social security benefits which meant that a group of older care home residents suddenly needed to submit claims for the first time. One of the council's care managers had previously worked as a financial assessment officer. Therefore, she both knew the residents and understood the financial issues. She was able to deal with the financial forms as part of her care management review of resident care plans. But if a similar issue had arisen <P>


<a name="column_660"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 660</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>once the care management team had transferred to the NHS, under the current legislation the only option would have been to send an administrative officer from the council as members of the care team would have been barred from being sent. However sympathetic that person might have been, he or she would not have known the residents and would have been less able to calm anxieties or to address other questions.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para35"></a>The regulations seek to make the most of joint working and to provide better services. Essentially they seek to organise services around the client. They are benign measures. I believe that they are the best of measures. They offer choice. It is a voluntary scheme. The regulations do not prescribe the way things should be done. They offer absolutely no compromise to the principle of the NHS being free to users. They introduce no new charges. They strengthen integration. The changes have been driven by practitioners.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para36"></a>If the amended regulations had been opposed&#151;I am pleased that the noble Baroness has stated that she will not oppose them&#151;it would not have meant the end of partnership working but it would have prevented Northumberland and other partners like them from operating in the future as they would want.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para37"></a>I refer to two other aspects of the regulations. I remind noble Lords that if they oppose the regulations they will prevent the Isles of Scilly from operating partnership arrangements. I am sure that we would not want to do that. We would also hold up the consultation on care trusts which is hardly controversial consultation.
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para38"></a>I must confess that we have discovered a typing error in the regulations. Our solicitor's advice is that it does not in any way affect the way in which the regulations will operate in law. However, we have noted the error and we shall correct it at the earliest opportunity. In Regulation 5(2)(k) reference is made to Section 23(2) of the National Assistance Act 1948. That reference should be to Section 23(3).
<P>

<a name="30429-22_para39"></a>I hope that having heard the explanation of what the regulations are intended to achieve, they are acceptable to your Lordships. I hope that your Lordships consider that they are a positive step to increasing local flexibility in joint working. I am grateful to noble Lords who have spoken.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para4"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;( ) the promotion of broadband competition in the United Kingdom at all levels of the market"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-23_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak first to grouped Amendments Nos. 315 and 316&#151;which are straightforward and offer alternative and measurable definitions of what broadband actually is, which is hugely important.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, is only too aware of the issues that concern me&#151;if only from the Written Questions from me that he has had to field. In November 2001, I asked the Government what data transfer feeds they used to determine whether an Internet connection can be defined as broadband. The noble Lord replied that they had
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"offered an initial definition of broadband as always-on, unmetered Internet services with a downstream (from supplier to home or business user) speed of more than 384 kbit/s".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para7"></a>
Fair enough. I am sure that your Lordships will have grasped why I tabled an amendment that articulates a definition of broadband that is consistent with this. Unfortunately, the waters get murkier. In November 2002, the noble Lord offered me these words of wisdom, observing that
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the speed of broadband connections, which at 512 kbps is 10 times faster than a standard dial-up modem".&#151;[Official Report, 4/11/02; col. WA 77.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para8"></a><P>

<a name="30429-23_para9"></a>I received that reply with some delight. For all sorts of reasons, that is my personal preference as a definition of broadband. Not unreasonably, I returned to the issue in March and April to see whether the initial definition elaborated upon last November had solidified into something more robust and definitive. The noble Lord's reply stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government view broadband as a generic term describing a range of technologies operating at various data transfer speeds".&#151;[Official Report, 11/3/03; col. WA 179.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para10"></a>
Does it matter? It does, for a number of reasons. As Simon Goodley, writing in the Daily Telegraph put it:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If you were being particularly pedantic . . .  the DTI's new definition could technically include ISDN services (which have been round for a decade) and might even extend to a carrier pigeon holding a floppy disk in its beak,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para11"></a>
In effect, connections at less than 384 kbps&#151;which most industry observers would define as either midband or narrowband&#151;are included in the figures to assess the take-up of broadband, thereby seriously inflating the true position. It has been estimated that if all 128 kbps or less cable modem connections were stripped out of the data currently published by Oftel, <P>


<a name="column_662"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 662</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the realistic number of &quot;true" broadband connections in the UK would drop from 1.4 million to&#151;from memory&#151;something a little over 700,000. Viewed from that perspective, BT's digital subscriber line market share rises to something like 65 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para12"></a>I understand some of the motivation behind Oftel and the Government adopting the definitional approach that they do&#151;not least, international benchmarking. Nevertheless, I make no apology for my conviction that it does little to establish the healthy and vibrant competitive market across the whole sector that the Government maintain that they want.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para13"></a>Viewed from a technical standpoint, data transfer speed, and thereby an appropriate and accurate definition of broadband, is crucial. What matters is that the real benefits of Internet communication are constrained by the speed of data transfer. Simon Goodley from the Daily Telegraph again states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"what cut-down services don't do very effectively is precisely what the Government said it wanted mass broadband for. Mid-band does not put us at 'the centre of the information economy', the place where the DTI constantly reminds us we need to be. It is also not much use for services such as video streaming, which may primarily be an entertainment source but also has commercial and educational applications. Whether you think any of this is beneficial, it is what the Government wanted broadband to do".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para14"></a><P>

<a name="30429-23_para15"></a>The point was vividly brought home to me in America&#151;I duly apologise to the Minister&#151;by news coverage of the war in Iraq. Because I was in the United States, I do not know to what extent the UK media chose to use the technology of videophones and so on to get the news to us. However, in America, grainy and fuzzy images of the star reporters of each network were broadcast pretty much every hour of the day. No matter that the images froze all the time, or cut the reporter off mid-sentence; from the networks' point of view, it was news in the raw, delivered live, up-front and as it happened. My guess would be that had the reporters been able to file, or rather broadcast, their stories at faster data transfer speeds, the quality on TV screens would have been much closer to the standard that we have come to expect.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para16"></a>I should say, too, that the Prime Minister has got himself involved in the issue. Members of the Committee will no doubt recall his statement on his return from the European Council meeting in Barcelona of March last year. He stated the Government's commitment, as an endorsement of a pan-European policy objective&#151;the Minister referred to that on the previous amendment&#151;to deliver broadband technology that will allow,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"internet access at 10 times the present speed",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para17"></a>
by 2005.
By any measure, and as confirmed by the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, in March this year, that implies,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"products in the 500&#150;600 kbps range".&#151;[Official Report, 31/3/03; cols. WA 98&#150;99.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para18"></a>
I am sure that Members of the Committee now see why I favour the 512 kbps measure.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para19"></a>It is also worth noting the recent judgment of the Advertising Standards Authority against NTL. Members of the Committee will, I am sure, be aware of the case where a complaint against NTL was upheld because it had advertised its 128 kbps Internet access service as a &quot;high speed broadband product". In the <P>


<a name="column_663"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 663</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sense that NTL had been complying with Oftel's definition, there should have been no complaint. However, as a spokeswoman for the ASA put it:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If you just call it 'high-speed broadband' then consumers will take this to mean a service of at least 500 kbit/sec".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para20"></a>
The perception and confidence of consumers is crucial. I cannot help feeling that if Oftel, the ASA and indeed the Government are confused about what properly constitutes broadband products, sure as eggs are eggs, consumers will be, too.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para21"></a>Finally, in so far as it could be portrayed as such, any slippage in the Government's definition can be interpreted as a watering-down of their commitment to broadband. That in turn calls into question targets such as establishing the UK as the most competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2007. All that explains why it is so important that a credible, clear-cut and agreed definition of broadband should be in general circulation. Amendments Nos. 315 and 316 set out alternative means for achieving that.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para22"></a>I apologise for spending quite so much time on those subsidiary amendments, but Members of the Committee will have grasped that much of what I have already said informs the purpose and intention of the lead amendment. Happily, I can therefore curtail some of the remarks that I might have wished to make. None the less, I should at least put a little more flesh on its bones.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para23"></a>I do not think that any of us would disavow the benefits that broadband can bring. That case is already well made. We all would acknowledge that take-up in the early stages of broadband development in the UK was extremely disappointing. No matter; that much is history. However, in reaching conclusions about how to take things forward and deciding the shape and direction of broadband development over the next 10 years or so, we must be absolutely certain of exactly where we are now. For example, email traffic is at its highest level ever, with some communications service providers in the UK handling more than 16 million emails across each of their networks every day. In terms of infrastructure, it is a simple fact that outside cable franchise areas, BT has a virtual monopoly on broadband products.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para24"></a>Whatever its virtue, very few telecommunications companies have entered the local loop unbundling market. Indeed, the regulator, David Edmonds, despite his high hopes for mass industry take-up, described it as a &quot;niche market" in his evidence to the Trade and Industry Select Committee on 4th February of this year. That is the reality of where we are now.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para25"></a>It is crucial that Ofcom, as the front-line regulator of this area, should have the means at its disposal proactively to promote and encourage the benefits that broadband can bring and, more importantly, to ensure that there is an effective competitive market across the breadth of the sector. Anything less runs a serious risk that consumers will be short-changed in the future to an even greater extent than they are being at the moment. Hence the amendment.

<a name="30429-23_para26"></a>I am only too well aware of the defence that Ministers in another place have mounted against the thrust of my intention. It is neatly encapsulated in a comment from Dr Kim Howells, who said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no specific mention of broadband because the Bill is technologically neutral. We are committed to the roll-out of broadband across the United Kingdom, but we do not feel that it requires a specific mention in the Bill. The Bill is designed to put in place a framework that can respond flexibly to developments in technology, but it is not about one technology rather than another".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, Standing Committee E, 10/12/02; col. 29.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para27"></a>
I am sorry, but that completely baffles me. It is akin to the Government arguing that in the context of, for example, transportation, they have no wish to promote the technology of air travel because to do so might give it an edge over rail and road. That is ludicrous. If I am permitted to use this phrase, the beans were comprehensively spilled in a reply that I have already quoted from the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government view broadband as a generic term describing a range of technologies operating at various data transfer speeds".&#151;[Official Report, 11/3/03; col. WA 179.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-23_para28"></a>
In other words, the Government do not perceive broadband to be a specific technology that can be put ahead of any other. As the noble Lord said (as it happened, correctly) it is a &quot;range of technologies"&#151;DSL, cable, wireless, satellite and so on&#151;all of which compete with each other, or attempt to do so, in the marketplace. What, therefore, is the Government's beef about putting such a technologically neutral&#151;and, I should argue, eminently reasonable and desirable&#151;concept and objective in the Bill?
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para29"></a>For all sorts of reasons, and whatever the statistics may say, the UK is still not realising the full potential of its broadband opportunities. As things stand, there is a very real lack of competition in the sector, which is limiting customer choice on prices, service packages and service quality. However, by the same token, there is a real chance in this regard to produce legislation that not only addresses the problems, but looks and thinks forwards.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para30"></a>Should the Government choose not to agree to the amendment&#151;I do not have many hopes for it&#151;there is a significant risk that the chance will be lost for the foreseeable future. It may be worse&#151;I sincerely do not believe that I am exaggerating&#151;because it could put the regulatory clock back by perhaps as much as 20 years to a much more monopolistic era. The choice really is that stark. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   I rise briefly in broad agreement with the thrust of the noble Earl's latter two amendments, but I want to I suggest a minor change to Amendment No. 13.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para31"></a>Towards the end of his speech, the noble Earl said that it should be Ofcom's duty to promote the take-up of broadband and to encourage competition. If only the first point as well as the second were inserted in the Bill, I should be happy. However, there is a grave danger of us overemphasising the potential of competition in this regard. In most of Britain, the great <P>


<a name="column_665"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 665</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problem is not competition but the total lack of anyone willing to provide a service. As the noble Earl will recall, the broadband stakeholder group produced last autumn a report which divided Britain into four categories: category one, plenty of competition; category two, only one provider but satisfactory service; category three, subsidies required; and category four, political solutions required&#151;which sounds like very big subsidies.
<P>

<a name="30429-23_para32"></a>In the light of that, to make it an obligation on Ofcom simply to go for competition could close off another option: to allow monopolies in large urban areas in exchange for a universal service provider to extend the service into rural areas which otherwise will not get it. At present, there is a bit of a fiddle whereby the Government one way or another through regional development agencies, or whatever, will be expected to foot the bill for Ofcom rather than the telecoms providers. I hope, therefore, that when the noble Earl returns to the matter on Report he will modify the amendment which otherwise would carry widespread support.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   As the noble Lord implies, there is a trade-off between competition and take-up. We see that exemplified in figures which have been issued by the European Competitive Telecommunications Association. They demonstrate that in Germany there has been a high take-up. That is at the expense of monopolistic conditions because Deutsche Telekom has the total share of 100 per cent of the market. According to those figures, in Britain only a 51 per cent share of the market is held by BT. That is the lowest share of a major provider of any of the countries in Europe, apart from Germany which I have already mentioned. In France, it is 71 per cent; in Italy, 73 per cent; and in Spain, 77 per cent. According to those figures, the UK is about the most competitive country in Europe.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para0"></a>Before I come to the question of competition, perhaps I may disrupt the harmony that has pervaded the amendment of the noble Earl. I hope that the Government will not accept the writing into the Bill of a definition of broadband. It is a rapidly moving technology. If we write such a figure into the Bill, it may shortly be out of date. One can see that when considering the report of Oftel published yesterday on the review of the wholesale broadband access market. Among other things, it reviews the previous definition of broadband. For the time being, the working definition is, first, that broadband provides higher speeds in excess of 256K downstream capacity; secondly, that it is an always-on service, or at least has the ability to establish rapidly a connection to the Internet; thirdly, it allows the use of the exchange lines for voice telephony and Internet access at the same time; and, fourthly, it allows content delivery which is not practical on narrowband Internet access such as realtime video content.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para1"></a>The noble Lord may say that 256K is inadequate for some of the services that people demand. In particular, it is inadequate for video on demand. But the consumer is offered the choice. One can have a lower quality, 256K service, and one pays less for it; or one can have a <P>


<a name="column_666"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 666</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>512K service and pay more for it. The market is sufficiently broad to allow for that customer choice to be exercised and for people to pick the service that suits their pocket and requirement. Some people may be perfectly happy to access news services on the Internet and to use it for sending and receiving e-mails in which case a 256K service is perfectly adequate for their requirements. Others may want something more sophisticated or to play games on the Internet, for example, and will want a high speed service. It is right that there should be that element of choice and as the services which are offered start at 256K, that is a useful working definition that Oftel should use, but it is not one that I feel would be appropriate to write into the Bill. In a year's time, or certainly within the lifetime of the Bill, things will be enormously different. If one considers the life span of any telecommunications Bill, we would expect it still to be working after 15 years. To put in a speed such as 384K would look quaint and old-fashioned by the end of that period.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para2"></a>The noble Lord's amendment provides a useful opportunity for discussing the state of the broadband market, and usefully coincided with the report which I have just mentioned by Oftel on the subject. The Oftel report reviews the latest developments, which show very healthy rates of growth in broadband take-up with the number of subscribers reaching 1.15 million in February this year. It shows also that BT has been gaining market share since the beginning of 2001, as the noble Lord points out. It now has 57 per cent of the market compared with 28 per cent for NTL and 24 per cent for Telewest. However, perhaps even more striking is that BT is winning something like 70 to 80 per cent of the new subscribers. That arises from the last price drops which BT offered the public in 2002 amounting to as much as 50 per cent. Those prices are due to be reduced again on 1st May from &pound;14.75 wholesale to &pound;13.00 per end user per month, with further discounts for volume which will enable BT Openworld to buy IPStream services at &pound;12.74.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para3"></a>I declare an interest as a user of BT Openworld and I look forward to the further reductions in price which no doubt I shall be offered after 1st May as it gets the benefit of these lower wholesale prices. But during the same period there has been no equivalent reduction in Datastream charges, which cover the traffic from the exchange to the subscriber for the operator who wants to provide services over his own network. That is to say, this operator is providing services from the exchange backwards and not to the consumer from the exchange. Those users continue to pay &pound;9.25 per end user per month. They say that in effect that difference is not enough to cover the cost of their network.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para4"></a>One such operator, Tiscali, complained formally to Oftel and pointed out that although BT had agreed to align the terms for IPStream and Datastream by the end of March this year, product enhancements that are available on the first are not available on the second and that there is a three-month minimum sign-up commitment on the first compared with 12 months on the second. There are other complaints such as the migration path between IPStream and Datastream, which BT says it can provide only after September <P>


<a name="column_667"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 667</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>2003 at a cost of &pound;30, whereas Tiscali says it could be offered now and that an appropriate price would be &pound;5.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para5"></a>These competitive issues in the provision of broadband services are causing enormous arguments between the companies in the industry. However, the Bill allows for those matters to be considered by Ofcom and I hope it will take a robust attitude to the development of competition in the industry. We want all those services to be provided at a cost that users can afford.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para6"></a>It is not for the Committee, however great the technical knowledge of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, to dictate to Oftel or Ofcom how it will exercise the powers that will be given to it. All we can say is that we want a fully competitive market. We do not believe that it exists at the moment because there is a significant market power in the hands of one company. However, we believe that the powers that are given to Ofcom in the Bill will enable it to solve the problems of the kind I have outlined. I should sooner leave the Bill as it stands and rely upon the forces of Ofcom to deal with the problems of market penetration and competition that we know exist.

<A NAME="30429-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I rise to support my noble friend's amendments. It is necessary to stress the significance of broadband technology to our economy. It is becoming increasingly important for future growth and development. Government targets are not being met: they have failed to provide a competitive structure within which this technology can grow and flourish. An ascertainable funding framework needs to be achieved; promotion alone&#151;words alone&#151;are insufficient.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para7"></a>I take note of the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, in relation to the need also to prioritise uptake. I can do no better than to use the words of my noble friend in another place, John Whittingdale, the shadow Secretary of State, who said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>XA balance must be struck between promoting competition in the short term and encouraging investment in the short term and encouraging investment in the infrastructure in the longer term. In all such debates, the vital importance of increasing access to broadband must be a priority and Britain is lagging far behind in this respect. Although the number of households with broadband access has now passed l million, we are still way behind our competitors".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 3/12/02; col. 796.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-24_para8"></a>
I entirely support my noble friend's amendment, but perhaps thought might be given to including the word &quot;uptake", or some such wording, in a revised amendment. I shall be interested to hear what the Government have to say in this regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   I have a brief contribution to make in this context in relation to Wales, because I believe that it is somewhat typical of rural areas in the rest of the United Kingdom. It is calculated that about 40 per cent of homes and businesses in Wales can have broadband through ADSL technology and cable modems. This compares with a UK average of about <P>


<a name="column_668"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 668</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>70 per cent. Recognising the urgency of addressing this gap, the Welsh Assembly government have launched the Broadband Wales programme, which will spend about &pound;115 million on a balanced programme of demand-side and supply-side measures to stimulate making broadband ubiquitous throughout Wales.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para9"></a>That level of public-sector support makes the broadband scene in Wales very different from that in other parts of the UK. It will obviously be important to ensure that Ofcom takes account of the situation. I am told that wireless systems have an important part to play in the roll-out of broadband in Wales&#151;and, I am sure, elsewhere&#151;which means that the licensing arrangements for suitable radio spectrum are also critical. I am told that the recent 3.4GHz spectrum licensing decision to split Wales into four parts, each linked with larger and more prosperous parts of England, was taken very much against advice in Wales. Again, that demonstrates the importance of making strong representations on behalf of Wales in future licensing rounds.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para10"></a>I say all this because not only is it relevant to my noble friend's amendment, but also because it is relevant to other later amendments that relate to the setting up of an Ofcom office in Wales, and its consequentials.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   There are two quite different issues involved here. The first is the issue of government support for broadband, and the progress that is being made in the development of broadband in this country. The second issue is whether in support of that government objective it is either necessary or desirable to have in the Bill a reference to broadband of the kind proposed in these amendments.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para11"></a>I have not heard it denied that the Government have given very active support to broadband in this country. We have a target of achieving the most competitive and extensive broadband market in the G7 by 2005. By no means are we there yet. Last August we were assessed as being fourth for competitiveness and fifth for extensiveness. But we are pulling away from those behind us and catching up with those ahead. In particular, we are more competitive than our European neighbours, although less competitive than, for example, Canada or Japan.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para12"></a>Coverage and take-up of broadband are both increasing. The latest figures show that the number of broadband users now stands at over 1.75 million, and is increasing by 35,000 a week. In case the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, thinks that that is a phoney figure, only 20 per cent of those 1.75 million users are at a lower figure than 500K. So use is running at the least at 1.4 million within his definition, and certainly nothing like the 700,000 that he suggested.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para13"></a>Some 71 per cent of the population now has access to mass market broadband services. I acknowledge that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, is right to point out that the percentage is far lower in Wales. That problem is being addressed by the Welsh Assembly.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para14"></a>Turning to the technologies, it is true that there are a number of different systems. Probably the most common is ADSL, but I have to say that it is an <P>


<a name="column_669"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 669</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intermediate technology. ADSL still uses coaxial copper cable. Within the expected lifetime of this Bill, I cannot imagine that ADSL will still be around. We have cable and fibre-optics, as well as fixed wireless access such as that provided by Firstnet. Furthermore, we have satellite provision, which is universal but, of course, more expensive. A bundle of different systems are all being called broadband.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para15"></a>That leads me to my second point. It would be inappropriate to seek to define broadband as being one of the specific and particular objectives of Ofcom in the Bill. The technology is currently varied and continues to change all the time. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, pointed out, during the lifetime of the Bill, figures of 384K or 512K will be laughable. We will be talking about different technologies and totally different speeds.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para16"></a>We have a perfectly good provision in Clause 3(3)(a), which sets out that Ofcom must have regard to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xthe desirability of promoting competition in relevant markets".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-24_para17"></a>
It is inconceivable that the broadband market will not be considered by Ofcom to be relevant. If necessary, I am sure that I could secure a statement from the proto Ofcom to that effect.
<P>

<a name="30429-24_para18"></a>The motivation behind the amendments is admirable and we all agree with it, but this is not a technology that should be specified on the face of the Bill any more than should the other technologies. I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, will feel that, although I have to resist the amendments, this is not what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, would call a &quot;no".

<P>
<A NAME="30429-25_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. Like my noble friend Lady Buscombe, I hear precisely what the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, has said. As he correctly anticipated, I shall take full account of the wisdom of his remarks in deciding how to return to this issue on Report. He also made the sensible point that to promote broadband in all cases is the wrong approach. I understand that point. I am merely grateful for his tentative support for the broad thrust of my intention.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para0"></a>I am bound to say to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that I am not wedded in any way to my definitional amendments. It is important that the Government's stance is properly understood and is as clear as possible. In my introductory remarks I sought to show that there was a degree of confusion about the matter. If the Government are confused, so must be the rest of us. However, my real concern is not the definitional amendments, which were a hook upon which to hang that element of the debate; it is the lead amendment. The definitional amendments were merely cosmetic embellishments for the purposes of debate.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para1"></a>I also say to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and the Minister that my judgment is that broadband is integral to the viability and usefulness of the new technology&#151;perhaps I am getting to the heart of a potential flaw in the amendment, because by <P>


<a name="column_670"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 670</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>broadband I mean increased and increasing data transfer speed. Subject to the caveat of the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, it is beyond question that a competitive market in broadband is needed, or, if the Committee prefers, a competitive market to provide the public with increasing and increased data transfer speed. The Minister agrees. My judgment is that increased and increasing data transfer speed&#151;not necessarily the term &quot;broadband"&#151;is so important in its own right, particularly on the back of the progress or the lack of it so far, that it is justifiable that Ofcom should focus on it.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para2"></a>The Minister will be assured from my remarks that I will return to the matter on Report. I will take on board some of the observations, particularly the folly&#151;maybe&#151;of focusing on including the term &quot;broadband" in the Bill. I think that I can address that problem. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;(g) the maintenance of a vibrant independent production sector"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-25_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 14 and in so doing shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 42, 196, 199, 272 and 273, all of which deal with the nourishing and building of the independent production sector. In brief, Amendment No. 14 requires Ofcom to oversee the continued vibrancy of the independent sector; Amendment No. 42 creates a register of original programme ideas to help independent producers to protect their work, and Amendments Nos. 196, 199, 272 and 273 strengthen the existing independent quota system.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para6"></a>I declare an interest: I have been an independent producer in one form or another for almost the past 15 years, with the exception of a brief period as a broadcaster at Carlton Television. Like the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, I shall not repeat my declaration of interest in future Committee debates.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para7"></a>The independent production sector is the creative community that exists outside the ownership of broadcasters. They come up with ideas for programmes. At Second Reading, I said I believed we had some of the finest television programmes in the world and that if they were not the envy of the world they certainly should be. I put forward two reasons why our creative community is so strong. The first was a system of regulation surrounding public service broadcasting, and the second was the independent production sector, which was established with the birth of Channel 4.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para8"></a>For Committee Members unfamiliar with television production, let me explain how programmes are commissioned. There are three sources of programmes and programme ideas. The first is the broadcaster, which generally, with the exception of Channel 4, has a team of creators who come up with ideas for <P>


<a name="column_671"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 671</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>programmes that they then make themselves. The second is the independent production community, which competes for the 25 per cent of hours that broadcast networks must commission out. The third is by acquisition of programmes from foreign broadcasters&#151;in effect, that means America. The temptation of broadcasters is always to cut costs. Generally, the losers are the programme makers and, ultimately, the audience.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para9"></a>The independent sector is an important safeguard to the creative success of the UK. An exhaustive survey of 50 of the most popular new series, introduced between 1992 and 1998, found that nearly 40 per cent of the new formats had come from independent producers. There are dramas, such as &quot;Spooks", &quot;Clocking Off" and &quot;Shackleton"; prime-time documentaries, such as &quot;The Fall of Yugoslavia", &quot;Faking It" and &quot;Jamie's Kitchen"; hugely successful children's programmes, such as &quot;Teletubbies"; shows that have pushed the boundaries of taste, such as &quot;Big Brother" and &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"; history programmes, such as &quot;The Great Plague" and &quot;1900 House"; and documentaries, such as &quot;Congo", and so on and so forth. This is the tip of a vast creative pool of world-class talent.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para10"></a>The international Emmy awards are the Oscars of the television world. UK independent producers have won over half of all Emmies awarded between 1990 and 2001. That is 38 awards out of a possible 71. Last year, independents also took over 60 per cent of the BAFTA programme awards.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para11"></a>Amendment No. 14 seeks to ensure on the face of the Bill an obligation by Ofcom to oversee that continued vibrancy of the independent production sector. It would be a great injustice to the creative community not to put a safeguard in this legislation to help them ensure that their regulator takes due account of their interests. It is easy in legislation of this size to ignore the people at the bottom of the food chain. I hope that my noble friend will at least feel able to accept this particular amendment.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para12"></a>Amendment No. 42 deals with the establishment of a register of original programming ideas. The ownership, creation, acquisition, sale and licensing of television rights are as important to the television industry as stocks and shares are to the stock market. However, to date, licensing and acquiring of rights has required not only strong industry knowledge but the deductive reasoning of Miss Marple. Other industries have been a lot more pragmatic in dealing with their rights. There are public registers for almost everything&#151;property, patents, pharmaceuticals and even Internet domain names.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para13"></a>The time has come for the television industry to establish a public register of its own that will support copyright legislation and copyright protection agencies. It could remove some of the risks of costly litigation and remove the lame excuses that it is too costly to locate rights holders. Generally, these arguments will be made by the broadcasters who want to drive down loyalty fees and take ownership of as many assets as they can from a very privileged position of power.

<P>

<a name="30429-25_para14"></a>I have talked about the value of the independent production sector and the importance of safeguarding its creative work. At Second Reading I talked about the increasing trend of ideas being borrowed&#151;euphemistically&#151;by broadcasters. I likened it to the plight faced by engineers in the Victorian era who spent huge amounts of money and time developing solutions only to find the bigger companies stealing them. I talked about the incentive to create disappearing and the subsequent establishment of the Patent Office. I believe that we are witnessing the beginning of the creative incentive in this country disappearing in the television markets.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para15"></a>Why should I, as a producer, invest in developing ideas for television if, when I present them to a broadcaster, with some minor changes he can adopt the idea and produce it himself? There is no incentive to walk into a broadcaster and show them one's ideas. I am proposing a simple system as a first stage so that individuals and small companies can register their ideas and help protect them against theft. This is a first step. It is not a big step, but a first step. A television rights register makes a great deal of sense for this industry. I hope that my noble friend on the Front Bench sees this as a constructive way forward edging the broadcasters towards a higher standard. This should be seen very much as the carrot. If it does not work, I am sure that we can find a stick.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para16"></a>I turn now to Amendments Nos. 196, 199, 272 and 273 which deal with the independent production quota. As the law currently stands, there is a requirement by broadcasters&#151;namely, the BBC and ITV&#151;to commission out 25 per cent of the hours that they broadcast to independent producers. The quota originated in 1986 as a result of the Peacock report. It was first voluntary and then made statutory in the Broadcasting Act 1990. Parliament always intended this to be a minimum threshold and not a ceiling on independent productions.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para17"></a>Three things have happened as a result of the quota. The first is a truly remarkable creative community which has helped to maintain Britain at the forefront of programme making. Secondly, broadcasters have seen the 25 per cent as a ceiling and not as a floor. This particularly applies to the BBC which, for the second year running, has failed to meet its independent production quota. Thirdly, broadcasters have tried to commission out the hours that are the most difficult to make and that are at the cheaper end of the scale.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para18"></a>The Government were so concerned about safeguarding the independent production centre&#151;for good, economic, commercial and competitive reasons&#151;that they commissioned a programme supply review, undertaken by the ITC. I should like to thank my noble friend Lord Puttnam, who is in his place, for inspiring that report; Bob Phillis and the rest of the ITC's expert panel&#151;Anne Bulford, with whom I worked at Carlton, Richard Eyre, Professor Bill Robinson and Sir Howard Stringer&#151;as well as Robin Foster and his team at the ITC.

<a name="30429-25_para19"></a>The report suggested a number of actions falling into four areas: first, measures to strengthen the longer-term viability of the sector&#151;it is also recommended that Ofcom should monitor the application of the quota and impose fines and sanctions if it was not met&#151;secondly, further safeguards in the Bill to guarantee a continuing high level of UK investment in original programming; thirdly, support for productions in the regions and nations; and fourthly, strengthening the commitment to training.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para20"></a>I am grateful to the Government for following many of those recommendations but I should like them to go one step further. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State, when giving permission for BBC 3 to move forward, amended the quota system so that it would not only have to commission out 25 per cent of its hours but would also have to ensure that 25 per cent of its programming budget was spent with independents.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para21"></a>Amendments Nos. 196, 199, 272 and 273 reflect this change broadly across all broadcasters. It will mean that broadcasters, in addition to commissioning out 25 per cent by hours, will have to ensure that 25 per cent of their programme budget is spent with independents. That will prevent the broadcasters abusing the quota system and result in a further expansion of the independent sector.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para22"></a>I know that my noble friend the Minister has some reservations about extending the quota budget but her right honourable friend the Secretary of State has set the precedent for good reasons. This will be an opportunity, at least in the short term, to extend that principle.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para23"></a>The quota system is a complicated and technical configuration but it does work. My amendments will improve it and further protect programme makers in this country. The Government and the broadcasters have nothing to fear from this group of amendments.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para24"></a>Grouped with my amendments are Amendments Nos. 197 and 198 standing in the name of the noble Baronesses, Lady Buscombe and Lady Wilcox. I have read their amendments carefully. I understand in principle what they seek to do&#151;that is, to inject additional capital into the independent production market. But perhaps they will look at their amendments again because I suspect that they may allow broadcasters such as Granada and Carlton to set up production entities and attack the independent production quota via the back door. I know that that is not their intention. The additional investment of capital would be much welcomed.
<P>

<a name="30429-25_para25"></a>I apologise for taking up so much of the Committee's time but this group of amendments is the only group to deal with independent television production. It is such an important area that I felt it necessary to explain the reasons behind each amendment. They are not so-called probing amendments. I genuinely believe that they should be on the face of the Bill and I want these changes to be made. I believe that they will be in the best interests of <P>

<P>
<A NAME="30429-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I support Amendments Nos. 14, 42, 196, 272 and 273. I have added my name to Amendments Nos. 14, 42 and 196. It was remiss of me not to have added it to Amendments Nos. 272 and 273.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para0"></a>We entirely support the amendments, which in turn support the independent sector. We believe that the amendments would lead to more independent production, which therefore would promote greater competition and greater transparency of the programme production market. They provide for the greatest push in programme exports and they would encourage entrepreneurs like the noble Lord, Lord Alli, to enter the television market. That has to be a good thing.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para1"></a>I move quickly on to Amendments Nos. 197 and 198, in my name, and note straight away what the noble Lord, Lord Alli, has said. The amendments are intended to introduce a definition of independence which would allow companies which gained no economic advantage from an ownership relationship with another broadcaster to produce programmes that qualify for the quota. At present, production companies that have an ownership relationship with a broadcaster&#151;that is, they share the same parent, but have no preferential commissioning relationship with that broadcaster&#151;are deemed to be non-qualifying independents&#151;although to all intents and purposes they are, on a day-to-day basis, independent. Those companies are therefore at a disadvantage compared with both other independents whose productions count towards the quota and with in-house production teams. That is damaging not only to specific non-qualifying independents, but to the independent production sector more widely, as success for smaller independents and ensuing investment from larger companies can result in loss of independent status. Large UK producers are the most likely source of risk capital for small UK independent production companies. Similarly, up-and-coming producers are being discouraged from working for successful and supportive companies which are non-qualifying independents for fear that their work will not be commissioned.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para2"></a>I do hope that the Minister will look on these amendments sympathetically. Amendment No. 198 would require producers to show that they have derived no more than 33 per cent of gross revenues from production activity from a related broadcaster. We believe that this test would be easy to measure and account for. In addition, it means that should a production company change status and become economically dependent, it would then automatically lose its independent status&#151;exactly what the law is intended to account for. I hear and accept what the noble Lord, Lord Alli has said. He has raised the <P>


<a name="column_675"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 675</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concern that notwithstanding his support of the principles and sentiments behind these amendments, the actual wording could mean that this would allow additional capital into the independent market for broadcasters to set up, as he put it, production entities by the back door.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para3"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alli, for raising that point. I hope that the Minister will give a favourable response to the principle behind the amendments, bearing in mind that we would be keen and willing to take another look at the actual wording between now and Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I warmly support the first amendment, with its emphasis on the need to maintain a vibrant independent production sector. I believe that that is right. I confess to some doubts about the proposition that the register of ideas should be in the hands of Ofcom. In his Second Reading speech the noble Lord, Lord Alli, said that it was time to consider a system of registering ideas. I have no difficulty at all with that. In part of his speech this evening he said that it was time for the television industry to establish a register. I have no difficulty with that. However, I am sceptical that it can be the right job of a regulator like Ofcom, with all its other responsibilities, to hold the register, police it, and presumably see that something useful is done with it. I am not sure that that is the right place for the register and therefore I have serious doubts about those amendments.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para4"></a>When the noble Lord, Lord Alli, turned to my noble friend's amendments, he presented them as representing a possible attack on the independents by Carlton and Granada. I want to put a slightly different point of view. I no longer have any connection with either of those organisations, but I have some experience of the relationship of licence holders such as HTV with the independent sector. I suppose that together with my noble friend I can claim some role in promoting the independent sector through the part we played in establishing S4C. Probably the biggest boost to the independent sector in Wales was the establishment of S4C and the need therefore to produce Welsh language television.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para5"></a>However, there has been a boost to the independent sector not only in the field of Welsh language television, and perhaps I can claim some modest part in that during my time as a director of HTV. The relationship between a company such as HTV and other licence holders and the independent sector has been extremely important and productive.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para6"></a>Clearly, we cannot have a situation in which the programmes of a regional subsidiary would qualify as independent for its owner's network schedules, but there are strong arguments for suggesting that ITV regional companies should qualify as independents for other broadcasters.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para7"></a>The fact of the matter is that the relationship that we had, for example, in Wales between HTV and the independents led to considerable independent <P>


<a name="column_676"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 676</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>production successes. We achieved successes in drama, documentary and current affairs strands. I believe that there is a risk that increasingly prescriptive independent quotas for the broadcasters, excluding that kind of operation, may threaten the continued close co-operation which would harm the independent sector.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para8"></a>There is a strong case for considering that if companies such as HTV could produce programmes for the BBC or other separate companies, they would be likely to work with independents and would encourage independent production. In Wales, we would certainly see a growth of English language independents in addition to the Welsh language independents.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para9"></a>I note that the noble Lord, Lord Alli, who has a particular interest in this matter, disagrees with me, but the view is strongly held by my former colleagues. They believe passionately in the case of the independents and perhaps for a particular reason. We as a company were among the first to feel the enormous financial burdens that fell on the industry as a result of the bidding process. We suddenly had to get rid of a large number of our former employees. We probably led the way in the industry. A large number of our former employees set themselves up as independent producers and we continued to work with them&#151;only with the difference that they produced for us and for others, and did so in a different relationship. So I return to my starting point; that is, the passionate belief in the role of the independents.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para10"></a>However, I urge that we do not simply dismiss the idea that a partnership can produce even more productive results than an exclusion. I hope that further thought will be given to those relationships and that even the noble Lord, Lord Alli, will consider it a possibility. I give way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Alli: </B>   This is a dangerous argument. It is seductive to believe that ITV, when it is consolidated into a single company which still has brands out there called HTV, Scottish Television, Granada, Carlton or London Weekend, should, with the broadcaster resources, be allowed to qualify for quota for the BBC. That is an absurd suggestion. There is nothing stopping the BBC buying programmes from London Weekend Television or HTV, but it should not be allowed to use the quota as an incentive to subsidise the ITV broadcaster. That does not help the independent production sector, but helps a combined ITV owned by a single set of shareholders and not the creative community.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   Perhaps I may make one further point in that regard. It is a subject to which we shall return on later amendments. It is production outside the M25. For some curious reason we have now entered into a situation where it is thought to be entirely satisfactory if television is produced two miles outside the M25, which counts as regional production.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para11"></a>But the reality is that we have to have production out in all the regions. If that is to be achieved, companies such as HTV producing in Cardiff and <P>


<a name="column_677"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 677</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bristol should receive a respectable share of what is available and work with the independents within those regions.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para12"></a>I entirely agree with the proposition that has just been advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, if we were going to have a centralised system in which all the production came from Pinewood or somewhere in the Home Counties. As I shall argue in a later debate, we have to strengthen regional broadcasting, in which I believe passionately. Therefore, the noble Lord should not close his mind entirely to the idea that partnership out in the regions is wholly helpful and constructive for the independent companies that have established themselves in those regions. I leave the matter there for the time being.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-26_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   We on these Benches broadly support the issues that are raised in this group of amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Alli, has eloquently explained the position based on his great experience. I fancy that none of us would disagree about the importance of the independent sector and the successes it has had, and continues to have, in providing vitality in this country's broadcasting output.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para13"></a>I had not been aware that the BBC is not yet meeting its quota. That is worrying. I am not quite sure why that should be the case. It may be that between now and the next stage of the Bill I can speak with the noble Lord, Lord Alli, to shed some light on the matter. I would not want to throw loose accusations around the Committee. The importance of the independent sector will not be lost on anybody, least of all on those taking part in the Committee. There is the vitality which the independent sector brings with a quick response to changing ideas and taste in different categories of the population, including the young and ethnic groups. It is stimulating as regards the creative work that is done by many people who might not otherwise have access to the machinery whereby their work can develop and be put into programming.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para14"></a>The debate on quotas has become a great deal more complex than I had expected. As we understand it, the current regime, well intentioned though it is, creates some difficulties for the independent sector where quotas apply. We all know about the minimum of 25 per cent of time allocated to the broadcasting of qualifying programmes.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para15"></a>We also understand that secondary legislation will shortly come before Parliament. That legislation is currently being redrafted. It will to some extent correct the definition of &quot;independents". The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, explained&#151;therefore, I shall not go into it in any depth&#151;that independent companies which are under the umbrella, or in the orbit, of a large broadcaster now find themselves in a difficult position whereby they are not considered to be independents in the sense in which that term is understood under the current regime. That leads to serious consequences for those businesses.

<a name="30429-26_para16"></a>The Secretary of State, Mrs Jowell, at the ITC's programme supply review at the Oxford media conference in January rightly announced a strengthening of the powers that would be given to Ofcom to police the independent production quota. But that has created a lot of disturbance from the point of view of the long-term commissioning process. Companies are now worried that those independents that they have been considering may not be qualified to provide programming for them. That is obviously an unintentional effect. I hope that the Minister will tell us whether there has been any further thinking on that point. Some of the larger independent companies have close shareholding relationships with larger broadcasters with which they have very little programme-making activity but do work for others, including the BBC. At the moment they consider that they are in an extremely vulnerable position. I believe that most noble Lords would agree that that matter must be looked at and corrected.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para17"></a>I do not intend to discuss the issue debated by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and other noble Lords on further refinements of the matter we are discussing. I shall read Hansard very carefully. Presumably we shall revisit the matter at a later stage. It seems to us that the way in which Ofcom will deal with the future of the independents is one of the most important aspects of the legislation.
<P>

<a name="30429-26_para18"></a>Having said that, we look forward to studying the matter very much more closely and perhaps being better equipped to enter into the very sophisticated debate which developed between the noble Lords, Lord Crickhowell and Lord Alli. We feel rather inadequately equipped to enter that debate at this stage although undoubtedly we shall do so at a later stage.

In the five-and-a-half years I have been a Member of your Lordships' House I have meticulously never gone into any detail or bored the House in any way about my earlier career, but it seems almost perverse not to do so at this particular juncture.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para0"></a>I joined the film industry in 1969. At that point 90 per cent of the people involved in the industry were permanently employed and 10 per cent were freelance or independent. Some 34 years later those percentages have exactly reversed themselves. Today 90 per cent of the people involved in the industry are independent and 10 per cent are permanently employed. From 1969 to 1983 I was disbarred from producing any form of material for television because if you did not work for one of the television companies, you could not produce for them. This reached the apotheosis of ridiculousness when, rather like the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, I was a director of Anglia Television in 1980 but until 1983 I could not actually make a programme for Anglia. That was how daft the situation was.

<a name="30429-27_para1"></a>Quotas allowed me to produce my first work for television both here and abroad. Another market distortion was introduced by the 1945 Labour government&#151;the Eady levy. Thanks to the Eady levy I and my entire generation&#151;every single member of my generation of film makers&#151;made their first piece of work. I name a few such film makers: the noble Lord, Lord Attenborough, Sir Alan Parker, Sir Ridley Scott, Ken Loach, Stephen Frears. Every single member of my generation of film makers made their first films with the support of the National Film Finance Corporation. That was market distortion and regulation&#151;not deregulation. The history of the independent sector in Britain has entirely relied upon a market-distorted process. My absolute contention is that it cannot survive in a free market. The market has changed very significantly.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para2"></a>My noble friend Lord Alli is quite right to table his amendment, because unless we protect and nurture the independent sector in this country, it will go back to where it was in 1969 and cease to exist.

<P>

<a name="30429-27_para3"></a>Major production centres have developed in some of our provincial cities. That is welcome because they have introduced a new dimension of enterprise and creativity to local economies. In Wales, the independent sector has benefited from the presence of an additional public service broadcaster in the form of S4C. Some 60 per cent of its analogue service is supplied by the independent sector, rising to 80 per cent with the launch of its digital service.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para4"></a>It was never intended that S4C should produce anything very much of its own but should always go out for its programming. The Bill introduces an independent production quota of 25 per cent for S4C along with other public service broadcasters. That does not make sense in view of the reality that I have just described. I hope that the Government will look again at the anomalous position of S4C in that context. We want S4C not to reduce independent production, but to encourage it and provide a stable financial base.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para5"></a>In relation to the larger argument, there is always a propensity within licensed broadcasting organisations to do programming themselves rather than go outside. There is a bias against the independent sector, which is not as highly valued as it should be.

His references to Channel 4 prompted me to realise that in an earlier speech today I declared no interest. I probably should share with the Committee the information that my second son has been working for Channel 4 for some years and is a reasonably senior manager there, on the digital side.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para7"></a>My interest in the issues raised by the noble Lord go back to my own period as a Minister engaged in this area between 1992 and 1994, when I remember being consistently impressed by the representations made by groups of independent producers about their development and problems. I am delighted to hear of the quota's success and will briefly return to the BBC later.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para8"></a>I warmly support my noble friends Lord Crickhowell and Lord Roberts in their remarks about S4C, which comes into the same category as Channel 4.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alli, referred to the wide range of awards won. I cannot help feeling that that particular success contributes to the plurality of which we were speaking earlier in today's proceedings. Going back to my experience between 1992 and 1994, I share his misgiving about individual ITV companies contributing towards the quota. I understand the problem that has arisen, and I fear sclerotic consequences if concessions were to be made in that area. I fear that they would not contribute to the success behind the achievement that is Amendment No. 14&#151;the generic amendment&#151;which seems to me the touchstone test.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para10"></a>The BBC has written quite frequently to individual Members of the House over the past month. I am not absolutely confident that it has ever in correspondence with me explained why it has been missing the quota. I can even remember one letter that gave the impression that the BBC was quite pleased to have got as close to fulfilling the quota as it had. I understand why it does not raise the subject but, considering all the other things that it asks us to support it on&#151;I have been happy to allude to them earlier today&#151;it is slightly careless of it not to have described why it does that.

<a name="30429-27_para11"></a>In the final analysis, the Minister's response on all the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and indeed by my noble friend, will be tested by some of us against the contribution that they make to achieving the fundamental premise that underlies Amendment No. 14. If the Government's heart is in the right place in terms of achieving what Amendment No. 14 talks about, they will have done well, certainly so far as I am concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   I want to emphasise the importance for Ofcom, once the Bill has passed into law, of having adequate powers in relation to independent production to ensure proper regional dispersal of production. Wales has an excellent record in that, of course, but it has certain linguistic advantages in making that possible.

<a name="30429-27_para12"></a>In television production, in my experience, there is an immense magnetic attraction to the London area&#151;to get inside the M25. In my time, S4C used to make very vigorous efforts to go up to Scotland to promote independent production there. I am not sure what the present position is. However, I have a suspicion that in general there has been a relaxation of that dispersal of independent production, and a greater concentration coming down into the London area. As ITV develops&#151;if we get ITV plc&#151;I greatly fear for all the great regional traditions of the ITV system. The pressures again will be toward independent production being concentrated down here in the London area.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para13"></a>In a completely different context, in my ministerial days I remember once trying to persuade the Home Office to engage in an effective dispersal of the Passport Office. With great agony, it finally produced plans to take us out to Ealing. Television has that same inner pressure towards the glories of the London area.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para14"></a>I searched as thoroughly as I could through the great volumes of the Bill for any reference to the importance of the regional dimension of independent production. I found none there. Before the Bill finally passes from this House, I hope that we might be able to do something about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I should first declare an interest as chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, although that organisation's work has very little to do directly with my noble friend Lord Alli's amendment, to which I should like to give my warm support.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para15"></a>I first came across the issue of independent producers not through the glamour of having been a producer or through having operated at the heady heights of owning a television company, but on a very wet morning in Brighton during the Labour Party conference, when I was invited to breakfast by PACT. It had a briefing session at which it put me in the picture as regards the difficult situation in which independent producers found themselves. It was in a situation in which it had little economic power compared with the big battalions&#151;the larger television companies, including the BBC and ITV. The fact that the scales were tipped against it made life pretty difficult. I was delighted when the committee of my noble friend Lord Puttnam made a firm recommendation that led to the Government accepting the proposal to give the ITC the responsibility of reviewing programme supply.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para16"></a>Various useful measures stemmed from that, including, I understand, the fact that the contracts under which independent producers have sometimes suffered will now be revised or at least be made more flexible so that they can negotiate better contracts. I understand that the previous position was that independent producers were tied in particular to the BBC and therefore had no independent right to market their production outside the UK; they were dependent on the BBC to do that. If the BBC chose not to do that, that was the end of the opportunity for the <P>


<a name="column_682"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 682</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>independent producer to make more money from their creative work. I believe that that will change as a result of the ITC review.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para17"></a>I turn briefly to the question of the 25 per cent quota. I understand that it depends on what are called qualifying hours, which can be significantly less than the total number of hours for which there are programmes. That is caused by the number of exemptions&#151;I refer, for example, to Open University programming, news, programmes with a large life content and so on. If one then examines the difference between the 25 per cent quota by time and the 25 per cent quota by value, which is what I support&#151;I believe that it is the basis for some of the amendments tabled by my noble friend&#151;one sees that the position would then become a little better for independent producers.
<P>

<a name="30429-27_para18"></a>I was given some figures by PACT about the BBC; I am not trying to pick on the BBC in particular, for which I have a great deal of respect, I quickly add. We shall discuss it in relation to later amendments. Looking at the figures by value, the 25 per cent figure becomes about 13 per cent with regard to work commissioned from independent productions. It is lower because of the point about qualifying hours and because of the difference between time and value. We should convert the qualifying quota from time to value. That would give our independent producers a little more of a fair crack of the whip. It is a question of giving them an even chance to compete. I believe that we are moving in that direction; if my noble friend's amendments were agreed to, we should move much more significantly in that direction.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   I shall endeavour to demonstrate to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, and all other noble Lords who have contributed to this debate that the Government's heart is in the right place with regard to the independent production sector.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para0"></a>I strongly agree with the claim made by my noble friend Lord Alli, the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, and practically every other speaker in this debate; that is, that the independent production sector is very important within the whole broadcasting environment. I also strongly agree that it produces some very fine programmes. If I did not acknowledge that, I should be in grave trouble with my daughter, who currently happens to make documentary programmes in the independent sector. I do not know whether that involves declaring an interest; the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, declared an interest in relation to his son.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para1"></a>The Government asked the ITC to undertake a review of programme supply in the UK, as the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and others mentioned, in response to concerns expressed during consultation on the Bill about the overall economic health of the programme supply market and the position of independent producers within it. It also commissioned that because it agreed with what my noble friend Lord Puttnam <P>


<a name="column_683"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 683</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>said; that is, that the sector should be protected and nurtured. I agree with all the former and current producers who spoke this evening about that.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para2"></a>The ITC's authoritative and incisive report was published in November 2002 and was well received by the whole industry. The Government accepted almost all its recommendations. Following the review, we made a substantial body of amendments in another place to strengthen the Bill's requirements on independent productions.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para3"></a>Let me reassert, therefore&#151;it is important to the noble Lord, Lord McNally&#151;that the Government are listening and have already made a great many changes to the Bill of which this is another example. These amendments will require all broadcasters to draw up and agree with Ofcom codes of practice for their dealings with independent producers. They will give Ofcom the power to measure the independent productions quota by value as well as volume if appropriate. I say that to the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and my noble friend Lord Dubs. They will require Ofcom to review periodically the way the quota is working and report to the Secretary of State. They will give Ofcom the power to require broadcasters to make up any shortfall in the quota in subsequent years.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para4"></a>These amendments demonstrate our strong and ongoing commitment to the independent production sector. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Alli and other speakers who have begun at least to acknowledge that. I can assure the Committee that the issue of independent productions will be very much at the forefront of Ofcom thinking. That is what the Government intend and expect of Ofcom. In particular, under its annual factual and statistical report, Ofcom must consider certain aspects of the programming quota for independent productions.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para5"></a>Paragraphs (e),(f) and (g) of Clause 351(3) require Ofcom specifically to consider the application of the quota and the effectiveness of the conditions and duties that are in force; whether to recommend to the Secretary of State that he exercise the power to change the quota or the way the quota is operated; and the extent to which independent productions are produced in the United Kingdom in a range of production centres outside the M25 area.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para6"></a>I believe that Ofcom's wide-ranging requirements adequately meet the concerns that prompted Amendment No. 14. I do not believe, therefore, that it is necessary to include a reference to the independent production sector as one of the overarching objectives contained in Clause 3(2). As far as a link between Ofcom's general duties and the UK programme supply market is needed, it seems to me that it is one of the &quot;relevant markets" referred to in subsection (3)(e) and as such Ofcom will have to have regard to the desirability of encouraging investment and innovation in it. I hope, therefore, that my noble friend will not press his amendment.
<P>


<a name="column_684"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 684</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para7"></a>Amendment No. 42 would insert a new clause proposing a new duty for Ofcom to promote the independent production sector. As I have explained in some detail, Ofcom will be very aware that to promote the independent production sector is already firmly within its remit. Furthermore, I am sure that Ofcom's radar is already fixed on this issue as one to which they must have particular regard. Again, I do not believe that that additional duty for Ofcom is necessary.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para8"></a>Furthermore, I am unsure as to the value of a register of programme ideas. Indeed, I am not aware that it has been raised as a specific concern in the broad consultation that has taken place on the Bill either by broadcasters or by the independent producers themselves. I agree, therefore, with the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, that keeping a register of all original programme ideas would appear to be a pretty big administrative burden to be placed on Ofcom, the benefits of which are not immediately obvious. Perhaps a register of original programme ideas might be considered a useful tool for independent producers. If that is the case, it would be appropriate, perhaps, for PACT, as the trade association which represents their interests, to develop and maintain such a register. Perhaps my noble friend would like to take that up.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para9"></a>Perhaps I may comment briefly on the issue of copyright protection, which my noble friend also raised. We are aware that some people have raised concerns about the existence of copyright protection for programme formats in the past. However, I think that many people now take the view that sufficiently elaborated original programme formats are already protected by copyright, and that is something with which the Government agree.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para10"></a>I reinforce what I have said by emphasising again that Ofcom will have an enormous amount of flexibility to promote the independent production sector in carrying out their duties. Therefore, I do not think that this new clause is necessary.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para11"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 196 and 199, which would require Ofcom to secure that every public service broadcaster in each year must meet a programming quota for independent productions by both &quot;value" as a percentage of the broadcaster's annual budget allocated to qualifying programmes as well as by &quot;broadcast time".
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para12"></a>Amendments Nos. 272 and 273 to Schedule 12 would place similar requirements on the BBC. It is perhaps appropriate at this point to say that like the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, and one or two other speakers, the Government are somewhat disappointed that the BBC has not managed to meet its quota targets. Indeed, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has written to the chairman of the BBC about that. I am sure that we will have a reply very soon. We know about the particular problems caused by the issues of Endemol, but I do not think that that entirely explains why it has not reached its quota.
<P>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 685</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para13"></a>The ITC UK programme supply review specifically examined a recommendation of the committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Puttnam. The ITC review was not persuaded of the need at present for such intervention in broadcasters' scheduling decisions. However, the review recommended that Ofcom keep that position under review, with reserve powers in the Bill to monitor the programming quota for independent products by value as well as or instead of by broadcasting time if that seemed appropriate. The Government have accepted that recommendation. It does not quite meet what is proposed by the amendments but it goes a very long way towards doing so. I hope that what the Government are doing in that respect will be accepted.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para14"></a>An order-making power for the Secretary of State to effect that change was introduced in another place. That power, which must be triggered by a recommendation from Ofcom, would allow the Secretary of State to make an order which would give Ofcom a duty to set licence conditions for the public service channels&#151;Channel 3, Channel 4 and Channel 5&#151;which would secure in each year that the programming quota for the independent productions must be met by value as well as or instead of by broadcasting time.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para15"></a>The &quot;by value" measure at Clause 273(5) means that the broadcaster in question must apply a certain percentage of its programming budget for qualifying programmes in a year to the acquisition of independent productions. That could be applied as well as or instead of the present measure which requires a certain proportion of broadcasting time to be devoted to such productions. Similar provisions were also introduced in Schedule 12 to extend that power to both the BBC and the Welsh Authority. I shall return to the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para16"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that should it appear to Ofcom that a &quot;by value" programming quota for independent products is needed, there are now appropriate measures in place to impose those requirements. I therefore hope that the amendments will not be pressed.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para17"></a>I turn to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy. S4C has never before had a quota for independent production, but the Bill includes S4C in the 25 per cent for the first time. As with Channel 4, the expectation is that S4C will achieve a higher percentage. I hope that that response meets the noble Lord's points.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para18"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, spoke to Amendment No. 197, which would insert the term &quot;independent producers" into Clause 273(2)(b). Amendment No. 198 would define that term as a producer who is not an employee of a broadcasting company, and is not a body corporate deriving more than 33 per cent of its gross annual revenue from a related broadcaster.
<P>


<a name="column_686"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column 686</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para19"></a>Prior to the establishment of programming quotas for independent productions a decision was taken in the Broadcasting Act 1990 that the definition of both &quot;independent productions" and &quot;qualifying programmes" should be set by the Secretary of State by secondary legislation. This was considered to be a rather more flexible approach to ensure that the definition of the terms used within the primary legislation remain appropriate to achieving the objectives of the quota. Establishing a definition of the term &quot;independent producer" in primary legislation would restrict the flexibility and scope of the order-making powers under the Bill. Therefore, it really would defeat the purpose outlined by noble Lords who contributed to this evening's debate.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para20"></a>As I am sure the noble Baroness is aware, defining &quot;independent producers" in the way proposed was considered as part of the ITC UK Programme Supply Review. The review examined the role of independent producers within the programme supply market and specifically examined the current definitions. The ITC noted that it did not think that there was a case at present for changes in qualification criteria to include producers who have ownership links to UK broadcasters. It considered available evidence, which showed&#151;contrary to what has been suggested tonight&#151;that producers in this category were not being unduly affected by exclusion from the quota at present, and that a change of definition would most likely impact adversely on other independent producers.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para21"></a>I understand the arguments that noble Lords have made by way of these amendments. I can assure them that, through the ongoing monitoring of the quota, Ofcom will keep these definitions under review. I hope that helps noble Lords, at least a little. Any further changes to the definition can be made by secondary legislation. However, I believe that the programming quota for independent productions has worked well. It has served as a catalyst. It has also helped stimulate competition and diversity and encouraged a thriving and innovative production sector.
<P>

<a name="30429-28_para22"></a>Through Clause 273 we aim to ensure that independent producers continue to make a significant contribution to the programme supply market in this country, as well as allowing us the flexibility to make some changes as circumstances dictate. I therefore see no reason to make such a fundamental change to the clause. I hope that the noble Baroness will not wish to press her amendment. Similarly, in the light of what I have said at somewhat great length in an effort to be helpful, I hope that my noble friend Lord Alli will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 172:
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-29_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;( ) It shall be the duty of each abstractor to produce a drought plan."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-29_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: I hope that this small but necessary probing amendment will kick off what I expect will be the last day of Committee well.
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para9"></a>The Bill lays a duty on each water undertaker to prepare and maintain a drought plan. Given that the Bill takes small users&#151;with a few exceptions&#151;out of the licensing regime, I wonder why each abstractor is not required to produce a drought plan. In the Bill, we are dealing with a time of climate change and the greater likelihood of drought, so each person with a licence to abstract water should be under a duty to think about times of drought and produce a plan to reduce the panic effect at such times. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I must admit to a certain fascination with the amendment. Most small abstractors will abstract water for their own use and will have limited alternative sources of supply. The reality for someone involved in irrigation is that, if the water genuinely is not there, all that they need to do is stop irrigating. That is the drought plan.
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para10"></a>I am not sure that we should accept the amendment. I understand the sentiment, but I am not sure that, in practice, the amendment would do anything other than place a considerable administrative burden on small abstractors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-29_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  I tend to agree more with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, than with the noble Baroness on the matter. It is true that many small abstractors are excluded by the Bill, but there are still 48,000 abstraction licences likely to be issued under the Bill, and, in most cases, there is no need for a drought plan of any dimensions.
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para11"></a>It is right that there should be scrutiny of the drought plans of water companies, so that, as far as possible, difficult decisions can be discussed on the <P>


<a name="column_GC116"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>basis of the information in the plans. However, for the vast majority of abstractors, the drought plan will be fairly straightforward&#151;in some cases, it will be as simple as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, suggested. There will be no need to scrutinise those drought plans in the way that there would be for the plans of the water companies.
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para12"></a>Some abstractors would need drought plans for their own purposes, but it would not be sensible to set them down in legislation. It would require quite a bureaucracy to enforce and scrutinise the plans, and it seems to me that the vast majority of cases would not merit such a legislative requirement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-29_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   The Minister's reply suggests that the Government are content to leave the Bill as it is. I understand the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, about small abstractors, but here we are talking about quite large ones. The time may come when we will wish to reconsider the question of whether people should bear drought in mind more than they do at the moment. We have not arrived at that position yet, so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para13"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-29_spnew5"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose </B>   moved Amendment No. 172ZA:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 77, line 25, leave out from &quot;sources" to end of line 27.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-29_para14"></a><P>

<a name="30429-29_para15"></a>The noble Duke said: In moving Amendment No. 172ZA, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 172B.
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para16"></a>Amendment No. 172ZA is a probing amendment. We would like to know whether the words in parentheses imply that, in times of drought or other shortage, a water undertaker who has to handle a quantity of water on behalf of a licensed water supplier in a time of drought may&#151;I searched for the right word, and &quot;purloin" did not seem quite right&#151;appropriate some of that water to alleviate his own drought shortage. Is that the sense that the Government wish to be taken from the sentence?
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para17"></a>In Amendment No. 172B, we suggest that, rather than having a three-yearly revision of a drought plan, we should go back to having a five-year period, the timescale used for so many other things. Why will it be necessary to produce a revised drought plan every three years, when a revision of the water resource management plan must be done only every five years?
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para18"></a>I was puzzling about that and about another point that goes along with it. Is the provision an effort further to reduce the timescale envisaged, along with the other rather frightening ruling that any licence that has not been used for four years can be withdrawn? Can the Minister tell the Committee whether the inclusion of a licence in a drought plan would qualify as use, even if it had not physically been used? Is the agency reserving to itself the final right to tear up an undertaken drought plan after four years and determine a drought plan of its choosing? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I shall start with the first amendment. It must be clear that, in the event of a drought, the <P>


<a name="column_GC117"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC117</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>undertaker will be responsible for ensuring that the needs of customers are met. It is important that the undertaker has sufficient information on which to plan. The noble Duke's amendment would allow the undertaker to prepare a drought plan that did not necessarily cover the sources of supply that belonged to licensed water suppliers. The ensuing drought plan would not provide sufficient information to demonstrate that all customers had adequate security of supply during a drought. Making the deletion suggested by the noble Duke would mean that we did not have a comprehensive drought plan.
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para19"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 172B. No causal relationship to the withdrawal of licences is implied by the provision. Drought plans explain the operational management action that water companies must take in the event of a drought. Several events&#151;drought or other changes in water supply and demand&#151;could lead to a change in the contents of a drought plan or in the structure of the companies. Leaving the revision of drought plans aside for five years could mean that they become out of date. The three-yearly review period means that the plans will always be reasonably current. That is a continuation of the present&#151;albeit non-statutory&#151;system of having a three-yearly cycle for plans, under ministerial guidance. That three-year timetable has worked well, and we wish now to include it in legislation.
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para20"></a>We need to provide for a material change and to ensure that a review can be triggered. There are none of the sinister implications that the noble Duke suggested with regard to other parts of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-29_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I ask the Minister to clarify what he said. I understood from what he said that, normally, it is current practice to have a three-yearly review. Is he not concerned that the management plan will be reviewed every five years and the drought plan every three years? In fact, the plans will not overlap, in the truest sense of the word. Would it not be more sensible if they did? Although I am hesitant to ask for the extra work to be done, if we made it a three-year rule, the management would be doing the same.
<P>

<a name="30429-29_para21"></a>Presumably, if there are emergencies, emergency proposals are in hand anyway. To follow up the question that my noble friend posed with regard to Amendment No. 172B, I ask the Minister to be more specific than the slightly general answer that he gave.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-29_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The water resource plans are the strategic framework within which we operate, whereas the drought plans are the operational plans by which the companies run their day-to-day, week-to-week operations. As I said, the plans are already, in practice, on a three-yearly cycle. For some time, we have operated the guidance on the basis of a three-yearly cycle. The only change that this part of the Bill suggests is that that guidance cycle should be written into the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I want to pursue the point slightly further. We are in the business of strategic planning for real problems. A drought plan is a <P>


<a name="column_GC118"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>drought plan, and I understand that it is an operational plan. However, an operational plan can work only within existing resources. It is essentially a short-term plan, if I can put it that way, particularly if it runs for only a three-year cycle. Solutions to water supply problems in a period of drought result from long-term strategic investment. We have discussed that sort of thing before.
<P>

<a name="30429-30_para0"></a>I find myself wondering who has the responsibility for saying to a water undertaking, &quot;Your drought plan is fine, but if we have a really hard time, you will have some difficulty, even with that plan. The plan can only make use of existing resources, and you ought to do something to take care of things strategically, so that you are not caught out in this way in future". Does the initiative for doing that lie with the water undertaking or, perhaps, with the Environment Agency? That is an important point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   If circumstances change so that a drought plan that has been relatively recently revised is no longer appropriate, the undertaker can seek a drought order that may impose restrictions on what would be the abstraction levels under the operational plan. It would be the undertaker's initiative, unless there were a general request that all undertakers operate on that basis. There is the ability to override a plan. In extreme circumstances, compensation can also be paid.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   With respect, the Minister has not answered the question, in a sense. I asked about strategic operations to obviate the need to take the short-term measures that are so upsetting for everybody.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Clearly, once the strategic plans are set on a reasonable basis, although they will be reviewed every five years, one would not expect them to change hugely, but if a short-term crisis led to the recognition that the existing strategic and operational plans were fine but that circumstances had changed, a drought order would need to be adopted. As for the drought plan itself, it must be checked by the Environment Agency. If what lay behind the question was who will check on the drought plan, the answer is that it will be the Environment Agency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that last point. I think that he has answered my question, which was really: what happens when, despite all the best laid plans, we find that we still have a problem? That is the sort of issue that the Environment Agency should consider and then, presumably, warn the water undertaking that, in difficult circumstances, it would be vulnerable, and ask it what it was doing about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   On a point of clarification, where is DEFRA in all this? If there is catastrophic drought, for example, surely the people who will know how best to handle it are the water undertakers, who live with that all the time. Who says: &quot;You must do &quot;, <P>


<a name="column_GC119"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Y or Z"? Is it DEFRA or the Environment Agency, or do the water undertakers carry the burden and get on with it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In circumstances in which we must modify or override existing plans, an order must be sought that is granted or initiated by DEFRA; but strategic management is a matter for the Environment Agency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew7"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   To return to Amendment No. 172ZA, when a drought takes place, let us say that the water undertaker has been told by the licensed water supplier&#151;I always get the terms wrong&#151;"I will give you 10 million gallons per day and I want you to supply it to someone down the road". Then the drought comes along.
<P>

<a name="30429-30_para1"></a>Does that mean that the water undertaker has within his drought plans to allow for those 10 million gallons per day to be passed on regardless of anything else&#151;presuming he is still receiving it from the licensed supplier&#151;or, if the drought order is brought into force, is he allowed to reduce the amount that he supplies on behalf of the licensed water supplier in proportion to everyone else? Having to take on someone else's drought plan may prove problematic. Perhaps the Minister can help me with that question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Hopefully, the combination of the strategic and operational plans will in most circumstances deal with that. The operational plans will need to include some contingency provisions. However, in circumstances outside that, a drought order could in certain circumstances impose restrictions on other abstractions, or other users, and allow the source of water to be used by the undertaker in a different way.
<P>

<a name="30429-30_para2"></a>In the example given by the noble Duke, the drought order could restrict and redirect the 10,000 gallons, but that would depend very much on the circumstances. As I said in reply to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, there may be circumstances in which compensation may then be payable. However, those are abnormal circumstances. We hope that the operational plans and the contingencies built into them will deal with most such situations, and the understanding between the undertaker and the abstractor will be clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew9"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I thank the Minister for attempting to clear up the matter. It is rather complicated, and I think it would be better if we took the amendment away to reconsider the matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(d) such other matters as the Secretary of State may specify in directions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-30_para10"></a>
There is much reference there to the water undertaker, but the actions of the water undertaker may have an adverse effect on the water environment. Supplying water to meet droughts means that other parts of the water system may in certain circumstances have to do without water.
<P>

<a name="30429-30_para11"></a>We are extremely fortunate in the United Kingdom. We do not have empty river beds, as do parts of the continent. When I see them, I often wonder what happens in the winter to the ecology of those river systems. We in the United Kingdom clearly have a better system than that, but of course we have more rain than many parts of continental Europe.
<P>

<a name="30429-30_para12"></a>However, I am especially concerned because I thought that the Bill was about the environmental sustainability of the river systems from which we obtain our water. We must balance strategic reserves of water to enable river flow, for example. Eventually, we reach almost impossible pluralities between the needs of communities&#151;the population&#151;and the need to sustain the environment. The purpose behind the amendment is to highlight the necessity of maintaining environmental sustainability. In this case, it must surely be the Environment Agency, rather than the water undertaker, that ensures that that occurs. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Again, the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, has opened a large can of worms. It may even be better to leave the matter for the Secretary of State to specify. I have some sympathy with the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord, but that is as far as it goes, because the wording of the amendment will not do.
<P>

<a name="30429-30_para13"></a>When one is dealing with a drought, the whole environment is already under stress&#151;otherwise, it would not be a drought. The noble Lord rightly said that this country is more fortunate than many parts of the world. We are: we have a very temperate climate. It is not that we have more rainfall than many other parts of the world; we have much less evaporation. That is a great distinction. One consequence of that is that we make pretty inefficient, poor use of the water resources with which we are blessed. But that is a separate issue that we have discussed on other occasions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-30_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   Perhaps I may respond to that. No, it is not that so much as that plans need to be put in place to ensure that we do not get into that situation and are able to sustain the environment. We all know about hosepipe bans and other such measures that occur during droughts. We need a strategic view to avoid the situation that the noble Baroness described. We need to be prudent in these matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   Perhaps I may add a comment on what the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, said, as one who lives in a part of England&#151;East Anglia&#151;where water resources are scarce. The kind of catastrophic situation that he described must be addressed in the context of planning. In our part of the world, we feel that there is a pressure for housing that existing water supplies could not meet.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para0"></a>Not long ago, I attended a public meeting at which the water company was asked that question, to which its answer was, &quot;Well, we are not short of water in this country; we have just to transport it from where it is to where we need it"&#151;which is, of course, a very large question. To avoid catastrophic droughts, if we had more consideration of water needs in the planning system, that would help to fend off that moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-31_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, has raised a terribly important point. If, as has happened in the past, water companies are abstracting water where the flows in the rivers are perilously low, that can have quite an impact on the sustainable management of the whole water system, and certainly has a major impact on the environment.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para1"></a>I am sure that my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith is right when he says that the amendment is inappropriate to deal with that point, but the issue is hugely important. As the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, said, it comes down to the need to have plans to deal with problems when they arise. The amendment may be inappropriate, but the noble Lord has raised a most important point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I strongly support the amendment moved by my noble friend&#151;perhaps more so given the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain. The environment has <P>


<a name="column_GC122"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>always been at the bottom of the heap in consideration of water supply. In the event of a drought, of course, if there were a choice between water for people to drink and maintaining even a minimal river flow, water for people to drink would come first. However, if the drought plan concerned maintaining a balance under which people could have a shower only once a week, not twice, in an attempt to maintain some sort of river flow, the environment should have a recognised place, rather than falling off the bottom of the list of priorities, as has been the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We have strayed somewhat wide of the amendment into the whole planning system and ablution arrangements. Although I do not dissent that some of those wider issues are important, they are not appropriate to the amendment. The point of the amendment and of this part of the Bill is to set out the nature of the drought plans.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para2"></a>As we discussed under the previous amendment, drought plans are currently produced and presented by the water companies and include information on their environmental impacts, because of their obligations and duties with respect to water supply in times of drought. So there is already a requirement for water companies' drought plans to cover environmental issues.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para3"></a>Plans currently produced under the guidance address possible environmental impacts such as the effect of drought orders on river flows, river quality or aquatic life, and they contain monitoring plans. We expect this to continue when plans are produced on a statutory basis, so we will use direction powers to ensure that that happens. In addition, Section 3 of the Water Industry Act 1991 already ensures that nature conservation obligations are taken into account by the undertakers in the discharge of their functions.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para4"></a>There is already substantial coverage of the environmental impact. The Environment Agency monitors the effect of any drought action taken by water companies, which includes the wider environmental impacts. So the amendment would not enhance anything that is not already in the existing system, which we are now placing on the statute book.

<a name="30429-31_para6"></a>I thank all the Members of the Committee who have contributed to this debate. Particular points were made about planning in relation to water resources.

I will not make other points now&#151;I will make them when I address Amendment No. 175, which is to be debated separately.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-31_para19"></a>
The section of the Water Resources Act to which I have just referred is well drafted regarding its relationship between regional committees and local flood defence committees. Local knowledge is crucial for flood defences. For example, the River Severn is <P>


<a name="column_GC124"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the longest river in England and Wales; I believe that it is about 221 miles long. That river system in its own right deserves more than one local defence committee. It clearly has an upper section, a middle section&#151;which floods in Shrewsbury and places nearby&#151;and a lower section, which floods very badly in the Gloucester area. The situations differ in the different sections of that river. The water undertaker is the Severn Trent authority, which covers two separate, completely different, river basins. It will be extremely difficult to be able to take objective, informed decisions in these situations if we do not have local flood defence committees, with all the local knowledge that is necessary to apply to get correct solutions.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para20"></a>When organisations and bodies are reorganised these days, staff are often made redundant or redeployed. In that process, the corporate memory of a business or a government department is often fractured. Decisions are then made which should not be made&#151;the knowledge was there before, but it is not there now. Local knowledge is crucial in this respect.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para21"></a>There may be a problem for flood defence where sufficient capital investment is not available to smaller local flood defence committee areas. I see no reason why an aspect of strategy propounded by a reasonable flood defence committee cannot be fed into by the local flood defence committees and which would appropriate the correct sums of capital investment to address flood problems in certain places. Obviously that must be equitable; drainage and matters of that kind are extremely important. In addition, investment priorities are acute at times.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para22"></a>The present system is not over-bureaucratic&#151;in fact, it is very practical. It works, and it makes informed decisions, but grass-roots knowledge is essential in order for good decisions to be made. Indeed, it should be possible to ensure that that continues rather than losing a vital section of knowledge. Members of local flood defence committees are often members of county councils; they often have personal knowledge of problems in communities where houses and flood plains have been flooded. They can cite what has happened and show people. I have seen that happen, when people said that a flood went to such and such a point 20 years ago. Nobody else knows that except perhaps a few people who were directly affected.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para23"></a>That is very important. There are local communities, local householders, farmers, landowners, fisheries and drainage interests. All of those are vital, and the amendment would maintain the situation.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para24"></a>Amendment No. 176 is also in my name. I shall try to go through it fairly quickly, but it is a vexed question. I speak here from personal experience rather than in theory. In my experience, the Environment Agency does not have responsibility for non-main river streams, while local authorities do. The amendment asks that the Environment Agency take over those responsibilities. From my experience as a constituency MP, I know that in reality, a huge amount of buck-passing goes on, and nothing gets <P>


<a name="column_GC125"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>done as a result. When people are up in arms about something that needs doing in the non-main river system, and the local authority does not have the resources or the money to apply, it says that it is the riparian owners who must ensure that a stream does not get blocked up, or whatever.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para25"></a>The town of Talgarth, after which I took my title, was acutely flooded about eight years ago&#151;a lot of citizens were flooded out of their homes. The reason was that the local authority would not take responsibility for the river that runs through the place and the riparian owners could not do so either. The local authority did not have the resources to do the job and the riparian owners did not have the labour. The river became blocked with branches and trees, there was huge rainfall of about six inches, a lake was created, and the dam burst and flooded the whole town. That was the result of neglecting a serious matter; it caused great hardship and still has not been properly resolved. The county is still in discussion with the Environment Agency and is still telling the riparian owners to do something about it. We need something much better than this system, otherwise global warming will mean that we see many more such instances. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30429-31_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I have two amendments in this group, and I shall speak to those first. Amendment No. 174 would go a long way towards relieving the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, about his concern if the change to regional flood defence committees takes place. The change would require the Minister to have regard to the need to involve all those who have local knowledge in the new set-up. If the change is to take place, we need an assurance from the Minister, which I am sure he would be happy to give, that as far as possible he will seek to involve people of knowledge and experience in the flood defence set-up that is to be established. I find it inconceivable that the Government would not already have that in the back of their mind.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para26"></a>The other amendment in this group&#151;Amendment No. 176A&#151;is somewhat different. It would remove a small subsection from Clause 65. We tabled the amendment because there is slight concern as to exactly what the new situation will be. Clause 65(1) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sections 147 to 149 of the [Water Resources Act] (which relate to grants for drainage works and flood warning systems) shall cease to have effect".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-31_para27"></a>
That is fine. The Bill then goes on to establish a new regime. But, for the life of me, I could not work out who was responsible for funding what in the new regime and whether responsibility for flood defence work would finish up with the riparian owners or the property owners. However, we all know that successful flood defence work must often be undertaken in a location quite remote from the place that will flood.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para28"></a>Because I cannot interpret the new financial arrangements, we tabled this amendment in the hope that the Minister's exposition on it would be sufficiently plain so that we could understand the matter and could then decide what we wished to do about it. That deals with Amendment No. 176A.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para29"></a>I return to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey. He is right to want to keep a great deal of local experience involved. I sympathise with him very much on the question of flood defences being tightly located in catchment areas, if that can be done. I suppose that ultimately it will come down to the working procedures of the new flood defence committees, when they are established. I find it inconceivable that someone in a remote township in the centre of a region would try to work in detail without the assistance of people who were involved fairly closely on the ground.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para30"></a>However, I also accept that because, as the noble Lord said in his introduction, there have been divided responsibilities with regard to some waterways and a lack of clarity, it may be desirable to put all the responsibility in one place. At least people would then know who to kick if there was a problem.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para31"></a>There are two distinct issues here. One is where the responsibility lies. That must be absolutely plain. Preferably, it should lie in one place. The question then is how those who hold that responsibility choose to do their job. If they have any sensitivity and sense, they will do it in a far more intimate way than would be the case if they sat in their ivory tower in their remote town and thought they knew what was going on in Little Tolpuddle-on-the-Marsh 70, 80 or even 100 miles away. That could well be the case.
<P>

<a name="30429-31_para32"></a>I therefore sympathise with what the noble Lord seeks to achieve through his amendment. When he spoke about the fracturing of responsibilities in reorganisation, I said to my noble friend Lady Byford that it was beginning to sound awfully like local government. That is not really a helpful comment but I am sure the Minister will recognise the sentiment. I believe that this group of amendments has some serious substance behind it, and I look forward to the Minister's reply.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-32_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   The reason that my name is not attached to any of these amendments is that, when we tabled them, I was not sure what kind of interest I should declare, if any. Since then, that has become plain. Therefore, I declare an interest in that my husband chairs a local flood defence committee and will be doing so when the reorganisation takes place, if it happens.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para0"></a>However, the Bill as drafted and, to some extent, these amendments, are concerned with reorganising the deckchairs when the Water Framework Directive requires a fundamental rethink as to what kind of management committees we have. The Environment Agency's guidance on the Water Framework Directive's guiding principles&#151;in particular, where the timetable is helpfully laid out&#151;shows that a work programme for the production of the first river basin <P>


<a name="column_GC127"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>management plans must be published in 2006. The first river basin management plans must be published for consultation in 2008. It is therefore inadequate for flood defence committees, whether local or regional, to deal simply with flooding issues when the Water Framework Directive clearly takes us in the direction of a far wider set of issues with regard to river basins.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para1"></a>Rightly, the Water Framework Directive will require us to involve a whole new range of stakeholders&#151;landowners, NGOs and planning authorities&#151;in a quite different way. All those stakeholders will need to have a place in preparing the river basin management plans. Of course, the Environment Agency will simply be able to consult them. But if we had a model of a management committee along the lines of what a flood defence committee now does for flooding but that dealt with all the issues expected of river basin management plans by the Water Framework Directive, we would be in a far better position to deal with river basin issues.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para2"></a>As it is, if we simply reorganise the flood defence committees as the Bill proposes, I fear that we shall again be trailing the requirements of the Water Framework Directive rather than being ahead of them and implementing them in a way that advantages everyone. They certainly could be implemented so that they advantaged the whole range of stakeholders. I regret that the Government have not come up with a forward-looking committee arrangement. This one seems to be rather retrospective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-32_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   The comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, bring me to my feet. As she knows, I have tabled an amendment towards the end of the Bill which again deals with the Water Framework Directive. Throughout our debates on the Bill over several days I have said that I believe we are foolish not to have taken in the implications of the Water Framework Directive. Although I shall perhaps repeat myself later, I do not apologise for that because it is a matter on which Members of the Committee feel strongly. When we pass the Bill and it goes to another place, it is not likely to come into effect until the summer months. Indeed, as the noble Baroness suggested, we shall then have to make all these arrangements before December.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para3"></a>As the Minister knows well, I object to the fact that I suspect he will turn round and say, &quot;Well, that is fine but it will be done through statutory instruments". Again, I voice my anger&#151;perhaps that is too strong a word and I should say &quot;crossness"&#151;that that will be the case. When statutory instruments come before the House, we do not have a chance to debate them in the way that we are able to debate business in this Committee now. Therefore, although our lead spokesman on this group of amendments is my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith, I felt strongly that I should say again that I believe the Government have it wrong.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para4"></a>Having said that, I know that the Minister will look at me and think &quot;Animal Health Bill". I am not suggesting that we should return to what was done originally, although that is not a bad idea. However, I believe that the Committee should be aware of the <P>


<a name="column_GC128"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seriousness of the matter and of the reasons why so many amendments have been tabled in the way that they have. We shall be including something that will be in place for perhaps only six months and we shall then have to return to the drawing board again. But next time the issue returns to the drawing board, we shall have no control over it whatever.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para5"></a>We on this side of the Committee and, indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, have reflected that in our comments and I believe that other colleagues will feel the same. It is very difficult to talk about one part of a river, one flood defence or whatever when the Water Framework Directive refers to river basins and the implications which arise for everyone from the original river basin. Therefore, I support the comments made by my noble friend and wish to add weight to what the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said. I am very concerned that we are not allowing time properly to debate the Water Framework Directive, which is hugely important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-32_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I wish to address Amendments Nos. 175, 176 and 176A and the &quot;non-amendments" which I believe we debated concerning the Water Framework Directive raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para6"></a>Perhaps I may reassure the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, on his concern about the Severn. The Severn Trent is currently a single-tier flood defence committee and it appears to work rather well. It is one of the largest committees and can therefore use its money very effectively. Certainly the consultation that takes place on individual flood defence schemes within the context of a committee, large or small, provides an effective way of hearing the local public voice, and that effectiveness is not necessarily dependent on the size of the committee or the number of people on it. There are many stakeholders in individual flood defence schemes and they all need to be heard.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para7"></a>Two-tier committees are very confusing for the public. What has become abundantly clear during times of flooding is how confused the public are about who is responsible for what. I believe that a two-tier committee system lends confusion to the public. It also adds duplication and cost to a system in which, quite frankly, the most important thing is to spend the money on protecting people and property rather than on elaborate superstructures of bureaucratic machinery. Therefore, I believe that Amendments Nos. 175 and 176, which suggest that two-tier committees should be retained, present a problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-32_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Before the noble Baroness leaves the matter of flood defence committees&#151;I believe she is intending to move on to the issue of main rivers&#151;perhaps she will comment on whether she would or would not welcome river basin management committees.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-32_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness for reminding me to put that into context. I was intending to do so and am happy to do it now. I believe there is a real dilemma in relation to river basin management committees or river basin <P>


<a name="column_GC129"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>management in the context of the Water Framework Directive and the issue of &quot;localness". The reality is that river basin management under the Water Framework Directive will be at a far larger scale than the current regional flood defence committees. The river catchments will be substantial.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para8"></a>As a result, I believe that issues arise as to how best local people, the public, stakeholders and all other interests will put together their resources in order to deliver satisfactory management of a river basin. That will not be done easily through any committee structure. It will have far more to do with how stakeholders are brought together to develop joint plans and how they are jointly tasked.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para9"></a>If people are worried about single-tier flood defence committees being too large and too remote from local interests, then river basins will be even more so. Therefore, I believe that the Water Framework Directive mechanisms are best taken forward in the way that is currently planned&#151;that is, through piloting to see what the most effective mechanisms might be.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para10"></a>I want to touch on the issue of Amendment No. 176A and the wish of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, to understand how the system would work. Basically, the amendment would remove the ability to take a block-grant approach to the funding of flood defence. Some real inefficiencies and difficulties are associated with that.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para11"></a>At present, some of the local flood defence committees have such tiny budgets that they are almost imperceptible to the naked eye. Indeed, they are so small that the committees must save for a number of years before they can afford to build any type of flood defence scheme worthy of the name. A flood defence committee in Wales had to build a &pound;10 million scheme in &pound;1 million slices. It was only in year 10 that the scheme provided any defence to the public. What can go wrong in a 10-year phased programme is infinite. It certainly cost more than would have been the case had it been built as a single scheme in an efficient and effective way.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para12"></a>Therefore, the idea of block grants, which allow money to be used flexibly both in terms of geography and the split between capital and maintenance spending, is fundamental if flood defences are to be provided in this country. I give an example: seven local flood defence committees have an annual budget of less than &pound;5 million. To be honest, &pound;5 million does not buy a lot of flood defence these days.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We have touched on the point about the Water Framework Directive on many occasions. No doubt, we shall do so again. The directive is fairly wide-ranging and will require major changes over a long period of time. I have indicated what are the boundaries of the Bill. I know that some noble Lords retain the view that we should be transposing the whole Water Framework Directive via the Bill. That is not practical. We should not delay making sensible <P>


<a name="column_GC130"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>modernising changes to the flood defence committees until we consider a structure for the delivery of the requirements of the Water Framework Directive and the river basin management plans. As the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said, they can be substantial. The idea is wrong that they are more local than the current structure or any structure that we envisage.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para13"></a>Therefore, we should separate the argument about the Water Framework Directive from the argument here. When the directive and the river basin management plans come into effect, clearly the flood defence committees will be among the bodies that need to be involved, but involvement will need to be significantly wider than that. In this discussion there has been some misapprehension as to the current structure. As the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said, and picking up the point of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, the Severn Trent area is a single-tier operation. It is for historic reasons, which are not entirely clear to me, that different water board areas have different structures.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para14"></a>The Wessex Water area, with which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, may be familiar, is a two-tier structure. I think that it has three local flood defence communities. That is a much smaller area than that of Severn Trent, so there is no specific reason why it should be two tier and the Severn Trent single tier. Indeed, of the 10 regional committees only four have a secondary tier. We are trying to tidy up this approach and to provide for a single tier generally. That does not necessarily mean that the single tier is the regional tier; the Bill gives power to subdivide the regional structure, but in a single tier, not a double one. That is the point of Clauses 63 and 64. That gives a greater clarity as to who is responsible; at present there is a certain duality of responsibility, as has been said; and the Bill allows us to create new single-tier committees and to remove the current double-tier structure.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 173 and 175 deal with the transition. I can assure the Committee that the existing local flood defence committees will remain in place until such time as they are revoked. The power to create local committees will also remain in the Environment Act 1995. Local committees will obviously be consulted on the new committee structures, so the transition will involve them. The aim of the change in structure is to provide more comprehensive and clear lines of accountability while not losing the ability to include local representation on the committee, as already happens in areas such as Severn Trent.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para16"></a>On Amendment No. 174, the Secretary of State is already required to have due regard to the desirability of appointing members who have experience of, and have shown capacity in, matters relevant to the functions of the committee. We also limit the appointments to persons resident in the area covered by the committee. So there is a restriction in terms of local input, which is bolstered by appointees from local councils who must make up the majority of the committee. Therefore, much of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, already applies.
<P>


<a name="column_GC131"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para17"></a>Regarding minor streams, Amendment No. 176 would make the Environment Agency responsible for every current local authority's ditch, stream and river. The reason for giving the Environment Agency the overall function is that it is responsible for those rivers and waterways which create the greatest flood risk. To give it responsibility for every minor watercourse in the country would divert attention and resources away from the real flood risks. That is not acceptable. While there will be occasions when local authorities have not carried out their functions effectively, most local authorities are able to take action to address local problems. The relationship between them and the Environment Agency needs to allow for that.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para18"></a>Amendment No. 176 in a sense deals with the broadening of the issues. Flood defence committees will definitely be consulted on the wider issues which arise both under the Bill and the Water Framework Directive. Some of these issues are covered by other statutory advisory committees and there is also cross-membership of the respective chairmen. The amendment would blur existing responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="30429-32_para19"></a>Amendment No. 176A, tabled by the noble Lord, Dixon-Smith, deals with money. As has been explained, the new system will move from the existing system to a flexible block grant system under Section 47 of the Environment Act 1995. We cannot do that with the co-existence of the 1991 Act provisions, so the Bill will revoke them. The current 1991 provisions require individual schemes to be approved by DEFRA. That is inflexible. The new approach to funding provides for greater flexibility. Block grants represent a major opportunity to streamline existing arrangements and to provide more certainty of funding for the agency in the medium term. Generally speaking, that shift was widely welcomed during the consultation. The formulation of the clauses perhaps does not make that clear, but that is the intention and the reason why we need to revoke those sections in the 1991 Act. I hope that that clarifies to the noble Lord what lies behind that part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am grateful for that. I infer from what the Minister said about Amendment No. 174 that the membership of the flood defence committees remains as established under the existing Environment Act which deals with the composition of regional flood defence committees. That is therefore staying in place.
<P>

<a name="30429-33_para0"></a>I am grateful for the Minister's comments on Amendment No. 176A. I am glad to hear that DEFRA will make a block grant to the Environment Agency; that that will become a block grant to the flood defence committee; and that hopefully everyone will be able to get on with the process without future interference.
<P>

<a name="30429-33_para1"></a>There was a subset to my question which I did not really go into, which I should perhaps pursue. Under Clause 65(2)(4) there appears to be a possibility that expenditure might be shifted unreasonably down to the individual. It states:
<P>
<br>

<a name="column_GC132"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
That is fine. However, if one happens to be a riparian owner upstream of a town that is liable to flood, of course there is much that one could do, but what might be required to be done may actually be rather more than one could possibly do as an individual. But it could be argued that because someone is a riparian owner or a group of riparian owners upstream that the liability was properly theirs. I wondered whether there was a possible attempt to transfer a liability, which up until now had been accepted by the taxpayer, back to the individuals&#151;because of the circumstances in which they find themselves.
<P>

<a name="30429-33_para3"></a>It may be that I have a nasty suspicious mind, but I should be grateful if the Minister would address that specific issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I hate to say that the noble Lord has a nasty suspicious mind&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   An inquiring mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: &quot;</B>An inquiring mind" is perhaps a better reference. No liability is shifted as a result of that. Of course, there is already some responsibility on the upstream riparian owner. However, Clause 65 requires agreement, so there is no way in which it could be imposed in the circumstances described by the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I shall sum up with regard to Amendments No. 173, 175 and 176 and comment on Amendment No. 174. Although I have sympathy with Amendment No. 174, it is not strong enough. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State shall have regard to the desirability".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-33_para4"></a>
I think that it is absolutely essential and not only desirable that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"persons who have knowledge and experience of flood defence in the local areas of those committees",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-33_para5"></a>
are appointed. It is essential; that is very important.
<P>

<a name="30429-33_para6"></a>I understand what the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Young, have said about local flood defence committees. I merely make the point that perhaps some of the local flood defence committees' problems may relate to centralised financial control and limits imposed on them. That is why it takes them 10 years to implement a flood defence scheme. I think that the jury is out on the question as to whether the position will be any better under the Bill and the reorganisation that will take place. I hope and trust that the new committees will not spend their money, especially initially, on grandiose buildings and neglect the essential flood defences that must be provided.
<P>

<a name="30429-33_para7"></a>I turn to the Severn Trent situation and the remark of the noble Baroness, Lady Young. I know that the Environment Agency has done a great deal of good work up and down the country and I do not want to criticise it and take it too much to task. However, if one talks to the residents of Shrewsbury, parts of Worcestershire and the City of Gloucester, they might not necessarily agree that the Severn Trent body has <P>


<a name="column_GC133"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been entirely successful, although I know that it has spent a huge amount of money on trying to do something about the situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way. In defence of the Severn Trent committee, I must say that many of the problems described by the noble Lord in Shrewsbury are a product of national policy on what is and what is not fundable for flood defence rather than the local actions of the committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   That is an interesting remark. Why that matter is not addressed in the Bill in more detail raises many questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   The response from the noble Baroness, Lady Young, highlights some of the problems we face. There is never enough money to do what we want to do. We are discussing flood defences. At present we are discussing rivers, but if we consider what is happening in East Anglia, which my noble friend mentioned earlier today&#151;I was in Suffolk last week&#151;it appears likely that the sea may encroach around Southwold and make it an island. The Government's decision is not to put in money to defend that at the moment; we are undertaking natural retreat because there is not enough money. So the amendments have raised issues that need to be debated. I return to what I said before: if we do not take the chance with a Bill such as this to raise these issues, we do not get another chance. The noble Baroness has touched on something that is highly pertinent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   The Minister has referred to some other issues. In particular, he said that the Environment Agency is not able to take over responsibility for the minor streams that feed into rivers. However, it is those minor streams that swell the rivers and cause much of the flooding. When a main river is in full flood, those streams are very often blocked up into the countryside and consequently flood much of the land. I do not believe that local authorities have the finance, the workforce or sometimes the equipment to deal with such situations. I therefore fear that the problem will continue in those areas. I sincerely hope that this Bill is not another exercise in megalomania whereby responsibilities are brought to the centre while services deteriorate at the grass roots. That is my fear. As far as I am concerned, the jury is still out. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30429-33_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth </B>   moved Amendment No. 177:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 68, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-33_para22"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;FRESHWATER FISHERIES
<br>
 The Agency shall have the power to promote the development of ecologically sustainable fresh water fisheries."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-33_para23"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall try to be brief. I declare an interest as a lifelong fisherman, having started at the age of five. I know from experience that despite the very good work which has been done, the quality of water is still not as good as it might be. Although the Environment Agency already has powers in this respect, I seek in this amendment to ensure that it has,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the power to promote . . . ecologically sustainable fresh water fisheries".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-33_para24"></a>
Those are the crucial words.
<P>

<a name="30429-33_para25"></a>As we know, there are more than 3 million anglers in this country. I believe that many of them serve as an early warning system for the environment. They are the first to see things happening and are the pathfinders in identifying environmental deterioration. They are, for example, often the first to see fish killed by pollution in the water.
<P>

<a name="30429-33_para26"></a>I shall give one example to demonstrate the importance of these issues. As I say in a later amendment, water-quality monitoring is crucial. In the area where I was brought up, there was a magical mayfly hatch every year, lasting for a fortnight in May. In May 1956, while I was doing my national service, I came home but saw not one mayfly. The reason was that Aldrin and Dieldrin sheep dips had been introduced and found their way into the river, which has never been the same since. Those pesticides were replaced by organophosphates and have now been replaced by pyrethroids, which are absolutely fatal to river ecology. This problem has to be sorted out.
<P>

<a name="30429-33_para27"></a>Long ago, I worked in the agrichemical industry. There is sufficient research and development to produce products that will not wreak such havoc on our aquatic environment. That needs to be pushed further. Regardless of whether they come from industry or elsewhere, some of the chemicals are an ecological disaster for some streams. Fish cannot live in them. Life cannot survive in some streams because of the chemicals. In fact, some drinking water is contaminated by them.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-33_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I rise briefly to support the thoughts behind Amendment No. 177. Although I suspect that the Minister will tell us that the amendment is not necessary, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, has raised an important issue. He has highlighted the fact that fishermen are often the first to detect that the water quality of streams and rivers is failing. Regardless of whether the amendment is necessary, it has been worth while for the Committee to hear those comments. I await the Minister's response with interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am not unsympathetic to the points made in the amendment. The Government have already recognised the need for new legislation on freshwater fisheries. Indeed, just before the recess, we had a fairly lengthy debate on salmon fisheries in which the noble Lord participated. Amendment No. 177 does not sufficiently enhance the agency's responsibilities and powers to enable it to take full responsibility for the development of those fisheries. However, it already has considerable powers.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para0"></a>The Government are already committed to bringing forward new legislation on salmon and freshwater fisheries. That draft legislation is relatively well advanced. Although we could have the usual discussion about parliamentary time, the preparation for that legislation is already well advanced. I think that it would be better to deal with fisheries in that comprehensive manner rather than to tag on to the Bill a rather limited provision which would not deliver everything that I know the noble Lord seeks. I therefore cannot accept the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   The Minister said that draft legislation is being drafted. Will it be presented as a statutory instrument or as a Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I think that it will probably be in the form of a Bill. However, it will be preceded by consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   When English Nature determines that a river system is sufficiently important to be designated as a site of special scientific interest, presumably it will have responsibility for the fisheries that it contains. So presumably the problem that the noble Lord identifies would occur only outside such designated sites. I would be interested to know whether that is the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Although the noble Earl is right to draw attention to the role of English Nature, that role is exercised in relation to a fairly limited part of the waterways. I assume that the amendment would apply to the totality of the waterways, and that the noble Lord seeks to include it in this part of the Bill so that it is included with the Environment Agency's other responsibilities. It would therefore become another dimension of the Environment Agency's own <P>


<a name="column_GC136"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibilities. I think that that is slightly different from a situation in which English Nature is dealing with the totality of the management of a particular site.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para1"></a>English Nature has certain particular powers, including the power of prohibition by means of by-laws which the amendment does not propose giving to the Environment Agency. Nor is it envisaged, at least in our early consideration, to provide that in our general legislation on freshwater fisheries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   I have one short observation on the amendment&#151;to which I am not in any sense hostile. We talk quite widely in these debates about the possibility of the Environment Agency taking on new and fresh responsibilities. While I am not opposed to that, I think that the agency's capacity and staff numbers will have to be enlarged if it is to discharge those responsibilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   This has been a short and very useful debate. I think that the remarks just made are apposite. It is quite clear that the Environment Agency has not had the resources that it would have liked. The agency's budget has been substantially improved, but it needs to go several quantum leaps further so that the agency can do its job properly. Amendment No. 177 simply asks for the promotion and development of ecologically sustainable freshwater fisheries. Enforcement and perhaps penalties for those who pollute are one aspect of the matter&#151;but we will come to that later.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para2"></a>I am particularly glad to hear the Minister say that there will be a Bill to address these fisheries issues. I most warmly welcome his statement on that. We look forward to seeing that Bill and how it will knit in with certain aspects of this legislation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 178:
<P>
<br>

<a name="30429-34_para6"></a><P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-34_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 178 seeks to explore the interpretation of the Reservoirs Act 1975, which was designed primarily to address the issues surrounding permanent water storage reservoirs, especially safety. We believe that it is beginning to be interpreted to apply to some short-term, temporary storage facilities such as temporary sludge storage lagoons where water may be stored for a matter of days during winter rains. Reservoirs of less than 25,000 square cubic metres are exempt under the Act. Although such an exclusion is reasonable in terms of drinking water storage, in terms of flood storage it is a minute amount of water. If we are seeking to ensure that landowners and particularly farmers are able to store flood water for later use in irrigation&#151;<P>


<a name="column_GC137"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which is a very sensible use of that water&#151;I do not think that it would be desirable to create a lot of unnecessary red tape. The amendment explores what is and is not included as a reservoir under the terms of the 1975 Act.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para8"></a>I tabled Amendment No. 179 to explore whether the Secretary of State will make known to other parties that he is serving the written notice. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 179A, which is grouped with the amendments to which the noble Baroness spoke.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para9"></a>Clause 72 refers to the ability of the Secretary of State to require reservoir undertakers to create flood plans for any reservoir. The implications of that are fairly obvious, in that it may be decided that all reservoirs should have a flood plan in place, regardless of size or the risk that they represent. I appreciate the need for flood plans&#151;I do not think that anyone would dispute it&#151;but I urge the Government to ensure that the details requested in the plan are proportionate to the significance of the risk of a particular reservoir.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para10"></a>The Reservoirs Act 1975 lays down a series of requirements such as registration, construction and enlargement of and inspection for large, raised reservoirs; other reservoirs are not covered by those requirements. It is surely unnecessary for all reservoirs to be covered by the clause, given the distinction between all reservoirs and &quot;large, raised" reservoirs referred to in the 1975 Act.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para11"></a>The amendment would ensure consistency between the Water Bill and the 1975 Act. That Act refers to &quot;large, raised" reservoirs, determined as retaining more than 25,000 cubic metres. I should have thought that it was necessary to provide consistency and clarity in spelling out that Clause 72 is intended for &quot;large, raised" reservoirs. It is clearly unnecessary to create a flood plan when there is no risk of flooding, such as when the reservoir is contained within the water table. It would be inconsistent to require reservoir owners who are not regulated in any other way to undergo unnecessary costs and bureaucracy in producing a flood plan.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para12"></a>Large, raised reservoirs are regulated under the 1975 Act, as they pose a significant risk when built above ground and impound water, and stand the risk of water suddenly escaping, which could create significant damage. However, reservoirs that are not raised do not impound water and are, for all intents and purposes, holes in the ground. They do not have the same risk attached, as the water cannot suddenly gush out because it is not impounded. In other words, it is part of the water table. The only risk accruing would be with a potential overflow of water due to heavy rain; the extra water caused by the heavy rain might overflow into the local surrounding countryside, but the actual water that was originally in the ground-level reservoir would of course remain there.
<P>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para13"></a>I hope that the Minister acknowledges that, as the Bill stands, there is a possibility of unnecessary demands being imposed in the form of flood plans, in cases where such plans are unnecessary. That question needs to be addressed. It is important to encourage the use of reservoirs as a means of collecting water at times when there is a good supply of rain and then using that water wisely. I fear that the additional regulations and costs may discourage users from taking such action, which would be a retrograde step.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-34_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I support the amendments, because to my certain knowledge there is one reservoir, which is not so far from where I live, which has a capacity of some 250,000 cubic metres, but the water is all below the existing ground level. It was created as a result of a fortuitous gravel extraction&#151;that does happen&#151;and was subsequently filled. It is well used for irrigation and is a wonderful nature reserve, serving everyone very well. There is a town within three quarters of a mile, but no one in the town is in the least bit worried about it because the water cannot run away. There is nowhere for it to go, as the river is right beside it and the bottom of the reservoir is way below the bottom of the river.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para14"></a>That is one situation that springs to mind. My own reservoir was built with an excavation, after which a ring was put around it with the stuff that was excavated. That is another way of doing it. It is in a flat location and, even though we are above the 25,000 metres, if the bank were to burst I do not believe that it would even flood my neighbour. It would cause me&#151;and him&#151;a great deal of vexation because it would flood our fields, but I do not believe that it would flood our houses. In that sense, it would be all right, and I have no doubt that my insurance company would smile sweetly and bite the bitter bullet and pay the consequential damages to the crops&#151;but that would be the extent of the damage.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para15"></a>Other circumstances are possible, of course. For example, there might be an impounding reservoir in a steep, narrow valley above a small village. That was the background to the original reservoirs legislation, when in unfortunate circumstances&#151;I think in Wales&#151;one or two villages were flooded out by reservoirs that were not perhaps as well built as they might have been or might have lasted longer than they should have done. I do not know the exact circumstances. That is going right back to an Act of the 1930s. In such a situation, a reservoir might be quite small&#151;way below the 25,000 cubic metres capacity&#151;but could still do considerable damage.
<P>

<a name="30429-34_para16"></a>One needs to have a slightly empirical approach, because simply proposing that a large reservoir might be a risk and should have a flood plan when a small reservoir should not, might not meet every circumstance. It depends so much on the terrain. A large volume of water in a large flat area is not a big problem, while a small volume of water in a narrow, tightly defined rocky valley can be a huge problem. Care must be taken in this matter.

<a name="30429-34_para17"></a>My sympathies are with the sentiments behind the amendments. We have discussed on many occasions in debating the Bill the need to encourage water conservation for all sorts of purposes. If we simply add to the administrative burden, the people who might otherwise take steps that would help in conservation will be less inclined to do so.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The bulk of the amendments and the clause to which they refer relate to the disapplication of the Reservoirs Act 1975. That Act applies to reservoirs that hold or are capable of holding 25,000 cubic metres above the natural water level, so it would not apply to reservoirs below the water level and the question of disapplication would not arise. For flood prevention and water management purposes, some of the other provisions of the Act apply to all the other reservoirs, but they do not apply in this respect.
<P>

<a name="30429-35_para0"></a>It is also true that some of the reservoirs above the water line may not be capable of carrying the level of water for which they were designed, owing to various changes such as siltation, or may not present a serious safety risk. The current provision means that reservoir panel engineers operate a system that considers the sites on the basis of quantified risk assessment. That would meet the purposes of Amendment No. 178, as reservoirs could be classified according to risk assessment rather than size. However, we are some way off the possibility of doing that across the board at present, so exceptions should be on an ad hoc basis rather than total disapplication. Although we understand some of the arguments behind that amendment, it would not be appropriate in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-35_para1"></a>Amendment No. 179 deals with consultation in relation to the part of the Reservoirs Act that relates to national security. In all other respects, any action to constrain the applications of the Act would be subject to consultation, but when we are dealing with an issue of national security, the clause would mean that consultation would necessarily have to take place. We do not have to spell out why we are more concerned about national security in relation to water supplies than we were when the previous legislation was made. In those circumstances, it would be inappropriate to insert a reference to consultation.
<P>

<a name="30429-35_para2"></a>I have some sympathy with Amendment No. 179A, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Peel. He said that we should make it clear that the new section applied only to large, raised reservoirs. That requires some consultation, and I shall take it away for further consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-35_spnew1"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I declare an interest as someone who owns a reservoir. The Minister referred to the panel of engineers being able to quantify the risk element. Was he saying that the risk should be codified, and that it is not sufficiently codified at the moment to form a basis for considering which reservoirs are risky?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Yes, that is what I am saying. The distinction is currently made on the basis of size&#151;by the cut-off point of 25,000 cubic metres&#151;whereas it would be more logical to make a risk assessment of <P>


<a name="column_GC140"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>every large, raised reservoir. However, that takes time and we have not yet developed a system by which we can categorise reservoirs in that way. The intention is to move down that road, but it would be premature to put a reference in that respect in the Bill because we lack the technique to do it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-35_spnew3"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   Under the Reservoirs Act, there is a requirement to have an engineers' inspection of reservoirs at regular intervals. In the inspection, the engineer codifies the risk, so presumably that is available under the inspection of each reservoir that currently exists.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The assessment of the risk is done in the traditional sense, in that engineers consider whether there is any problem with a particular reservoir. There is no national scale of risk assessment, whereby one could say that anything below a certain level can be excluded from this part of the Bill. We are working on a prototype approach of risk assessment, and we hope to produce something similar to what is envisaged by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, but we are not yet at that stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-35_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I should like&#151;

<P>

<P>

<a name="30429-35_para3"></a>I thank the Minister for clarifying why there would be no consultation or publicity, as proposed in Amendment No. 179.
<P>

<a name="30429-35_para4"></a>In the Minister's comments on Amendment No. 178, I understand him to be saying, &quot;Yes, that is a good idea, but not just yet". The Minister looks doubtful as to whether he agrees, but I believe that he does. I am still surprised by that response, given that under many circumstances common sense alone would allow it to be said that a reservoir posed a very negligible risk. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, described some of those circumstances. That is why I phrased my amendment as I did. A large but very shallow body of water, for the purposes that I outlined in my introduction, is unlikely to pose the sort of risk envisaged by the Reservoirs Act. I shall read his reply with interest and, perhaps, press him a little further on Report on what timescale the Government will need to arrive at a conclusion. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 87, line 8, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-35_para13"></a><P>

<a name="30429-35_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 179B, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 179C. The purpose of the amendments is to get from the Minister some information on exactly the sort of person who, he feels, will have created an offence.
<P>

<a name="30429-35_para15"></a>The subsection creates an offence, by now commonplace, the penalty for which is often topped up with a fine or imprisonment for two years or both. The offence is the publication of a reservoir plan or giving an unauthorised person access to it, after the Secretary of State has decided that publication is a national security matter. I accept what the Minister said in response to an earlier amendment, but will he tell us which employee of the water undertaker would be confined? Would it be, for example, the chairman or the chief executive? Who would be affected by this section. If a fine is imposed, it could be imposed on the body concerned, but if the penalty is imprisonment, who is likely to be taken to prison?
<P>

<a name="30429-35_para16"></a>There are only 17 water undertakers, of which five are responsible for more than 80 per cent of our water resources management. National security is vital and should be maintained. However, if anyone publishes when they should not, it could be due to human error or deliberate intent. The former does not merit huge fines or imprisonment, while the latter deserves more than two years. I seek clarification of that issue.
<P>

<a name="30429-35_para17"></a>Amendment No. 179C is a probing amendment. Where does the certificate mentioned in line 30 originate from? Is it something that already exists&#151;for example in a health and safety risk assessment that the Secretary of State is about to overrule&#151;or is it, as the section seems to imply, something produced in order to ensure that the power specified in the certificate cannot be used? The section should have a little more explanation in it, or it will make little sense. Perhaps, we are just getting tired at the end of the Committee stage. As so often with the Bill, the Explanatory Notes are not particularly helpful on the issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-35_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Clause 74(3) makes it an offence for an undertaker to fail to comply with a notice under new Section 12B. That has to do with national security, as the noble Baroness recognised. Constraints on publication or failure to publish could create a national security risk, and failure to comply with a notice under the provision could be a serious offence.
<P>

<a name="30429-35_para18"></a>Who commits the offence? The companies and their employees commit the offence, as with other offences under health and safety legislation and so forth. It would be appropriate that an individual could be subject to a fine or, on indictment for a more serious matter, to imprisonment. The company could be subject to a fine. It is important to recognise that that applies only to the circumstances relating to national security, as set out in the clause. We must ensure that we have the powers.

<P>

<a name="30429-35_para19"></a>In speaking to Amendment No. 179C, the noble Baroness asked who issued the certificate. The certificate referred to is issued by the Secretary of State. The provision will enable the enforcement authority to check, for example, whether a reservoir should be subject to the requirements of the Act, whether safety recommendations have been put into effect or whether any emergency action is necessary. As part of that process, reference to the certificate may be necessary. I hope that that is sufficient clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-35_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister, although I do not know whether it is sufficient. I will read what he said on the second amendment.
<P>

<a name="30429-35_para20"></a>With regard to the first amendment, I did say that the provisions related to national security. I accept the Minister's response on that. I also accept that, if a fine were imposed, it would be paid by the company. I did not discover who would be sent to prison. Unless I missed it, the Minister did not answer that question to my satisfaction. The Minister may want to come back to me on it at a later stage, and I would be happy with that. A company can be fined, but how do we decide which individual is the person likely to be sent to prison? It is beyond my comprehension.

Either the decision was in line with a decision of the directors, in which case the board is responsible, or it was taken outwith any instructions from the board by an individual employee, in which case it would be that individual employee.
<P>

<a name="30429-36_para0"></a>The second amendment relates to the issue of Crown exemptions. The provision relates to how, given the peculiar circumstances of the Crown and the possible very peculiar circumstances of Crown property in a national security context, such property can, in most circumstances, be made to comply with the rest of the regulations. The certification is to cover a situation in which there might be an exception.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister again, but I am still not entirely happy with his response on who would be likely to go to prison. It could be an individual who has failed to do whatever they should have done or done something that they should not. If something is done at the direction of, say, the board, does the whole board go to prison?
<P>

<a name="30429-36_para1"></a>I have raised the issue, and I would be grateful if it could be given a little more thought. Perhaps, the Minister could write to me and we could consider the matter a little further. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 180:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 88, line 20, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-36_para8"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;( ) The Secretary of State shall require appliances using water to be labelled so as to be clear to the purchaser the volume of water they may expect the appliance to require in order to fulfil the purpose for which it is purchased."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-36_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is aimed at exploring what the Government expect to be done with regard to the labelling of water use by appliances. I was pleased at the steps that they took recently with regard to the labelling of electrical appliances and cars. I remind the Government that, in Directing the Flow, they said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are putting more weight on improving product information on water consumption for consumers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-36_para10"></a>
I would have hoped that the Government might have considered a clear labelling scheme of the sort brought forward&#151;albeit with a lot of encouragement from Europe, as the move did not start nationally&#151;for the labelling of electrical appliances.
<P>

<a name="30429-36_para11"></a>I am sure that I need not remind the Minister of the useful statement that he made. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"What is needed is to make it easier for consumers and citizens to make the positive choices they now know they should make. That includes issues such as product specification, low energy household products and better labelling of all consumer goods, so that we can make the minimal energy use choice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-36_para12"></a>
We are discussing water. Water use choices are equally important, and it often takes a lot of energy to produce clean drinking water.
<P>

<a name="30429-36_para13"></a>My amendment is necessary to highlight the fact that water appliances have been left out of the considerations on labelling of water use. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of products such as power hoses. They may make washing the car easier, but I suspect that whereas people used to use a bucket or two, with a power hose they will use&#151;I guess, for I do not own one&#151;about 20 to 40 buckets full. I must declare that I own a power shower. The Minister is right to shake his head; it is reprehensible. I must take it out and get a dribbling shower back in. We should know what sort of water consumption choices we are making. I have not heard the Government mention that, so this probing amendment seeks to explore what action they are taking. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, spoke about power showers during our previous day in Committee, before the Easter recess. I was appalled, as I use a power shower daily. This morning, I thought to myself that I would do an experiment, so I put the stopper in the bath, while I used the power shower, to see how much water it used. I washed my hair and had a good shower, and there was no more than two inches of water in the bath. Power shower may be a misnomer.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-36_para14"></a>Someone using a dribble shower will have it on for about 20 minutes, whereas a power shower need be on for only three or four minutes. We should not exaggerate to make the point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am fascinated by these ablutionary details, but I shall not get into the subject. The matter is not covered in any other legislation, and there is a serious point that is worth supporting.
<P>

<a name="30429-36_para15"></a>What we might call the &quot;white goods industry"&#151;those who produce washing machines, dishwashers and so on&#151;are used, nowadays, to having to put on the label the energy requirement. This is a minor extension of that principle and would be worthwhile. A machine that uses five gallons of water, as opposed to six, to do the washing-up or to do a batch of washing is to be commended, provided it still gives things a good clean. Having to put that information on the label of the machine would be a considerable incentive to people to use water more responsibly. We support the proposal in principle, and I hope that the Minister will do so too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I have some sympathy for the amendment, which would introduce the labelling of products to indicate water efficiency. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, said, product labelling policy is well established in the energy sector as one element of the integrated product policy approach. As a matter of fact, there is a marked correlation in many cases&#151;most cases, but not all&#151;between the energy efficiency and the water consumption. There is a compatibility issue there.
<P>

<a name="30429-36_para16"></a>Since 1992, the regulations, which noble Lords welcomed, have resulted in the appearance of the A to G appliance labels in shops. The labels offer details about washing machines and dishwashers. Of course, the most effective way of conserving water is not to have a dishwasher. I confess to being absolutely marvellous, as I do not clean my car. I had never thought of it as a good reason.
<P>

<a name="30429-36_para17"></a>In 2001, the market transformation programme was extended to include domestic water-using products. The programme is consulting on a range of policy options, including product labelling, that could achieve and help to deliver the resource efficiency that the noble Baroness seeks. However, the cost/benefit and technical and legal feasibility of introducing a mandatory labelling scheme for water-using projects have yet to be established. I know that the noble Baroness will understand that, because of the implications for trade, it may be necessary to pursue that through the EU, as opposed to in one country. There is clear potential for environmental product information in general and labelling in particular, and we shall actively encourage the development and provision of reliable consumer information on the water efficiency of products, including labelling, via voluntary schemes in the first instance. As I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, could confirm, in areas where water is metered, customers will demand that information from producers.

<a name="30429-36_para18"></a>When we have undergone that process, it will enable us to establish the need for mandatory measures and put us in a good position to press for, not respond to, action by the EU, if necessary. I hope that that reassurance will encourage the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the Minister about water-efficient products. I understood her to say that details about them would be collected and made available.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   The idea would be to encourage manufacturers to provide the information through a voluntary scheme and see how effective that was. Running alongside that would be the cost/benefit and technical feasibility study. After that, we should be in a better position, if it was felt necessary at that point, to press for the EU to take up the issue, because of its trade implications.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   Perhaps I can help the noble Baroness. Instead of not washing her car, she could have it Teflon-ed. Then, she needs only to put two buckets of water on it a week. That is what I have done. I used to use a hose on my car. One can now get one's car Teflon-ed&#151;it costs about &pound;400, but it saves all that water.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I have a cheaper option. When I sell the car, I wash it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-36_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Members of the Committee who took part in the debate, whether to discuss showering habits or Ministers' ability to use Teflon to good effect. It was a useful debate and I thank the Minister for her encouraging words. I hope that manufacturers will be encouraged to take further steps themselves in labelling goods. I certainly undertake to test both my consumption and that of teenagers, which is much more relevant to showering in my household, by comparing a power shower with one when the power is switched off. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30429-37_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 180A:
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 76, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-37_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;GENERAL INTERPRETATION: DISCRETE WATERS

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-37_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a quick amendment to probe the Government on the meaning of &quot;discrete waters". An occasional body of water, such as a dew pond, has neither an obvious way of feeding in or <P>


<a name="column_GC146"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>feeding out. Would it fall within the definition of &quot;discrete water"? I would welcome the Minister's comments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In using the term &quot;discrete waters" in this context, we are not trying to exempt all discrete waters by including all waters that do not flow into a wider system. We are not necessarily seeking to exempt all of those. Discrete waters are either single reservoirs or ponds and lakes that have no outlet or are a series of interconnected lakes that have outlets to each other but not to any other inland waterways separate from that group of lakes. There may be scope under the Water Framework Directive and so on to exclude them not only from the abstraction controls but from other controls.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para2"></a>The noble Baroness's amendment, which would bring them into abstraction regimes and provide an exception that way, would not necessarily provide the kind of desired outcomes for the particular ecological systems that might develop in such discrete waters. However, DEFRA and the Environment Agency are considering the way in which we treat such ponds and lakes and how we might exempt them from some of the other controls under this Bill and other legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-37_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Minister for his explanation. It was useful, and, in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-37_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30429-37_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 181, I shall speak to the other amendments in the group.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para7"></a>Amendment No. 181 is a purely technical amendment. Early drafts of the Bill reserve the ability of the Secretary of State to determine by regulation additional powers for the Coal Authority in relation to entry onto premises affected by or at risk of being affected by mine water discharges.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para8"></a>Prior to introduction, we took the view that the range of powers explicitly set out in the Bill was sufficient, and the power to confer others was excised. The provisions relating to the manner in which the regulation-making powers may be exercised has been rendered obsolete, and the amendment would clarify that.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para9"></a>Amendment No. 185B is a substantial amendment. It will revise Schedule 6 to the Water Resources Act 1991 to account for the fact that only the Environment Agency would be able to apply for orders to change thresholds under new Section 27A and to establish registers of protected rights. The amendment, which is quite lengthy, will replace the previous Schedule 6 to the Water Resources Act.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para10"></a>Amendment No. 185A makes it clear that, when the Secretary of State intervenes because the exercise of some functions by the National Assembly for Wales might have serious environmental effects in England, that intervention must be made in order to make <P>


<a name="column_GC147"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>changes to the small exemption threshold but must not relate to orders relating to registers of protected rights in the wider sense. It is a clarification, rather than a substantive issue.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para11"></a>Amendments Nos. 189, 190 and 191 give effect to the recommendations of the report of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform on the Bill. The committee recommended that a statutory instrument that amended or repealed primary legislation should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, rather than the negative. We signalled, at Second Reading, that we accepted the committee's recommendations. The amendments give effect to the recommendations. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Perhaps I may ask a question on Amendment No. 185B, which produces new Schedule 6. Paragraph (4) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Not later than the date on which the notice is first published in pursuance of sub-paragraph (2) above"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-37_para12"></a>
we must bear in mind that this is a notice about abstraction of small quantities of water and compulsory registration of protected rights&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Agency shall serve a copy of the notice on&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-37_para13"></a>
almost everyone who has an interest in water. However, a significant category is left out; that is, any person holding an abstraction licence. I found myself wondering why that was and whether it should be included. Will the Minister be very kind and undertake to do so?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-37_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As far as I am aware, while this part of the amendment limits the requirement to the Environment Agency, it does not alter the timetable for having to serve notice or the number of people to whom notice is served. It does, of course, require the Environment Agency, in so doing, effectively to publish the notice, and therefore anyone who was affected by it would have access to it. I can confirm that we are using the existing schedule formulations on this. Whether the noble Lord will find that a satisfactory answer, I am not entirely sure. But we are not changing anything in that part of the amendment, and there is access to the information.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-37_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am slightly pleased to hear that the amendment is not changing anything, but the fact remains that there seems to be a significant omission. If we are not changing anything, this at the very least gives us an opportunity to change something if it ought to be changed. I have not really heard the Minister give a reason why holders of abstraction licences should be excluded. Let us look at who is included&#151;every local authority, joint planning board, national park authority, any relevant water undertaker, internal drainage board and navigation authority. These are all bodies that have interests in water. The other classification of people who have interests in water are those who hold abstraction licences, yet they are specifically excluded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-37_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I think we should welcome the first of the government amendments giving up the power to make regulations. We often complain that they take too many powers to make regulations, so I welcome their voluntary relinquishing of that one.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para16"></a>I see that our old friend the London Gazette appears copiously in the Government's next amendment, and the horrible thought occurs to me that there must be many people whose job is simply to read the London Gazette and see what happens in it. I sympathise with them.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para17"></a>My serious point about that amendment is that Bills are helpfully accompanied by Explanatory Notes. However, when the Government table amendments such as this later, we do not get Explanatory Notes at the same time, and it might help if we did.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-37_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We quite frequently try and explain why we are tabling amendments and notify at least the spokespeople. But in this respect we are simply replacing the existing schedule in another Bill with effectively the same words. I think the distinction is that there is a two-stage consultation process in that the bodies specified here, which have statutory duties in relation to water, are consulted on the draft. The proposal is then published and there is wider engagement at that point. However, rather than simply taking my word for it that we were not changing anything and that the old recommendations including the almost exclusive use of the London Gazette remain appropriate, as they were in 1991, I had better write to noble Lords and explain how we envisage this process operating. If some changes to the amendment would be appropriate, I will include those <P>


<a name="column_GC149"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>and bring them forward at a later stage. We need to take account of what people have said in the last few minutes.

<A NAME="30429-37_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith </B>   moved Amendment No. 181A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 91, leave out lines 18 to 24.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-37_para19"></a><P>

<a name="30429-37_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: The Explanatory Notes state that Clause 78 provides powers to prevent or treat water pollution from abandoned coal mines. Subsection (8), which the amendment would remove, does not appear to have anything to do with preventing water pollution or treating water so as to prevent that pollution; it has to do with land ownership. In fact, it is even more peculiar than that. It gives the Coal Authority the power compulsorily to purchase private land to replace common land which might be so used and even open space. The provision even mentions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"fuel or field garden allotment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-37_para21"></a>
I have tried to understand why the word &quot;fuel" has been included in the provision but I cannot. Its inclusion is sufficient reason to move this amendment; and the same applies to garden allotments.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para22"></a>I am not sure that we are not in danger of establishing almost a new principle&#151;that common land and open space are sacrosanct to the extent that they are superior and have rights over private land. It would be exceedingly dangerous if that were accepted. At the very least, that particular subsection should not be in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para23"></a>The Question on clause stand part is grouped with this amendment. As I understand it, the clause provides new powers for the Coal Authority to operate its programme of works to rectify actual or potential environmental damage caused by coal mine waters. Those powers include the ability to enter land, to carry out investigations into pollution, and also to be able compulsorily to acquire land where pollution from an abandoned coal mine exists. We do not really understand why the compulsory powers are needed.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para24"></a>At present, as we understand it, there is a memorandum of understanding between the Coal Authority and the Environment Agency covering the management of such matters. To the best of our knowledge, that works. It may be interesting to hear whether it has not worked&#151;we may have that opportunity. To the best of our knowledge, however, the arrangements have worked satisfactorily. We are therefore unconvinced of the need for this statutory framework.
<P>

<a name="30429-37_para25"></a>I should be interested to hear from the Minister why it has been suddenly decided that these additional powers for the Coal Authority are deemed necessary. <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I should like briefly to speak against the amendment and support the Coal Authority having these additional powers. The Coal Authority is an excellent organisation which is doing an extremely important environmental job in preventing pollution breaking out from abandoned mines. I know that it works because its work is well known. It works primarily on a voluntary basis with landowners and often acquires land at full commercial rates, which is the preferable way forward.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para0"></a>Sometimes, however, those negotiations can be lengthy&#151;when the water is rising and threatening to break out of the mine. Sometimes there is only one spot on which the requisite borehole or treatment facility can be placed but the landowner is unwilling to sell. It is vital that the Coal Authority can move quickly. I should therefore be loath to see the provision lost from the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-38_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, mine water is one of the major polluters of rivers in coal field areas. An estimated 400 kilometres of rivers in England and Wales are affected by it. Persons who knowingly permit discharges from mines abandoned prior to January 2000 are exempt from statutory liability under the Water Resources Act 1991. It is almost invariably in respect of mines abandoned before that date that the Coal Authority acts to prevent or treat discharges. It does so on the basis of assurances given during the passage of the Coal Industry Act 1994 to the effect that the Authority would be expected,

<a name="30429-38_para2"></a>The authority has subsequently implemented 19 mine water treatment schemes in England and Wales, saving over 50 kilometres of waterways from mine water pollution.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para3"></a>The authority already has power to acquire land by agreement. In most cases that is sufficient but, regrettably, not always. It has in the past met with intransigent landowners who have demanded exorbitant prices for their land. Either it has reluctantly paid or it has been forced to abandon its plans or consider less effective ways to control or treat a discharge. It is not desirable to be in that position, whether in terms of efficient use of public resources or effective pollution control.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para4"></a>In the absence of the authority, were the Environment Agency to step in to treat such discharges, it would have been able to employ powers of entry or compulsory purchase were that necessary to achieve efficient and cost-effective treatment. The clause recognises that the Coal Authority is simply doing what the agency would otherwise be obliged to do. The powers are based closely upon those already available to the agency, but every effort has been made to limit them to reflect the authority's more restricted role.

<P>

<a name="30429-38_para5"></a>The deletion of one aspect of those powers would not be acceptable. As drafted, Clause 78 would allow the authority compulsorily to purchase land not for mine water treatment but for the purpose of subsequently trading that land for other land that has special protected status under the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. The Act requires that special parliamentary procedures must be followed unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is appropriate to authorise and certify the purchase of such special land, which includes common land and open spaces. One ground for certification is a demonstration that there will be given, in exchange for special land, other land equally advantageous to those who enjoy rights. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, referred to that point. However, the whole certification process sets the bar for successful exchange very high indeed, as the Secretary of State must be satisfied that a number of stringent conditions have been met.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para6"></a>We understand the concerns that have been expressed but believe that it is proper for the provisions that are the subject of this amendment to remain in place. However, I can give a categorical assurance that the authority, as a responsible public body, would seek to utilise any of these powers only as a matter of last resort and would do so only to the limited extent necessary to secure sufficient land or access for its environmental purposes.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para7"></a>I am sorry to have gone on at length, but it was important to have those points on the record. I hope that with those assurances, the noble Lord will not feel it necessary to press his opposition to the clause standing part.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   Before the noble Lord replies, it surprises me a little to see that common land and allotments are covered. Allotments are normally owned by public authorities; in the case of common land, there is always grave difficulty over taking it away from those who use it. Are there actually cases in which common land and private allotments have not been available, making these schemes impossible? It would be interesting to know if there were any examples.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the noble Baroness responds, I want to ask her a question on a specific point. She said that there had been difficulties with landowners not agreeing and, therefore, voluntary agreements not being activated in that way. Might I ask her how many cases there have been of that sort?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-38_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I believe that I would be wise to write to Members of the Committee who have taken part in the debate or listened to it to give details about particular cases. All I can say to the noble Lord with regard to allotments is that, in my experience in local government, there is nothing more difficult than trying to deprive people of allotments. It may be that the process is lengthy, but I speak purely from memory of my time in local government and will write with greater detail.

<A NAME="30429-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for her response, which has done a great deal to set out the background. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, has also set out her position.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para8"></a>As we are already in letter-writing mode, it would help if the stringent conditions that must be met before one can jump the compulsory purchase hurdle for a land swap could be included as well. That might obviate future problems. We will have to study what has been said carefully, and we may need to come back to it.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para9"></a>As for allotments, I know that field allotments are a problem. They are a statutory creation and, like all statutory creations, they are regarded as almost inviolate and almost impossible to do away with, although it happens on occasion.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para10"></a>One question that I raised that was not answered was how the word &quot;fuel" was included in the category. The Minister might put that in the explanatory letter. The penultimate line of subsection (3) of proposed new Section 4C refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"part of a common, open space or a fuel or field garden allotment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-38_para11"></a>
I do not understand that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-38_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   In the clause, &quot;common" includes any land subject to be enclosed under the enclosure Acts from 1845 to 1882, in any town or village green.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para12"></a>The phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"fuel or field garden allotment",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-38_para13"></a>
means any allotment set out as a fuel allotment or a field garden allotment under an enclosure Act. That may refer to peat, or the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, may be about to come in and talk about biomass&#151;I know not. That is the answer that I can give the noble Lord. He may need further elucidation, as will I.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-38_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: I apologise to the Committee for not speaking on Second Reading, but unfortunately I was abroad at the time. Had I been here, I should have welcomed the Bill and, like many others, encouraged the Government to speed up implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive. I am aware that my noble friend the Minister explained that the directive is being implemented in stages. He made that point in response to an earlier amendment that would have introduced a general purpose clause for the implementation of the directive, on the grounds that he did not like general purpose clauses.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para20"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to speed up the implementation of the directive for economic as well as environmental reasons. Here, I must declare an interest as honorary president of the Environmental Industries Commission, which represents about 225 companies who supply environmental technology and other services, including companies providing water pollution control technologies and services.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para21"></a>In moving my amendment, I remind the Government of the economic advantages of the higher environmental standards that the Water Framework Directive will bring. These include: increased recreational use of the rivers and related amenities; increased satisfaction&#151;and, indeed, house prices&#151;for those living near cleaner water bodies; and benefits to industries such as tourism. Indeed the Government's own assessment of the directive concluded that the benefits from higher water quality in the UK could be valued at up to &pound;4.4 billion. In addition, industry itself can make considerable savings by cutting pollution and being more efficient, as the Government's own Enviro Wise Programme has demonstrated.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para22"></a>Then there are the advantages that would accrue to our environmental technology and services industry. My noble friend the Minister will be aware of the major effort being made to encourage innovation in British industry, and that an important element in encouraging innovation is how best to design and implement standards and regulations. That can influence innovation in business. Setting high environmental standards will encourage innovation in the environmental technology and services sector, because science and technology can achieve those higher standards as well as environmental management. Innovative science and technology will be required to control and prevent pollution.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para23"></a>At present, 28 per cent of the UK's rivers are classified as of fair quality or below. Although the definition of good status has yet to be finalised, it is likely that most of these 28 per cent will have to be upgraded. Some of the rivers classified as good may also need to be upgraded to meet the new standard. Although good progress has been made in achieving higher water quality in Britain's rivers in recent years, that improvement will have to continue and accelerate to meet the challenge set by the directive. My argument for getting on with the work of cleaning up our rivers is not only environmental, but economic, because of the benefits to innovation that cleaner rivers will bring.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para24"></a>The Minister will understand that technology providers and laboratories will not invest in innovative environmental technologies if they are unsure of the standards and regulations that have to be met. To enable that investment, the timescales have to be financially viable. So it is important to have clear targets and timescales so that technology providers and laboratories have the time and incentive to develop and implement new solutions.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para25"></a>However, our environmental industry does not exist in isolation. It has many competitors overseas, so it is important that the standards set by the Water Framework Directive are implemented at least in line with our major competitors. If the implementation is later than our competitors, their innovative technology will be used to provide our environmental solutions. That happened with fridges. The Germans moved first to put in place new rules to reprocess old fridges without releasing ozone-depleting chemicals. When our turn came, we had to buy their technology.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para26"></a>If the timing is at least in line with our major competitors, our environmental technology and services industry will be given every opportunity and encouragement to succeed in the rapidly growing world market for environmental technology&#151;a world market currently valued at over 500 billion dollars, which is comparable to the aerospace industry. The UK has only 4 per cent of that market compared with France's 7 per cent and Germany's 11 per cent. So there is absolutely no reason why we should not increase our share of the world market, while at the same time enjoying higher environmental standards. Those are the economic and business arguments for my amendment.
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para27"></a>A simple way to achieve good status for rivers is to give the Environment Agency the power and responsibility to review and tighten the consents held by industry to discharge trade effluent into rivers. Currently, the Environment Agency is held back by a legal restriction on reviewing those consents more frequently than every four years, unless specifically asked to review a discharge by the Secretary of State. My amendment therefore proposes that the agency be given the power to review discharge consents as and when necessary. In addition, it requires the agency to review discharge consents at least every four years where those discharges are to rivers that are failing to achieve good status, or where the discharge consent includes priority substances as defined under the Water Framework Directive.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-38_para28"></a>The amendment fairly balances the very real interest and benefit to the public of having clean rivers with the need to encourage innovation in industry. It is not more red tape that stifles innovation, it is a proportionate and measured attempt to balance three things: the public interest in and benefit from a cleaner environment; the needs of our environmental industry; and the fact that we will eventually have to implement the directive. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I warmly support the noble Lord's amendment. It is really music to our ears. I am especially grateful that he explained so eloquently that it is a question not of the environmental demands of the Water Framework Directive being in conflict with economic demands but, as he put it, that the two go hand in hand. As I touched on when speaking to my first amendment, the Government's piecemeal approach to implementing the directive still tends to adopt the attitude that those demands are in conflict.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para0"></a>I fear that not only will the directive be implemented in a piecemeal fashion but we will seek derogration after derogation because, instead of following the path laid out by the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, of innovation both creating economic goods and enabling environmental standards to be met, we shall simply not meet the environmental standards. We will then apply for a derogation; we will lag behind the timescale; the incentive will be lost for innovation to be made; and the economic benefit will not be gained. That is the sort of vicious circle in which we are at present.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para1"></a>So I warmly support the amendment and hope that the Government can see the sense of what the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   There can be no dissent from the principle of the amendment, but I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response. One cannot quarrel with the idea of carrying out a review as and when necessary, at least every four years and where a river is unsatisfactory or contains listed substances. &quot;As and when necessary", presumably implies, &quot;when circumstances are perceived to have changed", which could be a greater interval than four years, but that does not matter. The principle behind the amendment is unexceptional, but perhaps the Minister can tell us how the Bill fits with the framework directive and the amendment. I look forward to hearing his response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I agree with much of what my noble friend Lord Haskel said, but not with his amendment. It is important to recognise how we are implementing the Water Framework Directive and the importance of doing so in a way that encourages rather than discourages innovation. I pay tribute to the Environmental Industries Commission for the work that it is undertaking in that respect. It is important that we view the environmental, economic and competitive advantages of compliance together.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para2"></a>However, I am not sure that I can agree with the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, because I do not know on what basis she said that we are seeking <P>


<a name="column_GC156"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>derogation after derogation. The Water Framework Directive has already been subject to substantial consultation and will be subject to more that is in the pipeline. That certainly does not give the impression that we are seeking derogation after derogation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Perhaps I can help the Minister. I was thinking of the daughter directive about groundwater quality. On the Government's timetable, we are unlikely to meet those standards and, I expect, will be asking for derogations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   On the timetable for the Water Framework Directive, we are not yet at the point of transposing it; we are still consulting about its proper implementation and how it can be delivered through our system in this country. It would therefore be at best premature to say that we will seek derogations all over the place. There may be the odd area in which we cannot meet the exact timetable of the directive, but our support for the framework directive's objectives runs clearly through the consultation.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para3"></a>I think that the primary concern behind the amendment moved by my noble friend is industrial discharges of trade effluents into controlled waters, which is touched on by the Water Framework Directive and has a major effect on the quality of water in the rivers to which he refers. In fact, however, the amendment would disapply the four-year intervention period&#151;if I may put it that way&#151;for all types of discharge consents, not simply those of an industrial nature.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para4"></a>In its work to implement the Water Framework Directive, the Environment Agency is already well versed in the operation of a discharge consent regime and the priorities that it requires under the 1991 Act. We intend the regime to continue to include the four-year non-intervention period, as that allows consent holders, including those with trade effluent consents, greater certainty in investment planning.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para5"></a>Power already exists to allow the Secretary of State to direct the agency to review consents, including those within the four-year period, so an override provision already exists. We do not believe that that needs to be supplemented by any additional, more generalised relaxation of the four-year rule. All these aspects of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive are, have been, and will further be, the subject of widespread consultation. Meanwhile, the existing provisions in the Water Resources Act are sufficient for the implementation of the directive. We do not, therefore, need an amendment to the primary legislation in that respect.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para6"></a>We need to achieve a balance between meeting the objectives of the Water Framework Directive while at the same time encouraging industry to do so in an innovative way. We need to do so in a way that does not create greater uncertainty for industry as a whole. By and large, the four-year period has worked reasonably well and should, in our view, continue to be the norm.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew5"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   Presumably when a business has a discharge consent, it discharges whatever it is into the river or the catchment. If it discharges something that is doing damage, presumably it can be required to cease discharging immediately, and we do not need to revise the four-year consents. If it is not discharging something that does damage, what reason would there be for reviewing the consent within four years?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The degree to which the discharge is doing damage depends on the circumstances of the river as a whole. What might have been an appropriate level of allowable discharge at the beginning of the period of consent may change because the nature of the river has changed with regard to flow or other depredation of the river. This would be pretty unusual, which is why it is for the Secretary of State to direct the agency rather than having it as a normal part of the four-year consenting process which we think is, by and large, an adequate and sensible period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I thank the Minister for his detailed and rather thoughtful response. My amendment is not about derogations, it is about regulation. One of the purposes of the amendment is to explore ways in which water regulation can be a bit more positive.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para7"></a>More regulation is a fact of life, especially as we build a fairer society. Indeed, noble Lords may know that Professor Porter recently reported that deregulation is beginning to show diminishing returns. So a more modern attitude to regulation is needed. The simple mantra of &quot;more regulation bad, less regulation good" is not getting us anywhere, so I hope that this will be part of the consultation.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para8"></a>I will read what the Minister has said very carefully. It appeared to me that he was reluctant to give more responsibility to the Environment Agency because the Secretary of State already has certain powers. Getting the Secretary of State to use these powers is usually a pretty cumbersome and long-winded affair, so we will have to give that some thought.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para9"></a>I agree with the Minister that four-yearly reviews give industry an opportunity to plan and invest. But equally, a lot of damage can be done to the environment in four years, and it can take an awful lot longer to clear it up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I have listened carefully to the noble Lord's response to the Minister's comments. Do I gather that the noble Lord is in favour of more regulation, and that this would prevent it from happening in the first place? I got a little confused as the noble Lord spoke, and I am seeking some clarification. Obviously, once we have more regulation, we have more costs, and I thought that we were in favour of deregulation. I thought that that was what the noble Lord, Lord Haskins&#151;rather than the noble Lord, Lord Haskel&#151;is currently looking at, and that the Environment Agency, in particular, was one <P>


<a name="column_GC158"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the agencies whose role was being considered. If the noble Lord could clarify this point, I would be grateful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-39_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I am certainly not asking for more regulation. I am saying that it is inevitable that we will have some regulation because of the EU directive, and I am asking that it should be used in a more creative way.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-39_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 184 is related to Amendment No. 183 and what was spelled out in that amendment, which we have just finished debating. However, I would like in this amendment to stress that the agency, which does a good job in monitoring water quality, continues to monitor water quality and chemical and bacterial pollution through sampling, and is empowered to enforce compliance at the source and advise alternatives where chemical processes impact upon discharge. The purpose is to be proactive in tackling industrial and other sources of pollution.
<P>

<a name="30429-39_para16"></a>This is an exploratory amendment; we need reassurances that the monitoring process is continuous where discharges take place and that the agency will be given the tools to do the job. There have been some serious incidents&#151;I can think of a number on the Welsh Dee&#151;from chemical plant which caused an enormous amount of damage to the rivers there. There have been other examples of rivers where quite serious incidents have taken place.

<a name="30429-39_para17"></a>The amendment would ensure that the agency will be proactive and will continue to be diligent in carrying out these tasks. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The amendment relates to the part of the Bill which deals with sewers and drains. Therefore, the regulation structure is somewhat different from that for rivers and waterways.

These conditions are set out by the Environment Agency under the Water Resources Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para4"></a>I hope that noble Lords will therefore recognise that the 1991 Act already contains sufficient powers for the water undertakers to regulate efficiently and effectively the discharge of trade effluent in this context. Likewise, the Environment Agency has its own appropriate controls at the stage that most concerns it. I therefore hope that the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, recognises that the powers are already there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-40_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I realised at the time I drafted the amendment that it referred to sewerage, but I am afraid that a little time has gone by since then. The powers in the Water Resources Act are effective although I could name once or two incidents where, although sewage appears to be treated effectively, and discharges are going on, there has been a deterioration. However, some undertakers have done immense work in this respect and have greatly improved the situation.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para5"></a>I merely put the amendment down to ensure that vigilance would continue and that matters would continue to improve as these tasks are carried out. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME="30429-40_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth </B>   moved Amendment No. 185:
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-40_para10"></a><P>

(9) The Agency shall prepare plans for all non-adopted sewage schemes to be adopted by water and sewerage undertakers by the end of the year 2015."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-40_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is best described as the cowboy builders' amendment. In carrying out various work in the past, I have had a lot of adverse experiences of the consequences of this. In particular, residents can become stranded as a result of builders carrying out inadequate work in connecting to a sewage infrastructure and leaving the job half finished.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para12"></a>In the first part of the amendment, we hope that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"private and public housing developers and building contractors be subject to planning consent conditions specific to the water and sewerage undertaker adopting a new sewage scheme".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-40_para13"></a>
This is highly desirable, but it has not always been the case. I can point to a number of instances of dissatisfaction. What amazes me is that the planning authority has very often laid down what needs to be done to complete a scheme but supervising carrying out the edict of the planning authority in having a proper scheme at the start does not always come about. I would have thought it obvious that new schemes in particular ought to be in place in a building housing development in a state that can be adopted immediately, and not left incomplete. I am looking for planning compliance by the developers on site so that they leave the site in a state which is workable and up to speed.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para14"></a>The second part of the amendment requires that the agency,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall prepare plans for all non-adopted sewage schemes to be adopted by water and sewerage undertakers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-40_para15"></a>
I have suggested 2015 as a fair length of time for compliance. I believe from my experience that there are a lot of non-adopted sewage schemes around the country and it will take a very long time for them to get up to speed.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para16"></a>I can quote several examples of what tends to happen. In a town on the England-Wales border, the sewerage undertaker refused point-blank to adopt the scheme because the developers kept on building half a dozen houses and extending the estate to the point where the sewage facilities could not cope with the extension of the building work. Very often it is the fault of the planning authority but there is a stalemate. Three or four bodies are involved, none of which will take responsibility.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para17"></a>The other thing that happens, particularly with cowboy builder outfits, is that they start to build an estate and then go bankrupt. I have seen this happen several times. In fact, I can think of one instance in which the same company went bankrupt twice. The system is never adopted properly. The estate is sometimes left in a chaotic state as far as the sewage system is concerned. Even after 15 years, residents are still having most unpleasant experiences&#151;I will not go into detail&#151;because of inadequate sewage provision, and they suddenly ask for vast sums of money to put the matter right.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para18"></a>It seems to me that in that type of situation there should be some process whereby sewage schemes can be adopted and brought fully up to standard without the residents in some estates having to take matters in hand, as has been the case in some instances. I believe that the amendment presents a real opportunity to sort out this matter and to stop the nonsense that occurs. It causes many grievous problems and creates expense for innocent people who perhaps do not realise, when purchasing their houses, that they have entered a den of iniquity so far as concerns the sewage. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-40_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I believe we all recognise the type of situation to which the noble Lord refers in relation to cowboy builders and existing unadopted sewers. Indeed, the Government are seized of this matter and we have taken some action on both aspects of his amendment.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para19"></a>With regard to the first aspect, we looked at the issue of new sewers in order to try to stop the perpetuation of problems relating to private sewers. As a result of consultation in 2000, we established a protocol which sets out the key elements of design and construction of sewers for all new developments. That should enable wider adoption of those provisions. I believe that some of the wider elements relating to cowboy builders may not be dealt with entirely but largely the new developments are now dealt with under that system.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para20"></a>Obviously the situation is far more complicated with regard to existing private sewers. We shall shortly issue a consultation paper seeking views on possible solutions to deal with the problems. Until the outcome of that consultation is known, I do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to adopt the second part of the noble Lord's amendment. That would insert into the Bill a subsection which effectively would lead to the partial transfer of ownership of unadopted sewers to the relevant local sewerage undertaker without a clear indication of how that would impose costs and responsibilities on the undertaker which would then no doubt have to be levied on the rest of the customers.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para21"></a>Therefore, as the noble Lord will see, we have already taken some action on the first part of his amendment, resulting in the protocol, and we are beginning to take action on the second. It is hoped that we can achieve an acceptable solution to the second issue of unadopted private sewers. With that assurance, I hope that the noble Lord will not pursue the amendment but will recognise that the Government are fully appraised of and concerned about the problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-40_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, perhaps I may ask the Minister a question, based on my experience as a district councillor, with regard to the second part of the amendment. Huge amounts of time and effort, staff time and resources are put in by district councils, particularly into first-time sewerage schemes but also into trying to solve the problems of non-adopted sewers for the good of the environment of their districts. I believe that this is another example of a great deal of work which is entirely unrecognised in the Audit Commission's measurement of local authority work.
<P>

<a name="30429-40_para22"></a>Again, I ask the Minister to return to this matter because it is part of a local authority's work which is simply not recognised. If it is to progress in the way that it should, it needs better recognition. I believe that current environmental measures are limited to the problems of litter. That is obviously important because litter is very visible, but this type of work is <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Baroness makes a valid point, although it goes somewhat wider than many of the other activities of district and other councils. However, I take her point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I thank the Minister very much for his response. I am particularly pleased that in relation to proposed new subsection (8) in my amendment a protocol is being established for new developments. He has referred to a very important matter there.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para0"></a>The second part of my amendment concerning non-adopted sewage schemes relates to a very difficult problem. If the Minister's consultation is taking place, I can certainly give a couple of horrendous examples which may assist him. The worst example that I know of is that a builder deliberately went bust when the local authority was being reorganised. I am aware that that is not the only example of that. Therefore, I hope that a fairly tight solution can be found. It will help an enormous number of people in the country&#151;very often innocent householders&#151;and I look forward to the proposals following the consultation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30429-41_para4"></a>Clause 91 [Communication with public sewers]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 185AZA:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 113, line 44, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-41_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;(2A) In subsection (2)(b), leave out &quot;where separate public sewers are provided for foul water and for surface water,"."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-41_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: This group of amendments deals with the current situation whereby the owners and occupiers of premises and the owners of private sewers have a more or less unrestricted right to connect their drains and sewers to public sewers. While I never like to restrict the rights of individuals, I believe that such action needs to be undertaken in a more planned way because it creates unacceptable problems. The fact that sewerage undertakers have no control over the right to connect contributes to the overloading of sewers and the surcharging and resulting sewer flooding, the details of which we shall not go into.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para7"></a>Surface water can also enter the sewers, but I believe that that should happen as infrequently as possible, particularly where the sewers suffer such an overload. The flowing of relatively clean surface water into the sewers does not constitute good use of them.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para8"></a>Amendment No. 185AZA&#151;the first in this group&#151;ensures in particular that, where a foul public sewer has been provided and there is no surface water public sewer, surface water may not be drained into the foul public sewer. It seems to me that the two things are separate and should be treated separately. Indeed, we shall come to view water in different categories. I <P>


<a name="column_GC163"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that surface water is known as &quot;grey water" and it is inappropriate that it should enter the public sewer.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para9"></a>Where notice is given of an intention to drain surface water into a public sewer, Amendment No. 185AZB seeks to enable sewerage undertakers to refuse permission for that connection or to grant permission subject to the condition that if an alternative means of drainage is feasible, cost-effective and will alleviate sewer flooding, then that would be preferable.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para10"></a>Amendment No. 185AZC seeks to extend Ofwat's appellate jurisdiction to the reasonableness of sewerage undertakers' decisions. The final two amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 185AZD and 185AZE&#151;are technical and are based on the first three. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I recognise the problems to which the noble Baroness refers. She may not be aware that sustainable surface water drainage systems are currently being considered by a working group of all interested parties under the chairmanship of the Environment Agency. If we can develop such systems, they can significantly reduce pressure on the sewerage system by collecting, treating and disposing of surface water locally into the ground. That depends on suitable conditions and therefore it may not suit all areas. We also need to establish the responsibilities and the costs of building and maintaining such systems.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para11"></a>The working group will produce a consultation paper in the spring on the design standards for such systems. Until that work is completed and decisions have been taken on it later in the year, I believe that it would be premature to accept the amendment as it stands and to see whether, as the noble Baroness suggests, we should amend Section 106 of the 1991 Act.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para12"></a>Ofwat has said that it will consider additional investment by sewerage undertakers to deal with the most serious cases of susceptibility to sewerage flooding. It will do so before the next periodic review of water charges in 2005. There needs to be an increase in the rate at which companies rectify sewer flooding problems if they are to get on top of the problem. That has also been made clear to Ofwat by the department. Therefore, we need to proceed on the basis of the current consultation and of ensuring that in its approach to the next periodic review, and prior to that, Ofwat takes account of the need to take action in this respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I note that in his remarks the Minister has added yet another burden to the poor long-serving and all-serving Environment Agency. It would be useful if, following the Committee stage, we could have a tabulated list of the functions that have been spelt out. They are not always immediately apparent on the face of the Bill and it would be useful if we could have that so that we know exactly where we stand as a result of this Committee stage, which now goes back over rather a long period.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I am not sure of the feasibility of doing that. I was referring here to an operational consultation conducted by the Environment Agency. The regulatory responsibility will probably be largely on Ofwat. However, I recognise what the noble Lord seeks and I shall see what we can do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, I thank him for his last response to my noble friend. Throughout our discussions during the Committee stage of the Bill, we have continually heard references to a consultation on this or something else on that. We are told that this consultation will not take place until the spring, but we are dealing with the problems now.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para13"></a>Therefore, it would be enormously helpful if, in addition to agreeing to the request just put to him, the Minister could provide before Report stage a full list of all the items that are in hand or on which consultation is being sought. The number of such items is becoming vast. I have read the report of the Committee stage as we have proceeded but I believe that such a list would be helpful for the guidance of the Committee and it may well save time at Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I believe that I can undertake to consider providing such a list where the Bill states that there are additional responsibilities on regulators or others. That is one thing, but it would be rather more difficult to consider the totality of what is going on and to produce anything comprehensive or helpful. My comments during the course of the Committee stage have related to particular amendments and particular consultations which may in part be relevant. However, I do not believe that I can undertake to do quite what the noble Baroness is suggesting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I still want to encourage the Minister to do so, if he is able. The size of the task might be reduced if it related only to anything that has come within the confines of the amendments moved. Many issues within the water industry and the Water Framework Directive will come up very shortly. Therefore, at present much is in the air. We have the opportunity&#151;probably the only one in 20 years&#151;to get the matter correct on the face of the Bill. Therefore, if it were possible and did not cause too much expense, I should be most grateful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-41_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Minister for his helpful reply to the amendment. If the name of the working group is the acronym SUDS, then I was aware of it, but I was not aware that it would report quite so soon. I have sympathy for the request for at least a list of the major working groups and consultations that are taking place. A quick brain-storming session in the Minister's team would produce probably two sides of A4 of items that are directly related to the Water Bill. I, too, would find that helpful. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-41_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 185ZA standing in my name refers back to my Second Reading speech on 6th March, recorded at cols. 988 and 989 in the Official Report, in which I made the point about the huge amount of debt which is outstanding in the water industry. The Water Industry Act 1999 makes it illegal for water companies to disconnect customers who have not paid their water bills. However, companies remain under a statutory duty to supply water to customers, even when customers decide not to pay. That surely makes water companies unique. For example, council tax and services may be the only other example. They are of course not private companies.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para19"></a>According to Ofwat, in the year 2001&#150;02, 19 per cent of households&#151;that is almost one in five&#151;did not pay their water bills. That represents 4.4 million households with revenue outstanding. That in turn is an increase of 11 per cent since 1998&#150;99, which was the last year that disconnection was possible. As I said on 6th March, outstanding debt is now running at &pound;717 <P>


<a name="column_GC166"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>million per annum, which is an increase of 10 per cent or 11 per cent. The increased collection costs for recovering debt adds between &pound;1 to &pound;3 to every water bill. Unrecovered debts add a further &pound;6. That is nearly &pound;10 per household to support debtors. In other words, this is a charge on all paying customers.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para20"></a>There is a growing concern that the burdens imposed by &quot;won't" payers on those who do pay can only increase. As I said in my Second Reading speech, this has nothing to do with the inability, in terms of being on benefit, to pay for water. In that regard the most awful people are those who can well afford to pay for water, but, knowing that they will not be disconnected, do not bother to pay.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para21"></a>Anecdotal evidence&#151;again as I said at Second Reading&#151;shows that citizens advice bureaux, money advice centres and customers themselves have dropped the payment of water bills below catalogue and satellite TV payments. Currently, water payments have the lowest priority in deductions from benefit. There is no structure to cover these costs, for example by extending housing benefits to cover water charges. Is that not a contradiction?
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para22"></a>The industry is working with the Government to address the issue, but small changes in legislation could help to bring debt under control. I believe that the Water Bill provides an ideal opportunity to address the considerable problem of rising debt in the water industry.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para23"></a>The amendment would help to define the occupier to whom a water service is provided and who is responsible for paying the water bill. At the moment, the Water Industry Act 1999 does not define &quot;occupier" in cases of multiple occupancy&#151;for example, flat sharing, holiday lets, bedsits, lodgings, bed and breakfast and so on&#151;which causes confusion as to who should be charged by water companies. Residents of short lettings may move on before the annual water bill arrives. Finally, it is almost impossible in practical terms for a water company to levy charges on each of the multiple occupants.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para24"></a>The amendment adopts a similar approach to council tax legislation&#151;the Local Government Finance Act 1992&#151;that has successfully dealt with the same issue. That imposes liability to pay council tax in respect of a &quot;chargeable dwelling" upon an ordered list of categories of persons.
<P>

<a name="30429-41_para25"></a>The amendment would impose liability to pay water and sewerage charges upon an ordered list of categories or persons for dwellings of a class prescribed by regulations; that is, essentially those houses in multiple occupation. It would require the owner or occupier of a class of dwellings prescribed by regulations to provide the water company with information concerning the ownership and occupation of those dwellings. Finally, it would require public bodies to provide water companies with information concerning the current or former ownership of occupation of dwellings of a class prescribed by regulation. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-42_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   At Second Reading, my noble friend made a very passionate plea that we should <P>


<a name="column_GC167"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consider ways to help stop the ever-rising burdens created by non-payment of water bills that have such an effect on us all. Again today my noble friend has said that it amounts to &pound;10 for every paying customer. That is a lot of money. Unfortunately, it falls on families who can ill afford it. That is one of the big problems. My noble friend said that, on the whole, the people who do not pay these bills are not those who cannot pay but those who will not pay. I hope therefore that the Minister will deal with the issue sympathetically and that he can take it on board. Should the Minister find that perhaps the wording in the amendment is too long, too cumbersome or something like that, which often is the case when one tries to table an amendment to deal with a specific issue, I certainly should be very happy if the Government are willing to take the matter on board and to return with an amendment. It is important to note that, as I said earlier, it is bad enough that the payment for non-payments is recouped from people who can afford to pay. However, I am particularly concerned about those good people on low incomes who struggle very hard and yet must find an extra &pound;10 which really they should not. So I support strongly my noble friend's amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-42_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   In the intervening two or three weeks since we last discussed the matter, I hope that the Minister has had to time to reflect on the issue of separating the people who cannot pay from the &quot;won't" pay people that I tried to explore in my amendment which aimed to define &quot;water poverty".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Occupiers use water. Therefore, the logical charge is on the occupiers. It is not the same as council tax. Water is supplied for the particular use of those people in those premises, whereas council tax is a general tax that is applied for all kinds of services whether or not the person who pays it enjoys that particular service. So I do not think that there is a read-across there.
<P>

<a name="30429-42_para0"></a>I recognise the problem of debt. But, to adopt this proposal would raise other issues of principle. It is not so much the detailed wording, but that there are other issues of principle which must be answered before one can shift the burden of responsibility. For example, as regards metered premises, if the owners rather than the occupiers were responsible for the bills, there is absolutely no constraint whatever on the occupier using huge amounts of water because they will not have to meet the charge.
<P>

<a name="30429-42_para1"></a>If we are talking about water conservation and efficient use of water, to shift the burden might not actually meet that objective. There are also detailed complications, in the sense that the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness allows us to prescribe classes of property and classes of owner. I think she has helpfully explained that that relates principally to houses in multiple occupation. But it means that the relationship between the owner and the occupier will be affected by this legislation in a significant way. In other words, if owners think that they will end up being responsible, it is probable that in certain circumstances the supply <P>


<a name="column_GC168"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>of private housing might actually reduce if they feel they are potentially subject to an undefinable bill over which they had little control.
<P>

<a name="30429-42_para2"></a>Alternatively, that amount will be built into the rent in such a way that it might mean that certain families could not afford those premises. This raises wider issues in the relationship between the landlord and the tenant. Effectively, the proposal gives landlords the responsibility for the debts of their tenants. One way or another the land owner will try reasonably to avoid that responsibility.
<P>

<a name="30429-42_para3"></a>So I recognise the problem and the cogency of some of the arguments that seek to shift the burden, but I think that also there are a lot of objections. Therefore, I am not minded in this context to move in that direction. Of course, there is the separate issue as to how we collect the debt and whether we can effectively, as suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, distinguish between those who will not pay and those who cannot pay. Administrative and guidance notes may help on that. However, I do not think that a wholesale shifting of the burden on to the owner would necessarily be beneficial for the other objectives of the Bill and that it raises bigger issues in the tenant-landlord relationship.
<P>

<a name="30429-42_para4"></a>I have not commented on the information dimensions because I assume that they are supportive of the general intention. I am torn on the matter, but my view is that on balance the arguments against more than counter the arguments for making the change suggested by the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-42_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I thank the Minister&#151;not profusely I have to say, but he did not really expect that. Perhaps I may put him right on one matter. He said that there would be a profligate&#151;although he did not use that word&#151;use of water by the people using the water. The fact is that they are not paying for it at the moment. There is probably a profligate use of it anyway by these people in multiple occupations.
<P>

<a name="30429-42_para5"></a>The issue is a very serious one and it is getting worse. It is not as if the issue had just reached the stage of &pound;10 per customer. However, it is a rum thing for a government to say that it does not really matter, &quot;We shall not go after the 'won't payers'" and, &quot;It does not matter. The rest of you will have to pay &pound;10 a year more for your water". The problem is that more and more people are climbing on this bandwagon. They are aware that this is happening and are saying, &quot;We don't have to bother because no matter what we do, they can do as they like and we still will have the water", because there is no disconnection charge and it is something quite different.
<P>

<a name="30429-42_para6"></a>The industry as a whole is dealing with&#151;it must be&#151;DEFRA in trying to reach some solution to the problem. But I hope that the Minister will bear in mind just how serious this situation is and how much more serious it is likely to become. I am disappointed, but I can assure him that the issue will not go away. I just hope that the Government, together with the industry, can reach a solution that alleviates the problem for those that my noble friend so rightly says really cannot pay but who have to pay. They feel they have a moral <P>

<FONT SIZE=2><br> &quot;( ) Upon the coming into force of section 7 of this Act, section 24 of the WRA shall not apply to abstraction of water to prevent interference with any mining, quarrying or engineering operations (whether underground or surface) or to prevent interference or damage to works resulting from any such operations for a period of 12 months or if later final and lawful determination of an application for a licence."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-43_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 186 and 186A share quite a number of words. In fact, I accept that Amendment No. 186A, tabled by my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon, has the advantage of being five words shorter. At this stage in the proceedings, that is perhaps a merit. I should like to comment on the spirit which certainly informs my amendment and which I see reflected in Amendment No. 186A. The intention is to seek reassurance that, during the process of implementation of any legislation that follows from the Bill, companies already in business that are required to apply for a water licence will be able to continue in business until a determination has been made on the application for that licence. In other words, there will not be a hiatus in mining until the determination has finally been settled. However, having made that general point, I should be quite content to withdraw my amendment and leave it to my noble friend to place his before the Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-43_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   We return to the question of the relationship between the Bill, the quarrying industry and the construction industry. When we last debated this, my noble friend Lady Farrington asked the Quarry Products Association to write to her, which it did. I had no part in the writing of that excellent document which I am sure that Ministers have given an adequate and I hope a sympathetic reading.
<P>

<a name="30429-43_para2"></a>I should like to remind the Committee about the distinction we are making here. In general terms, the Bill is about extracting water mostly for domestic or industrial purposes. It also deals with certain forms of industrial and domestic drainage. To include the quarrying and construction industries' activities in this is quite mistaken. What we are dealing with here is draining either a quarry or a deep excavation so that one can continue a technological process. It is in fact a part of a technology and a technological process. As the Committee will remember, what happens is that the water is drained from one part of a water system and then put back into the same water system. It is shifted from one place to another, but it is still in the <P>


<a name="column_GC173"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>same general vicinity. It has not been taken away and drunk or made into whisky or anything nice like that. It remains in the water system.
<P>

<a name="30429-43_para3"></a>Quite frankly, the matter should not be dealt with in this Bill at all. It should be in another Bill which deals with construction or quarrying. But here it is, due to some malfunction in Whitehall. It is awfully difficult to deal with it if we do not make the distinction between these two processes.
<P>

<a name="30429-43_para4"></a>Several hours ago, the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, raised the issue of sustainability. Various other Members of the Committee have mentioned sustainability. Nothing could be more sustainable than this method of drainage and replacement. I often have difficulty with the definition of sustainability, but this seems to be just about as perfect an example of sustainability as you could get. We have therefore tabled Amendment No. 186A to deal with the transition from a period when a company does not require a licence to a period when it does. A substantial period might pass in the course of negotiating the licence. Meanwhile, the quarrying, or indeed the deep excavation at a construction site, would have to continue, or alternatively would have to stop. I am not quite sure what would happen. However, the Bill must recognise that that transition period must be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="30429-43_para5"></a>Our amendment proposes how that should be done. My noble friend had one set of words and I had another set. He has said that one is a little shorter. However, both say that the section of the WRA,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xshall not apply . . .  to prevent interference with any mining, quarrying or engineering operations . . .  or to prevent damage to works resulting from any such operations",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-43_para6"></a>
until the end of the period for determination of the licence has been reached. &quot;Reached" is a better word than &quot;set", which is in my amendment. This seems to be a fairly sensible and desirable amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-43_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   When the issue was raised earlier I was supportive about the difficulties expressed by the noble Lord. I think that we would all support his concern that there would be very damaging effects, perhaps mostly environmental, if the business were not allowed to continue. That is, of course, subject to establishing that the quarrying business is not damaging water or the environment, but I think that we are currently taking that as read. If that is so, the provision makes great sense. The noble Lords, Lord Sutherland and Lord Howie, have clearly explained how that water is used, drained, reused and returned to the same system. I am therefore happy to support the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   As I indicated in earlier debates, we, too, support this amendment. Clearly, quarrying is a continuing process. Any interruption to the process will cause great disruption to the business concerned. Such businesses are very often located in fairly remote areas and require support. As the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said, as long as there is no <P>


<a name="column_GC174"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>serious environmental damage and water is merely being extracted, we would be perfectly satisfied with the amendment and support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-43_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   The Minister will no doubt give assurances on the transition arrangements which I hope will satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon. Before she does so, I should like&#151;for perhaps the third or fourth time during our consideration of the Bill, in our customary exchange&#151;to raise the issue of what is and is not sustainable in terms of water extraction in the quarrying industry. Even in the process which the noble Lord described as drawing water out and then replacing it, quarries can have quite substantial impacts on the environment. To say that it is automatically a sustainable process to remove very large quantities of water and then to return them is perhaps to over-egg the sustainability of the quarrying industry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-43_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I thank both the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, and my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon&#151;although my noble friend Lord Howie seems to think that there could even be some malfunction in Whitehall. I am happy to assure him that on this occasion, as I assume on all other occasions, I can give him the reassurance that he seeks.
<P>

<a name="30429-43_para7"></a>These amendments, seeking special transitional arrangements for existing quarrying, mining and engineering operations, would be more restrictive than the published policy for transitional applications in paragraph 3.16 of Taking Water Responsibly. That proposed a period of up to two years for any transitional licence applications to be made, and a period of up to five years for them to be determined by the Environment Agency. Abstractions for existing operations would continue to be lawful during these periods. Clause 95(1) of the Bill already provides for the Secretary of State to make transitional regulations that will deal consistently with all such arrangements, including the validity of existing operations pending determination of applications and the granting of licences.
<P>

<a name="30429-43_para8"></a>I hope that I have reassured the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, and my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon and that they will not feel the need to press the amendments at further stages of the Bill.

<P>

<A NAME="30429-43_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </B>   I am content to withdraw the amendment at this stage and I beg leave to do so.

<FONT SIZE=2>underground or surface) or to prevent damage to works resulting from any such operations or was contemplating carrying out such abstraction in pursuance of planning permission for the winning and working of minerals extant at that date,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-43_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment has two elements to it. When it was originally drafted it referred to one particular context, but there is a second to which I shall refer in a moment. The context in question is clearly the eligibility for compensation should there be real and significant loss to the relevant industry. The issue is that as quarries and quarry owners develop a project, considerable advance investment takes place. In Amendment No. 187, the key words are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Xor was contemplating carrying out such abstraction in pursuance of",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30429-43_para15"></a>
and so on.
<P>

<a name="30429-43_para16"></a>The issue here is that as a quarry owner plans the future, he will have a time horizon within which a certain level of investment seems reasonable. It is a danger to such a time horizon if one simply restricts compensation to actual operations in place at the moment. The intent of the amendment is again to seek reassurance that in the event of any compensation being relevant, the level of investment and the policy and strategy documents of the company will be taken into account. I think that that is a perfectly reasonable request to make.
<P>

<a name="30429-43_para17"></a>Since then&#151;and this may be simply a point on which I need to be corrected&#151;I have been led to believe that the Environment Agency will in fact issue licences on a first-come, first-served basis. If that turns out to be the case, there will be a very significant question for those who own quarries and those who operate them in the way specified whether they can apply in advance for licences that refer to work which they contemplate undertaking, as part of the policy or which has been the basis of investment for that company. In that case, I should seek reassurances that they could do so and that these licences will be allowed to lie unimplemented for some considerable period compatible with the investment horizon which led the companies to make the proposals. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30429-44_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, in Amendment No. 187. I shall also give an example of how it might be important. In quarrying, one sometimes quarries up on a cliff, and sometimes underground. Drainage becomes important, of course, when one is quarrying underground. However, one might be contemplating quarrying up on a cliff and then to move down. One would have to apply for a de-watering licence at the beginning. It might be years before de-watering is necessary. The licence will by then have expired, and it will be necessary to apply to my noble friend Baroness Young for a kindly consideration of a renewal or extension, which may be given. However, the licence may not be renewed, although substantial capital may have been invested in developing the quarry. That is why Amendment No. 187 is necessary.

<a name="30429-44_para0"></a>Amendment No. 187A is much shorter. Clause 95(4) allows the Secretary of State to pay compensation to anyone who,

as a result of which they have to apply for a licence, when either no licence has been granted or it has been granted subject to restrictive conditions. There is no help in the Government press release of 19th February about what the phrase &quot;supply of water" means in that regard. If it does not include the drainage of a quarry, my amendment is relevant. Amendment No. 187A would ensure that the de-watering of the quarry was included in the provisions.

<A NAME="30429-44_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Where any previously exempt activity is unable to continue as a result of the introduction of any new controls by the Bill, Clause 95 already provides that regulations can deal with the payment of compensation. Amendments Nos. 187 and 187A seek to ensure that the mining, quarrying and engineering construction industries are included in the arrangements. However, all such cases will be provided for by the regulations.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para2"></a>Payment of compensation to any person in those circumstances would apply, in line with the principles for compensation set out in Section 61 of the Water Resources Act 1991. That would take due account of abortive expenditure incurred and any loss or damage sustained by reason of the inability to continue the abstraction. Expenditure abortively incurred may also include the preparation of plans for the purposes of any work, and any similar matters preparatory to that work. I hope that that reassures noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para3"></a>The principles on which compensation may be claimed are already established in legislation. I would expect future regulations governing the payment of compensation in transitional cases to be broadly consistent with Section 61 of the Water Resources Act 1991. With that reassurance, I hope that the noble Lords will feel that they do not need to press the amendments.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para4"></a>My noble friend Lord Howie of Troon raised a further issue. We recognise that in some instances existing quarrying operations will not require an abstraction licence for de-watering until after the coming into force of the provisions of the Bill. There is a possibility that such a licence will not be granted, or be granted on a restrictive basis, and that would not benefit from the currently proposed compensation arrangements. We are considering how to address that potential gap and hope to complete that consideration between now and later stages of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para5"></a>It is not possible for anyone to apply in advance of the Act. The Environment Agency will consider all applications during the transitional period, so the issue of first-come-first-served does not really arise. I hope that I have covered all the genuine concerns raised by the noble Lords, Lord Sutherland and Lord Howie. I should stress that the withholding of licences would not happen for some perverse reason; it would happen <P>


<a name="column_GC177"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because there were severe grounds for concern about the impact. Much as I enjoy, respect and understand the knowledge of quarrying possessed by my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon, I also understand the points made by noble Baroness, Lady Young. However, I am sure that I have satisfied his concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-44_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </B>   I thank the Minister for those words of comfort and reassurance and I shall certainly reread the wording of the 1991 Act to see how it applies&#151;or how we would regard it as applying&#151;in this situation.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para6"></a>The issue of first-come-first-served is not simply transitional, however. There may be a good reason to introduce quotas in a particular area or catchment, as the availability of water and the sustainability of that catchment area unrolls over the years to come. One question from the industry, which is not formally raised by the amendment but which I should like to leave with the Minister for consideration, is to what extent the industry's long-term plans will be part of the horizon that settles the question of quotas and, in due course, the allocation of licences within a particular catchment area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-44_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, will not be surprised by my response, which is that it is impossible to answer a totally hypothetical question as to what could happen at some date in the future in circumstances that I do not know about. I would never do that without advice. If I can write to him on that, I shall do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-44_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sutherland of Houndwood: </B>   I would not say that it was at least worth trying to ask the question, as clearly it was not. On the other hand, I am voicing a legitimate concern about what might happen to the long-term plans to which investment has been committed if a particular form of dispensing licences comes into play. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30429-44_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment speaks for itself. As we have debated the Bill in Committee, we have gone from frustration to greater frustration and greater difficulty, as we have had to look back through so many different Acts, then look at Butterworths to see if it has been updated, then table amendments to ensure that our interpretation was correct. The Water Industry Act ran to some 400-plus pages and the Water Resources Act to 600-plus pages. There have also been various changes made over the years. We believe that it is time to consolidate some of the various water Acts.

<P>

<a name="30429-44_para11"></a>If we who have parliamentary support to back us up have difficulties, one can only imagine what it is like for the ordinary person outside trying to gain the sort of information he needs. I hope that the Government will say that the amendment is very sensible, as this is something that needs to be done. Earlier, I slightly goaded the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, who is no longer in his place, about extra regulations being introduced. We could do with a whole Session of Parliament to deregulate and get rid of some regulations, or at least consolidate them.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para12"></a>I understand that ignorance of the law is no excuse for not complying with the law, but owing to the way that the law is presented at the moment, ignorance may become mandatory. I say that slightly jestingly, of course, but I am concerned that it is increasingly difficult for people to know what their responsibilities are or where they can find out the information that they need. The time has come to say, &quot;Enough is enough". It is time to address this topic, especially with regard to the Water Framework Directive that will be introduced after the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-44_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   The Minister will not be surprised that I support the spirit of the amendment, although it might have been strengthened if the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, had mentioned the Water Framework Directive in it.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para13"></a>In the course of the Committee stage, I have made a few notes of the aspects on which the Water Framework Directive may require primary legislation that are not contained in the Bill. The Minister will probably tell me that they can all be done by secondary legislation, but I press the point that this is a missed opportunity.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para14"></a>I shall give the Committee some brief examples. First, the river basin management plan, which has been much quoted and is much needed, will have no force in statute. The planning Bill that we shall debate shortly in this House could be a mechanism for the statutory changes that would be needed to give the appropriate powers or duties to planning authorities that the Water Framework Directive would need. However, this Bill would have been a more appropriate place, as the changes have to do with water.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para15"></a>Secondly, this Bill gives no legal powers to adapt the water charging regime, which might be required by the Water Framework Directive. I accept that that is a bit in advance of its time, but it is certainly something that we need to consider.
<P>

<a name="30429-44_para16"></a>Thirdly, the Bill makes no alteration of the definitions in the Water Resources Act 1991. That is mundane, but it is very important. For example, there is &quot;polluting matter" and &quot;pollution", &quot;coastal waters" and &quot;transitional waters". The first definitions are from the Water Resources Act and the second from the Water Framework Directive. That will cause considerable confusion. Defining what is meant in legislation is important. If we have altered the Water Resources Act in this Bill, we should have altered it in a way that anticipates a directive that we will bring into force by the end of the year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-45_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I have found myself in substantial agreement with many of the comments made by those on the Opposition Benches. I agree with the idea lying behind the amendment, especially insofar as it asks for a consolidation Bill.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para0"></a>As we often do in the House of Lords, I shall speak from personal experience. One great virtue of this House is that there are people here with experience of a wide variety of matters, and when they speak they frequently know what they are talking about.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para1"></a>My experience in this matter goes back to the period of my life when I was a publisher of engineering magazines, one of which was called World Water&#151;although that is not apposite to this discussion. This was the period when the then Government, starting with Jim Prior, were reforming industrial relations. Part of my activities in those days was to negotiate on matters such as salaries and conditions of work with the NUJ and SOGAT. That was always interesting and sometimes amusing.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para2"></a>As Members of the Committee will remember, during that period there was a succession of Acts reforming industrial relations, each of which meant that one had to go back to the previous Act, cut out bits of it and paste it in. By the end of that period, when there were four or perhaps even five successive Acts, the NUJ was bamboozling me and I was bamboozling it. That was not quite the best way of going about business, and I am perfectly sure that that is true here. The Bill that we are now discussing amends other parts of existing legislation. I merely put in a mild plea to gather it together and make a consolidated Bill&#151;if not now then at some time in the reasonably near future.

<P>
<A NAME="30429-45_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I can tell noble Lords present&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and I dealt with the Greater London Bill, as did my noble friend Lady Farrington&#151;that this is a straightforward, completely comprehensible Bill. I do not know what people are complaining about.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para3"></a>However, clearly there is a principle here which goes rather wider than the Water Bill&#151;that is, whether, when a number of pieces of legislation relate to one subject, Parliament as a whole should provide time for making consolidation. Frankly, I do not believe that we can deal with that matter on the basis of one amendment to one Bill. Indeed, the convention is that the priority for consolidation Acts is determined by the Law Commission rather than by a government department.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para4"></a>I can certainly give noble Lords the assurance that we shall draw attention to the views expressed here in relation to the consolidation of water legislation, both existing and prospective, in relation to the Water Framework Directive and the secondary legislation that we are proposing in that respect. However, I do not believe that we can carry that on the basis of an <P>


<a name="column_GC180"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>amendment to one Bill. It rather goes to the heart of the unsatisfactory nature of our proceedings and the complete incomprehension of them outside, and we shall not solve that tonight.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-45_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: &quot;</B>Shame", says my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith. I believe that we all accept the thrust behind the amendment and I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Howie, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. The noble Lord tempts me to sit in on every Bill and each time to seek to insert one of these clauses at the end. If enough pressure were exerted on all the Bills every time, perhaps something might be done. However, I digress.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para5"></a>I have to say to the Minister that this is an issue to which I believe we shall return and, indeed, we shall probably tie it up with some stronger wording on the Water Framework Directive. I do not believe that just because the directive is not included, that is an excuse for it not to be considered. I believe that it is something worth doing. However, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_GC181"></a>

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column GC181</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and within the handling of this Bill. Indeed, that sentiment has been reflected by other noble Lords at various stages and on various days.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para18"></a>We have just spent our sixth day&#151;I believe that we shall just about finish tonight&#151;of the Committee stage on a Bill which I suspect the Government originally thought was small and would go through on the nod. I believe that its complexity has been highlighted by the many amendments put forward by noble Lords from all sides of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para19"></a>As I said in debate on an earlier amendment, I believe that it will be the summer before the Bill goes through both Houses. Therefore, we feel very strongly that the implications of the directive should have been considered and that we should have had a chance to debate them fully.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para20"></a>As I said earlier, statutory instruments are all very well, but we do not get a chance to debate them in the way that we have been able to do in relation to this Bill. So far as we are concerned as legislators, they are frustrating and they are even more frustrating for those with businesses and interests outside the House who find the way that we do our business even more confusing.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para21"></a>In addition, I believe that not using the Bill in the way that we should have done will place extra time demands and resource demands not only on the Government themselves but also on all the businesses which employ people. They must go through the statutory instruments to ensure that they are up to date and running with them. I do not believe that that helps to keep costs down; I believe that it puts costs up. Therefore, that is my reason for tabling these two amendments.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para22"></a>As I said earlier, we are very disappointed. From the speeches from all sides of the House at Second Reading, it was clear that it was decided to push ahead without implementing the Water Framework Directive with the Bill. I believe that I have said enough because so much has been said on this issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-45_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I do not believe that at this stage the length of my speech will indicate the depth of my feeling about this matter. Therefore, I say simply that I look forward to returning on Report to the issue of the Water Framework Directive and its inclusion in the Bill. We end the Committee stage as we started it&#151;by discussing the directive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-45_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   With the promise of returning to this matter, I suspect that noble Lords will not accept the fact that we have not included the Water Framework Directive within the Bill. However, clearly we have already started on the process of its transposition, and that should be completed by the end of this year. As I said earlier, that is the normal way of proceeding with European directives.
<P>

<a name="30429-45_para23"></a>What I object to in this amendment is that, given that we have discussed the subject and do not see eye-to-eye on it, nevertheless, even if noble Lords are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>completely happy with the rest of the Bill, they want to delay it. That is not appropriate and I do not believe that I could ever accept a delay in commencement issued in those terms. I believe that it would also establish a difficult precedent on future occasions. Therefore, I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-45_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   The Minister will not be surprised that I am not surprised by his answer, nor that I am disappointed. The Minister has just said that this is the way that we would normally proceed with Bills. I accept that but, as I said previously, we have an opportunity&#151;perhaps once in 20 years&#151;to get everything together but we cannot do so. I believe that my words, as reflected by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, indicate great disappointment. However, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30429-46_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: I tabled this change to the Title of the Bill in optimistic anticipation that the Government would accept my Amendment No. 1 on the Water Framework Directive. This amendment seeks to reflect that change. However, at this stage the Government have not chosen to accept the amendment. I believe that this small amendment gives a flavour of what we have lost by not including a wider consideration of everything that makes up the water environment, and that is a disappointment to me. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-46_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Again, I support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. We have spoken about the whole question of water use, its resource, its quality and also the role that it has in protecting the environment. That is something that we very much share. I am not sure whether the Minister will be able to accept the amendment but it is certainly something that is very dear to all our hearts. We want efficient use of water and we want to conserve water. However, at the same time, we also have a responsibility for the environment. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-46_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I want to support my noble friend because I have spoken for most of the afternoon about this very topic. Its importance cannot be underestimated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-46_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I note the consistent views of noble Lords on this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-46_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   If the noble Lord suggests that it may be a challenge, I believe that it is one that we shall gladly accept. While the Bill has gone through its six days in Committee, many good ideas have come together. I want to record my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to others and, in particular, to the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, for the way that the Bill has been handled.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429-46_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   As I rise to withdraw the amendment, I want to associate myself with the thanks both to the Ministers who have taken part and to my colleagues and other noble Lords who <P>

Perhaps noble Lords did not take on board the breadth of possibilities within the Bill and perhaps it has suffered from not being dealt with on the Floor of the House. But I hope that on Report noble Lords, besides those of us here, will take a wider interest in it. I believe that the subject merits it. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Laird  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>Whether Section 69(3)(b) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 permits the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to issue a statement criticising the United Kingdom Government in connection with the war in Iraq; whether they accept the view of the commission that the war in Iraq is a violation of international law; and whether public authorities are permitted to engage in such criticism.[HL2270]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  Section 69(3)(b) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 states that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission shall advise the Secretary of State of legislative and other measures which ought to be taken to protect human rights on such occasions as the commission thinks appropriate. The Government are satisfied that, in providing advice on this matter, the commission has not gone beyond its remit. The legal basis for war in Iraq was set out in the Attorney-General's Written Answer of 17 March, col. WA3. This remains the Government's view.
<P>

<a name="30429w01_para0"></a>The Government always consider and value advice from public bodies, such as the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, whether it is supportive or critical.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn:  </B>  Administrations North and South agreed the current logo for the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) and the Joint Secretariat, with titles in English and Irish, in April 2001.
<P>

<a name="30429w01_para1"></a>In July 2002 the Joint Secretariat was asked to consult with both administrations on a tri-lingual logo for the council and the secretariat. Work on a revised logo has been completed by officials and will be submitted to the two administrations following the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland.

<a name="30429w01_para2"></a>With the exception of those covered by Schedule 4 to the Ombudsman (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, the actions of the Northern Ireland departments, including those relating to the affairs of the North/South Ministerial Council, are subject to investigation by the ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="30429w01_para3"></a>As provided for in Annex 2, Part 7, paragraph 5 of the agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland done on 8 March 1999, contained in Schedule 1 to the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 and Article 8(1) of, and Schedule 2 to, the Ombudsman (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, the North/South Implementation Bodies are subject to investigations by the ombudsman.

<A NAME="30429w01_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Laird  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is the current purpose of the First Minister's and Deputy First Minister's office in Northern Ireland.[HL2357]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn:  </B>  The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister is a fully functioning department of the Northern Ireland administration with a wide range of responsibilities. The strategic objectives of the department include supporting Ministers and the institutions of government; building a programme for government and modernising government programme; and promoting better community relations, a culture of equality and rights, and targeting social need and promoting social inclusion.
<P>

<a name="30429w01_para4"></a>During suspension of the devolved institutions the staff who provide direct support and advice to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister have been redeployed to other duties. Otherwise the department continues to discharge functions which have been conferred on it by statute or added to by the Northern Ireland Assembly from time to time. In particular the department is concerned with economic policy issues such as the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative incorporating the Strategic Investment Board, rights and equality issues including the establishment of the Office of the Commissioner for Children and Young People as well as the promotion of modernisation and the development of electronic delivery of public services and information.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Avebury  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Why over 40 per cent of local authorities have not reviewed their policies, and 65 per cent of those have not reviewed their travelling people policies, to ensure compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998, as shown in the recent study by the Cardiff Law School; and what steps they will take to ensure that local authorities do comply with the Act, particularly with regard to travelling people.[HL2431]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>  The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not have direct responsibility for ensuring that local authorities review their policies to comply with the Human Rights Act. However, the forthcoming joint ODPM/Home Office guidance on managing unauthorised camping will, among other things, remind local authorities of their duties under the Human Rights Act. A victim of an act of a public authority which is not in compliance with the Human Rights Act has a right to bring legal proceedings in connection with the breach.

<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_wqn6"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What was the outcome of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's review of its Focus Programme.[HL2565]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister for Trade   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My honourable friend, Mr Rammell, in his reply of 12 December to a question by my honourable friend Derek Wyatt, in another place (Official Report, col. 459W) concerning the FCO's IT systems, promised a further announcement on the FCO's Focus Programme.
<P>

<a name="30429w01_para5"></a>We reviewed all the FCO's information and communications technology programmes earlier this year, in the light of the financial constraints we face. Given the relative low priority of the Focus Programme and a substantial increase in its estimated

<B>29 Apr 2003 : Column WA92</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cost from &#163;23.5 million of &#163;42 million over six years (reflecting significant changes to the scope of the programme which involved a greater training requirement, enhanced security arrangements and, post-11 September, a considerable extra investment in back-up and disaster recovery), we decided to negotiate the cancellation of the contract for the Focus Programme. Agreement was reached with Fujitsu and the cancellation took effect from 31 March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30429w01_para6"></a>At the point of cancellation, the FCO had spent in the region of &#163;9.5 million on the Focus Programme. From this expenditure, we will retain a global electronic directory and a facility allowing on-line discussion groups to help cross-departmental team working. The directory will provide the FCO with savings estimated at &#163;2.5 million over the next five years. We will also be using one of the software licences brought as part of the Focus Programme to develop a new FCO intranet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_wqn7"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether any goods subject to the EU arms embargo have recently been approved for export to Bosnia. [HL2566]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   In September 2002 the Government issued a licence for the export of military listed components for use by the Canadian contingent of the Stabilisation Force (SFOR). The components are for logistical purposes. They will be used for the specific purpose of repairing palletised load handling system vehicles used for transporting containers.
<P>

<a name="30429w01_para7"></a>Bosnia and Herzegovina is subject to an EU arms embargo (imposed by Common Position 96/184/CFSP). The embargo was put in place mainly to ensure the safety of international troops and civilian personnel deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This decision does not affect the Government's continued support for the EU Common Position on arms exports to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
<P>

<a name="30429w01_para8"></a>The decision was made in accordance with our practice occasionally to make an exemption to our interpretation of the embargo by approving exports of non-lethal military goods to humanitarian, media or peacekeeping organisations where it is clear the embargo was not intended to prevent those exports and there is a strong humanitarian case for them.
<P>

<a name="30429w01_para9"></a>Her Majesty's Government fully support the Canadian element of SFOR and recognise their legitimate need for the right tools and reliable vehicles to carry out their job effectively. The decision underlines HMG's continued support for the work being done by SFOR in maintaining security and development in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  The Government have been actively involved in promoting peace in the Great Lakes region. We have given full support to the inter Congolese Dialogue, which successfully concluded at its recent plenary session in Sun City, South Africa, providing for the early establishment of a transitional national government in the DRC, with a view to democratic elections in two years' time. The UK is an active member of the international committee tasked with supporting this process.
<P>

<a name="30429w02_para0"></a>The UK, through the FCO, has also been actively supporting the United Nations Observer Mission to DRC (MONUC), which is currently considering how best to deploy its mandated peace-keepers on the ground in the DRC. We are also a major contributor to the Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme for the Great Lakes. In Rwanda, contributions totalling &#163;5.047 million were made from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool in 2002&#150;03 to support the World Bank Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme.
<P>

<a name="30429w02_para1"></a>In the next few weeks, we hope to agree with Government of Rwanda a Memorandum of Understanding covering UK support for Rwanda's security sector reform process. The MoU sets out how the UK could support the reform of the police, military, paramilitary and intelligence services, and the civilian structures responsible for their oversight and control, to improve the security of poor and vulnerable Rwandans.
<P>

<a name="30429w02_para2"></a>In Uganda we are actively engaged with a systematic review of defence policy and the resulting needs. The process is fully owned by the Ugandans and a draft White Paper on Defence is due in mid-2003. The paper will address both defence needs and the affordability of the various options set against the government's poverty reduction goals. In the interim we continue to engage with the government over the scale of their defence expenditure to ensure that these poverty reduction programmes are not affected.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  Our approach to funding work on vaccine development is to support multilateral efforts, for instance through the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), for which we are providing &#163;14 million over five years. We also support the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) for which we are providing &#163;35 million over five years focusing on research, development of new vaccines and effective delivery of services. We will not therefore support the Cuba-Africa project.

<P>
<UL>What progress is being made with the job evaluation exercise carried out for the purposes of Agenda For Change in respect of the professions allied to medicine. [HL2512]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   Job evaluation is being used to compare job demands across a wide range of National Health Service jobs and match common NHS jobs with the pay bands in the proposed new NHS pay structure. We and staff organisations have developed a number of nationally agreed profiles to reduce the need for local NHS organisations to carry out individual job evaluations when the new pay system is introduced (subject to the outcome of staff organisations' consultations).
<P>

<a name="30429w03_para0"></a>Eighteen profiles for allied health professional jobs have already been agreed and published. Further profiles are currently being discussed to ensure that a wide range of allied health professional jobs are covered.

<A NAME="30429w03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   Under the proposed agreement for a new National Health Service pay system, a new NHS job evaluation scheme will be used as the basis for measuring the relative weight of NHS jobs and allocating them to pay bands. The scheme is currently being used to evaluate a number of the most common NHS jobs and help produce national profiles for these jobs. Subject to ratification of the proposed agreement following consultation, these profiles will be used to help match individual posts to the pay bands in the new pay structure.

<A NAME="30429w03_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Jopling </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What has caused the delay in answering the concerns of the National Farmers' Union over plans for the disposal of fallen stock following the ban on burial of carcasses on farms.[HL2353]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  The Government have been in discussion with the NFU and representatives of the collection and disposal industries since April 2002 with a view to developing a national fallen stock collection service. Failure to make more rapid progress was because no agreement could be reached on how the service should be funded. The farming unions were calling for a scheme that was fully funded by government. This was not possible, both because it would have contravened state aid rules and because it is government's view that industries, including the agricultural industry, should be responsible for disposing of their own waste. Agreement has now been reached with the industry on a shared funding approach which farmers will be invited to join on a voluntary basis.

<P>
<UL>What are expected to be the public sector financial and manpower costs of implementing European Union Regulation 2000/0259 on the disposal of fallen stock; and[HL2412]
<P>
How they propose to enforce European Union Regulation 2000/0259 on the disposal of fallen stock where it applies to poultry; and[HL2413]

What is the present strength of the State Veterinary Service; and by what it is to be increased to administer European Union Regulation 2000/0259 on the disposal of fallen stock.[HL2414]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30429w03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The EU animal by-products regulation insofar as it relates to disposal of fallen stock including poultry will be enforced by local authorities. It is not possible to estimate the total cost of this enforcement activity which will depend on the level of compliance. The State Veterinary Service has 279 permanent veterinarians and 56 casual veterinarians.
