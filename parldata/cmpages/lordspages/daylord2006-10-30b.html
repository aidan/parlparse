Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord
Falconer of Thoroton): My Lords, with permission, I should
like to make a personal Statement. Last Thursday, I answered a question
from my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours about proceedings in
Parliament in which he had mentioned someone&#146;s name. In my
answer, I said
that,</p><ul><a name="06103018000219"></a>&#147;those
proceedings were not even broadcast on the BBC Parliament

correct. The BBC Parliament channel did in fact broadcast those
proceedings without any editing, both live on the internet and on
television the following day. The name was later edited out
whenthe proceedings were broadcast on &#147;Today in
Parliament&#148; and &#147;Yesterday in Parliament&#148;. I give
my unreserved apology for having misled the House in that

establishment reports, an action plan will be produced within two
months of publication. It will respond in detail to each
recommendation. Her Majesty&#146;s Government are grateful to the
chief inspector for her insightful report on Pentonville, which is
undoubtedly an establishment under pressure. The Prison Service has
acted to relieve some of this pressure by reducing Pentonville&#146;s
operational capacity by more than
100.</p><p><a name="06103018000016"></a><b><a name="61030-0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06103018000466"></a>Baroness
Stern:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
helpful reply, but does she agree with me that the chief
inspector&#146;s report shows that Pentonville is a prison in crisis?
Is the Minister aware that the chief inspector says not just that
Pentonville is affected but that all our local prisons are overcrowded
and pressurised? Since one-third of our 80,000 prisoners are held in
local prisons, can the Minister tell the House how the Government plan
to respond to the crisis that affects not just Pentonville, but all
local
prisons?</p><p><a name="06103018000017"></a><b><a name="61030-0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06103018000467"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, it would be
incorrect to describe Pentonville as being in crisis, although it is
undeniable that it has significant difficulties. It is one of the
busiest prisons in London, receiving between 90 and 100 prisoners per
day. There is a very targeted action plan for Pentonville, and a
further action plan will be produced one year after publication of the
report. Appropriate plans are in place for all local prisons, both to
manage the pressures that they are experiencing and to keep prisoners
safe.</p><p><a name="06103018000018"></a><b><a name="61030-0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="06103018000468"></a>Viscount
Bridgeman:</b> My Lords, the chief inspector found
that prisoners spent an average of five hours per day out of their
cells, while the prison record showed eight hours. This is not the
first time that the chief inspector has found such a discrepancy
between prison records and reality. What action are the Government
taking to ensure that their information on prison regimes is more

realistically, will continue for quite a long time, even if new places
are made available and other forms of punishment are used more
frequently? Does she agree that there is a real need for the further
training of officers when they are going to be working under pressures
of that kind? Conflict and anger management, for example, would have
assisted in some of the things that Her Majesty's Chief Inspector

of that are clear. We are also taking steps to ensure that officers
receive the appropriate training to enable them to look after people in

and infested with vermin, that too many prisoners lacked pillows and
toothbrushes and that, on one occasion, the prison even ran out of
food. Were the Government aware of those problems before the chief

governor has been changed and three new governor posts created.
Additional funding has been provided for the prison to bring about
physical improvements, including the refurbishment of the visits
complex and the staff mess and artwork for prisoner accommodation
areas.

probably the only person in this place who has worked in Pentonville
for six years as a member of the board of visitors. May I ask two
questions? First, what proportion of the prisoners there nowadays are
remand prisoners, and does that not complicate the authority and
working of the prison? Secondly, when I was working there, the main
trouble was lack of lavatories and showers. Has that situation been
improved?</p><p><a name="06103018000033"></a><b><a name="61030-0001.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="06103018000483"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness
is absolutely right: one of the problems that Pentonville faces is the
number of prisoners on remand. Approximately 65 per cent of the prison
population is on remand. As the noble Baronesswill know, that
brings about a high turnover and an inability sometimes to establish
prisoners on education programmes, with problems inherent in that.
Those issues are being addressed. We are looking at relieving the
pressure on Pentonville and sharing its allocation with other local
prisons. We have a detailed action plan for better addressing the
problems at Pentonville and learning from our experiences elsewhere,
which has
worked.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61030-0001.htm_wqn1"></a><a name="06103018000007"></a>Natural

However, the candour cannot conceal the crisis that has overwhelmed
Defra. What jobs will be lost in the light of the cuts and what of
Natural England&#146;s promised programme will be shelved or

this year&#146;s budget is approximately &#163;200 million. Our
overall spend is &#163;3.7 billion. I do not diminish the
significance of &#163;200 million&#151;noble Lords should not
misunderstand me&#151;but it is a very small part of our overall
budget. Within that, the adjustments to each of the bodies affected are
quite small.</p><p><a name="06103018000038"></a>No part of Natural
England&#146;s programme will be affected. Some areas will proceed a
little more slowly than others. Its start-up money has not been
affected. It is important for a new organisation to be able to start up
effectively&#151;it was launched earlier this month. Its core budget
is &#163;170 million. When other funding streams for which it is
responsible are factored in, that rises to some &#163;225 million. It
has overall responsibility for more than &#163;400 million when one
adds in the EU agrimoney schemes. I realise that that is not core
funding, but Natural Englandcan comfortably cope this year at
the start-up. I understand that no one will be dismissed from their job
as a result of the cuts to which the Question
refers.</p><p><a name="06103018000039"></a><b><a name="61030-0001.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="06103018000488"></a>Lord
Barnett:</b> My Lords, as I understand it, Natural
England&#146;s major function is to enhance the environment. Is this
not a crazy time to be contemplating a cut in the budget, especially
when the whole budget is petty cash in public expenditure terms? Will
my noble friend reconsider the
cut?</p><p><a name="06103018000040"></a><b><a name="61030-0001.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="06103018000489"></a>Lord

difficulty explaining to anybody that &#163;200 million is petty
cash, but it is petty cash in terms of our overall budget of
&#163;3.7 billion. It is a small part of the money. We have a
satisfactory arrangement for readjusting Natural England&#146;s
budget, and we do not envisage any of its major schemes being affected.
Some will probably start a little later than others&#151;it had a
spending moratorium in the period before it was launched. I understand

regret the announcement of a &#163;12 million budget cut on

Rooker:</b> My Lords, it is both.
The&#163;200 million is made up of approximately &#163;40
million of work for various agencies that was delayed last year and
brought into this year, as that helped to meet last year&#146;s
pressures relating to TB compensation and the final cost of foot and
mouth disease; &#163;55 million of work that was delayed last year
and moved into this year to cope with a reduction in end-of-year
funding arrangements; and &#163;65 million of surplus capital charges
that turned out to be no longer available under new rules. Some
&#163;23 million related to the RPA&#146;s running costs, and there
was &#163;10 million extra emergency preparedness for avian
influenza. That is how the &#163;200 million is made up; there is no
secret about it. Some was underspend, some was overspend, and some was
expenditure delayed last year and brought into this
year.</p><p><a name="06103018000045"></a><b><a name="61030-0001.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="06103018000494"></a>Lord

people might say that the cut is not the reason why it has had to make
the redundancies, but I do not know. I would have to take further

expectations. The budget was fixed at least at the last CSR and would
therefore have been known last autumn. It certainly was not known when

in his original Answer to the previous Question I thought I heard the

this year? Many of us feel that that is very much related to the
massive overspend in the Rural Payments Agency and its problems with
the single farm payments scheme. Surely, the shortfall should have come
from the contingency fund and not from slashing vet services at a time

available to it to cope with the difficulties that have arisen over
single farm payments. I could give the House a lecture&#151;it would
not thank me for it&#151;about the resource elements and the capital
elements. The fact is that the figures stack up. Of the &#163;200
million,

responsibility of the RPA, but that is not the cause of the deficit in
relation to the change programme because the Rural Payments Agency had
extra funds to deliver that. It is true that there are some
difficulties, but one cannot blame the single farm payments or the

2008 beforehand, and we need to go through the 2006 and 2007 payment

million but turned out in March 2006 to be &#163;50 million; the land
register was estimated at &#163;6.8 million but eventually
turnedout to be &#163;16.1 million; and the customer
communications contract was originally estimated in 2003 at &#163;1.2
million and turned out to be &#163;9.8 million. Did the department
not realise that it would have some customer inquiries due to those
major changes?</p><p><a name="06103018000060"></a><b><a name="61030-0001.htm_spnew44"></a><a name="06103018000509"></a>Lord

other people are looking at what happened in the past. We have to try
to learn the lessons from the past, which is why the system cannot be
turned out overnight. At least a year

the Treasury imposed cuts in the previous financial year. Will he

nothing about the cuts for last year, if that is the word that was

mynoble friend&#146;s question on the ground that there have
been some myths abroad about the so-called cut of&#163;3
million to the State Veterinary Service. There has been no &#163;3
million cut to the State Veterinary Service this year. In fact, there
has been no cut to the State Veterinary Service this year. The overall
budget for the SVS remains the same after a switch of funding where
money was switched around from the capital budget, which was increased
by &#163;3 million to replace resource money. The budget for the
State Veterinary Service has been increased this year by &#163;16
million, and another &#163;3 million will be made available for avian
influenza preparedness, giving a net increase of &#163;19 million for
2006-07, the year we are in at the moment. There has been no &#163;3
million cut. It is true that there was a cut in the resource area, but
that was money swapped from capital. It did not lose any money. The
State Veterinary Service got the same amount of money as was in the
original budget, so talk about a &#163;3 million cut is not
correct.</p><p><a name="06103018000065"></a><b><a name="61030-0001.htm_spnew49"></a><a name="06103018000514"></a>Lord

<p><a name="06103018000104"></a>I accept that this is a declaratory
statement but it is none the worse for that, and I do not believe
thatany civil servants have lost their job because of its
inclusion in that legislation. Indeed, in Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9,
which are very welcome, the Government are doing the same thing. For
two years they have been assuring us that schools already have a duty
to promote the well-being of pupils but now they see fit to make it
clear in legislation. That is what we are trying to do today with the
right to education.</p><p><a name="06103018000105"></a>It might be
worth asking why the Joint Committee on Human Rights felt it necessary
to include such a provision in the Bill. Children&#146;s right to
education is under threat across the world. Political situations,
refugee situations and poverty mean that many millions of children do
not receive an education. Some teachers even lose their lives for
providing education. I was moved and horrified to read that on 25
September Safia Ama Jan was gunned down in Afghanistan by the Taliban
simply for teaching girls and giving them their right to education.
Teachers in Ethiopia are also being put under a great deal of pressure
for providing education. When children&#146;s right to an education
is being threatened across the world, it is time for us in this
country, where most children are lucky enough to be provided with a
good education, to stand up and say so proudly in our legislation,
clarifying that we support children&#146;s right to a suitable
education appropriate to their needs.</p><p><a name="06103018000106"></a>Our amendment is not a blank cheque. We
are asking for no more than the right of the child as enshrined in the
UN convention, not any particular kind of education in a particular
school. Lines 7 and 8 of Clause 1 refer to the education
functions,</p><ul><a name="06103018000220"></a>&#147;to which
this section applies...(so far as they are capable of being so
exercised)&#148;.</ul><a name="06103018000204"></a>To
fulfil our requested duty, a local authority must show only that it has
done its very best to provide an appropriate education for each child.
Obviously, we hope that the education they provide will be appropriate
for every child and properly resourced.
<p><a name="06103018000107"></a>We are not asking for a lot. We are not
asking for anything that the Government say is not a child&#146;s
right. We are asking that we stand up and be counted on this, and make
it quite clear. The ordinary man in the street does not have the
opportunity to go to a legal library to consult half a dozen Acts of
Parliament and a good deal of case law in order to find out what the
law is. We have here an opportunity to make it absolutely clear that it
is the duty of the local authority to ensure that parents are carrying
out their responsibility to give their child an education, whether that
education is provided by the authority itself, bought in from another
authority, provided at home, at an independent school, or in another
appropriate way. That is all we are asking for: it is little enough. I
beg to move.</p>

Judd:</b> My Lords, I warmly applaud this amendment.
We greatly appreciate the consideration the Minister has given our
concerns, and the meetings he has facilitated with those responsible
within the department. We had good discussions together, and we very
much appreciated that
opportunity.</p><p><a name="06103018000109"></a>It
seems to me sad that a new education Bill should be couched in
the&#151;very necessary&#151;language of management and
implementation, but fail to spell out at its masthead what we are all
trying to achieve. It fails to establish the rallying point around
which the rest gather. That is profoundly sad. Teachers are under
intense pressure, as are all those involved in the education system.
There is great dedication in the profession and among others providing
education. That everything required of them by this Bill is in order to
fulfil the right of the child to education should appear in words of
one syllable in the opening clauses of the Bill. This is the standard
to which everybody else can then rally.</p><p><a name="06103018000110"></a>My noble friend has argued very well that
there are the four pillars. We all take the four pillars seriously and
judicial opinion supports the Minister on this matter. The Minister
also asks why we need to put it into the Bill when it is in the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child. We have been reminded by my
noble friend the Chief Whip that we must not argue at length matters
that have already been argued, so I will forgo that temptation. Let me
simply say that, yes, it is there in the convention, and we should be
proud of the part we played in making that convention a reality. If we
played that splendid part, surely it should be reflected and spelt out
in our own legislation?</p><p><a name="06103018000111"></a>The
noble Baroness referred to Scotland. In all our discussions I have not
heard any convincing arguments as to why what was possible in
Scotland&#151;that is, to have this rallying point&#151;is not
possible south of the Border. There is one other matter I want to
mention: in enthusiastically supporting the noble Baroness, I have one
quarrel with something she said today in the House. She said that local
education authorities will only have to prove that they have done their
best. I should like to feel that local education authorities must
demonstrate that they have done their level best. It is a strong
obligation.</p><p><a name="06103018000112"></a>The noble Baroness
went on to make a telling point about the realities of the educational
challenge across the world and the penalties being paid by courageous
teachers. If we can back up what is set out in the convention by
spelling it out in our own legislation, it indicates what should be the
policy and in the legislation of other countries. As I say, that is a
powerful point.</p><p><a name="06103018000113"></a>But much nearer
home, I am concerned about what is happening today. For example, for
children in detention and those caught up in immigration and asylum
procedures, none of which is of their making, it is not absolutely
clear in all circumstances that appropriate education is being
provided. We want to ensure that the children caught up in such painful
psychological experiences are not still further damaged by not having a
key pointer in the legislation 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_16"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which states that there must a right to appropriate education for all
children and that the local education authority has a responsibility to
provide it. That is terribly important in order to ensure that children
who find themselves in a predicament for which they are not responsible
are not deprived of the essential education which they should be
receiving. It is a struggle to ensure that it is provided, so a
specific reference in the Bill would greatly strengthen the position
for those who are trying to make sure thatit
does.</p><p><a name="06103018000114"></a>The House should be
grateful to the noble Baroness for giving us an opportunity, as we pass
this Bill, to spell out clearly what it is all about, what is its
purpose and why we should all get behind it and make it a
success.</p><p><a name="06103018000115"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew74"></a><a name="06103018000539"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and
Skills (Lord Adonis):</b> My Lords, the House is
grateful to the noble Baroness for giving us the opportunity to discuss
this issue yet again, but I fear that the Government&#146;s position
remains as it was on the two previous occasions we considered it. While
we wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment and intent behind the
amendment, as supported by my noble friend, we do not believe it would
be appropriate to make this change to primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06103018000116"></a>After long and
careful consideration, we still believe that the current legal
provisions, supported by jurisprudence, are the most effective way of
securing the right to education, and we do not support these further
changes. In particular, I note that Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 relate only
to duties on local authorities. This could cut across the existing
fourfold foundation of the right to education which, as I expounded at
length at cols. 657 and 658 on17 October, also places duties
on parents, the Secretary of State and governing bodies. I hesitate to
read it out again, but on that occasion I also cited at length the
judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, in the case of
Ali v Lord Grey School, a judgment issued only this year. It strongly
supports the fourfold foundation which, the noble and learned Lord
said,</p><ul><a name="06103018000221"></a>&#147;has endured
over a long period because it has, I think, certain inherent
strengths&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/10/06; col.
657.]</ul><a name="06103018000205"></a>We believe that
seeking to elevate one of those elements risks weakening the others.
Furthermore, an effect of placing a duty on local authorities to secure
the right of every child to suitable education in the way proposed here
could, we are advised, be used as a legal argument to cut across
parental choice and the right of children to be educated either at home
or at an independent school. As regards Scotland, raised by both my
noble friend and the noble Baroness, it is right that there is such a
provision in the law of Scotland, but it has not yet once been deployed
in a legal case, so we are not in a position to judge what its effect
might be on those who wished to avail themselves of an education that
was not of a kind approved in other respects by the public authorities.
For these reasons, I regret to say that we oppose these
amendments.

Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the
Minister for his not unexpected reply, and I am grateful too to the
noble Lord, Lord Judd, for his support. The Minister asked why we want
to put this duty on local authorities. It is because this Bill puts a
duty on local authorities to identify those children not receiving an
education. What therefore follows to us poor logical souls is that one
should also make it clear whose duty it is to ensure that the
child&#146;s right is secured. Of course the parents and the
Secretary of State have responsibilities. Those are clearly stated in
other pieces of legislation. Indeed, local authorities have a number of
levers and sanctions in order to assist them, to make sure that the
parents fulfil their part of the bargain. But it is because of
something elsewhere in the Bill. We felt it necessary to bring forward
the amendment today.</p><p><a name="06103018000118"></a>The
Minister says that in Scotland the situation has not been challenged
legally&#151;that there are no legal cases. Well, QED, say I. That
sounds to me as if it is quite clear and not causing any problem. That
is why there are no cases.</p><p><a name="06103018000119"></a>We
feel very strongly about this. It is absolutely fundamental. We believe
that it should be stated right up front in the Bill. We would like to

38&#148;<p><a name="06103018000125"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, this group of amendments will, I hope, pave
the way to greater responsibility from schools in their role in
improving integration and cohesion in the community. Amendment No. 3 is
a probing amendment to ensure that the proposers of new schools are
expected to set out their plans for fostering community cohesion in
their submissions under Clause 7. I am sure that, with the provisions
of the amendments in my name and in the names of others, that would be
a routine matter. I therefore propose to spend my few moments talking
about the other amendments.</p><p><a name="06103018000126"></a>Of those, Amendments Nos. 7 and 19 are
substantial and indeed incorporate new material. Amendment No. 24 is a
matter of tidying up thereafter. Amendments Nos. 7 and 19 specify
significant and important new duties and where these new duties should
lie. Amendment No. 7 places a duty on the governing body of a
maintained school to promote the well-being of pupils at that school
and, in the case of a school in England, to promote community cohesion.
Amendment No. 19 places a duty on the chief inspector to report
on,</p><ul><a name="06103018000216"></a>&#147;the contribution
made by the school to community
cohesion&#148;.</ul><a name="06103018000206"></a>I shall
be focusing in my comments upon community cohesion; others, I am sure,
will welcome and focus upon well-being.
<p><a name="06103018000127"></a>The background to this is the debate that
we have been having for some weeks, nationally and within this House,
on the nature and responsibilities of faith schools in our system. I
pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Baker, for initiating an important
debate on this at Report. I must, however, distinguish between paying
tribute and necessarily agreeing. That is for further down the
road.</p><p><a name="06103018000128"></a>How are we to deal with
the dangers of what David Hume referred to as &#147;errors in
religion&#148;? A thorough education in the history of religions
indicates both the benefits that religion can give and has given to
society as well as to individuals and also the disastrous consequences
of what Hume called &#147;errors in religion&#148;&#151;errors
which can promote exclusion rather than inclusion, myopia rather than
vision, imprisonment of the mind rather than freedom of thought,
zippered lips rather than free-flowing pens, and, from the point of
view of the amendment before us, errors which might promote disruption
rather 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_20"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than cohesion. These errors are dangerous, and there is no one in this
House who would encourage them. In the context of
education&#151;education of the young&#151;these errors are doubly
dangerous. The question is how to avoid them, and that is the intent of
these amendments.</p><p><a name="06103018000129"></a>The force of
the amendments is first to give a duty to school governing bodies and
to point schools in the direction of promoting cohesion&#151;that is,
towards cohesion and inclusion rather than disruption and exclusion.
Secondly, they would give a duty to the chief inspector to inspect and
report on how effectively such a responsibility is being met. I believe
that the inspection system we have is capable of doing this in a
thorough, fair and comprehensive&#151;as well as
comprehensible&#151;manner.</p><p><a name="06103018000130"></a>As
a way of avoiding the danger of such errors, the amendments can be
commended for three distinct reasons. Many ways of avoiding the dangers
of error have been proposed, but I suggest there are three reasons for
supporting these amendments. First, they build on an established,
proven and universally applied set of procedures developed by Ofsted
over the years. This is no new and uncertain proposal introduced to
deal with a specific group of new emerging schools. Secondly, they
rightly link this duty to promote cohesion and the duty to inspect that
with the inspection of the whole school. Let me illustrate. Among other
responsibilities that the chief inspector has for reporting, he or she
has to report on the quality of education, educational standards, and
the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils. These
matters for report and inspection are a roll call of the markers of
excellence in education.</p><p><a name="06103018000131"></a>The
point that this makes is that cohesion in our society starts with
literacy and numeracy, with educational standards and quality of
education. That has to do with cohesion in society, but it does not end
there. Cohesion in society has much more to it than that. The amendment
affirms, and does so emphatically, that in our society, promoting
cohesion shares in the order of priorities at the heart of our
education system.</p><p><a name="06103018000132"></a>The third
advantage of this way of dealing with potential difficulties born of
errors is that our call for cohesion in society is presented not as an
additional rod for the back of new or even existing schools; this is
not a new way of subjugating the aspirations of schools. Rather, it is
a positive encouragement to join an educational system which is
informed by the core values and aspirations of our society, of which
cohesion is one, and rightly features very highly in current times. It
is also an invitation to participate in encouraging those
values&#151;here summed up by the word
&#147;cohesion&#148;&#151;and to help embed these values in the
education system, the education that is provided by each school

cohesion. We expect that such reports will be acted upon if necessary.
They are not simply pieces of paper; there is a firmness and an
intention to deal with the dangers of what would disrupt, rather than
provide, cohesion within the community. On behalf of what I can regard
only as a rainbow coalition, I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06103018000134"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew77"></a><a name="06103018000542"></a>The

incredibly unpopular. I find this amendment waffle, meaningless and
platitudinous. Can anybody seriously imagine a school whose purpose is
to promote the ill-being of pupils or community incohesion? This is
legislative waffle of the worst order&#151;it is intellectually
sloppy and should never be seen on the face of any legislation.
Actually, it means that you should not have religious schools, because
they are by their nature exclusionist. They fail to promote cohesion
because they say they do not want people of other religions to mix with
each other, and so should be
illegal.</p><h5><a name="06103018000233"></a>3.45

Carnegy of Lour:</b> My Lords, I could not disagree
with my noble friend more. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, has never
promoted anything sloppily. That was an unfortunate comment to
make.</p><p><a name="06103018000136"></a>I rather wish that the
noble Lord&#146;s Amendment No. 3 was grouped with Amendment No. 12,
tabled by my noble friend Lord Baker of Dorking, as they deal with the
same matter. However, I strongly support the noble Lord, Lord
Sutherland. On the &#147;Today&#148; programme this morning,
Clifford Longley said in effect that what counts is not so much the
admission system as what goes on in a school. That is of course true.
In Committee, I supported my noble friend Lord Baker&#146;s
amendment, but at the same time I wondered if the approach put forward
by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, was not more realistic and
achievable.</p><p><a name="06103018000137"></a>I am a strong
supporter of faith schools. However, it is essential for life in the
modern world that young people should learn early to relate naturally
and make friends across racial, religious and social boundaries.
Without that experience and those skills, young people will have very
limited life chances indeed. In a faith school where one in four or
five students comes from another background, cross-border relationships
happen automatically and naturally. That is the point that my noble
friend will doubtless make again when he moves his amendment. Where
there are few or no &#147;outsiders&#148; in a school, those
chances are very limited. We can all think of circumstances where that
might happen. I think that in this country the problem arises not
mainly in Anglican and Roman Catholic schools but in the schools of the
other religions.</p><p><a name="06103018000138"></a>It would be
wise to expect every faith school, not just new ones, to arrange with a
school of a different background for shared activities such as lessons,
sports opportunities and social events. There might even be a twinning
of schools. I do not know whether that is the sort of thing that the
noble Lord,

friend thought that he was being woolly. I think that most of us were
able to read between the lines of the noble Lord&#146;s extremely
tactful and diplomatic speech&#151;which was clear quite and
definite.</p><p><a name="06103018000139"></a>The expectation that a
school will make it possible for young people to inter-relate with
those from different backgrounds has to be there. The inspectorate is a
way of achieving that provided that Ministers are prepared to back up
the inspectorate once it has made proposals. Although I fear that I
trespass on territory which will be covered by my noble friend, I
support the noble Lord, Lord
Sutherland.</p><p><a name="06103018000140"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew79"></a><a name="06103018000544"></a>Lord
Northbourne:</b> My Lords, my contribution will be
very short. I claim a historical association with this amendment. I
have always believed that it was the duty of Ofsted to prevent
&#147;error in religion&#148; and, indeed, &#147;error in
non-religion&#148;. Sixteen years ago, my amendment, accepted by the
then Conservative Government, inserted into the 1990 Bill which formed
Ofsted &#147;spiritual, cultural, social and moral values&#148; as
part of Ofsted&#146;s duties. I therefore entirely support the view
that responsibility for enforcing those qualities and for reporting
schools which are breaking the rules should lie with Ofsted and not
with any kind of arbitrary apportionment of the number of places
available.</p><p><a name="06103018000141"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew80"></a><a name="06103018000545"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Peterborough:</b> My Lords, I too
support this group of amendments. They address the concern we have
discussed on a number of occasions as we have considered the Bill.
Throughout this debate there has been considerable agreement that our
schools should support and provide community cohesion. We have
disagreed about how that can be best achieved in practice, but faith
schools will want to contribute to the process; indeed, to continue to
play their part in meeting that aspiration. I therefore welcome these
amendments, which achieve that in the right way.</p><p><a name="06103018000142"></a>Like the noble Baroness, I was listening
to the &#147;Today&#148; programme this morning and heard Clifford
Longley make that comment. It is perhaps worth adding that he made it
in the context of reflecting on the work that had been done in
Liverpool to bring together the Protestant and Catholic communities by
Archbishop Derek Warlock and Bishop David Sheppard. It was in that
context that he said it was not admissions policies but what goes on in
the school that matters. I think that is right. These amendments would
place responsibility for community cohesion where it belongs, with the
governing body and Ofsted. I therefore support
them.</p><p><a name="06103018000143"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew81"></a><a name="06103018000546"></a>Lord

inspected. The inspectorate will have its own benchmark. It will be
able to judge and will not simply leave it to the
school.</p><p><a name="06103018000144"></a>I ask the Minister to
address one point when he comes to respond: does he foresee a time, not
too distant in the future, when he could report back to the House on
some of the results of this series of inspections, perhaps after a year
or so? As we are all aware, there is an intense and serious interest in
this subject in the House, and we would like to know whether the
inspectorate regime will work.</p><p><a name="06103018000145"></a>As a supporter of church schools I have
always felt, as do other of your Lordships, that far more important
than the fact of faith schools is what is being taught in the syllabus
and, even more important, how it is being taught. I see the dimension
of social cohesion, whether or not it is being promoted, running
through every aspect of the inspection: how history is taught, or
religious education. It must not be simply propaganda, but real, proper
education. Because this amendment is designed to ensure that, I support
it most warmly.</p><p><a name="06103018000146"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew82"></a><a name="06103018000547"></a>Baroness

Alton of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, as one of the
signatories to this amendment I am happy to support the noble Lord,
Lord Sutherland, who has so ably moved it today. In answer to the noble
Earl, it is worth mentioning a letter from Christine Gilbert, Her
Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Ofsted, which was sent to the
Minister in the last day or so. She
says:</p><ul><a name="06103018000217"></a>&#147;I believe that it
will be possible for inspectors to make a judgment on this matter by
drawing on evidence including, but not restricted, to self evaluation
from the self evaluation form ... and that this will be possible
while retaining the overall balance and focus of the
inspection&#148;.</ul><a name="06103018000207"></a>There is
nothing woolly about that. It is a very hard-headed approach that will
be capable of assessment. It represents one of two approaches your
Lordships can take to this matter, which was raised last week in your
Lordships&#146; House by the noble Lord, Lord Baker. He has done us
all a service in raising this issue. He has concentrated our minds on
trying to find a way
forward.
<p><a name="06103018000149"></a>One way we could do that, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said, would be under AmendmentNo. 12,
after Clause 45, which we will debate later. That amendment will invite
your Lordships to impose quotas on schools. We would then have to
determine whether to fix a quota that would be compulsory on all new
faith schools. Last week, the Secretary of State stated that that
principle could be extended to all Church schools&#151;and concern
was expressed about that during last week&#146;s debate. It sent a
lot of hares running and has led to huge opposition, not just from
Catholics but from the Jewish community&#151;the Minister will have
seen the letter today from the Board of Deputies of British Jews and
others.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_24"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103018000150"></a>Many impracticalities that go beyond
philosophical problems are tied up with quotas. Parents would have to
be arraigned through a test act to find out what they believed or did
not believe or whether they fitted into the 75 per cent or the 25 per
cent. Imagine a situation in which a devout Anglican applied for
admission to a new faith school on a Monday and on Tuesday discovered
that their child would not be able to enter under the 75 per cent rule.
On Wednesday, they could say that they have committed themselves to
atheism and, on Thursday, their child could go to that school. On
Friday, they could have a roadside conversion and return to the fold.
That is what this kind of approach would lead to and that is why the
Government and Opposition Front Benches, as well as the noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, said last week that they were opposed to the idea of
statutory quotas&#151;and that is why that approach is doomed to
failure.</p><p><a name="06103018000151"></a>However, the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, concentrated minds on what we need to do to create a
sense of social cohesion, and the amendment, as an alternative to the
quota approach, does precisely that. It is the other way forward and
builds not only on the proven track record of the inspectorate, as my
noble friend has said, but the consensus that was created in the 1944
Education Act. Driving a coach and horses through the admissions
procedures that were agreed in 1944 will create a precedent that will
undoubtedly be used to touch all faith
schools.</p><p><a name="06103018000152"></a>Better than that, your
Lordships would be wise to follow the counsels of the noble Lord, Lord
Sutherland, and build on the 1944 agreement. After all, that was a
consensual agreement not just between faith communities but between
members of the national Government of the day&#151;RAB Butler was the
Education Secretary and his Parliamentary Private Secretary was
Chuter-Ede, a member of the Labour Party. Agreement was reached after a
painstaking search for a way forward. In education, surely it is better
to try to find consensus, rather than confrontation. In particular, I
pay tribute to role of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and her
colleague in another place, Nick Gibb, in trying to find a way forward
that would meet all the needs of Members of your Lordships&#146;
House.</p><p><a name="06103018000153"></a>The amendment is
attractive because, unlike a quota approach limited to new faith
schools, it touches all schools, whether in the maintained or
voluntary-aided sectors. All schools can be inspected on how they plan
for and stimulate community cohesion and a sense of personal
responsibility. If a school is failing in that regard, it will be
possible to require constructive
actions.</p><p><a name="06103018000154"></a>There are three ways
forward. We can do nothing; we can opt for the quota approach that will
destabilise successful schools and cause division and resentment,
because quotas will be used as a shoe-in to catch all faith schools; or
we can use an approach basedon the cultivation of duties,
fostering a love of our institutions, the encouragement of deep
tolerance and respect for other faiths and traditions. That would imply
that this is not merely an issue for new faith

way forward and I hope that the House will support
it.</p><h5><a name="06103018000234"></a>4

Peston:</b> My Lords, before I go on to my main
point, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, would do well to read the history of
the Education Act 1944, which was not remotely as he described it. It
was about RAB Butler buying the Church schools into the system so that
he could get the reforms that he wanted. The idea that it was the
result of some philosophical discussion and meeting of minds simply
does not correspond to the historical
facts.</p><p><a name="06103018000156"></a>I was astonished to see
this amendment on the Marshalled List as it seems totally to contradict
the rest of the Bill. If I wanted to promote community cohesion, as I
have always done, I would stick to the view that I have had all my
adult life that children should go to their local schools, that those
schools should be comprehensive and that they should be full of all the
children in the community. The Bill is about the exact opposite of
that. Therefore, to use a word from Yiddish, the chutzpah of tabling
this amendment absolutely amazes me.</p><p><a name="06103018000157"></a>I am a great admirer, as is everyone, of
the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, but, given David Hume&#146;s view of
religion and the possibility of religious schools, quoting him as being
in favour of the amendment is equally prosperous. Therefore, although I
have a delicacy of touch that the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, does not
have, I feel that he is right to draw our attention to this matter. How
do you promote community cohesion in a system in which children will be
in segregated schools of all kinds and will be encouraged to go to
those schools? The idea that the path to follow is to tell children in
a school in which they have opted to mix only with people of their own
kind that community cohesion is important and that it is part of their
education, and thinking that they will believe that,

felt that I would be better off keeping my mouth shut. I have read all
the debates and, in the various contributions from those in favour of
religious schools, I have read more nonsense on education than I have
seen for a long time. They should recognise that they are in favour of
segregation and not community
cohesion.</p><p><a name="06103018000160"></a>Perhaps I may give a
personal example. I went to an east London grammar school in the old
days of the Butler education system. There was no community cohesion in
that school. We knew that we were the cleverest boys in east London. We
knew that those who did not go to our school were less than us.

I grew up and had children, they went to the local comprehensive
school. My friends attacked me because my eldest son, who has not done
badly in life, went to a combination of two secondary modern schools. I
was accused by all my friends of sacrificing my eldest son because I

Jewish children. They do not seem to contain any black or brown
children or Catholics or anything else. If people want their children
to be educated in that way, of course they can use their private funds,
but we are discussing schools that have been paid for out of the public
purse. There used to be a view that you did not use money from the
public purse for private causes, so I stick to my view and still
suggest that this is persiflage.

open to the wider community. However, one or two other things which are
perhaps implied need to be said; first, that Church schools must be
distinctively Christian in character&#151;that is why they exist;

word &#147;cohesion&#148; is enough. This is where I have quite a
lot of sympathy with the intent behind the amendment of the noble Lord,
Lord Baker, if perhaps not with the form. It is not simply a matter of
cohesion whatever the case; the amendment must relate to a vision for
society, as the noble Lord said earlier. It has to relate to shared
values and about the virtues that we are prepared to inculcate in our
children.</p><p><a name="06103018000168"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew92"></a><a name="06103018000557"></a>Lord
Baker of Dorking:</b> My Lords, I support the

Sutherland, the former Chief Inspector of Schools. He has written
almost as many reports on schools as I have read. We are both experts
on inspectors&#146; reports.</p><p><a name="06103018000169"></a>Before I further express my support for
the amendment, perhaps I may chide the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for
saying that the implication of my amendment is to impose quotas of 25
per cent. The amendment would not do that. It would give powers to
local authorities, if they wished so to use them to create community
cohesion, to establish a quota of up to 25 per cent. We must not hear
misrepresentations as early as four o&#146;clock; it really is a
little bit naughty.</p><p><a name="06103018000170"></a>I support
the amendment because it is helpful. It is not an alternative to my
amendment. It is helpful because faith schools should be inspected more
regularly and in a tighter way&#151;I agree with the noble Lord
entirely on that. However, it is being asked to carry a weight which it
will not be able to sustain. It would make the inspectors the
instruments of a policy&#151;on which I suspect all your Lordships
agree&#151;for a happier and more cohesive society. Can we really ask
the inspectors to do this? First, as the noble Lord knows, the
inspectors inspect schools on very precise details; for example, is
this school teaching history to key stages 3 and 4 correctly? In
foreign languages, are the children able to practise sufficiently the
language which they are studying? Do they have the equipment to do it?
What is the quality of teaching? Again and again, some very subjective
statements are made, but the inspectors are used to working in close
definitions. The first thing they would have to ask is&#151;I am not
being pettifogging&#151;what is the meaning of
&#147;community&#148;? If an inspector examines an exclusive Jewish
or and exclusive Muslim school in, let us say, Tower Hamlets, what is
the community of the cohesion with which the inspector is concerned? Is
it just Tower Hamlets? Or is it Tower Hamlets and East Ham? Or is it
the whole of east London? Or is it the whole of London? That is what
inspectors will ask and what the Government will at some stage have to
define. They will have to define exactly what &#147;community&#148;
means in this context.</p><p><a name="06103018000171"></a>I
suspect that what the amendment is getting at is a report on
relationships&#151;the relationship of that school with the other
local schools, the relationship of

will have to look at precisely what is taught in schools under
religious education. That was raised by the noble Lord I think. The
inspectors will have to make a comment on one of the most difficult
fine lines in religious education: where religious education ends and
indoctrination starts. That central question has to be asked.
Inspectors will have to comment on it and they will have to attend a
large number of religious instruction classes in schools to determine
that. If religious instruction veers off into indoctrination,
communities can suffer a lack of cohesion and trouble can
start.</p><p><a name="06103018000172"></a>Inspectors have a huge
task. On relationships between schools, which my noble friend Lady
Carnegy mentioned, and whether schools can have joint activities, it is
marvellous if that can happen, but let us be realistic: there will be
no joint activities in sport between a Muslim school and a non-Muslim
school because of dress codes; there will be no combined swimming
galas; there will be no combined music classes; there will be no
combined art classes; and in drama there will be no desire to stage
<I>Romeo and Juliet</I> between a Muslim school and an Anglican school
because every page of <I>Romeo and Juliet</I> is against the Koran. I
suspect that there will not be a great desire to stage a combined
<I>King Lear</I>, because filial devotion in that play is not exactly
what it ought to be.</p><p><a name="06103018000173"></a>I ask your
Lordships to be realistic about this. I entirely accept that
relationships and activities are important between schools and they
exist in some areas: for example, Catholic schools in Glasgow take
their children to the local mosque. I know that because of an episode
that appears in a very good novel I read this year, which I recommend
to your Lordships, called <I>Be Near Me</I> by Andrew O&#146;Hagan.
It is about a Catholic priest in Glasgow and some ghastly Catholic
yobbos&#151;sometimes Catholic schools turn out ghastly
yobbos&#151;who are taken to the local mosque and the result is not
community cohesion. But that is
fiction.</p><p><a name="06103018000174"></a>Schools can come
together on civics and learn about that, but the degree of co-operation
beyond that is not all that great. That is why people who support my
amendment would like to see schools where children of different faiths
play together in the playground, sit together in maths and physics
lessons, talk together over lunch and go home on the same buses. We
think that that is a happier system and a better way to create
community cohesion.</p><p><a name="06103018000175"></a>I turn to
one specific point made by the noble Lord that reports should be acted
upon. As the writer of many reports, he will know that sometimes
reports are acted on and sometimes they are not. A recent Chief
Inspector of Schools, David Bell, put in a report only a year ago that
many Muslim
schools,</p><ul><a name="06103018000222"></a>&#147;must adapt
their curriculum to ensure that [they provide] pupils with a broad
general knowledge of public institutions and services in England and
help them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures
in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony&#148;.</ul><a name="06103018000208"></a>We all agree with that. What have the
Government done as a result of that report? Perhaps the Minister can
direct our attention to particular papers that have 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_29"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been issued by the department to implement that recommendation from the
inspector, because many reports, as he will know, are not acted
on.<p><a name="06103018000176"></a>Mr Bell also
said:</p><ul><a name="06103018000218"></a>&#147;The growth in
favour of schools needs to be carefully but sensitively monitored by
government to ensure that pupils at all schools receive an
understanding of not only their own faith but of other faiths and the
wider tenets of British
society&#148;.</ul><a name="06103018000209"></a>The
department is miserably deficient in that. In the past year, I have
asked various questions of the department on faith schools and I get
the reply that the information is not held. I have asked how many
children from other faiths go to faith schools and it has no idea. It
did not even know that the admissions procedures in some faith schools
require photographs, which is actually
illegal.<p><a name="06103018000177"></a>For some time, the
noble Lord, Lord Adonis, has had on his desk a report about a school in
Sussex which has only four pupils and which has radical weekends. Why
has he not closed that school? If we are to depend on
inspectors&#146; reports, we must be satisfied that they are acted
on. Although I support the amendment&#151;I think it embodies the
direction in which we all want to go&#151;by itself it carries a
weight which the issue cannot bear and that is why I hope many noble
Lords will later support my
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103018000178"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew93"></a><a name="06103018000558"></a>Lord

7 and 19. I attended a comprehensive school&#151;I was not fortunate
enough to get into a grammar school&#151;and all my children also
went to comprehensive schools. I support faith schools because they
have provided good education, whether they are Church schools, Jewish
schools, Sikh, Hindu or Muslim schools. There are only seven or eight
state-funded Muslim schools, not 124. I heard the noble Lord, Lord
Baker, saying on television this morning that they might be applying.
The Association of Muslim Schools told me this morning that only seven
are seeking voluntary-aided status. We need to have facts rather than
scaremongering to the effect that there are hundreds of Islamic and
Muslim schools that want state funding; we need to make sure that all
the rules are in place.</p><p><a name="06103018000180"></a>I
apologise to the House that I was not here on Report&#151;I was
discussing bail, which was a big national issue for us all. The
Association of Muslim Schools told me that it already does as much as
it can and it is prepared to do more in terms of intra-community
relations and with community cohesion work it already teaches the
common vision, common purpose and core values that the noble Lord, Lord
Sutherland, talked about. We need to 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_30"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make sure that our children have a sense of belonging, citizenship,
rights and responsibilities. There is more in terms of recognising
diversity. Cohesion is not a single way process; it is a two-way
process. We have to recognise and celebrate our diversity. We need to
create an environment to strengthen relations in the workplace, in
places of worship and the community, wherever we can. We need to have a
process of cohesion that is important and the empowerment of
communities so that they can engage.</p><p><a name="06103018000181"></a>When we give the example of state-run
schools in Tower Hamlets, we are not talking about Islamic schools,
faith schools, or Jewish schools. Even the state-run schools have 98
per cent children from one community, so it is wrong just to target
faith schools. If we go to Bradford, Leicester or Southall we will find
state-run schools with 98 or 99 per cent of children from one
community. So community cohesion needs to be taught and promoted, but
in every school. We all need to do it. I was speaking in Nottingham
yesterday and I said that we have to open up our mosques every Friday
for a samosa and cup of tea for every member of the community who wants
to come in, because there is nothing to hide. It is such
misunderstandings, whether in the media or through politicians, that
lead to people thinking that there is an alien community.</p><p><a name="06103018000182"></a>On that issue I could not understand why
the Muslim community has suddenly become a burden in society when we
all recognise that during the Second World War Muslims gave their lives
to save the way of life of our democracy. There are cemeteries in
Woking commemorating Muslims who died for Britain fighting against the
fascists and the Nazis. Muslims were part of the British society that
helped to rebuild this country's economy after the Second World
War&#151;in the steel and textile industries&#151;and they have
been very good contributors to British
society.</p><p><a name="06103018000183"></a>Very recently, because
of a few criminals, because of a few who were given time on television
and in our newspapers to provoke entire
communities&#151;andalso to insult and demonise our religion
and communities&#151;we have this huge debate. The Muslim community
and the Association of Muslim Schools welcome any opportunity to be
able to meet requirements for community cohesion and I am delighted to
support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103018000184"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew95"></a><a name="06103018000560"></a>Lord
Dearing:</b> My Lords, I begin by saying to the noble
Lord, Lord Peston, that I respect those who take the view that there
should not be faith schools, but it is because we have faith schools
that we havethe amendment. To the noble Earl, I say that I
understand his point and I am glad that he made it. If the amendment
stated just that schools should be in favour of community cohesion, he
would be right, but it states &#147;promote&#148;. There is an
active verb there and that makes the difference. To the noble Baroness,
Lady David, I say that I listened to what she said about twinning. That
could be one way in which cohesion could be promoted in particular
cases.</p><p><a name="06103018000185"></a>I join with others in

because I have felt for a long time that this is the kind of thing that
we needed state schools and faith schools to be doing actively. I have
argued actively for that within my own Church and more widely. The
noble Lord said that there were limits within which it was practical to
expect schools of different faiths to relate to one another. I
understand that. But I have been to Church of England schools that
predominantly contain children of the Muslim faith. They get on and it
works. We play Pakistan at hockey and it works&#151;except that they
win. So there are these
opportunities.</p><p><a name="06103018000186"></a>I want to be
brief, so I mention a practical suggestion for promoting cohesion that
came fromSir Cyril Taylor, chairman of the Specialist Schools
and Academies Trust. He wrote a paper arguing that one of the problems
in promoting community cohesion is that many immigrants do not have
much capacity to speak English. That is especially true of many Muslim
mothers who come to this country. Many of them cannot speak any
English. His proposal is that schools in such areas should take it on
themselves to run English classes after school for those people. He
points out that the Learning and Skills Council has recently withdrawn
funding for such courses in Tower Hamlets, where there is a huge demand
for them.</p><p><a name="06103018000187"></a>I say to the Minister
that that is something that is practical, useful, to the point and
deserves funding. Perhaps, in the fullness of time, it would be good if
the Minister made available non-statutory guidance on what constitutes
good practice in that
regard.</p><p><a name="06103018000188"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew96"></a><a name="06103018000561"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> My Lords, like my noble friend Lord Baker,
the amendment is a fine set of words. If we were dealing with an
amendment to the European Union constitution, I know how it would be
used&#151;because I have seen a great deal in Sub-Committee E of how
the European Union is capable of making a great deal out of very small
words and for ever taking power, based on what some kind person has
written down. This is just the sort of wordy provision that could be
used by an organisation such as the Commission to do a great deal.
However, I share my noble friend&#146;s concern that it will not
be.</p><p><a name="06103018000189"></a>The amendment has the
virtue that it applies to all schools. It would apply to the socially
selective, comfortable, suburban comprehensive school which, if
community was defined as it might be, would have to find ways to reach
out to its neighbouring council estates&#151;perhaps by having some
socially blind admission system by ballot or
whatever.</p><p><a name="06103018000210"></a>The promotion of
community cohesion seems to me to be a thoroughly worthwhile
enterprise. If this is something that is going to be used and turns out
over time to have teeth and to move the faith schools in the direction
of being more part of the community than they are, I will find this a
thoroughly good amendment. I share the pessimism of my noble friend
that it will, but I will support this amendment happily because I am
allowed to be optimistic from timeto time.</p>

with something the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said. He implied that paying
10 per cent of the costs of the school gives you total rights over it.
Suppose that the independent schools got together and said: &#147;We
will pay 10 per cent of the cost of a new university but only pupils
from independent schools will be allowed to go to it&#148;. That
would be outrageous. Why, then, is it acceptable that any religious
group, by paying10 per cent of the cost of the school, can
have exclusive use of
it?</p><p><a name="06103018000191"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew97"></a><a name="06103018000562"></a>Lord
Alton of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, I would not like
the noble Lord to leave that point on the record as it is, because I
did not say that. What I made clear, I hope, in my remarks and in my
speech last week on Report was that where a community has made
considerable sacrifice to build a school, it should have rights to send
its children to the school that they have contributed towards, whereas
if quotas are imposed, members of that community may well be excluded
from
it.</p><p><a name="06103018000192"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew98"></a><a name="06103018000563"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord is saying exactly
what I thought he said; namely, that by making a sacrifice of the order
of 10 per cent of the cost of that school, that community should have
rights over the whole of its
admissions.</p><p><a name="06103018000193"></a>I approach this from
a different point of view. I think faith schools are desirable. I think
to be true faith schools, they have to be supported by their Church and
have a decent community of that Church as part of their make-up, so I
am very happy that Church schools should be founded and should be
partially selective on religion. But I really do not think that saying
that providing a little bit of money entitles us to all the places is
the basis on which we should run our society. I think we should not
tolerate but welcome faith schools and we should welcome the provision
of the particular kind of education that they make available to all of
us.</p><p><a name="06103018000194"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew99"></a><a name="06103018000564"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I would like to go
back to the beginning of this debate. When I read this amendment, I was
absolutely joyful because it seemed to me that in an amazing way,
starting with the amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Baker, tabled,
which had enormous point to it, we were getting to the point of what
the whole of this semi-argument has been about; that is, to have an
inclusive education system. One of the best ways to do this is to build
on the strengths we already have in the community. There are huge
strengths in the faith schools and in the plans that the
Government&#146;s plans involving an extension of trust schools, and
there are other ways of doing this. I congratulate everybody who signed
up to the two major amendments that we are
discussing.</p><p><a name="06103018000195"></a>Governors of schools
will also welcome this but I must nudge the Minister on one concern I
have. When more trust schools are set up, the promoters of these
schools are going to have rather more rights in appointing the
governors of that school, and the number of elected parent governors
will go down. I 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_33"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would have thought that the aim of everything we have talked about is to
get the local community much more cohesive and I hope that even more
school governors will come from the local community. Joining-up and the
use of extended schools are very well thought-through plans for just
how things are going to operate for the benefit of the whole community,
as well as for children in the schools. I also support the idea of
language teaching and the various other ways in which local communities
can join together.</p><h5><a name="06103018000235"></a>4.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06103018000196"></a>I doubt whether we could have
had this debate a year or two ago, as the tensions were just too high.
The very fact that, since the noble Lord, Lord Baker, moved his
original amendment, everybody has got down to seeking the most
proactive, effective way forward reflects very well on your
Lordships&#146; House and the Government, so I congratulate them. I
hope that we will look to the approach proposed. I have to say that
there have probably been too many education Bills, even during my time
in this House, but for those who do not believe that the voluntary
approach will work there will be other occasions when we can review its
effectiveness. We underestimate the ingenuity and spiritual approach of
those of varied nationalities and religions&#151;and those with no
religion&#151;involved in our community who want to make a success of
all the talent we have in this country.</p><p><a name="06103018000197"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew100"></a><a name="06103018000565"></a>Baroness
Morris of Yardley:</b> My Lords, this debate has been
very interesting; it seems, to some extent, to have got into the right
position today. I welcome the amendment and would find it difficult to
vote against it. Who could vote against an amendment that promoted
community cohesion? That, at least, gives us a common starting
point.</p><p><a name="06103018000198"></a>There have been two
sides to this debate: faith schools and community cohesion. Although
the issues overlap, we have run the danger in previous stages of the
Bill of thinking they were one and the same. Two weeks ago I would have
agreed with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, but
given the views of some Churches, particularly the Catholic Church, I
think it wise not to push it and make the arrangement
compulsory.</p><p><a name="06103018000199"></a>I welcome the
attitude of the Church of England in saying that it will voluntarily
seek, as it does now, to admit people from other faiths. I say to my
good friend the Archbishop of Birmingham, with whom I have worked
closely over the years, that having been around many
Catholic&#151;and Jewish&#151;schools I do not believe for a minute
that admitting one in four children of another faith or none would take
away from the Catholic nature of the school. The values of the school
were strong enough not to be weakened by the admission of one
non-Catholic pupil in four. Although I accept the Archbishop&#146;s
comments that he has a primary obligation to parents of Catholic
children whom they want to have a Catholic education, we have a wider
obligation to all children in the community. Had the Archbishop
voluntarily

not just some of them&#151;we were only ever talking about the new
schools&#151;will have 25 per cent of people who are not of the
Catholic faith&#148;, I do not think that it would have set back
Catholic education in this country. However, that position ought to be
arrived at through consensus. I hope that this issue does not fall off
the agenda, and that in months and years to come the Churches will find
that they can change their position.</p><p><a name="06103018000200"></a>I would not have chosen to teach in a
faith school, and had I had children I would not have chosen to send
them to one, but I have always defended other people&#146;s right to
make that choice. It is strange that, at this time, when we are talking
about defending our liberties and things that have been precious to us
for generations, we are in danger of becoming the first generation to
say that we can no longer tolerate somebody else&#146;s decision to
enrol their child at a faith school because of the nature of the
community. If we ever did that, we would be giving up a liberty that we
have had for many centuries. I also acknowledge the role that Church
schools played in educating poor children long before the state did
so.</p><p><a name="06103040000001"></a>I
turn now to the essence of this amendment. I welcome our being, to some
extent, where we should have been. What is society worried about? I do
not think that it is worried about faith schools. Society is worried
that a number of factors are leading our children to live and learn in
segregated communities. Faith schools have been thought of as an
example of that, which is why they are entwined in this debate. So, I
welcome the fact that there should be something in legislation about
promoting community cohesion. But there are dangers in that. There is a
real risk that, because it is in legislation, we will think that it is
already done or that it will take place. There is a risk of Parliament
sending the message that we do not acknowledge the teachers, schools
and communities that have already been working very hard to do the
things we are talking about now. To some extent we are putting in law
the best of what already takes
place.</p><p><a name="06103040000002"></a>I say to the Minister
that this is the third attempt to do this. The first attempt was back
in my day when we had a similar debate on faith schools in an education
Bill. I was not around long enough to see the publication of the
proposal, and I cannot lay my hands on it now, but it was a list of 20
ways in which faith schools can promote community cohesion. However,
when looking for that piece of paper from 2002, I found another one:
the Local Government Association&#146;s <I>Community
Cohesion&#151;An Action Guide</I> from 2004. I shall read out some
words from the section on education, which was backed by the
DfES:</p><ul><a name="06103040000080"></a>&#147;Educational
institutions have a key role in building cohesion...promoting the
values of equality, diversity and mutual respect...to promote
shared values... similar life
opportunities&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06103040000077"></a>through
literacy and
numeracy&#151;<ul><a name="06103040000085"></a>&#147;cross-cultural
contact, through mixed intakes, school twinning and community-wide
extra-curricular
activities&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06103040000003"></a>My only
reason for reading that out is to show that we must be very clear about
what we now expect to change. What will change when we pass the Bill? I
understand the importance of putting it in legislation, 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_35"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and I understand the importance of inspection. But we need to see the
bigger picture of what a socially cohesive community looks like. Are we
saying that it looks like a school where all children are not of the
same race or ethnic background, do not come from the same street, and
do not have the same faith? If that is true, what powers will we give
anybody to change that? Will we put in schools&#146; admissions codes
of practice that they should ensure that the school is ethnically
balanced? I hope not. We must go beyond this. The noble Lord, Lord
Baker, was right in this respect: it is easy to sign up to this, but
more difficult to see exactly where are the levers that will make sure
that it is implemented. I welcome it; it has got us out of a difficult
position in this debate. I very much hope that the amendment of the
noble Lord, Lord Baker, will be accepted by all churches in future
years.</p><p><a name="06103040000004"></a>I ask the Minister to
flesh out what he expects to change. What is his evaluation of the two
previous attempts to bring this about without legislation? What powers
will be needed to make sure that we end up in a different position from
the present one? Quite honestly, if schools look as they do now in five
years&#146; time, we will not have achieved our objective. Schools
are some of the most cohesive institutions in our community&#151;more
so than almost anywhere else. Schools have not caused the problem we
have at the moment; schools have mitigated its worst excesses. Do not
blame schools, but look to them for a solution. It behoves us to say to
schools: thanks for what you have been doing, but what can we do to
help you be more effective in promoting social
cohesion?</p><p><a name="06103040000005"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew101"></a><a name="06103040000375"></a>Lord

the various views expressed about community cohesion in the debate, and
I feel that something is missing. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, has
just mentioned in passing the principle of shared values. Community
cohesion without shared values is not of much use. In saying that, I
wish particularly to point out one factor. Let us not beat about the
bush, we are concerned about Muslim schools more than we are about the
existing faith schools. We have heard over and over again that everyone
likes to send their children to faith schools because they are more
disciplined, they have uniforms and they hold to old-fashioned values.
That is fine, and we are not worried about that. But let us consider
very strict schools such as Jewish Hasidic schools, and then we should
be worried, as we should have certain worries about Islamic
schools.</p><p><a name="06103040000007"></a>I assume that they will
be single-sex schools, a point which no one has mentioned. There is
nothing wrong with single-sex schools, but are we sure that gender
equality will be taught in these schools? Gender equality may be a
subject in girls&#146; schools, but will it be one in boys&#146;
schools? There is no point in fudging the issue because we all know
that this is an

country, this is a major issue and I think it is about shared values.
In this country, we do not want to lose the way we treat
everyone&#151;women, men, girls and boys&#151;in a faith
school.</p><p><a name="06103040000008"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew103"></a><a name="06103040000377"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> My Lords, Members on these Benches also
support the amendments, and your Lordships will not be surprised to
hear me say that. At every stage of this Bill amendments have been
tabled from these Benches on the duty to promote social cohesion,
despite the fact that in Clause 33(6) there is already a duty on
foundation schools to promote it. We tabled an amendment to put the
duty on local authorities, with their more broad-brush powers that
affect whole communities. In Amendment No. 11, to be debated later, we
also seek to put the duty on admission forums rather than just have it
in guidance. So noble Lords will not be surprised to see that we
support Amendment No. 7, which started life as a duty to promote
well-being but now has had the duty to promote social cohesion added to
it. However, we will have the debate on well-being in a few
minutes&#146; time when we come to Amendments Nos. 8 and
9.</p><p><a name="06103040000009"></a>If you ask an Irishman how to
get to Tipperary, he will answer you by saying, &#147;Well, I would
not have started from here&#148;. I too would not have started from
here. It is probably well known that I, like many noble Lords, would
prefer the state and religion to be separated and for our schools not
to be of any denomination. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Dearing,
has rightly said, we are starting from here. We have faith schools,
many of them extremely good schools and popular with parents. But what
we have to do is to persuade them to serve the whole community as much
as they possibly can and to open their doors to those of other faiths
or none. The question, of course, is how that is done. Indeed, the
question put by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, also occurred to me: does
a school have the capacity to actually affect social cohesion in its
community other than&#151;I stress this&#151;by addressing its
admissions policy?</p><p><a name="06103040000010"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Baker, emphasised the burden on the inspectorate produced by
this amendment. I agree that it is a heavy burden, and I want to ask
about the benchmarks. How are these things to be inspected? The noble
Lord, Lord Alton, suggested that it would be done through the
self-evaluation forms that the schools have to fill in. I am concerned
that schools that do not want to open up their admissions to those of
other faiths and none are not let off the hook by
Ofsted.</p><h5><a name="06103040000088"></a>4.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06103040000011"></a>It is not enough to make
federations, however loose or close, with other schools. It is not
enough to outreach into the community. At Report stage we enjoyed
hearing the noble Lord, Lord Alton, tell us that Catholic schools do
such outreach, but such work is not enough. These schools have to open
up their admissions to people of other faiths and none. I am somewhat
doubtful whether some of them want 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_37"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to do that at the moment, and, even if they do, unless things change,
whether people of other faiths and none will want to go to those
schools. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that schools can
be part of the solution. They are not necessarily part of the problem
of social integration, but they certainly can be part of the solution.
That is why we welcome these
amendments.</p><p><a name="06103040000012"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew104"></a><a name="06103040000378"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> My Lords, I am very pleased to return
to this debate with an amendment that is the result of the best spirit
of consensus. I begin by thanking all noble Lords who have supported
the amendment, beginning with my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour.
However, it is thanks largely to the efforts of the noble Lord, Lord
Alton, that the amendment before us has materialised, and thanks to the
combined efforts of the noble Lords who signed up to the amendment that
such consensus has been achieved. I do not think that the media or most
people in the world outside have any idea, or will ever know, much of
what has gone on behind the scenes over the past week, which is what
has brought us to this consensus. We were expecting a government
amendment but are pleased that one has not surfaced. Following the
remarks made by the Secretary of State for Education after Report last
week, we on these Benches were very wary of any kind of quota system.
While I am sure that the Minister would have handled it responsibly, we
are not so confident in his potential
successors.</p><p><a name="06103040000013"></a>Briefly, Amendment
No. 3, in my name, is a probing amendment to ensure that new schools
will be expected to set out in their proposal their plans for fostering
community cohesion. I am sure that the Minister can assure me that that
would be a matterof routine. These amendments offer a hugely
constructive way forward in how greater integration of faith schools
can be achieved. While it is the integration of faith schools that has
come under scrutiny in recent weeks in public debate, it is clear that
the successful future of a cohesive society cannot be the
responsibility of faith schools alone. That is why I am so pleased that
these amendments will apply to all schools, not just faith schools, and
will form part of their inspection regime. It is right that this is an
enterprise taken on by all in the education system, and, I should add,
by all of us outside the education system as
well.</p><p><a name="06103040000014"></a>The amendments germanely
link well-being to community cohesion. I applaud that sentiment. It is
clear that the future well-being of our nation depends on greater
integration and interaction within communities. That is the right step
forward. It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that these measures
are introduced and applied with some rigour. Community cohesion among
the next generation of young Britons is of critical importance and we
should expect all faith communities and those without a religious faith
among us to set an exemplary example. I for one, in my personal
capacity, shall be watching this like a
hawk.</p><p><a name="06103040000015"></a>In the context of this
Bill, I believe that this amendment strikes the right balance between
parental

responsibility. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, is absolutely right.
This is going to be a local effort. It is about involvement with
parental governors, which has to be the right way
forward.</p><p><a name="06103040000016"></a>These amendments
provide the perfect incentive to engender social responsibility.
Legislation is at its best where it expresses an expectation of a
standard, provides an audit on that expectation and trusts people
themselves to act upon it themselves, and yet achieves that without the
complex rigidity of a quota system. I am proud to have been able to
assist in its success and I am pleased that the Minister has been able
to abandon his previous position and give his support to this side of
the debate. The motto of these amendments could well be,
&#147;Integration, not intervention&#148;. I ask noble Lords to
support these amendments, which will enhance the efforts of schools in
playing their crucial role in spreading the values of tolerance that
will foster community cohesion.</p><p><a name="06103040000017"></a>During the passage of the Bill we have
had a full, open and often very frank debate about an extremely
important and, for some, very difficult subject. We should thank my
noble friend Lord Baker for initiating the debate. This is a classic
example of this House, as it is currently constituted, being free to
express a whole cross-section of views, openly and without fear or
favour.</p><p><a name="06103040000018"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew105"></a><a name="06103040000379"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, we are debating Amendments Nos.
7, 19 and 24 separately from Amendment No. 12, the amendment of the
noble Lord, Lord Baker, which concerns admissions to faith schools.
But, as Amendment No. 12 has the same genesis, if I may put it that
way, I need to explain how we have got to where we are with these
amendments.</p><p><a name="06103040000019"></a>When we debated the
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, at Report stage, I emphasised
the importance that the Government attach to all schools, including
faith schools, promoting community cohesion. I should say to my noble
friend Lord Peston&#151; who I am delighted to see has joined us in
our deliberations&#151;that the Bill already makes reference to
community cohesion, specifically in respect of trusts and the new types
of schools that will develop as a consequence of the Bill. I draw his
attention to Clause 33(6) of the Bill which states that new foundations
shall have requirements on them which, in carrying out their functions
in relation to the school, must promote community
cohesion.</p><p><a name="06103040000020"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew106"></a><a name="06103040000380"></a>Lord
Peston:</b> My Lords, I have a feeling that my minor
contribution was not understood. The point I was trying to make is that
you get community cohesion by going to the same school as your friends.
Once you start siphoning off people, it will get rid of community
cohesion. I may be arguing erroneously but my point was that the school
promoting community cohesion is not a feasible strategy; it needs to
have in it a full range of children. I may be wrong. I am not really
allowed to join in now anyway because I have spoken once, but that is
what I was tryingto say.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_39"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103040000021"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew107"></a><a name="06103040000381"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, I believe that it is perfectly
possible for schools, including faith schools, to promote community
cohesion in exactly the kinds of ways set out by my noble friend Lady
Morris when she quoted from guidance issued by the department. Of
course, we want to see that take place to a higher degree in
future.</p><p><a name="06103040000022"></a>As to admissions, in our
earlier debates I welcomed the Church of England&#146;s decision that
its new schools will offer places within their local community in
addition to those made available to declared Anglican families. I said
that if there was a sufficient consensus for such a policy&#151;and I
was careful to say &#147;if there was a sufficient
consensus&#148;&#151;then the Government would be prepared to
introduce a local authority power, but emphatically not a duty, in
respect of admissions to other new faith schools. I undertook that my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State and I would consult with
the other political parties, with MPs and Peers with an interest in
this matter, and with the leaders of the faith communities before
deciding on our way forward.</p><p><a name="06103040000023"></a>We
have undertaken those consultations. Having done so, as the House is
now well aware, we have decided that the best and most effective way to
promote community cohesion is to lay a duty to promote community
cohesion on the governing bodies of all schools. This will of course
extend beyond faith schools, whether new or existing, and will embrace
all schools whatever their admissions policies. We believe that this
will make it far more
effective.</p><p><a name="06103040000024"></a>My noble friend Lady
David and the nobleEarl, Lord Onslow, asked about the
definition of &#147;cohesion&#148;. An effective definition is
already available in the documentation issued by the Home Office in its
publications on community cohesion. This defines &#147;community
cohesion&#148;
as,</p><ul><a name="06103040000086"></a>&#147;the appreciation
and positive valuation of the diversity of people&#146;s different
backgrounds and
circumstances&#148;,</ul><a name="06103040000078"></a>and
the development
of,<ul><a name="06103040000087"></a>&#147;strong and
positive relationships...between people from different backgrounds
in the workplace, in schools and within
neighbourhoods&#148;.</ul><a name="06103040000079"></a>That
takes up the theme of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, about relationships
between people from different backgrounds in the workplace, in schools
and within
neighbourhoods.<p><a name="06103040000025"></a>I
believe that the whole House would agree with the noble Lord, Lord
Dearing, that those are immensely worthwhile objectives which we should
be seeking to promote and it is to the advantage of our society that
they should be advanced in schools and there should be some teeth
behind the promotion of those duties. That is why the new duties will
be supported by new inspection requirements&#151;to give them that
force.</p><p><a name="06103040000026"></a>My right honourable
friend and I are grateful to all those who have helped us to develop an
effective way forward and which is encompassed in the amendment before
us. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, who speaks with the authority of a
former chief inspector, set out the case for this approach most
powerfully. We also appreciate the support of the noble Baroness, 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_40"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lady Buscombe, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and my noble friend Lord
Ahmed. I also thank the leaders of the faith communities, who are
strongly supportive of this
approach.</p><p><a name="06103040000027"></a>Ofsted also endorses
the proposed approach&#151;both the new duty on schools to promote
community cohesion, and the new role for Ofsted in monitoring it. I
have discussed this issue in detail with Her Majesty&#146;s Chief
Inspector of Schools, Christine Gilbert, who was until last month chief
executive of Tower Hamlets Council and so brings considerable personal
experience to bear in this area. In her confirmatory letter to me she
says:</p><ul><a name="06103040000081"></a>&#147;I
welcome your proposal that Ofsted should be asked to judge the extent
to which learners contribute to community cohesion; and that in doing
so we should assess both the education of pupils and how the school
works with others in the community to achieve
this.</ul><ul><a name="06103040000082"></a>I believe that it will
be possible for inspectors to make a judgement on this matter by
drawing on evidence including, but not restricted to, self evaluation
from the self evaluation form (SEF); and that this will be possible
while retaining the overall balance and focus of the
inspection&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06103040000028"></a>We
have the powerful endorsement of Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector
and, taking up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, about how
this will be reported through to Parliament regularly, the chief
inspector makes an annual report to the Secretary of State which is
laid before Parliament and which encompasses all of the areas of
Ofsted&#146;s inspection activity during the course of the year.
Ofsted also publishes periodic thematic reports and we believe that
this would be an appropriate area for one of Ofsted&#146;s reports in
due course. They are of course published and subject to debate in this
House and in the other place.</p><p><a name="06103040000029"></a>In response to the comments of the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, on the steps that the Government take to follow up
Ofsted reports, he will know that the Government have not been dilatory
in following up the Ofsted report in respect of the particular private
Islamic school in Sussex that he referred to. There was a full
parliamentary Statement on the action that Ofsted and the Government
have taken in response to that report and we believe that the public
authorities have risen to their responsibilities in that regard. I
should stress that David Bell&#146;s remarks, which the noble Lord
cited, were in respect of private Islamic schools and it is precisely
in those schools that we have powers of enforcement where they do not
meet the required standards. In the particular case that he mentioned,
we have made it clear that we are ready to exercise to the full those
powers of enforcement if the standards of education do not meet the
required level.

Baker of Dorking:</b> My Lords, the report that the
noble Lord refers to by David Bell specifically referred to inadequate
standards in private schools and it anticipated that the Government
would react. That report has not been debated in this House as far as I
know and the Government have taken no action upon it. If the noble
Lord&#146;s amendment is to be effective there must be action upon
the report.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_41"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103040000031"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew109"></a><a name="06103040000383"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, that is simply not correct.
Where Ofsted reports unfavourably on the standards in a private Islamic
school, enforcement action follows and there are set procedures to
ensure that that takes place.</p><p><a name="06103040000032"></a>Thanks to the noble Lord, Lord
Northbourne, Ofsted already reports on the spiritual, moral, social and
cultural development of pupils, assesses personal development and
well-being and evaluates learners&#146; contribution to the
community. In doing so, inspectors already pick up on aspects of a
school&#146;s work which contribute to community cohesion; the
measures we are debating build on that. However, having an explicit
reference in legislation will, we believe, ensure that all schools will
be held to account for their contribution in this important aspect. My
department will work with Ofsted to determine what changes will be
necessary to the inspection framework and supporting documents, such as
the self-evaluation form, to make this a
reality.</p><p><a name="06103040000033"></a>The new focus on
community cohesion through school inspection will enable the tremendous
work that is already taking place in many of our schools across the
country to be recognised and shared. For example, we know of a wide
range of school-linking projects: children and their families from
diverse ethnic, cultural, social and religious backgrounds who might
normally not meet because they live in an attend schools in different
areas are able to work and play together through joint assemblies,
visits and activities. Many schools also encourage visits by leaders of
other faiths to increase understanding of different religions. To cite
one example, the Tower Hamlets Inter Faith Forum is working in
partnership with secondary schools and the local standing advisory
council on religious education to develop a model for supporting
religious education and community cohesion across the borough by
encouraging faith leaders to visit schools. Three schools are currently
piloting the project, and the borough is looking to take this forward
more widely.</p><p><a name="06103040000034"></a>The new focus for
school inspection will also identify schools that need to do more. Here
I pick up the remark of my noble friend Lady Morris about there being
an impetus to defined activities which will see that the duty to
promote community cohesion is taken seriously. Schools should do more
through their curriculum delivery, including education outside the
classroom; they should do more through developing partnerships and
effective working with other bodies; and they should do more through
the professional development of staff, among other
things.</p><p><a name="06103040000035"></a>Prompted by
Ofsted&#146;s findings and by recommendations on areas for
improvement, schools will be expected to take appropriate action. They
will need to reflect the progress made on these actions in updating the
self-evaluation form. The school improvement partners will challenge
and support the school in making any necessary improvements, and
schools will need to inform parents about this progress through the
school profile.</p><p><a name="06103040000036"></a>We believe that
this is an effective way forward. We are extremely grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord

competition for establishing new schools. Throughout the passage of the
Bill, we on these Benches have been arguing in favour of local
authorities having as much right to put forward proposals for new
schools as any other organisation or institution. In Committee, my
noble friend Lady Williams argued very coherently for promoting a level
playing field between local authorities and other organisations and
institutions that are, particularly under Clauses 7 and 8, encouraged
to put forward proposals for new schools.</p><p><a name="06103040000044"></a>In Committee and at Report, we tabled
amendments to open up the competition between local authorities. We
also argued for the deletion of Clause 8 which, as we argued then and
continue to argue, imposes unduly restrictive constraints on local
authorities. Clauses 7 and 8 are only about putting forward proposals
for a competition for a new school. Decisions are then taken as to
which of the proposals may go forward. We have been arguing that local
authorities should have the right to put forward a proposal for a
community school on the same sort of basis as the other institutions
being encouraged to do so by this Bill.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_43"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103040000045"></a>Clause 8 was inserted as part of a set of
compromises agreed within the Commons. It essentially allows local
authorities to establish community schools only when that local
authority has achieved the top rating of excellent in the local
authority performance ratings. Only 11 authorities out of 145 have
achieved that rating. Local authorities are otherwise allowed to put
forward a proposal only with the permission of the Secretary of State,
and then subject to a lot of further conditions relating to the
proportion of foundation and voluntary-aided or controlled schools
already existing in the area. We seek on this occasion not to eliminate
Clause 8 but to ease the criteria so that authorities getting the top
two ratings in local authority performance assessment will be allowed
to put forward proposals for community
schools.</p><p><a name="06103040000046"></a>The amendment would
retain the Secretary of State&#146;s control over proposals put
forward by authorities achieving only a fair or poor rating. We thus
meet the criteria of one objection put forward at Report to our
proposals then, when the Minister
said:</p><ul><a name="06103040000084"></a>&#147;I do not accept
that a local authority should have an unfettered right, however bad its
track record, to promote schools which it more directly manages. A
local authority with a poor track record should commission those with
better prospects of success&#151;be they a parents group or an
education foundation&#151;to take on the task by means of a trust or
a voluntary-aided school or an academy&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 17/10/06; col.
674.]</ul><p><a name="06103040000047"></a>On this occasion, we
accept that those with a poor track record should not be allowed to
enter the competition. We ask that those with a good track
record&#151;the good and the excellent&#151;should be allowed to do
so. This amounts to approximately 100 of 145 authorities, cutting out
those that have a poor track
record.</p><p><a name="06103040000048"></a>I stress again that we
are arguing only about who may put forward proposals for the
competition. The competition then goes forward, and it is not
necessarily the proposal put forward by the local authority that is
chosen. The local authority is one of the contestants and the
competition is decided bythe adjudicator. We argued last time
that local authorities, elected democratically by those who pay council
tax&#151;a good part of council tax pays for schools in the
area&#151;should know what the local community wants. It is right and
proper that they have the chance to make known what they
thinkthat is.</p><p><a name="06103040000049"></a>I also
find it astonishing in the week after the Government have published
their White Paper on local government, which asks local authorities to
take more responsibility, that in the heart of the Bill we have a
clause that prevents them from taking responsibilities which I believe
are their democratic right. I beg to

something&#151;a part of this House then leaves before the crucial
element of the Bill is discussed: how many of our community schools
will be permitted, under the Bill, to survive.</p><p><a name="06103040000053"></a>In our amendment we are proposing
something simple. The local authorities that could be permitted to put
forward a proposal for a new community school or community special
school should include not just the very thin group at the top that are
described as &#147;excellent&#148;, but the rather broader group
described as both &#147;excellent&#148; and &#147;good&#148;. I
must ask your Lordships to consider for a moment whether we are
applying those criteria to all the other schools that will be part of
the pattern of education under the terms of the Bill. The Edinburgh
study published in May 2006 pointed out that the academies so far in
existence, despite all the extra money that has been lavished upon
them, had achieved less than a 1 per cent improvement on the position
of the associated previous community schools. I pointed out to this
House only recently that the closest parallel we have to the proposed
trust schools, the charter schools of America, have actually produced
less successful standards in literacy and numeracy than the schools
they succeeded.</p><p><a name="06103040000054"></a>We have pointed
out from these Benches that the single most successful educational
system in the whole of Europe, according to the OECD&#151;a pretty
independent and impeccable source&#151;is the comprehensive system in
Finland. It is far ahead of virtually any other European country and
sadly a long way ahead of this country. It has been argued that Finland
is a small country. Yes, it is. It is also amazingly cohesive and
educationally successful.</p><p><a name="06103040000055"></a>We
have tended not to look too closely at the relatively better results of
our Scottish colleagues, in terms of the proportion going on to higher
education, staying on, achieving in schools and so on, in what is still
almost entirely a genuinely comprehensive system, not one that has been
raddled by political football matches in the way that has been in true
in the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06103040000056"></a>My first
point is that we ought to consider above all&#151;I believe that the
Minister is very concerned about this and always has been&#151;what
constitutes a good school. Surely the criteria we apply to good 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_45"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schools, whether trust schools, academies or CTCs, should also be the
criteria we apply to community schools. That means we should include
the good alongside the very small group called
&#147;excellent&#148;, and that should be true across the whole
spectrum of education.</p><p><a name="06103040000057"></a>My
second point has already been made effectively by my noble friend Lady
Sharp of Guildford. What is proposed runs directly contrary to the
promises made by the Government in the White Paper on local government.
In it we give local government some extra, rather unattractive, powers
to impose fixed penalties. In this Bill, we take away from local
authorities a much more significant power, the power to run a
substantial number of schools in their own communities, thereby making
a joke of the Government&#146;s recent promises to devolve much more
power to local authorities.</p><h5><a name="06103040000090"></a>5.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06103040000058"></a>Thirdly, on community
cohesion, the noble Lord, Lord Baker, is right to say that words,
admittedly supported by the inspectors in this case, are not much of a
substitute for a structure of education that puts the community and
community cohesion at its heart. We are trading a serious system for a
passel of promises. Fourthly, but not least important, we have a
serious problem of trying to attract enough good teachers to stay in
our schools and enough even better teachers to take on the huge
responsibilities of headship. We know that, at least in London and
other great cities, it is now extremely difficult to find a good head
teacher.</p><p><a name="06103040000059"></a>In our previous debate
on community cohesion, as in so many debates on this Bill, we once
again placed responsibility on the teacher and on the head teacher. If
you add up the responsibilities that we now place, morally and legally,
on head teachers, it is hardly surprising that so few people are
willing to come forward to bear such huge burdens, with so little
assistance. The evidence is clear that without the support of local
authorities and their inspectors and the support that one gets from a
good county hall, it becomes even harder to become a head
teacher&#151;and that becomes a very lonely activity indeed. We have
not begun to thank our teachers and head teachers for the huge
endeavours that they have made and for their successes that they have
to their credit, whether in secular or faith
schools.</p><p><a name="06103040000060"></a>We have a brilliant,
articulate and extremely helpful Minister. If he was not there, this
Bill would have had a very much rougher time getting through the two
Chambers of Parliament. As the noble Lord, Lord Peston, whose honesty
always gets the better of him, has implied, quite a few passionate
critics of the Bill have decided that the better course is simply to
stay away and let it happen, because they feel that it would be futile
to try at this late stage to change it by more than minor
ways.</p><p><a name="06103040000061"></a>In my view, this Bill
will prove to be a disaster. There will be constant competition under
it. The fine words about fair admissions and all the rest are, I am
sure, sincerely meant, but they will turn out to be in conflict with
the deep, underlying principles of the 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_46"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill, including sponsorship of trust schools, introducing the private
sector, and so on. It will be very difficult to square that
circle.</p><p><a name="06103040000062"></a>I end on a personal
note. It is incredible that a Labour Government should be bringing
forward this Bill. It is more than incredible; I find it
heartbreaking.</p><p><a name="06103040000063"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew115"></a><a name="06103040000389"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, I join the noble Baroness, Lady
Williams, in paying tribute to the outstanding work of our head
teachers and teachers in all types of schools up and down the country.
I see that work day in and day out. I visit schools frequently and make
no discrimination between the successes of different categories of
schools. All of them are equally community minded, whatever their
formal legal status, and it is absolutely right that we should pay
tribute to them. It is fair to say that no Government in recent times
have given them more practical support than this Government in terms of
resources to enable the profession to succeed, its pay, its
training&#151;and in terms of its numbers, given the sheer size of
the teaching profession, which has grown substantially in recent years
and is vital to teachers being able to do their
jobs.</p><p><a name="06103040000064"></a>So I hope that those big
issues of principle that the noble Baroness mentioned do not turn out
to be the great divisions that she described. I continue to believe
that many of her concerns are due to misapprehensions as to the design
and effect of the policies that we are talking about. She repeated the
view, which she articulated powerfully in Committee, that only
community schools&#151;that is, schools in the legal category of
community schools, which is simply one characteristic of their
governing bodies&#146; formation&#151;could be relied on to act in
a community-minded spirit. I deny that contention. There are effective
schools in all categories that are extremely good at promoting
community cohesion.</p><p><a name="06103040000065"></a>I also
pointed out to the noble Baroness that a disproportionate number of
schools that offer low standards of education&#151;which, frankly,
neither she nor I would find acceptable for local
communities&#151;have the legal status of community schools. If only
we have the determination to be bold in this area, it is absolutely
within our power to see the development of many more successful schools
serving communities honestly without fear or favour in the way that she
would wish. We could have many more such schools if we were prepared to
see the further development of mission by schools, including more
flexibility in their governance, which is what trust status brings
about.</p><p><a name="06103040000066"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew116"></a><a name="06103040000390"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, I draw to the
Minister&#146;s attention that the amendment is precisely about the
authorities that are rated by his own department and by local
authorities as being either excellent or good. We are not talking about
what are admittedly poor schools, whether in the private sector, among
academies or, for that matter, among local authority
schools.</p><p><a name="06103040000067"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew117"></a><a name="06103040000391"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, with great respect to the noble
Baroness, that is precisely what we are talking about. The Secretary of
State will exercise his 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_47"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>discretion in deciding whether or not to allow competitions to be
entered into by community schools, precisely with a view to seeing that
current weak or failing schools are replaced by ones with a much better
prospect of success. That is where most of these competitions are going
to come from.</p><p><a name="06103040000068"></a>If I may say so, I
think that the noble Baroness is confusing the status of the local
authority in terms of its performance assessment, which is a judgment
on the local authority at large, and the precise set of circumstances
that apply in respect of the individual school competitions, many of
which will be to replace existing weak or failing schools. With regard
to the latter, it might be absolutely appropriate for the Secretary of
State to wish to see a greater diversity of proposals coming forward
rather than for the local authority to promote a community school where
the set of circumstances surrounding the school to be replaced would
lead the Secretary of State to judge that other proposals would have a
much better chance of producing a successful
school.</p><p><a name="06103040000069"></a>For those reasons, we do
not believe that the amendment should be supported. The clause as
drafted puts the details in regulations, and the draft regulations
specify that only authorities with an annual performance assessment
rating of four should be allowed an automatic right to promote
community schools in competitions. For other authorities, as I said,
the Secretary of State may well give consent for community schools to
be entered into competitions, but we believe that that judgment should
be made on a case-by-case basis, specifically because we want to see
effective action taken in areas where standards are low and where there
is insufficient diversity in the provision of schools. We do not
believe that it is inappropriate for the Government to play that role
in areas where educational standards have not been sufficiently high or
where choice for parents is inadequate. For those reasons, we invite
the House to disagree with the amendment.</p><p><a name="06103040000070"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew118"></a><a name="06103040000392"></a>Baroness
Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I thank the
Minister for his reply. I point out again that the amendment relates
only to whether local authorities are allowed to put a proposal on the
table. By no means are these proposals about always replacing poorly
performing state schools. Frequently, they will be proposals for a new
school where housing estates are expanding on the edge of a large
community. As we know, somewhere in the region of half a million new
houses are due to be built in the south-east of England. Many new
schools will be required to meet the needs of those housing estates. As
I said, the competition will be open to anyone to put forward
proposals, and the question is whether the local authority should be
allowed to put forward such
proposals.</p><p><a name="06103040000071"></a>We have whittled down
our amendments. We have accepted the Minister&#146;s view that poorly
performing local authorities should not be allowed to put forward such
proposals. We now propose to him that authorities which are rated
either good or excellent in local government performance terms and are
judged

forward proposals.</p><p><a name="06103040000072"></a>These are
democratically elected local authorities. Why do we have elections? We
have them so that people represent us locally when it comes to spending
our council tax on such things as education. It is right and proper
that such local authorities should be allowed to have a view on what
best represents their interests; it is right and proper that they
should be allowed to put forward such proposals. If they did so,
decisions would be taken by the schools adjudicator, outside the range
of the local authority concerned, because the authority would obviously
be an interested party if it had put a proposal on to the
table.</p><p><a name="06103040000073"></a>It is demeaning to local
authorities which are generally judged to be performing well to suggest
that they should not be allowed to put forward such proposals. We would
like to test the opinion of the House on this
issue.</p><h5><a name="06103040000091"></a>5.27

737.]</ul><a name="06103063000088"></a>What consultation
has there been with those representing persons who could be
disadvantaged? Surely the person appointed should be the best qualified
professionally to do the job rather than one who is or claims to be
religious? What transitional provisions will there be for those already
employed in regard to transfers or promotion? Even assuming head
teachers&#146; security is not threatened in their present
appointments, the career progression of non-religious teachers will be
blighted. Competent and aspiring teachers will not be able to seek
promotion unless willing to become, or at least pretend to become, a
believer in an appropriate religion.
<p><a name="06103063000006"></a>Clause 37 also makes it lawful for there
to be discrimination on a religious basis in regard to non-teacher
posts in voluntary-aided schools. It may be claimed that that will not
apply to all non-teaching jobs because of the requirement in employment
regulations that there should be a genuine occupational requirement,
but the extent to which discrimination is permitted under the
requirement is largely untested. Many of the staff involved will be
relatively poorly paid. Alternative jobs in the same locality may be
hard to find and the difficulty and expense involved in challenging an
attempted reclassification may be almost impossible for them. Moreover,
reclassification of such jobs, perhaps calling them pastoral
assistants, if they are told to hand out prayer books, may be fairly
easy for an over-zealous religious administration.</p><p><a name="06103063000007"></a>From such inquiries as I have been able
to make in the limited time since the Bill was amended to include
Clause 37, I gather that there has been no consultation with the
teaching unions, or with the GMB, the union to which many of the
non-teaching staff belong, and yet those changes will affect many
employees, immediately in some cases and also into the future. They
would appear to be contrary to the EU employment anti-discrimination
directive and also possibly to the requirements of our own sex
discrimination legislation. It is understood that Catholic schools are
already having difficulty in recruiting sufficient head teachers of
their faith. I also understand from the general secretary of the
National Union of Head Teachers that there is already a shortage of
head teachers. Indeed, he says, the situation is reaching crisis point,
and he asked whether the Government are aware of that.</p><p><a name="06103063000008"></a>Church attendance has been declining and
that trend seems set to continue. Clause 37, unless removed or amended,
will increasingly privilege a dwindling group of religious teachers
while discriminating ever more acutely against the majority who are
non-religious. That is even more unacceptable in the light of the
stated government policy that new faith schools should be inclusive and
should offer places to pupils from the families of other faiths or
none. The funding will come from taxpayers, an increasing number of
whom are secular.

reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle, speaking on Report at cols.
718 to 719, seemed proud of the fact that the Church of England schools
are community schools. We heard more about that this afternoon. He
referred to them as neighbourhood schools. He supported the idea
of25 per cent of places being available to the new schools on
the basis of local rather than religious priority. I am sure that many
noble Lords were pleased to hear that. Of course we welcome the idea of
neighbourhood schools, but that is surely all the more reason for not
discriminating when it comes to employing school staff. Surely
professional ability, commitment and competence must be the criteria on
which school appointments are made.</p><p><a name="06103063000010"></a>If the Bill becomes law, including Clause
37, in a short space of time all the new faith schools will employ, in
any capacity, only staff who are or profess to be believers in their
faith. Then it may gradually become the norm in existing faith schools,
which will add to the divisiveness that the Government are anxious to
avoid. I hope that the Minister will agree to reconsider the clause and
that there will be consultations with the unions representing those who
are likely to be disadvantaged before proceeding further with the
changes envisaged.</p><p><a name="06103063000011"></a>The Minister
this afternoon paid tribute to the outstanding work of head teachers
and teachers generally. I hope that he will bear in mind those
achievements when considering the clause. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103063000012"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew120"></a><a name="06103063000372"></a>Baroness
Flather:</b> My Lords, I have put my name down to the
amendment. I have been involved in race relations since the mid-1960s,
when we had the first Race Relations Act. During the 40 years that have
elapsed, we have constantly sought to try and make it impossible for
people to discriminate in employment on the basis of race. We have
fought against the notion that a certain type of job requires a certain
person of a certain colour. Here we are looking backwards and saying
that all jobs could be requiring a certain person of a certain faith. I
find it extremely strange that we should be sitting here today and
debating the issue. I thought that once we had put it to bed in race
relations we would have put to bed the whole notion of discrimination
on the basis of jobs.</p><p><a name="06103063000013"></a>The idea
should be that if we want an RE teacher we can say that if the person
is not of the faith that they are going to teach, it may be difficult
for them, but I was an infant teacher with the ILEA and it asked for no
requirement of any kind. Although it was a Church school, I was allowed
to teach RE in the school. Now we are saying that all sorts of people
could be discriminated against in jobs in a faith school, I feel that
this is another serious reason for reconsidering what we are doing and
where we are going. What will come next? I know that today we will not
allow the provision to pass. Proper consultation should have been held
with the unions. I am amazed that they have not raised a hue and cry:
they should have. I hope that the Minister will take
note.</p><p><a name="06103063000014"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew121"></a><a name="06103063000373"></a>Baroness

a tangled web here and

but important concerns. First, if this were law, people may be inclined
to pretend to be something that they are not&#151;that is,
religious&#151;to get the job or to retain a job. The reality of the
clauses is a signal to faith schools that they can build requirements
into job specifications, leaving the unsuccessful candidates to bring
tribunal cases challenging the faith school. As we all know, appeal
cases are very difficult. There is no statutory agency in this case to
provide support for claimants. That is why I am so concerned to support
my noble friend's
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103063000015"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew122"></a><a name="06103063000374"></a>Lord
Avebury:</b> My Lords, my name also appears on the
amendment and is attached to a letter that the noble Baroness, Lady
Turner, addressed to the Minister and the Secretary of State, dated 20
October, asking for replies to be given to us before Third Reading. As
we have not yet had that reply&#151;I am very sorry that the Minister
has not been able to address his mind to the important questions put to
him by noble Lords then&#151;I shall repeat some of the questions
that were asked.</p><p><a name="06103063000016"></a>First, I must
point out that, although the clause may not be contrary to the letter
of the employment directive, it is certainly contrary to its spirit.
For that reason, it is highly objectionable. From speeches already made
from every Bench of this House, your Lordships will understand that it
is a matter of tremendous concern that the Government should have
introduced proposals such as this, which run contrary to what we have
all agreed are ways to remove discrimination throughout
Europe&#151;in this country, in
particular.</p><p><a name="06103063000017"></a>The first question
that we asked the noble Lord and the Secretary of State was what
consultation there has been about the proposals. We now understand from
the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, that the trade unions principally
concerned in the matter knew nothing about them until the last
moment.</p><p><a name="06103063000018"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew123"></a><a name="06103063000375"></a>Lord

Avebury:</b> My Lords, I am sorry, but there is a
difference of opinion between us on this, because the noble Baroness
has spoken to trade unions during the past couple of days and has their
authority to make statements on their behalf in the House. If the noble
Lord is now saying that the noble Baroness hasgot that wrong,
there is, at the very least, a misunderstanding between us on the
question.</p><p><a name="06103063000022"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew127"></a><a name="06103063000379"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, this is a very important point.
We met our social partners with whom we discuss these matters, which
includes teacher associations, last Thursday, and they were supportive
of the changes that we were making. They had been consulted about the
matter previously, so they had

to the matter last week, when they were updated on the amendments laid
in the House, they were also supportive last
Thursday.</p><p><a name="06103063000023"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew128"></a><a name="06103063000380"></a>Lord
Avebury:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness tells me
that she has consulted at least two of the principal trade unions and
that they have both expressed their opposition to the proposals. We
cannot deal with these matters across the Floor of the House when there
is such a fundamental conflict of evidence between us. We shall have to
refer to what the trade unions have actually said, not what the noble
Lord tells us they have said behind the scenes or in consultation. As I
say, there is a conflict of evidence that we cannot resolve in this
debate.</p><p><a name="06103063000024"></a>We would like to know
what other consultations, apart from those with the trade unions, the
Minister has undertaken, because the process between the appearance of
the proposals on the Marshalled List and their embodiment in the Bill
was rapid. I do not believe that sufficient opportunity has been given
to all those concerned to consider the effects that they may have. What
research has the Minister and his department conducted on the effect of
the proposal on employment in rural areas, which the noble Baroness,
Lady Turner, mentioned? Where there is no choice of employment, it will
be very difficult for teachers and there will be a particular
difficulty for those who aspire to be head teachers. My noble friend
Lady Williams was during the previous amendment paying tribute to head
teachers and saying how difficult it was to secure really good ones.
The Minister and his Government will make it far worse, because he will
rule out many people who are still best qualified to match the needs of
the appointments.</p><p><a name="06103063000025"></a>What study has
been made of the likely effects of the Minister's proposals in areas
where the local school is the only employer of any size and those
losing their jobs or unable to obtain jobs because of the proposals in
the clause are likely to suffer severely? Perhaps he would also answer
the question put obliquely by the noble Baroness: how is a judgment to
be made about a genuine occupational requirement? So far in this
debate, it has been suggested that we do not know how far that will
extend, but it will certainly mean that the jobs of teachers are under
threat. Will it then extend from them to other people in faith schools?
How does the Minister justify that under the employment
directive?</p><p><a name="06103063000026"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew129"></a><a name="06103063000381"></a>Lord

When I read the Bill as it is before us, before the amendments, it was
difficult to follow precisely the meaning of Clause 37. My main hope is
that my noble friend will be able to tell us that it does not mean what
it seems to mean. So, if I may, I shall put my speech as a series of
questions.</p><p><a name="06103063000030"></a>My first question is:
if we take a religious school of a particular religion that is
advertising for a geography teacher, where I can see no religious
content as relevant, will it be legal in the advertisement for the job
to specify that only people of whatever faith&#151;whether Jewish or
Muslim&#151;need apply? Will that be legal from now on&#151;or, at
least, will it be legal at the interview to say, &#147;Oh, by the
way, apart from having a degree in geography, are you actually a
believer in the religion of the school?&#148;? It is difficult to see
from the Bill what is the answer to that question. Our fear is that
that will be legal, which is why the amendments had been
tabled.</p><p><a name="06103063000031"></a>If we go even further,
and talk about the school caretaker, will the school be able to ask the
school caretaker, &#147;Are you Jewish?&#148;? If the reply is,
&#147;No, Jews are not caretakers. That is not the sort of thing that
Jews do, so I am not Jewish&#148;, can the school then say,
&#147;You cannot be in this school&#148;? My hope is that the Bill
does not allow anything like that to occur&#151;sorry, that was meant
to be a
joke.</p><p><a name="06103063000032"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew132"></a><a name="06103063000384"></a>Lord
Winston:</b> My Lords, it is a gratuitous comment. I
must emphasise that a large number of Jewish schools have a huge number
of non-Jewish teachers and staff who do an excellent job, including
teaching <I>Romeo and
Juliet</I>.</p><p><a name="06103063000033"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew133"></a><a name="06103063000385"></a>Lord
Peston:</b> My Lords, if I may say so, that is the
whole point of the amendment. The point is: will it be legal for people
to change from that position? Why would anyone want to? That is what I
do not understand: where is this coming from? Why was the Bill changed
to move in this direction?</p><p><a name="06103063000034"></a>When
I was at school, I was taught maths by a Communist. We knew that he was
a Communist because he had a hammer and sickle lapel button&#151;this
was during the war. It was legitimate to do that sort of thing in those
days. I do not recall any of our maths teaching being distorted by the
fact that we were being taught by someone wearing a hammer and sickle
and I cannot understand why the teaching of the main subjects in the
school should have any relevance to the religion of the
teacher.</p><p><a name="06103063000035"></a>It may well be that I
am being ultra-sensitive here and that my noble friend will say that
that cannot possibly happen. One of the great ways in which we have
moved forward in this country&#151;very much under new Labour, let me
say&#151;is that people are meant to get jobs according to their
merits and being the best candidate for the job. The old-boy system,
which many of us, when we were young, knew dominated what went on in
the world&#151;that should now include the old-girl
system&#151;has, at least to some extent, gone. It is certainly not
acceptable to make it explicit.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_56"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103063000036"></a>I remember when I was starting as an
academic that there were certain professors whom, if you could not get
them to support you, you could not get an academic job at all. Those
days have now gone. I am merely asking the Minister to assure us that
that is the case. For example, I would honestly expect that the head
teacher of the Catholic school would be a Catholic. I follow my noble
friend in being in favour of religious freedom and that would not
offend me at all. However, let us assume that the best possible person
for the job was not a Catholic. Are we absolutely certain that person
should never be considered for the job? I am just not sure. But
certainly for the ordinary teachers, let alone the people who do the
other work, this should not
run.</p><h5><a name="06103063000111"></a>6
pm</h5><p><a name="06103063000037"></a>My last point in asking where
this is coming from is that, to my pretty certain knowledge, the one
religion for which this has never been a problem over a long period has
been the Church of England. The Church of England, on the whole, has
tried to appoint the best possible teachers for its schools, just
as&#151;and we were discussing this earlier&#151;it has been much
more welcoming and much less concerned about whether all of the pupils
are Church of England believers. I repeat: who is driving the desire to
do this sort of thing? My hope is that the Minister will be able to say
to us that there is no problem here and that none of the existing
legislation which is meant to stop sexual discrimination and other
forms of discrimination is now, in some sense, removed. I am hoping he
will tell us that and I wait to hear his
answer.</p><p><a name="06103063000038"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew134"></a><a name="06103063000386"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Peterborough:</b> My Lords, I shall
intervene only briefly because reference has been made to Church of
England schools. A lot of the fears that have been expressed are
unfounded; these are two very modest amendments. They clarify the
situation in regard to controlled schools, where the majority of those
on the governing body are not Church members or foundation members, and
the majority of the governing body would have to agree that the head
teacher could be a reserved teacher. Currently under the School
Standards and Framework Act 1998, governing bodies have not been able
formally to take into account the religious belief and practice of a
candidate, but they have been able to appoint on the basis of the
person&#146;s fitness and ability to preserve and develop the
religious character of the school. So if the governing body feels that
in order to do that, they have to be a believer, this would allow them
to do it.</p><p><a name="06103063000039"></a>The second part of the
provision refers to aided schools and reflects a situation where what
has in the past applied to teachers now needs to apply in some
circumstances&#151;again with the support of the governing
body&#151;to classroom assistants and others who were not covered by
the previous legislation. So it is a tidying-up amendment. I say very
firmly that it has certainly not been the intention of my colleagues in
their discussion with the Government to havea negative impact
on the circumstances of the 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_57"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employment of anyone working in a Church school, or indeed to be
discriminatory in the way that it is applied. I hope I can allay some
of those fears and I am sure the Minister will do so as
well.</p><p><a name="06103063000040"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew135"></a><a name="06103063000387"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the
noble Baroness, Lady Turner, for giving us the opportunity to debate
this issue properly. Noble Lords will recall that when this issue came
before us extremely briefly at an early stage of the Bill, I said
nothing about it because it was grouped with a whole lot of other
amendments about faith schools and the very fundamental matter of
whether the school assembly should be of a broadly Christian nature. At
the end of a three-hour debate, I felt it right to confine my comments
to those issues.</p><p><a name="06103063000041"></a>However, if the
noble Baroness chooses to put this amendment to the vote, we on these
Benches will support her, and not because we misunderstand the
situation as it now stands&#151;with due respect, I think that
perhaps one or two noble Lords do misunderstand it. The situation now
is that we have the 20 per cent reserved quota and that is not being
increased. The Government&#146;s measures, as introduced by the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Peterborough&#151;as the noble Lord,
Lord Peston, might know if he had been here on Report&#151;allow the
composition of that 20 per cent to be changed
slightly.</p><p><a name="06103063000042"></a>I know of very few
faith schools that do not already have a head teacher of the faith.
Therefore, I really wonder why this is needed at all as regards head
teachers. What does concern me is that a well qualified head teacher
might be passed over for a less well qualified head teacher who is of
the faith if this post is chosen to be reserved by the school. At a
time when we are desperate for really good head teachers with the
qualities of leadership, inspiration, understanding of young people,
hard work, creativity and innovation about the curriculum, we do not
want to exclude anybody who is really well qualified to lead a school
just because they are not of the
faith.</p><p><a name="06103063000043"></a>I am also a bit concerned
about some of the other posts that might be included in the Bill. Some
of these posts are not well paid and the people applying for them may
find it quite difficult to move or to go elsewhere to get those jobs. I
do not accept the arguments that this is going to mean that thousands
more teachers are going to be discriminated against. But we are nothing
if not consistent on these Benches and when the School Standards and
Framework Act came before Parliament in 1998, we sought to delete
Sections 58 and 60, which brought in these quotas in the first place.
We are against these quotas and we continue to be so. Just because this
changes the quotas, that does not make them any more acceptable to
these
Benches.</p><p><a name="06103063000044"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew136"></a><a name="06103063000388"></a>Lord

feeling of my noble friends against faith schools generally. That is a
perfectly proper view for them to hold and I respect it. With respect,
however, I point out that they have hugely exaggerated the impact of 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_58"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these amendments. I hope I may explain how, but itis simply not
correct that there has not been
consultation.</p><p><a name="06103063000045"></a>Voluntary-controlled
schools are religious schools. They are schools which are maintained
almost entirely by the Church of England because of their faith
character. The issue at stake is a legal uncertainty about whether the
head teacher of schools that are already Church of England religious
schools can or cannot be appointed with reference to a faith
requirement. As the right reverend Prelate said, it appears that it is
possible to do that at the moment but it is not absolutely clear. This
amendment clarifies the fact that a Church of England
voluntary-controlled school is actually able to appoint its head
teacher to maintain the ethos of the
school.</p><p><a name="06103063000046"></a>However, even under this
amendment, and this is at the discretion of the governing
body&#151;of course the governing body will make a decision about
whether this is going to lead to a dearth of candidates&#151;it is
highly unlikely that a governing body is going to pass over an
outstanding candidate because of the faith requirement if they believe
that the need could be met in a different way. The amendment allows
only heads to be reserved teachers, even in voluntary-controlled
schools, where they also teach religious education, which particularly
meets the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, who said she could
accept that there would be a case for it where these teachers in
question teach religious education, but not
beyond.</p><p><a name="06103063000047"></a>It is specifically
because of that factor that we allow these reserved posts to come
about. The case which has been made to us particularly applies to
primary schools because a large proportion of voluntary-controlled
schools are primary schools. Not having this flexibility at the moment
is making it difficult for small primary schools, which is a large
proportion of voluntary-controlled schools, to adequately arrange their
teaching staff to ensure that they have sufficient teachers who can
maintain the ethos of the school and teach religious education in those
schools.</p><p><a name="06103063000048"></a>To reiterate the point
of the right reverend Prelate: if a school chooses to appoint the head
teacher as a reserved teacher, this appointment will count towards the
one-fifth of the teaching staff who are already permitted to be
appointed as reserved teachers under the 1998 Act. I know the noble
Baroness does not approve the 20 per cent requirement at the moment but
this does not expand that requirement at
all.</p><p><a name="06103063000049"></a>I believe that this is a
modest amendment which clarifies the existing law in respect of faith
schools. There is no great plot here to introduce faith requirements
for the head teachers of other schools. I would also like to stress
that our proposal will include transitional provisions in the
commencement order for Clause 37 to provide that the change to Section
60(6) will not take effect for any non-teaching staff in post at the date
of commencement. The unamended Section 60(6) will continue to apply to
such staff, and also to head teachers who are in post at the
moment.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_59"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103063000050"></a>The other amendments that I have tabled
refer to staff other than teachers to whom it is now permissible to
apply a faith test. The case for those amendments is very simple. Since
the 1998 Act, particularly in the past two or three years, there has
been substantial reform of the workforce in schools to provide for many
more support staff and to encourage schools to diversify their
workforce so that a wider range of staff can carry out the wider range
of activities that we want to see. That includes, not least, the
<I>Every Child Matters </I>type of agenda, which will require pastoral
staff and all kinds of other support staff. We also need staff to carry
out the clerical and administrative jobs that have hamstrung teachers
for too long.</p><p><a name="06103063000051"></a>As those reforms
have taken place, we have been concerned to ensure that voluntary-aided
schools are not unduly restricted in their capacity to use a religious
test in appointing support staff who have a pastoral mission directly
related to the school ethos, in exactly the same way as they can
appoint teachers.

Walmsley:</b> My Lords, does the Minister not accept
that schools can very easily implement the greater flexibilities of the
workforce agreement without restricting such posts to members of staff
of a particular faith?</p><p><a name="06103063000053"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew138"></a><a name="06103063000390"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> No, my Lords, I will not. It is perfectly
reasonable for a school to believe that pastoral duties should be
conducted by a member of a particular faith, but under the law at the
moment it can impose that requirement only if the member of staff is a
qualified teacher and not support staff. That is ridiculous
inflexibility because it does not restrict the right of faith schools
to discriminate; it simply says that they can discriminate only in
favour of teachers.</p><p><a name="06103063000054"></a>The
amendments would enable voluntary-aided schools to take advantage of
the wider workforce reforms that enable support staff to play a bigger
role, and to apply the same test to them. But the crucial point is that
schools must do so only where they believe there is a genuine
occupational requirement.</p><p><a name="06103063000055"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew139"></a><a name="06103063000391"></a>Lord

occupational requirement&#148; is precisely what I was asking the
noble Lord about. Let me give an example. Regrettably, there is a need
for remedial English teaching in some secondary schools, which will
undoubtedly involve assistants. Will it be legal to bring to bear a
person&#146;s faith in deciding whether to appoint them as an
assistant? The noble Lord has not answered me with a straight yes or
no.</p><p><a name="06103063000056"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew140"></a><a name="06103063000392"></a>Lord

schools to appoint people with multiple responsibilities, as the noble
Lord will know when he visits schools. However, to exercise this power,
there must be a genuine occupational requirement.</p><p><a name="06103063000059"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about
consultation. We consulted our social partners some time ago through
the workforce agreement monitoring group, which includes the NASUWT,
the Association of School and College Leaders, the ATL, the PAT, the
GMB, Unison and the T&amp;G. The official who services that group sent
me an account of its meeting last Thursday and the previous meeting
during which it discussed the issue. I shall read it out so that the
noble Lord can see that there has been full consultation:</p><ul><a name="06103063000093"></a>&#147;We initially discussed this with
partners some time ago, and they were supportive of the measures being
taken. However, they were somewhat alarmed following the misleading
reports last
week&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06103063000089"></a>in the
media, following the campaign against this proposal, to which my noble
friend
referred&#151;<ul><a name="06103063000108"></a>&#147;so
we updated them at WAMG last Thursday as to what the amendment actually
did. They were all content&#151;NASUWT commented that they were at a
loss to see what all the fuss was about. They all recognise that these
were minor amendments that were a sensible response to ensuring
remodelling took place in VA schools, and that VC and religious
foundation schools were not unnecessarily hamstrung as to what role
their head could play&#148;.</ul><a name="06103063000090"></a>That is the reality. I invite the House
to stand by these changes.

Turner of Camden:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for his response but I am not entirely happy about it, and other noble
Lords have also raised questions. In particular, I cannot see why there
seems to be an acceptance that it would be possible to exclude very
good head teacher candidates on the basis that they were not of a
particular faith. We want head teachers with ability and the necessary
professional qualification rather than their necessarily always having
the religious one. I am not convinced by the Minister&#146;s response
that that would always be the case.</p><p><a name="06103063000061"></a>There is a great deal of legal
uncertainty about the term &#147;genuine occupational
requirement&#148;. It seems that in plenty of cases there would be a
reclassification which would have to be tested at an employment
tribunal, and perhaps beyond, because the individuals concerned would
be relying on the EU non-discrimination requirements and so on. All
that would impose on individuals a great deal of difficulty and
expense.</p><p><a name="06103063000062"></a>I am surprised at the
Minister&#146;s remarks about the unions. The information I have had
over the weekend is that there is a great deal of concern about the
amendments to Clause 37. I quoted the general-secretary&#146;s remark
that there could well be a &#147;crisis situation&#148; because of
a shortage of appropriate and suitably qualified applicants for head
teacher posts. He asked whether the Government understood that the
amendments to Clause 37 would make the situation that much more
difficult. In addition, I understand that the GMB is very concerned
about the pressure that will be exerted on non-teachers.</p>

your Lordships&#146; House. At Report, in response to the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and my noble friend Lady Morris, I undertook
to consider further how we might address the role of schools in
promoting pupil well-being. This includes, among other things, their
responsibility to deal with bullying and other bad behaviour by members
of the school community. When we first considered this amendment in
Committee, we said that we were concerned about placing statutory
duties where levers already exist. We argued that Ofsted already
inspects schools, using a framework that requires consideration of the
delivery of the five outcomes in <I>Every Child Matters</I>, and that
school improvement partners would also support and challenge schools on
their contribution to the five outcomes.</p><p><a name="06103071000007"></a>However, following the extremely
productive debate we had on Report, with excellent contributions from
many noble Lords, including the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and my
noble friend Lady Morris, I was persuaded that there is real value in
sending a message to teachers and other professionals working with
children that raising educational standards and promoting pupil
well-being are mutually reinforcing. Stating unambiguously in primary
legislation that school governing bodies have a clear duty to promote
well-being will help to speed the delivery of the undoubted premium on
school standards that arises from the improved well-being of pupils.
For all those reasons, we are glad to bring these amendments forward. I
beg to move.</p><h5><a name="06103071000038"></a>6.30

Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I rise with great pleasure to
welcome this pair of amendments, along with Amendment No. 7 which goes
with them. At the risk of sounding a little ungracious, perhaps I may
say that they have been a long time coming because they result not just
from our debates on bullying and other issues related to well-being in
the current Bill, but right back to the yawning gap left in the
Children Act 2004 when Members on these Benches tried to ensure that
schools were not just inspected on the extent to 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_64"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which they contributed to the well-being of the child, but that they had
such a duty in the first place. I think that all noble Lords have
accepted the importance of the well-being of the child as a factor in
how well that child will do in his education, and that these amendments
will fill that gap.</p><p><a name="06103071000009"></a>On Report,
in hinting that he was about to bring these amendments forward, the
Minister said that he felt they would meet my concerns on the issue of
bullying&#151;and they do to a great extent, but not completely. That
is not to say that I do not welcome them&#151;I do. But I should like
to explain what I mean. </p><p><a name="06103071000010"></a>The
amendments refer to the well-being of children. In my speech on Report,
I said that I felt that the references to bullying already set out in
the Bill are not sufficient because they focus on the school&#146;s
behaviour policies in relation only to children, but that what is
needed is a set of policies that would affect the whole school&#146;s
ethos and the whole school community&#151;adults and children
alike&#151;to generate a climate of mutual respect between children
and other children, adults and other adults, and adults and
children.</p><p><a name="06103071000011"></a>There is an issue that
I should like to bring to the Minister&#146;s attention concerning
the modern technology that allows short video clips to be posted on the
internet, particularly on a website called YouTube. I understand that
it is being used to bully teachers. Children are bullying teachers by
taking pictures of them without their permission, sometimes in not very
flattering situations or when they are actually being abused by the
children, and putting them up on the internet along with some very
derogatory personal comments. This includes the homophobic bullying of
teachers by children.</p><p><a name="06103071000012"></a>Although I
warmly welcome this group of amendments and what they do in relation to
children, they do not cover some of my concerns about adults who work
in a school. If one adult bullies another adult, disciplinary measures
may be taken concerning the standards of the adult&#146;s behaviour.
However, those professional disciplinary measures do not apply to a
child. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us in responding
to these concerns what might be done to encourage schools to generate a
climate of mutual respect so that this sort of thing does not happen
again. I am not asking the Minister to ban it. We can ban far too many
things, and a ban on something to do with the internet is completely
unworkable. But I would like to hear the Minister&#146;s thoughts on
what can be done about this serious and important
issue.</p><p><a name="06103071000013"></a><b><a name="61030-0002.htm_spnew147"></a><a name="06103071000042"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, on the treatment of school
staff, which I take to be the noble Baroness&#146;s concern beyond
these amendments, I am advised that although the amendments refer to
the well-being of pupils, the duty to promote well-being applies to the
governing bodies of schools at large. We regard it as inconceivable
that they could be acting in accordance with those duties if they did
not also take account of the issues referred to by the noble
Baroness&#151;the maltreatment or bullying of individual members of
staff. So while the amendment is couched in terms of

outlined, the force of which I appreciate, are also met. But, as she
says, there is always a limit to how far one can go in legislation. We
can impose duties on school governing bodies and school leaders, but

moving Amendment No. 10 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 11. This is
a repeat of an amendment we tabled on Report and I have to say that my
arguments in its favour have not changed. Members on these Benches
contend that the Government are introducing, through this Bill and the
new draft admissions code currently under consultation, very
considerable changes in admissions procedures. These new arrangements
have been introduced precisely because the Government are worried about
the degree of social segregation that has been emerging as a result of
the current admissions arrangements. Since the Government now propose
that more schools should be in a position to control their own
admissions within the context of the local admission forum being
subject to adherence to the new code of practice, and since research
shows that allowing schools to be their own admissions authority has in
the past led to greater social segregation, there is a strong case for
reviewing how well the arrangements are working after they have bedded
down for two or three years.</p><p><a name="06103071000020"></a>On
Amendment No. 11, the Minister explained at Report stage that admission
forum are specifically enjoined in the new draft code of practice to
promote social equity and to serve the interests of local parents and
children collectively. In Amendment No. 11 we argue that these duties
should be in the Bill rather than buried in the code of practice. As
foundation schools are specifically required to promote community
cohesion in Clause 33(6), and the new provisions in Clause 38 will
require all maintained schools to do so, it is all the more logical
that admission forum&#151;which are much better placed to make such
an aspiration a reality&#151;should also have this duty provided for
them in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06103071000021"></a>I return to
Amendment No. 10. The Minister has rightly said that individual
admission forum would look at the effect of the changes in their own
areas and submit reports to the new schools commissioner, and that the
commissioner would review the reports and then submit his own report to
Parliament on how far the forums were achieving fair access after the
new arrangements had been in place for two years. After the first of
those reports, it would be appropriate for the Government to decide
whether they needed a further independent review. We contend that since
one of the main purposes of the Bill is to ensure, as stated in Clause
1,</p><ul><a name="06103071000036"></a>&#147;fair access to
educational
opportunity&#148;,</ul><a name="06103071000022"></a>and
since in pursuit of this objective the Government are introducing
far-reaching changes to admissions procedures, it is only right and
proper that a full, independent review of these arrangements should
take place once they have had a chance to make their mark. We do not
consider that the new schools commissioner, as an official employed
specifically to make these things happen in the department, can be seen
as sufficiently independent to conduct such a review. We need to commit
ourselves now to such a review, not down the line in two or three
years&#146; time. Given the degree of concern about social cohesion
that has emerged in our debates, we need an independent review even
more now than we did before. I beg to
move.

she was making exactly the same arguments that she made on Report. I
will make exactly the same arguments in

Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, I apologise to the
Minister. I know that he wants to get on, but I have a couple
of&#151;I promise&#151;brief points to make. I commend what my
noble friend Lady Sharp said, not least to those who voted in large
numbers for the amendment that concerned the whole issue of community
cohesion. That is because they are expecting the inspectors to have a
remarkable impact. Some of us hope that that will be so, some of us are
rather more sceptical. Certainly, an independent review two or three
years down the road would ensure that we would discover how far the
commitment to community cohesion existed in fact&#151;in the way in
which, for example, schools conducted themselves on admissions. If we
believe that, then there is nothing to worry about with an independent
review. If we are a little uncertain, then an independent review will
enable us so to arrange and change the legislation to ensure that what
the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and other people have so eloquently
demanded is actually going to
happen.</p><p><a name="06103070000004"></a>My first point is that
those who are relying heavily on some of the amendments being made
ought, in order for the Bill to carry the weight that they are giving
it, strongly to support an independentreview, which carries no
political baggage. It is a straightforward request that we look again
at what we have just done.</p><p><a name="06103070000005"></a>Secondly, as somebody who, like the noble
Lord, has been a Minister, I am very struck by how little feedback
there ever is from legislation. We pass often sweeping and very
thorough legislation&#151;I am referring not just to this Government
but to any Government&#151;but we then almost never follow up to see
what has happened and how far that legislation has been justified. That
is one of the reasons why we keep putting new Bills in&#151;to
replace the holes in the previous Acts. Anybody who believes, as I am
sure the Minister does, in research, study and careful looking into the
facts of what has happened ought to support an independent review,
because we have very complicated admissions arrangements in the Bill.
We also have transparent ones, but ones that are in some ways likely to
conflict to some extent with each other.
</p><p><a name="06103070000006"></a>I come to perhaps my most
important point. It is well known in this House that some of the
crucial changes that the Government have made to the Bill, under
considerable pressure from Back-Benchers in their own party as well as
in other parties, were specifically to the admissions arrangements.
Quite a lot of concessions were made in that regard. It is therefore
important that we know how far those concessions are going to be
carried out.</p><p><a name="06103070000007"></a>In case anyone
doubts that this could happen, I shall quote briefly, but also very
relevantly to the amendment that we have just discussed, with regard to
the issue of good and excellent local authorities. At Second Reading in
another place, the then Minister, Ruth Kelly, said:</p>

strongly suggest that we should give weight to an independent review to
ensure that the various promises, changes and arrangements that have
been made should actually stand the tests of fact, of research and of
study. I strongly support my noble friend in moving the

Buscombe:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady
Williams, has just made a speech rather similar to the one I made just
a few days ago when I asked the House to support an independent review
on special educational needs. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has
said that her party is nothing if not consistent. It would have been so
nice if her party had thought about this in terms of consistency.
Indeed, in the Commons only last week her party had a debate on whether
there should be a major review of special educational needs. The
response from the Liberal Benches by the shadow Minister, or the
cross-party&#151;I think she is called&#151;shadow Minister for
children and the family, was that there should be. It is deeply
unfortunate that the Liberal Democrats are now asking us to support a
major review of this kind on admissions, but seemed unable to support
us on something so hugely important, which in the Commons they were
crying out for only last week&#151;a major review of special
educational needs.</p><h5><a name="06103070000123"></a>6.45

before the noble Baroness, Lady Williams. After the very nice things
she said about me earlier, the last thing that I would want to do is to
discourage her from speaking. I am only sorry that on this occasion we
cannot agree with the amendment. It is not that we disagree with the
objective, but we believe that it is met by the arrangements put in
place by the Bill as it stands. The changes that we have made will
ensure that the admissions system is kept under proper review, both
locally and nationally, which is the concern of the Liberal Democrats
in this matter.</p><p><a name="06103070000011"></a>Locally, the
core membership of admissions forums represents a wide range of
interests in the local admissions process, including schools. The
reports of the admissions forums will reflect these different
perspectives, ensuring that their decisions are not swayed by the views
of a single group and are properly representative of the views of local
stakeholders. In addition, admissions forums must act in accordance
with the new school admissions code of practice. The guidance given to
admissions forums gives them an unambiguous responsibility for ensuring
that the admissions system promotes social equity. All schools must
comply with the admissions legislation and the new school admissions
code and must also have regard to the advice given to them by the
relevant admissions forum. As well as that, local authorities and other
schools will act as a check on

authorities may produce their own reports, if they so wish, and they
can refer admissions practices that they regard as unfair to the
adjudicator. Locally, we believe that the system is kept under proper
review by the arrangements in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06103070000012"></a>Nationally, I agree with
the noble Baroness that there should be a proper process of evaluation
and review. That is provided for in the role of the schools
commissioner, which is a new role&#151;the first schools commissioner
has just been appointed. Integral to the role of the schools
commissioner is that they should promote fair access and report on it.
I quote from the schools commissioner&#146;s job description. His
role shall be
to,</p><ul><a name="06103070000097"></a>&#147;monitor and
promote fair access, including through producing a two yearly national
review of fair access, based on national data and the annual reports
provided by Admissions Forums on their local admissions arrangements
and how they impact on fair access for different
groups&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06103070000013"></a>We are
committed to there being a proper process of national evaluation and
reporting. In our earlier debates I undertook that the Government would
submit to Parliament the reviews that come from the schools
commissioner, so we believe that the objective of the noble Baroness is
met without setting up an additional independent review process over
and above that we have already provided for in the role of the schools
commissioner. I hope that our objectives are shared. We believe that
the ends of the noble Baroness are met by the Bill and that there is no
need for these further
provisions.</p><p><a name="06103070000014"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew154"></a><a name="06103070000133"></a>Baroness

on our Benches we take account of the particular circumstances of the

special educational needs, including the Special Education Consortium,
we felt that it was appropriate not to ask in this particular instance
for an independent review. On other occasions we have supported such
reviews. On this amendment, we continue to feel that there would be a
good case for a fully fledged independent review to look at these
substantial changes in admissions procedures. I am very sorry that the

the Statement. We have seen on several occasions that Statements do not
have to be made exactly after the given time. I have been in this House

Many of us have sat here all afternoon and it seems to me that it would

Lord Baker in particular&#151;if his amendment was not now
taken.</p><p><a name="06103070000022"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew161"></a><a name="06103070000140"></a>Lord
Grocott:</b> My Lords, I watched the first two or
three minutes of these exchanges on the monitor and I thought it was
right for me to come into the Chamber. The normal practice is quite
clear: as from three o&#146;clock this afternoon it was known that
the Statement would be taken at a convenient time after 6.45. As the
noble Earl, Lord Onslow, will know, &#147;a convenient time&#148;
is not an ambiguous phrase; it means, quite precisely, that when the
group of amendments being discussed at 6.45 is completed, we then move
on to the next business. If we were now unilaterally to change this
practice by an argument in the House, it would not only be a question
of changing normal practice but of seriously inconveniencing a lot of
people. Some people are interested in the Education and Inspections
Bill; others are extremely interested in the Statement; and many
others, including people from outside&#151;midwives, I might
say&#151;are very interested in the Unstarred Question which we have
down for the dinner break. This would be seriously delayed if we went
on to the next business.</p><p><a name="06103070000023"></a>I
strongly advise the House that we should continue in the normal way. No
one more than I would have been utterly delighted if we had moved more
quickly on the Bill. Sadly, that is not within my power. As we have no
means of adjudicating on this issue&#151;although we have a splendid
Lord Speaker on the Woolsack&#151;if we carry on with this discussion
we will simply delay matters further, with the same outcome. I suggest
that the House continues with the next
business.</p><p><a name="06103070000024"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew162"></a><a name="06103070000141"></a>Lord

seek to move is central to the whole debate about inclusion in schools.
Quite frankly, I think many noble Lords would like the debate to
continue now. It may not be for the convenience of the House to have

decide whether you now want to hear the climate change Statement now.

Rooker:</b> My Lords, this seems a convenient moment
to repeat the Statement made in the other place by the Secretary of
State. The Statement is as
follows:</p>&#147;With your
permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the
independent report on the economics of climate change by Sir Nicholas
Stern, commissioned by the Chancellor and the Prime Minister in July
2005. This morning Sir Nicholas published his comprehensive and
compelling report. I believe it is a landmark in the debate about
climate change.&#147;The
Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary have
repeatedly stressed that climate change is an economic, energy,
security and political issue, not just an environmental issue. The
Stern report shows why this is true. The conclusions of the report are
clear.&#147;Climate change
is the greatest long-term threat faced by humanity. It would cause more
human and financial suffering than the two world wars and the Great
Depression put together. All countries will be affected but the poorest
nations will be hit
hardest.&#147;The costs of
inaction far outweigh the costs of action. At a minimum, a failure to
tackle climate change will cost 5 per cent of global GDP. Costs could
run to 20 per cent of global
GDP.&#147;The window of
opportunity to reverse the rise in global emissions is narrowing. The
science and the economics suggest that to avoid catastrophic climate
change, global carbon emissions must peak in the next 10 to 15
years.&#147;The Stern
report shows how the stock of CO2 or equivalent has risen
over the past 150 years to 430 parts per million. It continues to rise
at about two parts per million per year. Stabilisation at between 450
and 550 parts per million would mean at least a 25 per cent cut in
global emissions. For richer countries with high emissions, this would
mean a cut of 60 per cent or
more.&#147;Finally, climate
change is not an insoluble challenge. The technologies to reduce energy




<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_73"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>demand, increase efficiency and develop low-carbon electricity, heat and
transport are within grasp. The costs are manageable at around 1 per
cent of global GDP. The earlier we act, across all countries and all
sectors, the more we will keep costs
down.&#147;Stern argues for
both global co-operation and domestic action. Let me set out our
initial
response.&#147;First, on
emissions trading, Stern argues that we must create a price signal for
carbon, in particular, through the development of emissions trading
schemes around the world. Emissions trading can not only ensure
cost-effective reductions in emissions but could also drive tens of
billions of dollars each year to put developing countries on a path to
low-carbon economies.
&#147;In this area, the European Union
is a world leader and it is a European solution that is key to our
goals in this area. Today we are proposing that the EU commits to new
targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 and
at least 60 per cent by 2050. And we are setting out our commitment to
strengthen the European Union emissions trading scheme as the nucleus
of a global carbon market. I will be discussing with business and
environmental groups on Wednesday how we can develop a unified UK
position for phase 3 of the scheme from 2012. I am sure we need to
secure the long-term certainty of the scheme, extend it to cover new
sectors&#151;especially aviation&#151;and link it to other emerging
emissions trading
schemes.&#147;Secondly,
Stern argues for a stronger focus on technological company-operation,
including the doubling of energy research and development support and a
five-fold increase in the deployment of low-carbon
technologies.&#147;In
March, the Chancellor announced the creation of the Energy Technologies
Institute, a new public/private partnership designed to co-ordinate
&#163;1 billion worth of research and development funding into low
carbon energy technologies over the next 10 years. Today, we can
announce two new companies will be joining the partnership, Scottish
and Southern and Rolls Royce, taking total contributions so far
to&#163;550 million of funding&#151;half Government, half
private sector.&#147;Stern
also identifies a specific need to develop low carbon transport fuels.
That is why the UK has initiated a joint task force with Brazil, South
Africa and Mozambique to promote the development of a regional
sustainable biofuels industry in southern Africa. The Renewable Energy
and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), which the UK launched in
2003, is now working in over 40 countries to develop policies and
financing frameworks for investment in sustainable
energy.&#147;At the
Gleneagles G8 summit last year the UK was instrumental in establishing
the Energy Investment Framework, led by the World Bank and the Regional
Development Banks, to catalyse 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_74"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>increased investment in energy efficiency and alternative energy
sources, as well as adaptation. The UK Government are therefore pleased
to announce today with President Wolfowitz of the World Bank, together
with the four leading regional development banks, a partnership with
the World Economic Forum and the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development to stimulate private sector investment through the Energy
Investment Framework. President Wolfowitz and the Chancellor will
co-host a conference early in February 2007 to kick off the
partnership. &#147;Third is
the action to reduce deforestation, which makes up 18 per cent of
global greenhouse gas emissions each year&#151;equivalent to more
than the whole of the transport sector. Forests are of great global
importance for climate change and biodiversity. But they are also
sovereign territory of the countries whose forests they are, and only
those nations can decide what happens to them. With the governments of
Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Costa Rica and the Coalition for Rainforest
Nations, with Germany holding the presidency of the G8 and the EU, and
with the World Bank and other interested parties, we will be exploring
over the coming months how to mobilise global resources for sustainable
forestry.&#147;Fourth is
the need for adaptation. The review suggests that richer countries must
provide financial support to developing countries to adapt to the
changes in climate already in train. The UK Government are strongly
committed to making climate risk reduction key to development
activities. Contributions to the special climate change fund (SCCF),
the least developed countries fund for climate change (LDCF), and the
Canadian International Development Research Centre, are additional to
development finance and policy as part of this
drive.&#147;In all these
four areas, the UK is determined to continue to show international
leadership; that drive is strengthened by our domestic leadership. To
be the most convincing persuaders, we must also be effective
contributors. &#147;Between
1997 and 2005, the economy has grown by 25 per cent and greenhouse gas
emissions have been cut by 7 per cent. We are exceeding our Kyoto
targets and are the only country on track to double them. The ambitious
commitments inthe energy review to take a further 19 million
to25 million tonnes of carbon out of the economy will add
further impetus to the drive to reduce
emissions.&#147;We have now
also decided to put in place a legislative timetable to become a
leading low carbon economy. Our climate change legislation will provide
a clear, credible, long-term framework for the UK to achieve its
long-term goals of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
&#147;The Bill will be based on four
pillars. For each, we will come forward with details at the time of
publication of the Bill. We are in addition 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_75"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>determined to promote the widest possible debate in this House and
across the country about the contents of the
Bill.&#147;The legislation
will, first, put into statute the Government&#146;s long-term goal to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent by 2050 from 1990
levels. We will also consider appropriate interim targets. We are
determined to enhance Britain&#146;s competitive position and believe
that business in particular will benefit from the long-term framework
that it says is so important for effective investment
decisions.&#147;The new
legislation will, secondly, establish an independent body&#151;a
carbon committee&#151;which will work with Government to reduce
emissions over time and across the economy. We will ensure that the
committee&#146;s advice is transparent, equitable and mindful of
sectoral and competitiveness impacts, including the need to secure
energy supplies at competitive
prices.&#147;Thirdly, we
believe that targets need to be accompanied by substantive measures if
they are to have credibility. This legislation will, therefore, create
enabling powers to put in place new emissions reduction measures to
achieve our goals.
&#147;The final pillar of
the legislation will be to assess what additional reporting and
monitoring arrangements are necessary to support our aims of a
transparent framework for emissions reductions, including reports to
this House.&#147;I believe
that the House and the country owe a huge debt to Sir Nicholas Stern
and his staff for their outstanding work. I believe his report should
be a cause for alarm but also a cause for action. It is action that the
whole Government are determined to deliver&#151;at home and
abroad&#148;. <p><a name="06103070000033"></a>My Lords, that
concludes the Statement.</p><h5><a name="06103070000125"></a>7.06

Dixon-Smith:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
repeating the Statement made by his right honourable friend in another
place. May I also add my thanks and the thanks of my colleagues
toSir Nicholas Stern and his assistants for this landmark
report which so adequately puts the problem of dealing with global
warming into a proper perspective. It is better to act now than to
attempt to clear up a mess
later.</p><p><a name="06103070000035"></a>The report is in
considerable contrast to the Government&#146;s approach to energy
matters up until now. The last energy White Paper and indeed the
preamble to the latest energy review both concentrated on security of
supply using traditional fuels. The contrast is even deeper with the
rather extraordinary meeting between European Prime Ministers and
President Putin only 10 days ago which rather appalled me&#151;they
appeared to be grovelling in order to secure supplies of gas from
Russia. The question is: will we now begin to see real action to
develop green fuels and thereby really tackle the issue of carbon
dioxide emissions?</p>



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_76"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103070000036"></a>All this of course illustrates the
international nature of the problem and the depth of change in
attitudes that will be required if we are to succeed. One only need
mention three countries&#151;China, India and the United
States&#151;to see that all too often short-termism is the dominating
sentiment that is ruling policy. Developing green energy sources is
apparently a very low priority for any government in the present era.
It is to be hoped that Sir Nicholas&#146; report will change
that.</p><p><a name="06103070000037"></a>In the
Statement&#151;on page 3 of the copy&#151;there is a sentence that
I found puzzling. It refers to the specific need to develop low carbon
transport fuels and
says:</p><ul><a name="06103070000093"></a>&#147;That is why the
UK has initiated a joint task force with Brazil, South Africa and
Mozambique to promote the development of a regional sustainable
biofuels industry in southern
Africa&#148;.</ul><a name="06103070000088"></a>That may all
be very worthy but I was not aware that Brazil was in southern Africa,
still less in the UK, nor that half the southern hemisphere constitutes
a region. This is very peculiar and I suspect it is simply a device to
secure large supplies of imported biofuel, which would be a kick in the
teeth for British agriculture.
<p><a name="06103070000038"></a>The policy is short-sighted for two
reasons. First, if that were the case, transport costs would of course
not be very green and, in the longer run there is not enough
land&#151;and I have said this in this House before&#151;to produce
both biofuels and food for society, so this can only be a short-term
Statement. Sir Nicholas mentions the need for green fuels; there is no
mention in the Statement, or in anything else I have seen, of the
development of hydrogen, which is the ultimate zero emissions
fuel.</p><p><a name="06103070000039"></a>Only one domestic action
is mentioned in the Statement&#151;the creation of the Energy
Technologies Institute. There is no mention of green taxation, widely
floated in the media, which apparently had access to the report long
before us. I recognise that that is a matter for the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, but I would be grateful if the noble Lord could help us with
a statement of principle. Are green taxes to be additional revenues for
the Government, or substitute revenues? In other words, as green
taxation increases&#151;I hope it will be a carbon-based tax if we
have any green revenues&#151;will other taxes be reduced as it is
introduced? Otherwise the tax burden on society will increase, which
will not be very helpful at this time. Can the Minister help us on
that?</p><p><a name="06103070000040"></a>The truth is that under
this Government carbon emissions have increased for five of the past
eight years. It is true that the Government are still meeting their
Kyoto targets, but the outlook is worsening rather than improving, and
it will take very positive action to reverse the developments in the
economy and get carbon emissions under control. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response.</p><h5><a name="06103070000126"></a>7.11

in

switch from taxing work totaxing pollution. I congratulate the
Treasury on commissioning such an important piece of work and Sir
Nicholas on implementing his brief very
fully.</p><p><a name="06103070000042"></a>The Statement justly
credits the EU as a world leader in showing how emissions trading can
drive innovation and carbon reduction. It has not been a perfect
mechanism but it has been an extremely valuable start. The report is a
blueprint for further action, and not just UK action. As one would
expect from a former chief economist of the World Bank, the report is a
blueprint for international action. I believe that it will provide the
route map for the post-2012 route that follows the first round of the
Kyoto negotiations. It will be a springboard for those starting to
develop a framework, not just for developed nations and the EU, but for
the rapidly developing nations. I particularly welcome the point about
the action that the World Bank will be taking.</p><p><a name="06103070000043"></a>The Statement contained some interesting
suggestions about deforestation. I am sure that the House will benefit
from knowing more about what that will mean. There is an interesting
list of the nations which will be taking part; it does not include
Guatemala, Belize and Mexico&#151;although they may be in the
Coalition for Rainforest Nations&#151;which, after the Amazon basin,
have the largest area of rainforest in Latin America.</p><p><a name="06103070000044"></a>The report will make us&#151;as
businesses, as a nation and internationally&#151;take account of the
true price of things; not just the financial price but the hidden cost.
Cheap goods are not so cheap if the environmental or social costs are
high and hidden&#151;particularly, in this case, the environmental
costs.</p><p><a name="06103070000045"></a>The report is
particularly important; it takes the debate out of the province of
scientists and environmentalists, although of course they have a
critical role to play. However, the report has made it quite clear that
it is for everyone, from the boardroom to the tearoom, to think about
the implications, whether it is a question of future investment for
large corporations or how much water to use to fill a
kettle&#151;even, indeed, what sort of
kettle.</p><p><a name="06103070000046"></a>The &#147;act
early&#148; message is extremely important. The past decade has been
marked by inaction and emissions in some sectors have risen. Transport
emissions in particular have risen under this Government. Private
mileage has increased because cars have become more efficient, so the
overall effect is that, given the lack of investment in public
transport, emissions have increased. In passing, I congratulate Defra
on its <I>Environment in Your Pocket </I>publication. It often comes in
for criticism, but that very informative publication is exactly what
the public need to play a part in this important debate.</p><p><a name="06103070000047"></a>The other people who must play an
important role are the media. I do not think that today&#146;s
headlines were helpful, The <I>Evening Standard</I>, in particular, was
scaremongering about tax rises before looked at the report. The
Government could take a leaf out of the book of Liberal
Democrat-controlled Richmond council; it received very positive
coverage for its gas-guzzler parking charges. I hope that the media

every effort to be informative as opposed to publishing what was called
by the IPPR report, &#147;climate porn&#148;. Some of
today&#146;s headlines could have been called the same
thing.</p><p><a name="06103070000048"></a>Stern makes a very
important comment on investing in research and development. He suggests
doubling expenditure, from a very low base. I look forward to hearing
what the Minister says about the research and development budget. It is
impossible to imagine moving forward without the innovation that that
research will bring. That will be key in making this a success or a
failure.</p><h5><a name="06103070000127"></a>7.17

Rooker:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful for the
contributions of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the noble Lord,
Lord Dixon-Smith. I do not think I can answer everything in detail,
although I would like to make one or two points. In his final point,
the noble Lord referred to taxation. All I can do is repeat what was
said this morning and in the other place that people should look at
what the Chancellor has done. The climate change levy was offset by
national insurance, and I understand that one of the other green taxes
had an offset as well. The was not used as an excuse to raise more
funds; it was designed to change people&#146;s behaviour. The
investment in the climate change levy was offset by national
insurance.</p><p><a name="06103070000050"></a>The noble Lord
mentioned Brazil. I did not say that it was in South Africa; the fact
is, Brazil is the biggest, most expert producer of bioethanol fuels,
and one has to share global experience. That is the issue relating to
South Africa and Mozambique, which have come
forward.</p><p><a name="06103070000051"></a>The noble Lord also
asked about land. We in the UK do not have enough land for all our fuel
requirements. If we used all our land, we could not grow enough for our
food and fuel. He implied that we would have to import all our biofuels
and then said that there was not enough land for biofuels and food. No,
there is not&#151;I accept that.</p><p><a name="06103070000052"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew174"></a><a name="06103070000153"></a>Lord
Dixon-Smith:</b> My Lords, perhaps I can help the
Minister. I was not referring to the situation in the United Kingdom;
it cannot be done globally
either.</p><p><a name="06103070000053"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew175"></a><a name="06103070000154"></a>Lord

point and apologise if I misunderstood him.</p><p><a name="06103070000054"></a>I freely accept that there will have to
be arrangements for transporting biofuels around the world.
Nevertheless, a start will be made to develop a large-scale,
world-class biofuels industry. This cannot be done on small plots of
land, hence we are using the experience of Brazil, South Africa and
Mozambique.</p><p><a name="06103070000055"></a>The noble Lord also
asked about the need for a balanced supply of energy. The energy White
Paper published in the summer made it clear that we want a balanced
supply. We will be using fossil fuels for a considerable time, and some
20 per cent of our power comes from the nuclear industry. We have made
it clear that we will not use public subsidy, but the existing nuclear
supply will be phased out and the

And it is, of course,
carbon-free.</p><p><a name="06103070000056"></a>I have not read the
700 pages and do not know if there is a mention of hydrogen.
Yet&#151;I have used this example in this House before&#151;I have
been into a dwelling in the Midlands which is fuelled by hydrogen as an
experiment. There are experiments going in the UK now; they are small
scale but high-level experiments and other fuels are
used.</p><p><a name="06103070000057"></a>I freely admit that I have
not seen the headlines today, but sometimes the hysterical approach of
the media can be counter-productive. I am not saying that every
scientist in the world agrees with this, as no doubt I am about to be
reminded. Yet the position on climate change, as explained today, is
vastly different from what it was 10 or 20 years ago. On balance,
taking the precautionary principle, we have had it set out that if we
do not move on carbon&#151;if it went up from 450 to above
550&#151;we may not be able to get it back anyway. We have to deal
with this issue. If the scientists are wrong, at least we survive. If
they are right and we have done nothing about it&#151;which we owe to
the next generations&#151;then it is a complete failure of our
society.</p><p><a name="06103070000058"></a>There will obviously be
debates on this and legislation, as the Government have indicated. I am
grateful for what the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said about
Defra&#146;s handbook. It is incredibly easy to read, unlike some of
the material put out by government departments that sometimes have a
difficulty with material for general consumption. They always want to
get it right, so you end up with too much detail and the message gets
lost. This Defra handbook is incredibly easy to read and ought to be
compulsory reading. I am grateful for what the noble Baroness said
about Defra doing that, and also welcoming that it was the Treasury who
commissioned the report. This goes beyond the environmental aspects, as
the Statement said. It is also about security, energy and finance. The
report shows, in summary, that we can deal with climate change without
wrecking our economies, provided we move now. If we leave it 10 to 15
years, then, as the report makes clear, we are in a no-hope
situation.</p><p><a name="06103070000059"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew176"></a><a name="06103070000155"></a>Lord

issue as he put it can be dealt with only on an international basis by
the international aviation authorities. This report gives the lead.

my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith, if the Government are going to carry
the people with them in their determination to deal with climate
change, it is essential that they make it clear that they will not use
their response to the threat as an excuse to pile more taxes on an
already over-taxed people. It is not good enough to say that once or
twice in the past there has been some balancing reduction. This is a
good opportunity for the Minister to give an undertaking that necessary
green taxes are not going to be used as an excuse to increase overall
revenue.</p><p><a name="06103070000064"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew181"></a><a name="06103070000160"></a>Lord

Taverne:</b> My Lords, will the Government bear in
mind the need for some caution in the Statements they make? This is not
the time to debate the Stern report&#151;which is going to be a very
important question indeed&#151;but there will be actions which he
recommends that will be unpopular. It will be vital to get popular
support for such actions. There will not be popular support if the
claims made are not supported by scientific evidence and are then found
to be false.</p><p><a name="06103070000066"></a>For example, it
has been widely stated that Hurricane Katrina was the result of global
warming. That is something that Mr Gore says in his
film&#151;although he also makes a number of statements in his film
that I fully agree with. The evidence on this is not yet clear and it
is a dangerous claim to make. This year, for example, there have been
fewer hurricanes. Many people may say, &#147;If global warming causes
hurricanes and there are now fewer hurricanes, then there ain&#146;t
no global warming&#148;. It is important that we do not make rash
statements.</p><p><a name="06103070000067"></a>The Statement says
that climate change is the greatest threat faced by humanity. But
climate change has always been happening. It is not climate change that
is the threat; it is global warming caused by human activity and the
effects of global warming, which may or may not be very serious. There
is a lot of evidence that it may well be serious, and that would
justify action. It is therefore important that the Government are
cautious in the Statements that they make. I am somewhat worried that
they have appointed Mr Al Gore, or so certain reports say, as their
adviser. While there are many good things in his

pessimistic view of everyone. He suggests, for example, that the
thermohaline current is going to switch off, although most
meteorologists do not think that very likely. Will the Government
exercise some
caution?</p><p><a name="06103070000068"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew183"></a><a name="06103070000162"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, with due respect to the noble
Lord, there are a few wild statements there. There is not enough time
for me to rebut them. However, less than a week ago, in this House, I
read from some scientific literature about the thermohaline current
possibly switching off. If it does, it will not switch on again. Those
documents are in the Library: it was a Cambridge Press/Defra
publication from an international symposium. It is not clear that
scientists say it will not switch off. That is a
threat.</p><p><a name="06103070000069"></a>The Statement
said:</p><ul><a name="06103070000094"></a>&#147;Climate change
is the greatest long-term threat faced by humanity. It [could] cause
more human and financial suffering than the two world wars and the
Great Depression put together. All countries will be affected but the
poorest nations will be hit
hardest&#148;.</ul><a name="06103070000089"></a>This is a
banal point to make, but if anybody wants to query whether something is
going on out there, then just look at the leaves on the

Berkeley:</b> My Lords, I welcome this Statement by
my noble friend. Perhaps I may concentrate on transport, which is my
interest. Does he agree that there is going to be a strong need to
change behaviour and the way in which people and goods travel by road,
rail, air, sea and whatever? Are the Government thinking of extending
emissions trading to all transport, and, if so, how? My worry about
emissions trading as it is at the moment is that although we have
started in Europe&#151;not on aircraft emissions but on other
things&#151;there are many stories about other member states
initially giving such a leg-up to companies that may be at risk of
having to spend large sums on buying emissions quota that it all
becomes pretty meaningless. Does my noble friend accept that some
people will get hurt to change their behaviour while others will
probably
benefit?</p><p><a name="06103070000071"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew185"></a><a name="06103070000164"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, the summary makes it clear that
if we act now, it need affect only 1 per cent of GDP and will not stop
growth of the economy. That is one of the central messages. I heard Sir
Nicholas say this morning that if we act now, growth is not at risk.
There is a one-off 1 per cent change, so there need not be damage to
the economy.</p><p><a name="06103070000072"></a>I believe the
Statement only referred to aviation in the European emissions trading
system. There are many complaints about people flying short journeys
when there are perfectly adequate railway networks; the argument
against that might be that the railway networks are expensive, but that
is because the flights are not paying the full cost of the carbon
damage to the atmosphere. That is what this is all about: putting a
price on carbon, so activities are charged for the cost they impose on
the planet.</p>

Lawson of Blaby:</b> My Lords, seldom can this House
have heard a Statement containing so much fantasy with so little
relation to the real world. I have one specific question. It is
generally agreed that China will very soon overtake the United States
as the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. If the Chinese insist on
maintaining their current position of generating their growth on the
back of low-cost carbon-based energy, what do the Government propose to
do? Will they pay the Chinese to change their ways, or propose trade
sanctions against them if they do not? What are they going to do, in
concert with our allies and partners in
Europe?</p><p><a name="06103070000074"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew187"></a><a name="06103070000166"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord made sweeping
statements about the whole of the Stern review. I acknowledge his
position, which he has held for a long time and expressed in this
House, to my knowledge, on more than one occasion. I do not think that
China should be put in the dock. I understand that it is opening a
coal-fired power station every week. We are working with the Chinese
and looking at low-carbon technology for burning that coal. They will
carry on burning it, because they want to grow. There is no reason why
their growth should not continue, but it could be low-carbon growth.
That is the offer. The Chinese will be just as interested as anyone
else, by the way, in people being flooded out of their homes, or in
having no land to grow crops because it has got too hot. They are not
divorced from this and we should not put them in the dock. We have to
help. We are all in this together.</p><p><a name="06103070000075"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew188"></a><a name="06103070000167"></a>Lord

the report that the Chancellor has refused to allow, and pay for, the

launch this morning and picked up a 30-page executive summary and a
disk. I have not put the disk in anything yet; I assumed it contained
the whole report. As far as I know, the report is available. It is 700
pages long. I understand that it is not available in the Printed Paper
Office and I am going to find out about that. I was supposed to be
given a line on that before I stood up, but I realise I have not been.
I suspect that this issue was raised in the other place, but I do not
think that the Chancellor is so mean as not to allow the publication of
a report that will have such an impact on all our lives, both
economically and socially.</p><p><a name="06103070000077"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew190"></a><a name="06103070000169"></a>Baroness
O'Cathain:</b> My Lords, I welcome the report. It is
marvellous that it brings to everyone&#146;s attention that there is
a problem, because for so long people have been saying there is no
problem. However, following the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Barnett, it is extremely difficult for us to assess the, I think,
612-page report&#151;but then of course there are lots of appendices
we do not even know about, as they are not in the contents&#151;by
reading the Statement.</p>

can stop the problem. Surely that must be nave. There is not a
single mention of the word &#147;USA&#148; in this four-page
Statement. There is no mention of China. Aviation is briefly mentioned,
but surely most of the aviation in the world is in the US. How much
notice will the United States, India and China take of the report? Do
we not have an exalted view of our influence? I quote from the
Statement:</p><ul><a name="06103070000095"></a>&#147;The UK is
determined to continue to show international
leadership&#148;.</ul><a name="06103070000090"></a>Honestly, if, as I am told, we only
contribute something like 2 per cent of the carbon emissions, is anyone
going to listen?

Rooker:</b> My Lords, our contribution of 2 per cent
is small. It could be argued that we do not need to do anything; that
we are overshadowed, and our contribution would be replaced by some of
the developing countries within 10 months. That is not a satisfactory
situation when we have taken the position that, if we do not move
within 10 to 15 years, the process will be unstoppable. According to
the chart shown by Sir Nicholas this morning, the temperature could
rise by 5 degrees&#151;well above the 2 degrees that I understand is
a turning point. We have to move on this.</p><p><a name="06103070000080"></a>I cannot give chapter and verse about
what individual countries are going to do. The report has been
published today, and we want the rest of the world to have a look at
it. It will be discussed in a few days&#146; time in Nairobi at the
pow-wow of environmental and Treasury Ministers, and it was partly
discussed during the recent discussions in Mexico. The issue is being
dealt with at a world level, not at the UK or EU level, but we are
attempting to take a lead. We have a contribution to make.</p><p><a name="06103070000081"></a>Regarding the printed report, my note
says:</p><ul><a name="06103070000096"></a>&#147;Mix-up. Full
report soon&#148;.</ul><a name="06103070000091"></a>It also
says, though, that if the report is on CD,the CDs are more
environmentally friendly than 700 printed pages anyway. I do not know
anyone who cannot put a CD into a computer and read from it. Grey power
gets hold of computers and gets going at them better than the
youngsters sometimes. However, I apologise if the noble Lord has not
been able to get his copy today.

address the subject of energy conservation, on which the UK has a bad

energy conservation, which is crucial if this great aim is to be
achieved?</p><p><a name="06103070000083"></a>Secondly, does he

between the rich world and the poor? If we are going to save the planet
we have to start by saving the forests, and in many forest lands there
is no money whatever to do so.</p><p><a name="06103070000084"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew193"></a><a name="06103070000172"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness has raised a
practical solution that has very seductive undertones. There is clearly
an issue. Sometimes people have destroyed their heritage&#151;that
is, the forest&#151;because of money. There is no other crop, as it
were. They have to be prevented from doing so, and shown the wisdom of
preserving it. But they have to have alternatives. If we can sell this
to our people on the basis that we can make all these changes and still
grow our economy, the same must apply to everyone else. They will want
to grow their economies, because they are far behind us in that
respect. This issue has to be dealt with.</p><p><a name="06103070000085"></a>I regret that I did not comment on the
point made by the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, relating to public
perception. He is right: if the public are not on side, nothing will
happen. Ministers talking, business acting or taxes changing to change
people&#146;s behaviour will not work. It will build in resentment.
People have to be made to understand that there is a major
problem.</p><p><a name="06103070000086"></a>We have an outreach
programme focusing on the private sector, legislators and broader civil
society. I shall briefly give some examples of what was done. In
December last year, a new campaign was launched, called
&#147;Tomorrow&#146;s Climate, Today&#146;s Challenge&#148;,
which included free resources; short films; a website; a communications
guide; a &#163;6 million climate challenge fund to support local
level communication projects, and we expect to announce winners on 5
June; a European environment day; large-scale national activities
allowing local level activities to feel part of a wider
government-backed initiative to commencein 2006-07; and a
youth competition to help communicate climate change in their region,
in which nine regional climate change champions were announced on 11
May 2006. Work has to go on over a whole range of activities. It is not
just about the media but about understanding the footprints of normal
people&#146;s
lives.</p><p><a name="06103075000002"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew194"></a><a name="06103075000049"></a>Lord

remember that not long ago we were being warned of a new ice age, so we
have to take that into account, too. I have two questions. First, the
inexorable growth in world population is estimatedto increase
by a further 50 per cent over the next30 years, I believe. Do
the Government have any plans to address that problem, because if we do
not deal with it, we have no hope of solving global warming? Secondly,
will the Government review their policies on airport expansion,
particularly at Heathrow and Stansted&#151;and in other parts of the
country? Unless the Government do that, aircraft movements will
continue to rise and rise and there will be no hope of reducing
aircraft emissions.</p>

Rooker:</b> My Lords, on that last point, I cannot go
beyond what I have said, other than that the Statement attempts to
bring aviation into the emissions trading scheme, so that the cost of
aviation pollution is paid for and will bring about a change in
peoples&#146; behaviour. As I said, plenty of trains are available
for short journeys in this country and between this country and other
parts of Europe in which one can probably travel faster than if one
used the airports.</p><p><a name="06103075000004"></a>As I
understand it, forecasts of population growth are taken into account;
but is it not also the case that when countries have good economies and
economic growth, population growth decreases? This is a serious issue.
It is a fact that we are using up the planet at a greater rate than we
are creating more planet, if you like&#151;and the planet is finite.
The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, half joked about a new ice age that has
not yet happened, but if the Atlantic Gulf Stream closes down, we will
soon know about a new ice
age.</p><p><a name="06103075000005"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew196"></a><a name="06103075000051"></a>Lord

matched by reductions in indirect taxation and his acknowledgment that
everything depends on growth economies such as China and India buying
into this proposal, could he assure us that providing leadership does
not mean putting up taxes on business in this country in advance of
those countries doing the same? Given the mobile nature of capital,
will not business simply switch its investment into countries where
there is no such levy or charge, whether it be a tax or a carbon
trading scheme? How will the Government deal with
that?</p><p><a name="06103075000006"></a><b><a name="61030-0003.htm_spnew197"></a><a name="06103075000052"></a>Lord

Countries have been pillaged environmentally because there has been no
international agreement about what happens to their resources. I cannot
say any more about what would happen as regards the effects of
taxation, because they will be matters for the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. He commissioned this report, so it is self-evident that
there are issues beyond the environment, including social, cultural,
energy and conservation issues, as well as the economic issues of
climate change, that, clearly, the Treasury will take into

Cumberlege</b> rose to ask Her Majesty&#146;s
Government what is their policy towards community hospitals and
maternity units.</p><p><a name="06103075000010"></a>The noble
Baroness said: My Lords, I start by thanking noble Lords for taking
part in this short debate and the Minister for answering it. He is
after all, according to the <I>Health Service Journal</I>, the fifth
most powerful person in the NHS, so I am sure he will be able to answer
my questions, of which I have given notice, with
ease.</p><p><a name="06103075000011"></a>The Minister and I are
united in that care should be closer to home. My father was a GP.
Patients came to the house and in my home we literally had blood on the
carpet. Six miles from where I live we have a much-prized community
hospital in which a few years ago I had successful minor surgery. My
husband&#146;s great-grandfather donated a similar hospital to the
people of Lyndhurst. I have given birth to two of our three sons at
home, so I think I know what care closer to home, or indeed in the
home, can mean.</p><p><a name="06103075000012"></a>It was Voltaire
who said,</p><ul><a name="06103075000044"></a>&#147;if you
wish to converse with me, define your
terms&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06103075000013"></a>The tools of
the trade for any Government are language and it is important to be
precise. In July, the Government published a sequel to their White
Paper, called <I>Our health, our care, our say</I>. It contains a
diagram which defines a community hospital asone which offers
multi-use community clinics, intermediate care, integrated health and
social care, or is a remodelled general hospital&#151;presumably with
or without beds.</p><p><a name="06103075000014"></a>PCTs or trusts
will argue that after closing all in-patient facilities, minor surgery
and minor casualty, but retaining two or three physio sessions, the
hospital is still open. That is dishonest and it does not wash with the
public. The public do not recognise a multi-use clinic as a hospital.
They perceive the closure of in-patient beds as a significant loss of
services. So, can we agree that a community hospital is, in essence, a
small local hospital with 20 to 30 beds, a range of clinics,
rehabilitation, a minor surgical and a minor injuries unit? Anything
less is a con. Some community hospitals have other facilities such as
hospice care, or birthing centres, but they are in addition to, not
instead of.</p><p><a name="06103075000015"></a>Using my definition,
which is drawn from one used by the Community Hospitals Association,
out of 320 community hospitals in England, 107 are under threat and 10
have closed this year alone. This has happened when the Government have
explicitly stated that,</p><ul><a name="06103075000045"></a>&#147;community facilities should
not be lost in response to short-term budgetary pressures that are not
related to the viability of the community facility
itself&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06103075000016"></a>Community
hospitals rarely exceed their budgets. Their beds cost between a third
and a half of an acute bed. They are efficiently run with committed
staff. The food is edible, the infection rate low and the quality of
care high, because neighbours are looking

never know who you are going to meet in Tesco on Saturday
morning.</p><p><a name="06103075000017"></a>The public value these
hospitals and recognise that they are closing to pay off other
debts&#151;and the public have taken to the streets. Angry protestors
are marching across England&#151;in Gloucestershire, Suffolk,
Norfolk, Cumbria, the New Forest, Wiltshire, Shropshire and
Oxfordshire. It is sad that these areas do not show up on the Secretary
of State&#146;s political heat map. Few are in Labour seats. They are
in market towns and rural areas&#151;out-of-the-way places that
Labour finds hard to reach. The Minister is quoted in this
week&#146;s <I>Health Service Journal </I>as saying that some trusts
are pretty inept in theway they go about consultations on
service reconfiguration, presenting a <I>fait accompli</I>, rather than
involving local people. So, being the fifth most powerful person in the
NHS, and clearly concerned, what measures is the Minister going to take
to ensure that PCTs listen and involve local people; and, where they
have not, what is he going to do about it?</p><p><a name="06103075000018"></a>Change requires resources. The sum of
&#163;750 million has been allocated over five years for the
refurbishment and equipment of community facilities. I do not want to
be ungrateful but this smacks of a Treasury initiative&#151;Big
Brother providing the wrong solution for the wrong problem. NHS LIFT
and other capital schemes involving the private sector are available.
It is revenue that is in short supply, not capital.</p><p><a name="06103075000019"></a>The original benefactors, like my
husband&#146;s great-grandfather, gave their hospitals to the local
community. In 1948, with great generosity, they gave again to the new
NHS&#151;a health service now owned by the people. Today, that
generosity is being denied to the local community. Sites are sold to
pay off some remote debt unrelated to the local population. Marvellous
Leagues of Friends voluntarily paint wards, make curtains and raise
funds for buildings and equipment, but they cannot provide trained
staff day in, day out. So, as the fifth most powerful person in the
NHS, will the Minister negotiate with the Treasury to ensure that this
capital fund can be used flexibly and be converted to revenue, as and
when the need arises?</p><p><a name="06103075000020"></a>I turn to
the subject of birthing centres, maternity and midwife-led units. The
issues are very similar. Supermarkets driven by consumer demand have
realised that people want convenience, diversity and choice. Tesco and
Sainsbury, having invested heavily in large stores, are now
diversifying in small convenience stores, locally sited. The NHS, as
always, forced into short-term expediency, is working against this
social trend. It is centralising and reducing choice.</p><p><a name="06103075000021"></a>The defence is that units close because
they are not popular&#151;that is not true. What happens is that
those intent on the closure say, &#147;We will keep this unit open
but only from 9 am to 5.30 pm&#148;. Unsurprisingly, women say,
&#147;How can I guarantee my baby will respect working hours and
arrive just then? I had

birthing centre which is under threat. It may not be there when the
great day arrives.</p><p><a name="06103075000022"></a>The Birth
Centre Network has worked for three years to further enhance
midwife-led units and establish quality standards&#151;an initiative
applauded by Stephen Ladyman, then the Minister responsible for
maternity services. What progress have the Government made in funding
this project?</p><p><a name="06103075000023"></a>Today&#146;s
PCTs, in turmoil, broke and pressurised to break even, see a line in
their budgets and think, &#147;Cut the birthing centre and save
&#163;0.25 million&#148;. But they fail to think of the additional
costs in the high-tech maternity unit&#151;the additional unneeded,
unwanted, highly expensive interventions, not only in cash but also in
health terms. Will the Minister, the fifth most powerful person in the
NHS, honour the undertaking given by his colleague, Stephen Ladyman, to
undertake an economic appraisal of the costs and benefits of birthing
centres?</p><p><a name="06103075000024"></a>According to the
Office for National Statistics, the birth rate has been increasing for
the past five years. The Government Actuary&#146;s Department
predicts further increases over the 2003 birth rate. Today,18
birth centres or midwife-led units are under threat, nine have closed
temporarily and three have permanently closed. In addition, other
maternity units in district general hospitals are under threat. With
units closing, where are these women to give birth?</p><p><a name="06103075000025"></a>There have been shameful incidents where
women in labour have been rushed from one hospital to another searching
for a maternity unit&#151;this at a time when in July Ivan Lewis, the
Minister now in charge, emphasised that maternity services are a
priority and that the Government will meet their manifesto
commitments.</p><p><a name="06103075000026"></a>So to my final
question. The Government extol choice, which is very popular. They
believe that more care should be provided closer to home, which is also
popular. Therefore, can the Minister&#151;after all, the fifth most
powerful person in the NHS&#151;explain how the Government&#146;s
policies will be implemented, and when decisions are devolved and
locally ignored?</p><h5><a name="06103075000047"></a>7.55

and is now developing an alternative service.</p><p><a name="06103075000029"></a>I declare my interest as a member of the
board of Monitor, the NHS foundation trust regulator, which is
examining with interest and some excitement the possibility that some
community hospitals and wider community health services could be
delivered via foundation trust status. That would be a practical means
of injecting improved local accountability and bringing better
financial and managerial rigour and service innovation into the
community services sector. This is a &#163;7.5 billion industry and
perhaps it needs a little more rigour to be brought to it. To justify
effective governance and financial expertise in such trusts, sufficient
size is important&#151;perhaps less than &#163;30 million would be
unwise&#151;but I urge the Minister not to get too hung up on this or
on the current geography of services. It may be better to let some
specialist services thrive across larger areas, rather than leave
existing generic services as they are.</p><p><a name="06103075000030"></a>In this brief debate tonight, I want to
highlight three other matters: first, the need to increase the
diversity of providers of community health; secondly, the importance of
better commissioning of those services; and, thirdly, how crucial it is
to understand the detailed costs if we are to make an impact on service
delivery.</p><p><a name="06103075000031"></a>I have lived through
numerous decisions and revisions relating to the role of community
hospitals. There are still 450 of them, in spite of the alarms about
closure, all the way through from the traditional cottage hospital at
one end of the spectrum to, at the other end, a modern, almost bedless
site for outpatients, diagnostic tests, minor operations and day
treatments. I believe it is possible to have community hospitals
without beds. However, we need to ensure that the next generation of
community hospitals is the second sort, rather than the latter,
traditional sort, where many of the services can be provided rather
better by independent sector nursing homes and the spot-purchasing of
beds of different sorts. The recent White Paper set out clearly what
needs to be delivered, but the infrastructure to deliver that vision is
not in place.</p><p><a name="06103075000032"></a>Revenue follows
capital investment in the NHS, so the Government&#146;s announcement
of &#163;850 million capital investment in such schemes is very
welcome. But we must pause and consider why NHS LIFT, which, as the
National Audit Office pointed out recently, has been relatively
successful in getting new private money invested in GP premises, has
not on the whole stimulated the new-style community services or the new
kind of community hospitals which the Government support. The answer
lies in the poor commissioning of services. Unless we strengthen the
commissioning and detailed procurement of services, acute hospitals
will continue to dominate. We have seen how difficult it has been for
United Healthcare to make inroads into primary health and community
health services in the teeth of reactionary opposition. Can the
Minister tell us what steps the Government

development of hospitals for the future?</p><p><a name="06103075000033"></a>I was very encouraged to see in the
<I>Health Service Journal </I>of 19 October a commitment from the
Minister to unbundling the tariff for rehabilitation services&#151;to
encourage community-based options&#151;and for diagnostics, too. This
is crucial if we are to understand what money is being spent on
community health and how we can begin to spend it better. When is some
definite news expected on that unbundling work, which is so crucial to
delivering the services that we
need?</p><h5><a name="06103075000048"></a>8

Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for raising this debate. I shall speak about
maternity units.</p><p><a name="06103075000035"></a>Maternity
services should be safe and of the highest quality, because, for more
than 100 years, the midwifery profession has been regulated. Midwives
are regulated by a set of midwives&#146; rules and a code of conduct.
Formal supervision of midwives takes place, with supervisors of
midwives accountable for ensuring that all the rules are
followed.</p><p><a name="06103075000036"></a>There have been many
changes in policy on who leads in the practice of childbirth, not least
as a result of the input of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, into
the <I>Changing Childbirth </I>report of 1993. However, whether
hospital delivery or home delivery is the fashion, the priorities are a
safe pregnancy, safe delivery of a healthy baby and a healthy mother.
However, despite the regulations and supervision, all has not been well
and we need to ask why.</p><p><a name="06103075000037"></a>The
United Kingdom is renowned for a very low level of maternal deaths. The
national average is11.4 per 100,000 births, but, between 2002
and 2005, this figure rose dramatically, when, in Northwick Park
hospital, 10 maternal deaths were recorded. This led to an
investigation of maternity services by the Healthcare Commission. It
identified common factors in nine of the 10 cases. They included:
insufficient input from the consultant or a senior midwife, with
difficult decisions often left to junior staff; failure in a number of
cases to respond quickly where a woman&#146;s condition changed
unexpectedly; inadequate resources; agency and locum staff; the lack of
a dedicated high dependency unit; a working culture which led to poor
working practices, resulting in a poor quality of care; failure to
learn lessons in the unit&#151;the trust took action following the
deaths, but the working environment was such that mistakes were
repeated&#151;and failure by the trust board to appreciate the
seriousness of the situation&#151;the board was aware of the high
number of deaths and should have acted sooner to rectify the
problems.</p><p><a name="06103075000038"></a>Sir Ian Kennedy, the
chairman of the Health Care Commission, said that the root cause of
poor performance is often weak managerial or clinical leadership, which
can leave problems unidentified or unresolved; in other words, the unit
has become dysfunctional. As a result of the Healthcare Commission's
report, an outside team was brought in to assist in rectifying the
problems. It was led 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_91"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by Professor Arulkumaran, head of obstetrics atSt. George's
Hospital. A number of workforce streams were identified, requiring
leadership and implementation by midwives and obstetricians. These have
now been addressed. I highlight this tragic situation to demonstrate
that, where no performance management of clinical care is in place and
no accountability is being exercised through the organisation, up to
and including the board members, tragedies such as this
occur.</p><p><a name="06103075000039"></a>Sadly, this is not an
isolated case of performance management of clinical care not being
exercised. Commissioned by the Burdett Trust for Nursing, a report was
recently published by the Office for Public Management entitled, <I>Who
Cares Wins: Leadership and the Business of Caring</I>. A companion
study was produced to back the OPM report&#146;s findings, with
evidence based on research by Plymouth University. Having studied a
random sample of healthcare trust board minutes, researchers found that
only 14 per cent mentioned direct clinical
care.</p><p><a name="06103075000040"></a>The OPM report
demonstrates that the business of caring is a whole-board issue and it
argues that, if a more market-driven health system is going to deliver
a new NHS, patient satisfaction and customer care need equal ranking
with finance, targets and outputs on board agendas. However, it also
makes it very clear that critical organisational factors need to be
addressed so that the business of caring is led and managed in a way
which is clearly accountable and which seeks, and acts on,
patients&#146; opinions.</p><p><a name="06103075000041"></a>The
unanswered question that emerges fromthe work which the
Burdett Trust for Nursing commissioned is: how will NHS trust boards be
encouraged to balance finance, targets and outputs on their agendas
with patient care? Who will be accountable and have the authority at
board level for the performance management of clinical
care?</p><p><a name="06103075000042"></a>We surely cannot wait for
units to become dysfunctional, whether they are maternity units, as in
Northwick Park, or acute or mental health trusts. Patients surely
deserve the highest-quality care delivered in the most cost-effective
way. The strategy to introduce a dedicated person at executive board
level who is accountable for the performance management of patient care
is complicated, involving trust board executives and non-executives, as
well as healthcare professionals.</p><p><a name="06103075000043"></a>Will the Minister give his support to the
concept of having a designated person at board level accountable for
performance management of clinical care and consider making resources
available for the training that will be required for executive and
non-executive board members? A designated performance manager of
clinical care would be in the interest of ensuring that care and
compassion become part of the agenda and a high quality of care for
patients.</p><h5><a name="06103078000065"></a>8.06

is

hostile complaint from the public. The policy on community hospitals is
an example of this. My noble friend set out the problems that are
occurring around the country, which are rather more typical, perhaps I
may respectfully say, than the example given by the noble Baroness,
Lady Murphy.</p><p><a name="06103078000002"></a>The Government use
the remarkably ugly word &#147;reconfiguration&#148; of services to
explain what they are doing. Basically, that means closing some
facilities to develop others. They are never entirely frank in public
about the implications and, particularly, the closures. On 5 July, an
announcement from the Department of Health trumpeted
a,</p><ul><a name="06103078000064"></a>&#147;huge cash boost
for community
hospitals&#148;,</ul><a name="06103078000056"></a>without
the press release quite making it clear that the promised &#163;750
million was capital spending and not revenue, which is where the
problems were.<p><a name="06103078000003"></a>However, the
department knows as well as everybody else that the general policy that
it is following involves hospital closures. They are difficult
decisions for any Government to take, where, at the very least, the
public should be able to expect that decisions are taken absolutely
objectively. This is the one point that I want to make in this short
debate.</p><p><a name="06103078000004"></a>On 3 July, two days
before the &#147;huge cash boost for community hospitals&#148;
press release, a meeting took place which involved not just health
Ministers, but party political representatives of the Labour Party,
including the party chairman, Hazel Blears, and political advisers from
Number 10. I quote from the <I>Times </I>of 15 September, reporting on
a number of e-mails which had come to it. The e-mails stated that
Patricia Hewitt, the Secretary of State, called for those at the
meeting to be provided with &#147;heat maps&#148;, showing public
opposition and the potential political implication of any closures.
Another e-mail from Patricia Hewitt&#146;s private secretary asked
for a political meeting to discuss the implications of the Civil
Service submission on how services should be changed. The e-mails in
the <I>Times </I>report went on to state that the Health Secretary
wanted a political meeting to discuss the submission and that she
wanted the health Ministers, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, and Andrew
Burnham, to attend with their advisers, as well as Ms Blears with her
two advisers and two advisers from Number 10. A further e-mail from
Miss Hewitt&#146;s diary secretary stated that Ms Blears had asked
for a party representative to be included at the Department of Health
meeting. Later, a spokesman for Ms Blears confirmed that the meeting
had taken place, but said that, because it was political, there was no
record of who was present. He
said:</p><ul><a name="06103078000061"></a>&#147;It
wouldn&#146;t be unusual for Labour Party press officers to attend
meetings with
ministers&#148;.</ul><a name="06103078000057"></a>This is a
serious matter which goes to the heart of how the Government are
run. <p><a name="06103078000005"></a>For six years, I was
Secretary of State for Social Services and I had one special adviser.
My Ministers of State&#151;unknown people like John Major and Ken
Clarke&#151;had a no special advisers whatever. At this meeting there
appear to have been six or seven special advisers. However, I find it
utterly extraordinary that 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_93"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Labour Party chairman, plus this array of political advisers, should
be allowed to give their views on such an official submission. It is
beyond belief that the Labour Party press officer should have been
invited and utterly incredible that not one of the six or seven
advisers actually took a note of anything that took place at the
meeting. I find that simply unbelievable. Without that we cannot judge
whether party political interests entered into what should have been an
impartial and objective process.</p><p><a name="06103078000006"></a>There is one man who can answer those
questions: the noble Lord, Lord Warner, who was at the meeting. Will he
confirm that such a meeting took place? Will he explain what he
understands by &#147;heat maps&#148;? Will he confirm the
membership of that meeting and confirm that no note was ever taken of
it? Above all, how can such a clearly party-political meeting be
justified to consider an official submission on such issues of health
policy? Should not any policy involving closures be fair and clearly
seen to be fair? Is there not a danger at the moment of the whole
process appearing tainted?</p><h5><a name="06103078000066"></a>8.11

Finlay of Llandaff:</b> My Lords, I too thank the
noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for instigating this debate and for
the way in which she opened it. I declare my interest in palliative
care. I wish to address hospice services as a community resource, the
way in which they integrate with community hospitals, and the fact that
I believe that they should be more integrated than they are.</p><p><a name="06103078000008"></a>The in-patient beds in the community are
an important resource. At the moment, in England there are 176 units,
providing 2,624 hospice beds. This patient-focused community resource
is effectively subsidising the NHS provision to a great extent. Last
year, English adult independent voluntary hospices spent &#163;326
million on providing services. It has been estimated that if the NHS
were to provide a similar service to that provided by the voluntary
hospices, it would incur expenditure of around &#163;415 million,
unless it also benefited from the equivalent volunteer input that the
local community services attract and are able to motivate and maintain.
But the hospices, despite the &#163;415 million that the NHS would
have incurred, received only &#163;119 million of NHS funding,
leaving about &#163;208 million as non-NHS funded expenditure. It is
worrying that over a quarter of hospices recorded a deficit last
year.</p><p><a name="06103078000009"></a>Their workload is
considerable. Without them that workload would land at the door of
community hospitals and the NHS. Across the UK there were more than
58,000 admissions, of whom 42,000 were new in-patients; there were
30,000 deaths and 160,000 patients were visited by home-care teams. So
hospices are an important resource in the communities they serve; they
provide care that evaluates well and they relieve pressure on the NHS;
but they cannot and should not operate in isolation. An example of
integrated care is being led in the hospice world by Marie
Curie&#146;s Delivering Choice programme, which is keen to work with
providers at every level. Local hospice services can provide in-reach
services into 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_94"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>community hospitals to ensure networked care. Community hospitals are
not only a step down from hospitals and a step towards home, but they
also provide a higher-tech environment than the hospice unit for some
diagnostic and therapeutic admissions that do not need to go to a
specialist or acute centre and for some drug monitoring.</p><p><a name="06103078000010"></a>However, many in their last illness are
not imminently dying and they need services and support near their
homes where a local hospice does not exist. No one should forget the
social cost of caring. There are more than 6 million carers throughout
the UK, about 12 per cent of the adult population. The number providing
support for 20 hours or more every week has increased steadily and is
probably over2 million now. The number of heavy-end
carers&#151;those providing more than 50 hours of care a
week&#151;has increased at a proportionately greater rate. No one
should forget that those providing this heavy-end care are twice as
likely not to be in good health as those who are not carers. Those
under 25 are three times more likely not to be in good health. It is
also clear that mental and physical health deteriorates the longer
carers continue to care, particularly when they do not get a break. I
know that a third of those who have not had a break have mental health
problems.</p><p><a name="06103078000011"></a>So community
hospitals need to work with their local hospice services and with other
community services to relieve the pressure on carers at home. With all
the powers that were highlighted by the noble Baroness, Lady
Cumberlege, in her opening speech, does the Minister recognise the huge
resource that hospices provide? Can he assure us that the Government
see integration across all sectors&#151;home, hospice, community
hospital and on to acute and specialist trusts&#151;as a priority in
the new NHS so that resources are best utilised, patients receive the
most appropriate care to match their needs and carers are not worn to
the ground by caring at home, nor by travelling great distances to
visit someone they love in an in-patient
unit?</p><h5><a name="06103078000067"></a>8.16

Masham of Ilton:</b> My Lords, just before the Summer
Recess, on a very hot day, a large lobby from the West Country and the
New Forest campaigned for community hospitals. I was impressed by how
the communities had come together. The lobby consisted of patients and
their supporters, hospital staff and fund raisers. They wanted
Parliament and their Members of Parliament to know how strongly they
felt. All through the Summer Recess, in north Yorkshire, where I live,
there has been a running campaign for the local community hospital in
Ripon to stop cutting beds and for two units for elderly people with
mental health problems to be retained. They also provide much needed
respite care. Members of the public who know how important those
facilities are have been organising petitions. The local councillors
and the PCT members have been walking out of meetings and disagreeing
with each other and the public have become more 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_95"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerned as the Ripon community hospital has now cut its 20 beds by
half, two of which are hospice care
beds.</p><p><a name="06103078000013"></a>The Government keep saying
that more healthcare has to be provided by primary healthcare, but the
overspend led to the shortfall in other services, including the fast
response teams and nursing, causing a shortage of district nurses in
the Ripon area. The out of hours doctor service at the weekends and
after 7pm seems to come from Harrogate, which is 26 miles away from
Masham, where I live. The local surgery operates only from 9am to 7pm
with a lunch break from 12.30 to 2pm, Monday to Friday, with a half day
on Thursday. The local vet service also has an out of hours service,
but the vets answer emergency calls quicker than the doctors. It is not
surprising that the local population in rural areas feel threatened
when they see their local services diminishing and they know that
people are living longer and the Government have stated that there are
more people with Alzheimer&#146;s and dementias. Many of the local
rural surgeries are not equipped to deal with many procedures that the
Government are now saying could be undertaken in them. That is why the
community hospitals have a role to
play.</p><p><a name="06103078000014"></a>The Government have given
a great deal of extra money but now the question is being asked, where
has all the money gone? The maternity units up and down the country
seem to be patchy. I have heard high praise from two people I am
involved with: first, my secretary, who had a caesarean in a County
Durham hospital; and secondly, a nephew and his wife, who enjoyed a
natural birth in a birthing pool in east Yorkshire. Both families had
successful births and praised the attention of the midwives, but there
are other units that seem to be under a great deal of pressure and I am
told that there is a baby boom at the present
time.</p><p><a name="06103078000015"></a>May I ask the Minister a
question particularly associated with London? It seems that there is an
upsurge in births by caesarean. Is the reason for this that maternity
units have become overstretched with midwives having to care for more
than one woman in labour at a time and women being worried that
complications will not be spotted in time and their baby will be placed
at risk? As there have been some disturbing cases the risk of
litigation may also be a factor. Are pregnant women told of the risks
of caesarean births such as breathing difficulties and the need for
specialist treatment for the babies? It also takes mothers longer to
recover after the birth and they may be at a serious risk of infection.
Whatever the procedure, does the Minister agree that the safety of the
mother and the baby should be paramount and the safest procedure should
be worked out before birth so that crisis situations do not
arise?</p><p><a name="06103078000016"></a>I was invited to visit a
GP&#146;s surgery south of the river a short time ago and was told
that health visitors are going to be cut. It seems worrying with a high
amount of deprivation in that area. I thank the noble Baroness for
airing this important topic and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s

Neuberger:</b> My Lords, I too would like to thank
the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for asking this Question and in
this short speech I want to address maternity services. Women of my
generation believed that the hugely successful campaigns for choice in
childbirth had changed things. The <I>Good Birth Guide</I> generation
would be able to give birth where and how they wished. Some wanted to
give birth in warm water, some went for natural childbirth and others
for home births. Some wanted an epidural; others, despite medical
advice at the time, wanted a caesarean, and so on. It seemed as though
things had truly changed, but towards the end of the 1990s that
perception began to shift. Reform, the think tank, showed in December
2005 that women giving birth in NHS hospitals received less care from
their midwives than 10 years earlier.</p><p><a name="06103078000018"></a>To support the question of the noble
Baroness, Lady Masham, the number of hours worked by midwives in NHS
hospitals fell 14 per cent between 1994 and 2004. In 1994 60 per cent
of midwives worked full time. By 2004 that figure had fallen
to39 per cent. In addition, the Council of Deans of the
nursing and health professions representing nursing and health
faculties at UK universities voiced its fears in May this year that the
NHS would by 2009 be stuck with a chronic under supply of nurses,
midwives and other allied health professionals because ofcuts.
But, as of last month, we are being told by David Nicholson that there
may be as many as60 reconfigurations of NHS services,
some&#151;perhaps all&#151;of which will affect maternity services.
That runs alongside a government policy, as stated in, <I>Our Health,
Our Care, Our Community</I>, of expanding community provision for
expectant mothers. It stated:
</p><ul><a name="06103078000062"></a>&#147;We want to ensure that
maternity services are women focused and family centred. This means
increasing choice for women and their partners over where and how they
have their baby&#148;.</ul><a name="06103078000058"></a>That
acknowledged that women were not being able to choose where their baby
was born.<p><a name="06103078000019"></a>However, in, <I>Our
Health, Our Care, Our Say: making it happen</I>, published on 18
October, there is no explicit mention of maternity services&#151;at
least, I could not find one. The Minister in another place, Andy
Burnham, said that decision-making is a matter for PCTs and strategic
health authorities in consultation with the local population. That may
be right. Nevertheless, something strange seems to be going on here.
Part of that may concern a real
difficulty.</p><p><a name="06103078000020"></a>In Stroud, a
renowned local midwife maternity unit was given a last-minute reprieve
last month after strong local objections to its projected closure
because of local health service debts. Near where we live, in
Leamington Spa, people in Banbury are up in arms about the Horton
Hospital&#151;not to mention Kidderminster, not very far away. At the
same time, there are clear clinical reasons for shifting some services
to specialist centres or to newer configurations, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Murphy, said. That needs to be much better explained or
consulted on. The case of Stroud is not alone. Nor is

those assurances this
evening.</p><p><a name="06103078000021"></a>David Nicholson said
that the NHS had to tackle the &#147;wicked&#148; issue of
maternity services. He
said</p><ul><a name="06103078000063"></a>&#147;Pregnant women
would be best served by maternity departments big enough to sustain a
24-hour, consultant-led service. That would require work to be
concentrated in fewer
hospitals.</ul><a name="06103078000059"></a>For whom is that
true? For all pregnant women? The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, has
already pointed out some difficulties that have occurred in some of
those acute hospitals. How can the Secretary of State for Health
announce &#163;750 million for local people to set up and develop
local community services, as she did, if David Nicholson wants to cut
community maternity services, which are hugely popular&#151;and, for
women without complications, often
preferable?<p><a name="06103078000022"></a>If the promise is
that all women will have choice over where and how to have their babies
by 2009, how will what seems to be happening now with community
services help; and how will the Government monitor whether it will be
possible for women to choose? We seem to have two conflicting policy
objectives. Since we have the fifth most important person in the NHS
here&#151;the Minister&#151;perhaps he can explain how the
Government will make that
possible.</p><h5><a name="06103078000069"></a>8.26
pm</h5><p><a name="06103078000023"></a><b><a name="61030-0004.htm_spnew206"></a><a name="06103078000075"></a>Lord
McColl of Dulwich:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank my
noble friend Lady Cumberlege for securing this debate about these vital
services.</p><p><a name="06103078000024"></a>As the custom of this
House is to talk only about subjects that one thinks one knows
something about, I shall confine my remarks to community hospitals,
because, for 15 years, I had the privilege and enjoyment of working in
one such hospital one day a week&#151;in Edenbridge, in Kent. It is
run by five first-class GPs and is a great morale booster for the local
population and staff. They have a rather revolutionary practice: they
keep the place spotlessly clean. Not only were there no complaints
about cleanliness; there were no complaints about catering or patient
care. That hospital is now threatened with closure, through no fault of
its own.</p><p><a name="06103078000025"></a>Community hospitals
play an important role, as has been said, in the local health care
system, contributing general medical care and rehabilitation after
strokes and operations. It is estimated that there are 4,000 GPs
working in community hospitals. On average, they are called into their
hospital five times a week and carry clinical responsibility for
resident patients. Community hospitals almost always stay within the
constraints of their budgets set by the PCTs, but the new Department of
Health system of payment by results, which pays acute trusts for the
work that they do, makes no provision for the in-patient care provided
by community hospitals. Acute hospitals have not been willing to share
their income with the very hospitals which take their patients for
rehabilitation. In the case of elderly patients, that may require an
extended period.</p><p><a name="06103078000026"></a>Indeed,
community hospitals have also been very helpful to the NHS in taking
patients who could not be discharged and who were therefore blocking
beds. 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_98"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bed blocking does three things: it prevents the admission of patients
for elective operations; it diverts acute admissions to other
hospitals; or it causes excessive delays in accident and emergency
departments.</p><p><a name="06103078000027"></a>Despite appeals to
the Secretary of State to set a tariff for community hospitals and
establish a fairer financial system between acute hospital trusts and
community hospitals, the Secretary of State has stated to my friend in
another place, Sir John Stanley, that community health services are
outside the scope of payment by results and that funding must be
negotiated locally. This proves very difficult when many acute hospital
trusts and PCTs are already overspending their
budgets.</p><p><a name="06103078000060"></a>In the light of the
Government&#146;s clear wish that community hospitals are not closed
for short-term budgetary pressures and their wish to see community
services take on more work, why can the Government not ensure that the
PCTs are given the financial support to keep open the very community
hospitals which fulfil their criteria? We must not let the present
crisis of funding in the NHS sweep away an extremely valuable and
treasured resource which will be irreplaceable.</p><p><a name="06103078000028"></a>Many community hospitals were created by
voluntary contributions and efforts and continue to be supported by
their local communities. Their demise would mean this support would be
lost. They have very strong and loyal support from the communities they
serve and this support has been earned by many years of dedicated
service. The public&#146;s strong support is quite easy to
understand. The opportunity for continuity of care from the
patient&#146;s own GP team, the friendlier surrounding and the
proximity to the patient&#146;s home and family make them an
excellent environment for recovery and rehabilitation.</p><p><a name="06103078000029"></a>With these convincing arguments,
acknowledged by the Government&#146;s 2005 election manifesto and
again by their White Paper in January, can the Minister explain to the
House why it is that community hospitals are still closing and why it
is that many more still remain under threat of closure, especially
considering the Government&#146;s wish to provide more healthcare
closer to people&#146;s
homes?</p><h5><a name="06103078000070"></a>8.32

Minister of State, Department of Health(Lord
Warner):</b> My Lords, I am sure we are all grateful
to the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for the opportunity to have
this debate this evening on this important topic. I am extremely
flattered by the power that she and a number of other noble Lords have
invested in me. What I have to do is disappoint her a little by saying
that I am going to resist this overwhelming power that the Health
Service Journal seems to have invested in me by succumbing to telling
large parts of the NHS how to plan their local services in great
detail.</p><p><a name="06103078000031"></a>I have to say that I was
mildly surprised by one or two of the speeches from the Benches
opposite. I know it is a long time since they have been in Government,
but they were in Government from time 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_99"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to time, and I thought they were now also in favour of giving a fair
amount of independence to people locally. That is the principle on
which I am operating.</p><p><a name="06103078000032"></a>This
Government are committed to transforming the NHS. Questions have been
asked this evening about where we spent the money. One of the things we
have done is invest over &#163;1 billion in new and refurbished GP
surgeries and we have opened over42 LIFT projects with another
seven in procurement. These do enable local parts of the NHS to provide
a wider range of services in community settings. We have had to spend a
lot of this money to improve the pay and the numbers of NHS staff, to
deal with the appalling fabric in parts of the hospital service that we
inherited, and to tackle the extremely long waiting times that we
inherited, which in some cases led to unnecessary
deaths.</p><p><a name="06103078000033"></a>So we have put a lot of
money in and my understanding of many of the patient surveys, including
those from the Independent Healthcare Commission, is that people who
actually experience the NHS recognise the improvements made, as
distinct from those who may be excited by misleading reports in the
media. Patients have told us that they want more care closer to home
and many professionals support this. We are committed to providing more
community services in a range of settings as part of this
programme.</p><p><a name="06103078000034"></a>I have to say to the
noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, that I do not resile in any way from
the flexible definition of community hospitals that we have used. I do
not think we want to go in for the kind of rigid definition that she
seemed to be suggesting. That will only fetter the ability of local
communities to design services which meet their local needs in a way
which is suitable for today&#146;s and tomorrow&#146;s
society.</p><p><a name="06103078000035"></a>We also have a bold
vision of radically improved maternity services, which I will say more
about later. By 2009, all women will have a range of choices of where
and how they have their baby and what pain relief they use. Every woman
will have continuity of care before and after birth, provided by a
midwife she knows.</p><p><a name="06103078000036"></a>There is a
clear synergy between our vision for community services and our vision
for maternity services. We expect local commissioners to ensure that
the new generation of community hospitals and services include in many
cases good-quality maternity services. Nothing that we have said would
prevent that.</p><p><a name="06103078000037"></a>In January we
published a White Paper, <I>Our health, our care, our say</I>, which
reiterated our manifesto commitment to develop a new generation of
modern community hospitals over the next five years. Listening to some
speeches, one could start to assume that all community hospitals as
they are today would be fit for purpose for the years to come. Some of
them may be so but many need to change. I was much heartened by the
fine speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, who drew attention to
the fact that sometimes facilities outlive their usefulness and
have 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_100"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be replaced. That is part of having a mature debate about the NHS,
instead of ossifying hospital services in a form which no longer meets
local needs.</p><p><a name="06103078000038"></a>In July we
published <I>Our health, our care, our community: investing in the
future of community hospitals and services</I>. I am pleased to learn
that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, actually read our press notice,
although I am sorry that he did not like it more. The document sets out
in detail how we plan to develop new community hospitals. It announced
the investment of &#163;750 million capital funding over the next
five years and gave detailed guidance to primary care trusts that wish
to bid for some of that
capital.</p><p><a name="06103078000039"></a>The publication told
PCTs that we want new community hospitals to be safe, effective and
affordable. We want them to span primary and secondary care, a boundary
that is sometimes artificial in today&#146;s age. Wherever possible,
we want to see social care and other public services brought
into some of these new developments. We want them to use
innovative funding models and to be designed in consultation with local
residents. We want to see the third sector and the independent sector
play a role in the development of these new services so that they are
fit for purpose in local communities.</p><p><a name="06103078000040"></a>The department has received the first
round of bids. Eleven proposals have been submitted from eight of the
10 SHAs. Officials are reviewing the submissions and collecting more
information. I hope to be able to advise successful bidders and make an
announcement well before the end of this year. We will move speedily to
approve the bids and get things moving on the
applications.</p><p><a name="06103078000041"></a>I make no
apologies for standing by the definition I gave of a community
hospital.</p><p><a name="06103078000042"></a>Some noble Lords
chastised us slightly because this is a capital project not a revenue
one. But the Treasury has defined capital spending, as did a number of
distinguished ex-health Ministers on the Benches opposite. You cannot
substitute capital for revenue in such a way. This has always been a
capital scheme.</p><p><a name="06103078000043"></a>I can tell the
noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that the scope of the new community
facilities that we hope to see developed provides opportunities for
better support for carers. They can provide opportunities to produce
more help with palliative care and to support hospices. It is down to
local people to decide what is fit for purpose in their community
hospitals. We do not want to fetter them in taking forward those ideas.
</p><p><a name="06103078000044"></a>In September 2004, we published
the maternity standard in the <I>National Service Framework for
Children, Young People and Maternity Services</I>. It requires that
women can choose from a range of ante-natal, birth and post-birth care
services in their local area. We followed this with our manifesto
commitment that by 2009 all women will have choice in this particular
area. This brought forward the timescale for the implementation of key
elements of the maternity standard from 10 to five years. We have
outlined a lot of detail since then.</p><p><a name="06103078000045"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege,
raised the request of my former colleague, Stephen Ladyman, for an
economic appraisal in developing quality 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_101"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>standards in birth centres. In July the department
commissioned the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit to conduct a
three-year study into the effectiveness, acceptability and efficiency
of maternity units. The study will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
midwife-led units and consultant-led units. This part of the study will
start next year and will be completed in spring 2008. The department
has also agreed to write to the Healthcare Commission, suggesting that
once the conclusions in the study have been published, it should work
with the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists and the Birth Centre Network to develop operating
standards for stand-alone midwife-led maternity units. I agree with the
noble Baroness, Lady Masham, that the safety of mothers and babies has
to be paramount in this particular area.</p><p><a name="06103078000046"></a>It is sometimes worth concentrating on a
particular area that shows what can be done. In some places the kind of
service we want to see is already happening. The Crowborough Birthing
Centre is a small unit adjacent to Crowborough War Memorial Hospital, a
community hospital. The birthing centre has six beds, is open 24 hours
a day and is run by a dedicated team of experienced midwives. It offers
just the high quality of care we would all like to see.</p><p><a name="06103078000047"></a>David Nicholson was somewhat misquoted:
he is not setting out to close maternity services. He was getting the
NHS and others to address the fact that sometimes we need to look at
the way particular services are provided in some parts of the country,
and may need to reshape those services. Whether we use
&#147;reconfiguration&#148; or some other term, it means that we
must make them safe and fit for
purpose.</p><p><a name="06103078000048"></a><b><a name="61030-0004.htm_spnew208"></a><a name="06103078000077"></a>Lord
Mayhew of Twysden:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful
to the noble Lord. I was hoping&#151;and am still hoping&#151;that
he would find time to deal with the point made about the wholly
improper meeting referred to by my noble friend Lord Fowler. I hope the
Minister will leave time for that. Will
he?</p><p><a name="06103078000049"></a><b><a name="61030-0004.htm_spnew209"></a><a name="06103078000078"></a>Lord
Warner:</b> My Lords, if the noble and learned Lord
was a little more patient and did not interrupt, we would be able to
get to that, but he has now taken a little more time away from the time
I have to deal with the remarks of a number of noble Lords. The noble
Lord, Lord Fowler, was not the only person to raise questions and
issues. I was trying to address those as a courtesy to the whole
House.</p><p><a name="06103078000050"></a>We have talked a lot
about service reconfigurations. This is, of course, one of the issues
the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has a deep interest in, with regard to
this meeting, which he is so concerned about. The point to bear in mind
is that we expect people to review their services and make sure that
they are fit for purpose. This is something that PCTs and strategic
health authorities must, under statute, do in consultation with their
local population. Local people have the power to appeal decisions
through the overview and scrutiny committees, which can, if necessary,
refer decisions to the Secretary of State and the Independent
Reconfiguration Panel. That is a well established procedure, but it
does not mean that we can never have any public debate about making
sure our services are fit for purpose.</p>

the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and I have another minute in which to

forward to dealing with the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. Let me reassure
him that I was at the meeting. As a Minister of State I do not have any
special advisers, nor does my good friend the honourable Mr Andy
Burnham. The Secretary of State has special advisers in the same way
that other Cabinet Ministers have done under successive governments.
What I would say to the noble Lord&#151;and I was a civil servant
when he was the Secretary of State&#151;is that I respect the fact
that when he was in that position, he and his colleagues would, quite
rightly, discuss areas where there might be public anxieties about
changes of policy. I was in attendance on some of those occasions and I
am going to respect the confidentiality of the discussions, just as I
am going to respect the confidentiality of the discussions I had on the
occasion he mentioned with my political colleagues. That is a perfectly
sensible way for any government to conduct
themselves.</p><p><a name="06103078000055"></a>In conclusion, over
the next few years the NHS will be transformed by the extra money we
have put in and we will provide vastly improved maternity services in

that.</p><p><a name="0610315000007"></a>Perhaps I may draw the
House&#146;s attention particularly to subsection (2), which states
that when a new school is set
up:</p><ul><a name="0610315000257"></a>&#147;The local education
authority for the area in which the school is to be established may, if
they so desire, specify that up
to&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="0610315000233"></a>not
necessarily the full
amount&#151;<ul><a name="0610315000281"></a>&#147;25
per cent of places at the school shall be allocated to pupils who do
not follow the religion or religious denomination of the
school&#148;.</ul><a name="0610315000234"></a>That is the
nub of the amendment. It goes on to state that where the local
authority does not specify a certain percentage because it is prepared
to grant a totally exclusive faith school, the Secretary of State can
call that in if there is significant opposition from residents. That is
the amendment we are about to
discuss.<p><a name="0610315000008"></a>I had better turn off
my mobile phone&#151;though you never know, it may be God. I
apologise to noble Lords for that little
intermission.</p><p><a name="0610315000009"></a>The point I want to
make is that the amendment we have tabled today was the
Government&#146;s policy just a week ago. It was the policy
enunciated at the Dispatch Box by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis,
on17 October when he said that, on the undertaking that I
withdraw my amendment, the Government intended
to,</p><ul><a name="0610315000282"></a>&#147;bring forward an
amendment on Third Reading along the following lines. We do not believe
it right for there to be a mandatory national 25 per cent
requirement...However, we wish to give local authorities, in their
role as guardians of community cohesion&#148;&#151;</ul>

debates, and it is absolutely
right&#151;<ul><a name="0610315000283"></a>&#147;a
power to require that new faith schools have admissions policies which
include the offer of at least 25 per cent of places on the basis of
local preference, not faith preference
alone&#148;.</ul><a name="0610315000236"></a>That was the
policy that the Government intended to follow. The Minister also
said:<ul><a name="0610315000258"></a>&#147;We also wish to
confer a reserve power on the Secretary of State&#151;a power, not a
duty&#151;to act in this matter where a local authority&#146;s
decisions give rise to a sufficient body of local
objections&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/10/06; col.
738.]</ul><a name="0610315000010"></a>The Minister has already
said in reply to an earlier amendment that that was conditional upon
his securing a degree of consensus. He said that he was very sorry but
that he could not secure a degree of consensus. I will come back to
that later, if I may. <p><a name="0610315000011"></a>So, what
I have tabled is in effect what the Government&#146;s policy was
seven days ago. Indeed, so enthusiastic was the Secretary of State for
this policy that he actually leaked no less than a Cabinet document to
the <I>Sunday Times</I> of the day before last Monday revealing that
this was the Government&#146;s policy. He made a speech on that
Monday saying that faith schools must cross ethnic and faith barriers.
As late as Wednesday of last week, one of my friends went to see him
and he confirmed that on the following day the Government would table
those two amendments. However, on Thursday night everything changed.
Unfortunately, I was on the way to Oxford in a coach and it was very
difficult to find out what was happening. But the Government completely
changed tack. They abandoned their principle and their policy. One
might ask why there was such a huge U-turn, because it was certainly
the fastest U-turn in political history. I think Churchill said that
the best diet in the world is your own words. But when Churchill said
that, he thought that there would be a decent interval between the
utterance and digestion. In this case there was not; it was a mere
matter of seven days.</p><p><a name="0610315000012"></a>The reason
why the policy was withdrawn is very clear. There was a very effective
Catholic campaign&#151;brilliantly effective&#151;headed by the
Archbishop of Birmingham, who wrote an article in the <I>Daily
Telegraph</I> saying that this was the thin end of the
wedge&#151;those were his very words. Of course, it was not the thin
end of the wedge, because the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, who is gifted in
these matters, said very clearly
that,</p><ul><a name="0610315000284"></a>&#147;there is no
question of requiring this admission arrangement in respect of existing
faith schools where it does not already
apply&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/10/06; col.
739.]</ul><p><a name="0610315000013"></a>The Government made very
clear when they said they were going to table these amendments that in
no way were they to apply to existing faith schools. But the view of
the Catholic Church, led by the Archbishop of Birmingham&#151;of whom
I am an admirer, because he has managed to secure a complete surrender
by the Government without conceding an inch&#151;is exactly the same
as it was seven days ago. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, is nodding. I
hope that the Minister has noted that the noble Lord nodded when I said
that. He is the closest that we get in this House to a Catholic
authority.</p>

Birmingham, in an interview last Friday, said, &#147;If we are going
to have any new Catholic schools&#151;though we have no such
proposals because we cannot afford any new schools at the
moment&#151;but if we have any new Catholic schools, we will
determine what the demand is locally for such schools&#148;. If they
decide that there are 200 pupils in Bury St Edmunds who want to have
Catholic schools, they will then put forward a proposal for a Catholic
school for 200 pupils in Bury St Edmunds. Then he said, &#147;When we
fill that lot, if there is any spare, we will add a few
more&#148;&#151;that is their present policy. So I think that the
Archbishop of Birmingham&#151;and I hope that the noble Lord will
take this back to him&#151;is a brilliant negotiator. He has got the
Government to surrender without yielding an inch. I think that the
Government ought to use him in Iraq. I think that he would do a
marvellous job there. Congratulations to
him.</p><p><a name="0610315000015"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew213"></a><a name="0610315000567"></a>Lord
Alton of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to
the noble Lord. I would just like to say to him that although I too am
a great admirer of the Archbishop of Birmingham and have known him for
probably30 years, I have not actually spoken to him once about
this Bill during its proceedings. He is more than capable of reading
<I>Hansard</I> and seeing what the noble Lord has
said.</p><p><a name="0610315000016"></a>What I was agreeing with
the noble Lord about is that the position has not changed since last
week as far as the opposition of most Catholics is concerned. I do not
speak for the Catholic Church&#151;I speak for myself, like the noble
Lord speaks for himself. Most Catholics in this country feel very
strongly about their schools and would resist any attempt to change the
1944 Education Act, whether it is by central control, in the way that
the noble Lord proposed seven days ago, or now, in his change of heart
seven days later, by making it a local
imposition.</p><p><a name="0610315000017"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew214"></a><a name="0610315000568"></a>Lord
Baker of Dorking:</b> My Lords, with great respect,
my amendment seven days ago applied only to new faith schools and not
existing faith schools. In the past 10 years the Catholic Church has
opened only two new faith schools&#151;two primary schools, one in
Plymouth and one in Milton Keynes&#151;and it has no proposals to
start any more Catholic schools. The amendment affected only new faith
schools, not existing schools. It would not have affected existing
schools.</p><p><a name="0610315000018"></a>I think the Catholic
Church should be congratulated because it adopted the technique of
LBJ&#151;Lyndon Baines Johnson. He had a wonderful technique. He said
that in any dispute you must put your opponent at a disadvantage
immediately. The way you do that is you must get him to deny that he
has had carnal knowledge of a pig. Because as soon as he has to deny
that, everyone begins to believe, &#147;Well, could he have had
carnal knowledge of a pig? My God!&#148;. So the immediate reaction
would be, &#147;Could it be extended to all faith schools?&#148;,
and LBJ would be quite proud of the Archbishop of
Birmingham.</p><p><a name="0610315000019"></a>It is rather ironic
that the main beneficiaries of the Catholic Church&#146;s victory are
not the Catholic schools but the Muslim schools, which have rather

do not think that that is quite what the Pope had in
mind.</p><p><a name="0610315000020"></a>I also had to debate with
the Catholics when I was Secretary of State. I did not deal just with
an archbishop&#151;I was summoned to see Cardinal Hume on my
proposals to establish grant-maintained schools. When I met him in his
palace, he had on his great red robe and had several nuns around him.
He was very impressive indeed and rather saintly. It is very difficult
to debate with a saint. He said, &#147;I have a letter from the Pope
which opposes grant-maintained schools&#148;. I said, &#147;Really?
Why does the Pope oppose grant-maintained schools?&#148;. He said,
&#147;It is an absolute principle of the Catholic Church that nothing
should come between the bishop and his flock, particularly an electoral
process. So I would ask you, please, to withdraw Catholic schools from
the grant-maintained provisions of the Bill&#148;.</p><p><a name="0610315000021"></a>As I said, it was very difficult to argue
with this saintly man, but I said, &#147;I am very sorry, but this
goes back to the Reformation. This is your region and my region. But if
we are going to have national legislation on grant-maintained schools I
cannot possibly exempt the Catholic Church&#148;. I was able to
resist the Catholic Church on that occasion and I think that the
Government could have done so on this occasion, because they made it
quite clear that their proposals would not damage existing Catholic
schools. But they decided not to do
so.</p><p><a name="0610315000022"></a>What is the central issue
behind my amendment? It is not about freedom of worship&#151;that is
accepted in our country. It is not about respect for the
faith&#151;all faiths are respected in our country. It is not about
what is taught by each religion in the schools&#151;that is a matter
for each religion to decide itself. What is at stake is the shape of
our society in the course of the next 10 or 20 years.</p><p><a name="0610315000023"></a>Interestingly, the debates we have had
previously and today are the first serious debates in which we as
legislators have been able to debate the Butler Act since 1944. There
has been no serious debate on the Butler Act. To some, the Butler Act
was a religious settlement in which substantial money was provided to
the Catholic and the Protestant denominations in order to maintain
their schools. However, it had not envisaged at all the situation which
now exists in our country&#151;the multi-faith society into which we
have grown and the nature of those faiths which have now emerged in our
society. As a result of that Act, and of the debates that we have had,
everyone believes that there should be integration in our society. That
is what everyone agrees and it is what report after report has
said.</p><p><a name="0610315000024"></a>The Cantle report on the
race riots in Oldham, Burnley and Bradford in 2001 is the critical
report, and it was absolutely clear in what it said. Its first
recommendation was that schools in the future should have 25 per cent
from other races and other religions. It is still the most important
report on this issue, reporting as it does upon ethnic, racial and
religious strife in our cities just four years ago. Quite apart from
that, all opinion polls show that parents would like, on the whole, to
have integrated schools.</p>



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_107"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="0610315000289"></a>9
pm</h5><p><a name="0610315000025"></a>When the
Government give academies money and support academies, they insist upon
integration. They are about to finance an academy in Oldham itself. It
will be an integrated academy with children from all faiths attending.
The rabbis, priests and imams and other people come in after hours to
talk to the schools. So when the Government are in the driving seat and
provide the money directly, they are totally committed to integration.
I believe that the Minister personally is committed to integration
though I know he will have to speak to another brief tonight. We will
probably not know his real feelings until his memoirs are published. I
hope that I live long enough to read them. The Government are committed
to integration but they run away from the pressure of the Catholic
Church. That is what has happened.</p><p><a name="0610315000026"></a>I remember when the noble Lord, Lord
Kinnock,&#151;who is not in his place tonight&#151;was the shadow
Education Secretary way back in 1980-81. I remember him going to the
Muslim communities and saying, &#147;Don&#146;t ask for separate
Muslim schools; it will not do you any good. Go to ordinary
schools&#148;. The whole lesson of immigrant communities in our
country is that they prosper when they mix and merge and mingle. The
Jewish community shows that time and time again. That was the strong
message put out by the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, and it was in fact the
policy until 1997 when the Government agreed to restart faith schools.
The consequences of that were not appreciated at the time.</p><p><a name="0610315000027"></a>People ask whether my proposal is
practical. I have had to answer on television and radio a lot of
questions such as whether I would send one of my children&#151;I am a
bit past that now&#151;or anyone in my family to a Muslim school to
form part of the 25 per cent. And this is principally about Muslim
schools, because there are 120 such schools waiting in the wings, with
probably 50 or 60 of them ready for it. I am not against that. Money to
Muslim schools must be a good thing because the standard of education
will be improved. But if you take the Queen&#146;s shilling, it is
entirely appropriate for the Queen to determine the conditions on which
that shilling is taken. We can say to the Muslim schools that their
admissions criteria should be closer to the admissions criteria of the
Church of England, but the Church of England has rightly and with great
boldness said that it will give priority to non-Anglicans in 25 per
cent of places in new Anglican schools. That was a bold and correct
measure and reflects very much the practice of what happens in Anglican
schools. That is the policy. I myself went to an Anglican primary
school which was totally mixed and where my closest friend was a Jewish
boy. If the Muslim schools adopt something as relaxed as that as an
admissions criteria then other people will come to then.</p><p><a name="0610315000028"></a>Secondly, in answer to the question of
whether anyone else will go to those schools, Bradford Council has
decided that no particular school should be dominated by a particular
ethnic race. It has moved the catchment areas around so that they are
composed of mixed communities. That can be done, and is being done in
Oldham at the moment. There can be mixed community schools.</p>

House tonight but I am sure that he must have read my speech. I do not
believe that it is in the interest of the Muslim communities themselves
to rush into establishing a great number of Muslim schools. If a large
number of single-faith schools emerge in an area, say four primaries
and three secondaries&#151;there are 100 Muslim schools waiting, but
there are also 100 evangelical Christian schools which in many respects
are just as difficult&#151;then the community will be closed. You
will have a community that is closed upon itself. What will happen in
that area? They will first ask for a separate inspection&#151;and
that has already been asked for. Secondly, they will ask for
modifications to the curriculum. The most beguiling request of all is,
&#147;Can&#146;t we have world history rather than British
history?&#148;. Then, they will also ask in the Muslim schools for an
observance of family Sharia law.</p><p><a name="0610315000030"></a>These communities tend to have two
characteristics&#151;they are disadvantaged and poor. What we are
really talking about is what is going to be the shape of our society in
our towns and cities in the next 20 or 30 years. If the purpose is to
create a total Muslim or Christian personality, then you will have
isolated communities. The report into Oldham observed parallel and
separate development. That is why this debate is important. I know that
it is late at night and a difficult time to take decisions, but this is
the first time that either House has had to discuss this matter and
what will happen.</p><p><a name="0610315000031"></a>If the
Government win tonight&#151;which I suppose is quite
likely&#151;and open the door to more faith schools, the people who
start those schools will have to exercise considerable leadership to
ensure that they do not create closed communities. We talked of the
inspectorate under an earlier amendment, which I do not think is a
substitute for this one&#151;it cannot bear the weight it wants to
carry. One of the things the inspectorate will have to do is find and
draw the fine line between religious teaching and indoctrination, which
is very difficult.</p><p><a name="0610315000032"></a>Dr Patrick
Sookhdeo, director of the Institute of the Study of Islam and
Christianity, is not in favour of exclusive Muslim schools. He said of
the Muslim faith:</p><ul><a name="0610315000259"></a>&#147;It is
the only one which teaches its followers to gain political power and
then impose a law which governs every aspect of life, discriminating
against women and non-believers alike. And this is ultimately why
nave multiculturalism leads not to a mosaic of cultures living
in harmony, but one threatened by Islamic extremism&#148;.</ul><p><a name="0610315000033"></a>The overwhelming feeling of people in this
House, whether they support me tonight or not, is to have some form of
integrated education in our country. I would like to see children of
different faiths playing together in the playground, sitting beside one
another in maths and physics lessons, meeting over lunch, walking down
the corridor together, taking the same bus home and then visiting each
other&#146;s family. That is what I did&#151;I visited a Jewish
family back in Southport during the war. I would never have known what
Judaism was about if I had not done that. If you have separate faith
schools, and more separate faith schools, you will not have that. The
House has to

upon our inner cities or whether we want proper integration. The only
way to have proper integration is to adopt these voluntary proposals. I

I have come to this from different standpoints. The noble Lord is an
Anglican; I am a committed humanist, so there is no chance that God
will phone me on my mobile phone.</p><p><a name="0610315000035"></a>The amendment may not be the perfect
solution, but it would help integration and send a strong signal to
schools. I am also disappointed and frustrated at the
Government&#146;s failure to bring back a similar amendment as
originally proposed, except it has meant that we have had a good
debate.</p><p><a name="0610315000036"></a>Recent surveys have
shown that 64 per cent of the public oppose government funding for
faith schools, fearing their impact on social cohesion&#151;an
expression heard many times tonight. I would prefer to have no
expansion of faith schools, but the amendment tries to balance any
expansion with the imperative to counteract the exclusivity and foster
integration between faiths.</p><p><a name="0610315000037"></a>It
is understandable that with faith schools already funded through the
public purse, others will want public money for their schools. But
faith should surely not be allowed to override the needs of children
for an education which opens windows to a wider world. Culture and
beliefs should, in my view, be transmitted mainly at home, in the
church, mosque or temple. The report on Bradford carried out by the
noble Lord, Lord Ouseley, pointed out that young people realise that
being taught in what he called religious ghettos is not a good
preparation for life in a multicultural society.</p><p><a name="0610315000038"></a>One Muslim school in north-west London
states that the aim of the school
is,</p><ul><a name="0610315000285"></a>&#147;to produce total
Muslim personalities through the training of children&#146;s spirits,
intellect, feelings and bodily senses&#148;.</ul><a name="0610315000237"></a>We know where such exclusivity leads. We
know what happened in Northern Ireland, as pointed out so powerfully at
Report by my noble friend Lady
Blood.<p><a name="0610315000039"></a>I have been and am
committed to sound, integrated education as a teacher, parent and
school governor. My own children all went to local schools where they
made friends across the religious and racial spectrum. I have also been
privileged, through schools, to meet parents and teachers across the
religious spectrum. The school where I am governor celebrates a
multi-faith ethos most successfully. If a school has mixed faiths, then
parents will be of mixed faiths and will create communities of mixed
faiths. Separation will not do this, nor I fear in some cases will
there be adequate emphasis on scientific fact or personal, social and
health education. How will the inspectorate for separate faith schools
operate alongside Ofsted?</p><p><a name="0610315000040"></a>I
remember teaching personal, social and health education in a secondary
school where a father prevented his daughter from attending the lessons
on religious grounds, in case sex was mentioned. This girl

playground. At least the school could deal with this as it had a policy
and a programme, and I am glad to say that the father became convinced
that not discussing things was harmful. How many more children might be
damaged by schools not dealing adequately with their broad educational
needs?</p><p><a name="0610315000041"></a>I do not believe that
faith schools will necessarily and voluntarily admit a percentage of
children of other faiths or of no faith, though I know that some do. I
had a graphic experience of this over the Recess. A Muslim boy I know
wanted to apply to a well known Roman Catholic school in London. He
lived nearer to the school than many who attend it. The case was a
needy one, which I thought might attract some sympathy from the school.
I was told that it only admitted children from Roman Catholic families,
and that the waiting list was also open only to Roman Catholic
families. Some will say that that is fair enough, but I resent having
to pay taxes to fund segregation, which is essentially what this
is.</p><p><a name="0610315000042"></a>The Secretary of State for
Education affirmed, as did my noble friend earlier, that consultation
on this issue with various faiths has taken place. Were all beliefs
consulted&#151;such as humanists and secularists? Were teacher
organisations, governors and parents consulted? The Secretary of State
says we should we seek voluntary agreements rather than use a
&#147;blunt instrument&#148;&#151;his words&#151;to achieve the
aims of integration. Yet Governments have used many a blunt instrument
to change laws on matters of principle and practice. It seems that
here, expediency is being peddled as sound educational
philosophy.</p><p><a name="0610315000043"></a>There is some value
in other amendments before us today about inspections and reviews. I
have great sympathy with them, but I want to see more rigour attached
to ensuring that schools represent a wide spectrum of belief and
understandings now. As I said earlier, a strong signal is needed. The
letter to noble Lords from the noble Lord, Lord Baker, myself, and the
noble Lords, Lord Skidelsky and Lord Taverne,
says:</p><ul><a name="0610315000260"></a>&#147;We do not want to
see our society separated, divided, jealous and envious. We want a
society that is cohesive, harmonious, generous and
tolerant.&#148;</ul><a name="0610315000238"></a>I fear that
unless we are firm about our good intentions, we will see society
splinter even further, and deny children the opportunity to enjoy all
that living in multi-racial Britain
offers.<p><a name="0610315000044"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew216"></a><a name="0610315000570"></a>Lord

pm</h5><p><a name="0610315000046"></a>I suspect the reason that many
people do not want this is because they do not like the idea that
children should be treated as Muslim, Jewish, Protestant and Catholic
children. If you think about it, it is as wrong as if you treat them as
Conservative, Liberal Democrat or Labour children. Most people do not
want that because they feel they want children, as they become more
mature, to decide for themselves what and what not to believe
in.</p><p><a name="0610315000047"></a>It is perfectly true that
religion is overwhelmingly determined by an accident of birth: who your
parents are, and where you are born. That is not true of
all&#151;there are converts&#151;but of most. I suspect that even
as reasonable a group as the Bishops in this House, if they had been
born in a Muslim country, would now be imams rather than bishops. As
children learn to think critically and become more mature, they often
abandon the religion of their parents. That is one of the reasons why
there is a decline in church attendances&#151;not in the case of the
Muslim community, but then if one turns out to a Muslim apostate there
are certain rather severe penalties.</p><p><a name="0610315000048"></a>The fact is that faith schools seek to
ensure that the children they teach stay within the fold. I agree with
the remarks made by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, in the last debate on
this subject. I support this amendment because it seems to be the only
way to limit the role of indoctrination and to leave children as free
as possible to make their own decisions about what to
believe.</p><p><a name="0610315000049"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew217"></a><a name="0610315000571"></a>Lord
Skidelsky:</b> My Lords, I am also a signatory to the
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Baker. I am always amazed how much
theological energy there is still left, especially when we debate
education. I wonder whether the Minister may sometimes feel he is back
in the age of Gladstone, about whom he knows a great deal. All the
issues we are discussing today would have been completely familiar to
the grand old man, and he would have attempted to discourse on them at
immense length, though much more eruditely than any of us can probably
manage&#151;except perhaps the Bishops&#146; Bench.</p><p><a name="0610315000050"></a>The basic historical situation is
perfectly clear. The Roman Catholics, having been driven into a
defensive posture by nonconformist attack, have long since joined
forces with the Church of England in dogmatic defence of the 1902
Education Act, as amended in 1944, which, in Lloyd George&#146;s
words, &#147;put Rome on the rates&#148;. This is exactly the same
debate as we were having in 1902, only now it is not Rome but
Mecca.</p><p><a name="0610315000051"></a>I dare say that the best
solution would have been that proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Peston,
that most rational of men: that all state education, new and old,
should be severely secular, with religious education left to churches,
Sunday schools, mosques and other private foundations. That was
essentially 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_112"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the solution of the Church/state conflict in France, but they were too
logical for us. That is not the position we are faced with here; we
have run a dual system in which church and voluntary schools have
received state money, have been supported by the taxpayer and have had
to give very little in return over the 100 years or more that the
system has existed. I know that they want to continue that, as they had
a good deal from the state.</p><p><a name="0610315000052"></a>The
1944 Act established a principle, of which we should be aware in
considering the amendment, that voluntary schools were supposed to give
something in return for state support. They could opt to be controlled
and obtain 100 per cent grant, or aided and get 50 per cent grant, or
have special agreements and a 75 per cent grant. Each had a graduated
obligation attached to it&#151;the grant was in inverse ratio to the
freedom to provide denominational instruction. In other words, the less
they got, the freer they were to be religious missionaries. The
principle is clear; if the state gives money to schools, it has a right
to a say in school policy and aims.</p><p><a name="0610315000053"></a>What aims of educational policy do the
Government want to see served by allowing new schools to be set up?
That goes back to a debate that we have been having for the past 10 to
15 years, the main point of which is that such schools are part of the
Government&#146;s choice agenda. Some of us have urged for a long
time the idea that parents should be given a wider choice than they now
have regarding to which schools they send their
children.</p><p><a name="0610315000054"></a>The Government could
have pursued that by allowing only secular promoters to set up state
schools. In fact, as I understood it, the main clamour for new
state-supported schools came from Muslim communities. So the Government
decided, as part of their choice agenda, to put Mecca on the rates,
just as Rome was put on the rates in
1902.</p><p><a name="0610315000055"></a>The Church of England and
Roman Catholics do not want to disturb the existing concordat. They are
relaxed that Muslim schools can be fitted into it without any major
change. But we need something more robust, as I suggested in my
previous intervention. First, we are dealing with large, newly arrived
communities, not old, established ones. That presents us with problems
of a completely different order from those that gave rise to the
Church/state debates of the previous century. Nebulous words, or even
instructions, such as &#147;promoting social cohesion&#148; are
inadequate to that situation, as the noble Baroness, Lady Flather,
pointed out.</p><p><a name="0610315000056"></a>Secondly, the
position is more complicated because Islam has more implications for
the curriculum than Christian denominations. The problem is the
requirement stated in a standard text that Islamic education should in
all respects conform to Koranic guidance. That is particularly relevant
to such areas of the curriculum as physical education, swimming, art,
music, dance and sex education. Do we want government money to be
invested in such deeply separated curricula? We should not want that
and we should impose some requirement. The amendment of

be put on the rates without substantial
modifications.</p><p><a name="0610315000057"></a>Requiring Muslim
schools to take 25 per cent non-Muslim pupils will be a continuous
check on any tendency to extreme separation, which would otherwise
become unchecked. There are other ways of achieving greater integration
of educational practices, but until the Government come up with
something more robust, I urge the House to support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="0610315000058"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew218"></a><a name="0610315000572"></a>Lord
Alton of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, I oppose the
amendment. I do not want to rehearse all the arguments that I put to
your Lordships during Report&#151;I know that we all want to make
progress.</p><p><a name="0610315000059"></a>I enjoyed the
knock-about to which the noble Lord, Lord Baker, treated us earlier,
but I think that he sometimes underestimates the sense of passion that
ordinary Catholics feel about this issue. I do not refer to the
Catholic Church but to people who attend Catholic churches, who have
been to Catholic schools and whose children attend Catholic
schools.</p><p><a name="0610315000060"></a>The noble
Lord&#151;perhaps inadvertently, because he said where his real
target was&#151;has inflamed the passions of people in nearly 2,000
Catholic schools all over the country because his amendment has been
interpreted by some as the beginning of the end of their control over
their admissions policies. Many noble Lords and Members of another
place have also received letters from those people. The position was
exacerbated&#151;a point that he did not touch on&#151;when the
Secretary of State said that this measure could be applied later to all
Church schools. That obviously fills people with a deep sense of
misgiving and places at risk the gains that many people have
made.</p><p><a name="0610315000061"></a>Lessons can be learnt from
the experience of immigrant families who came to this country and
integrated and married in the way that I described on Report. My mother
was from the west of Ireland and came to the East End, where she
married my father at the end of the war. He was a Desert Rat and, when
he was demobbed, they married. In common with many people, I was
brought up in the East End in a Catholic/Jewish neighbourhood and had
the same kind of friendships as the noble Lord, despite the fact that I
went to Catholic schools. I was privileged to go on to the Jesuit
grammar school, having passed the scholarship at the age of 11. That
represented yet more social division, as the noble Lord might see it,
but, in fact, it provided me with an opportunity, and I am grateful to
those who gave me those chances at that time. I am also very conscious
of the way in which money had to be raised, street by street,
neighbourhood by neighbourhood and parish by parish, to pay for the
construction of those schools.</p><p><a name="0610315000062"></a>My noble friend Lord Skidelsky knows
better than I do that the debate did not begin at the start of the 20th
century. The noble Lord, Lord Baker, is a great admirer of GK
Chesterton and is familiar with the rallies that he and Hilaire Belloc
led in 1906 to fight for Catholic education in this country. They came
to the issue having been informed by what had happened in the 19th
century. After all, it was only in 1829 that 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_114"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Jews and Catholics were emancipated and the iniquitous Test Acts were
removed. During the 19th century, universities&#151;Oxbridge, for
example&#151;denied places to Catholics merely because they were
Catholics. Therefore, significant gains have been made.</p><p><a name="0610315000063"></a>If we want to integrate the Muslim
community in this country, it will not happen by imposing 25 per cent
quotas. Does anyone believe that, in the present climate, people will
be queuing up to send their children to Muslim schools to take up that
25 per cent of places? It would be unrealistic to believe that. We will
see change through patience and generosity and by working with the
Muslim community in this country. I was very pleased to hear the noble
Lord, Lord Ahmed, talk this evening about the responsibility that
Muslims feel they have to work towards social inclusion, social
responsibility and social cohesion. I am sure that that represents the
best way forward.</p><p><a name="0610315000064"></a>It has been
suggested in this debate and previously that somehow the Church schools
are not inclusive. However, the fact is that about 16 per cent of our
population who qualify as ethnic minorities are in state schools. In
Catholic schools, that figure is 18 per cent. Thirty per cent of pupils
in Catholic schools are not Catholic. It is not as a result of
legislation that those schools have come to admit people who are not
Catholic; they have done so voluntarily.</p><p><a name="0610315000065"></a>I was struck by a letter that many of your
Lordships will have received today from Henry Grunwald QC, the
President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. He said:</p><ul><a name="0610315000261"></a>&#147;You will understand, therefore,
why our community is particularly shocked at the suggestion that the
current model of Jewish faith schools would no longer have an assured
future. You will also understand the concern that a discretion devolved
to local authorities provides very little comfort, when there can be no
certainty as to how that discretion would be exercised, either now or
in the future. Finally, you should be aware of the fear,
notwithstanding any current assurances, that these provisions might
eventually extend to existing faith
schools&#148;.</ul><a name="0610315000239"></a>That is
certainly the view of many Catholics as well as Jews, and we should
take such fears into account as we consider these
questions. <p><a name="0610315000066"></a>I think back to my
own experience as a constituency Member of Parliament in Liverpool. It
was suggested earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, that Jewish
schools are in some way non-inclusive. The fact is that, because there
was a surfeit of places in the local Jewish school that served my own
constituency&#151;the King David High School&#151;it had more
non-Jewish than Jewish children. This matter is not as straightforward
as noble Lords would have us
believe.</p><h5><a name="0610315000291"></a>9.30

come to the same conclusion. It is also notable that opposition to the
introduction of quotas has united the Prime Minister and the Leader of
the Opposition. The political reality is that if this amendment were
passed this evening, it would undoubtedly be resisted in another
place.<p><a name="0610315000068"></a>Last week, when asked
whether he supported this amendment, David Cameron categorically said
that he opposed the quotas proposed in the noble Lord&#146;s
amendment because it smacked of social engineering. He said that he had
initially been attracted to the localist approach canvassed by the
Secretary of State, until he had heard Mr Johnson suggest that the
principle could in future be applied to all Church schools. Mr Cameron
concluded that the best and most effective way forward was to impose a
duty to work for social cohesion, which your Lordships debated and
approved earlier
today.</p><p><a name="0610315000069"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew219"></a><a name="0610315000573"></a>Lord

down the land. What will that lead to in turn? It will lead to a
patchwork quilt. I give noble Lords an example&#151;it is not
hypothetical. During the 1980s, many noble Lords will have followed
events in Liverpool. If an ideologically motivated city council takes
it into its head to oppose all state schools, it would be able, under
the amendment which has been crafted this evening, to deny places in
faith schools. It would be able to impose a new Test Act. Its local
thought police would decide whether someone had faith. I am not
exaggerating the situation: that is precisely what would happen. How
will they be able to prove it one way or another? If the noble
Lord&#146;s amendment were to be successful and become law, we could
easily find ourselves in a situation where people lied to admissions
authorities to get their children into a school. How would we be able
to prove that they told the truth? This amendment opens the way to that
situation.</p><p><a name="0610315000073"></a>It would achieve one

Muslims, Jews and many others to bring about some sense of social

or two has borne fruit. I hope he will take the view that the amendment
which was carried a short time ago is a great achievement and that he
should not press the matter further. If he does so, I certainly shall
not vote for his amendment. I shall not vote against him, but only for
old time&#146;s sake and not because I have any sympathy for the

answer to the fundamental argument against what he proposes. I am glad
that the Government have climbed down from an elevated position that
they should never have scaled. If new Catholic schools were required to
take a given percentage of children of non-Catholic parents, I cannot
believe that harmony would reign where harmony does not prevail now. In
many of our inner cities, the problem is not that there are schools
where all the children are of one faith, but, a more serious one, that
there are schools where nearly all the children are of one race. In
some neighbourhoods, schools have become almost entirely occupied by
people of one race.</p><p><a name="0610315000078"></a>This
amendment would not cure a social ill; it would create a great
injustice. If new schools were required to take a given percentage of
children of, say, non-Catholic parents, that would create a great
feeling of injustice among those Catholic parents whose children were
denied places which were given to the children of non-Catholic parents.
We all know that much of the anxiety in the House tonight is centred on
the future of Muslim schools and what that will do for our society. I
can see the argument for a complete end to state funding of new faith
schools, but I can see no argument for the state continuing to fund
faith schools and then agonising over how to

endeavour to be brief and I shall certainly not emulate Gladstone. I
agree with a number of speakers that we are seeking integration. I am
sorry but I do not believe that the amendment in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, will achieve that and I do not think it is the right
way to achieve it. I disagree with the noble Lord in thinking that it
will be simple to implement as I think there will be complications in
implementing it; and, in the light of the amendment which we have
already debated and accepted, I believe that there are other ways of
addressing these issues.</p><p><a name="0610315000080"></a>When we
last debated this matter, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Portsmouth was in his place and he is sorry not to be here today. I
would like to correct a comment that was made earlier. In his letter to
the Secretary of State, the right reverend Prelate said
that,</p><ul><a name="0610315000286"></a>&#147;all new Church
of England schools should have at least 25 per cent of places available
to children with no requirement that they be of practising Christian
families. The places would not be left empty if they were not filled by
such children, so this would technically not be a &#145;quota&#146;
but a &#145;proportion&#146;&#148;.</ul><a name="0610315000241"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Baker, spoke of a
priority, which gave the wrong impression of that
statement.<p><a name="0610315000081"></a>I do not want to
repeat all the comments made from these Benches less than two weeks
ago. We have made a statement and I am delighted that the Archbishop of
Birmingham has clarified that at least 30 per cent of children in Roman
Catholic schools are currently from non-Catholic families. I think that
is an advance.</p><p><a name="0610315000082"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Baker, rightly said that this is about the shape of our society.
In addition, I believe that the heart of the matter is whether we in
this Parliament, those who form public opinion and the people of
Britain have enough confidence in our values and way of life, founded
as it is on Christian beliefs and values&#151;themselves generous and
inclusive&#151;to allow those of different beliefs and ways of life
to flourish within our society on their
terms.</p><p><a name="0610315000083"></a>I believe that we need to
trust the minority faith communities and not impose legal limitations
on them before allowing their schools into the maintained system of
education. So I believe thatthe amendment could foster a lack
of trust, which in the end would be destructive to the very integration
we are seeking to achieve. Therefore I hope that your Lordships will
reject the amendment. Although I understand the reasons why the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, has proposed it, it will not achieve the objective we
seek.</p><p><a name="0610315000084"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew227"></a><a name="0610315000581"></a>Lord
Brennan:</b> My Lords, at Third Reading the House

is to give local authorities the power to impose quotas and to give the
Secretary of State the reserve power to 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_118"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ensure that exclusive schools do not come into existence. In neither
case is there an appeal. These are strong powers to give to local
authorities and to the Secretary of State. Our legislative discipline
requires us to consider in what way that power is expressed. What
circumstances circumscribe its exercise? I invite your Lordships to
note that in subsection (2) the power for local authorities is a power
whereby they may, &#147;if they so desire&#148;, impose a quota.
That is not a clear expression of the extent of irrational exercise of
a power. There is no cross reference anywhere to the circumstances to
be taken into account if it is to be exercised. It is doomed to
failure. It will never survive a judicial review application. It is
that discipline that I am inviting the House to note on this
occasion.</p><p><a name="0610315000085"></a>In addition, there are
no circumstances to be applied to its exercise. Clause 33(6), as the
Minister pointed out, refers to community cohesion, but for foundation
schools. Amendment No. 7 refers to governing authorities and Amendment
No. 19 to the Ofsted inspectorate. Not in Clause 1, Clause 2 or
anywhere else do we find a local authority being required to take into
consideration certain circumstances before deciding what it desires.
That is unacceptable. I was surprised when I read the amendment, and I
may prove to be wrong, as may the librarians, but tonight they inquired
on my behalf.</p><p><a name="0610315000086"></a>In 58 years of
parliamentary experience, only two Acts and nine sets of regulations
have used the phrase, &#147;if they so desire&#148; and then only
to give people a choice to make a representation, to participate or
not; never to lay the foundation for the exercise of national or local
power. If the amendment in this form is the result of inadvertence, so
be it. If it is the alternative, so be it. In either event it is simply
not acceptable. Would any one of your Lordships accept a power by
national or local authorities in any other context simply dictated by
the phrase, &#147;if they so desire&#148;? Of course not. The
amendment fails, I regret to say, despite the wit and style with which
it was introduced, on basic legislative principle. This is not a phrase
that accommodates our democratic
approach.</p><p><a name="0610315000087"></a>Secondly, if you
propose to change decades of educational practice ingrained in our
society, you need clarity. Was it not in the United States, on the only
occasion that I can think of, with quotas in education during the civil
rights era, that the passage of white pupils to black schools and vice
versa led to division and outrage&#151;educational and social
consequences that no one had ever envisaged? Those who propose a system
in which that might be required need to explain to us how it will work
and how those problems will be avoided. The amendment does not do that.
Neither in its content nor in its intent does it meet the democratic
and legislative principles of the
House.</p><h5><a name="0610315000292"></a>9.45

has just been forensically said by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, about
the defects in the amendment, but I should like, if I may, to make a
series of different, short points. First, any Jew, like me, from 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_119"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>my generation would have a natural aversion to quotas when it comes to
access to schools. Those of my generation will remember how most public
schools in London, for example, had very small Jewish quotas. The
school that I went to, the City of London School, was, when I went
there, the only one that had no Jewish quota, so one-third of the
school was Jewish. The idea of quotas is something that I think both
secular and religious Jews dislike, partly for that
reason.</p><p><a name="0610315000089"></a>Secondly, most sensible
people would say that having apartheid or religiously segregated
schools creates social evils&#151;witness Northern Ireland or, I
would say, Birkenhead in Liverpool or Scotland, where there are obvious
examples of the social problems that segregated education
creates.</p><p><a name="0610315000090"></a>Thirdly, it is important
to explain to the House and to the right reverend Prelate that this is
not an area where there is not already robust law in place to catch
state-maintained schools as public authorities if they discriminate on
racial or religious grounds in access to places in those
schools.</p><p><a name="0610315000091"></a>I give just two
examples. One is the Race Relations Act, which would prevent any
school, Jewish, Muslim or otherwise&#151;indeed, even private
schools&#151;from practising direct or indirect racial discrimination
in access. The more telling example, because it is more pervasive, is
the Human Rights Act. I should be interested to know whether the
Minister agrees with what I am about to say or can take advice on
it.</p><p><a name="0610315000092"></a>The European Convention on
Human Rights, in Article 2 of the first protocol, guarantees the right
to education. Article 14 of the convention has to be read with it, and
states that in respect of the enjoymentof the right to
education, there must be no discrimination. &#147;No
discrimination&#148; will include discrimination on religious
grounds.</p><p><a name="0610315000093"></a>I was counsel in a case
on behalf of the Government of Mauritius, whose written constitution is
modelled on the European Convention on Human Rights, which came before
the Privy Council two years ago. An appeal was brought by the Bishop of
Port Louis on behalf of the managers of 12 Catholic secondary schools
in Mauritius. What had happened in that case is instructive. The
Catholic Church in Mauritius maintained a system of private education
that was excellent in the secondary area. In order to persuade the
Churches to bring their schools within the state sector, the Government
made a deal whereby the Catholic schools could maintain a 50 per cent
quota for Catholics; the other 50 per cent being admitted on merit. So
there was a clear 50:50 quota.</p><p><a name="0610315000094"></a>The question that a Hindu father of an 11
year-old girl raised in the case was whether it was unconstitutional
discrimination to refuse to admit his daughter in the 50 per cent
reserved for Catholics in that area. A strong and unanimous judicial
committee with the Privy Council, led by the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Bingham, the senior Law Lord, held that that difference of
treatment was discriminatoryunless it could be objectively
justified, looking atall the circumstances, including the
principle of proportionality.</p>



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_120"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="0610315000242"></a>In my view, that
case, read with the case law on the European Human Rights Convention,
shows the following: either of these categories of schools, these
additional schools, is wholly funded out of public funds. They are
therefore public authorities within the meaning of the Human Rights
Act. They therefore have a duty to comply with the conventional rights
and with the right not to discriminate unfairly and unjustifiably in
allocating pupils to those schools. Therefore, whether it be a Muslim
school, a Jewish school, a Catholic school, or an Anglican
school,any school which discriminates arbitrarily or
ina disproportionate way in their admission arrangements will
be vulnerable immediately to a direct challenge under Sections 6 and 7
of the Human Rights Act for breaching their obligations under the human
rights convention because they are all public
authorities.<p><a name="0610315000095"></a>This would not
apply, of course, to schools that are privately funded, and nor should
it. In the private sector, as the case I have just mentioned indicates,
different considerations arise. But I just wish the House to understand
that we already have a strong and robust Human Rights Act and Race
Relations Act which govern in this field, and for that reason, as well
as the technical points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, I am
not in favour of this amendment. I do not like quotas, anyhow, and it
is unnecessary. But I do think that those who operate schools of this
kind ought to be pretty careful about the way that they make their
admission arrangements. I would just add that under the Race Relations
Act, local authorities are implicated in some areas, and so is the
Secretary of State for Education, if they allow schools to discriminate
indirectly or directly on grounds of
race.</p><p><a name="0610315000096"></a>There is a lot of law in
place. It will trump the legislation that the House is now considering
because the Human Rights Act says that all legislation must be read and
given effect in a way that is compatible with the convention rights,
and the same applies to administrative discretion. I apologise for
talking as the lawyer that I am, but I thought it might be quite useful
if I gave the House some free legal advice on this
area.</p><p><a name="0610315000097"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew229"></a><a name="0610315000583"></a>Lord
Winston:</b> My Lords, I rise regrettably to oppose
the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Baker. I do so remembering that
we have at least one thing in common. Although I did not go to his
primary school, we both shared a secondary &#147;ancient&#148;
education.</p><p><a name="0610315000098"></a>Be that as it may, I
feel that what he is recommending is embarking on a huge social
experiment. It seems to me that before one considered this kind of
legislation, one would need to do some very serious social science
research to see exactly what the consequences could be. It could well
be that rather than causing harmony, disharmony could occur as a result
of this, particularly in areas where these schools are oversubscribed.
In the current case of some Jewish schools, they are grossly
oversubscribed in north-west London. If there were new schools being
made, that would be a massive problem for those people.</p>



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_121"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0610315000099"></a>We have heard a great
deal about the taxpayer paying for a religious education, but often in
the schools that I am aware of, the religious education is paid for
separately. Certainly in most Jewish schools, it does not come within
the state&#146;s remit. Religious education is paid for by the
parents who raise those funds by alternative
methods.</p><p><a name="0610315000100"></a>We have heard other
irrelevant arguments. My noble friend Lady Massey talked about the
situation in Northern Ireland. That is completely irrelevant. The
divisiveness in Northern Ireland has nothing to do primarily with
schooling. It comes from a totally different kind of society with the
social tensions that
has.</p><p><a name="0610315000101"></a>Equally, I have to say to
the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, that it is ridiculous to take France as
an example. Does he seriously consider France to be a more cohesive
society as regards religious discipline? On the contrary, there is
probably more anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic feeling there than there has
been in Britain in recent years. The model in other parts of Europe is
no better.</p><p><a name="0610315000102"></a>Rather than taunt my
noble friend Lord Adonis for a switch of direction, we should
congratulate the Government on their flexibility. It is not just the
Catholic community that has made representations to them; the Jewish
community is wholeheartedly opposed to this kind of amendment because
it fears for the consequences. Much of the Muslim community opposes it.
As has been said, we must trust the Muslim community accordingly. The
worst thing that could happen if we discontinued such state funding
would be to force some religious education into the private sector,
where it might not be so well controlled. That would be a grave error.
We should contemplate that today before we go through the Lobby, if the
noble Lord decides to call a Division.</p><p><a name="0610315000103"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew230"></a><a name="0610315000584"></a>The
Earl of Onslow:</b> My Lords, it is self-evident from
what the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said that the Roman Catholic Church is
acting in a selective and self-protecting way. It is perfectly
understandable. My noble friend Lord Baker and others have created a
real danger of Muslim schools undergoing the same
ghettoisation&#151;I am not sure whether that is the right word but I
am afraid that it is what they want to do. It is not often realised,
for instance, that in the Muslim world there is no conception like ours
in the Christian world
of:</p><ul><a name="0610315000263"></a>&#147;Render therefore
unto Caesar the things which are Caesar&#146;s; and unto God the
things that are
God&#146;s&#148;.</ul><a name="0610315000243"></a>Throughout
Muslim history there has been tension with secular government, because
in theory the prophet did not allow it. Everything had to be governed
under Sharia or religious law. Christianity, luckily for itself, had
the ability to separate the two.
<p><a name="0610315000104"></a>The Church of England has been fundamental
to the development of the ethos of the United Kingdom. As I said to a
bishop earlier, I am not even sure that the Church of England always
believes in God. He quite charmingly proved my point by saying,
&#147;I think we do&#148;. The Church of England&#146;s very
broadminded and, if I may say so, very English approach to religion and
society has made its schools particularly good.</p>

for help to preserve their separate identity. That is why Peel paid for
Maynooth Roman Catholic seminary well before 1902 and Lloyd George. It
was designed by Pugin and paid for by the English taxpayer. The very
real danger that has been shown is that of exclusive schools, and we do
not address it at our peril.</p><p><a name="0610315000106"></a>I
will vote for the amendment of my noble friend Lord Baker, even though
I was deeply influenced by the stunning performance of the noble Lord,
Lord Brennan, and quite understand why he is such a brilliantly paid
barrister. I agree with him legislatively, but I feel so strongly about
the danger of faith schools at the fringe, beyond the Roman Catholic,
Church of England and, probably, Jewish schools, that I must vote for
my noble friend Lord Baker. I do not think that we have yet addressed
this serious problem as much as we should.</p><p><a name="0610315000107"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew231"></a><a name="0610315000585"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, I shall be very
brief. I suspect that the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord
Baker, is unworkable, for the reasons given by, among others, the two
noble and learned Lords who addressed the House.</p><p><a name="0610315000108"></a>The horse may well have bolted because I
am not sure how one could apply the 25 per cent quota to the new
independent trust schools, which will be substantially financed by the
state. I am not clear about it, but I guess that it would be very
difficult to do that, therefore there is always a door open to escape
from the requirements that might be laid upon the schools in the
maintained and public sectors.</p><p><a name="0610315000109"></a>Having said that, I recognise the points
raised by the noble Lord, Lord Baker. There are real issues here about
how we deal with separate faith schools. I will conclude by saying that
I am very sorry that, in this debate, we have not looked at all at the
concept of confederation between schools. We cannot, I believe, make
the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Baker, work; I would not support
it even if I thought that we could. I am troubled that we have had
almost no discussion of the extremely helpful and fertile concept of
confederation between schools, whereby schools retain their own
governing bodies, but share a great many activities, and even some
courses and teaching, so that there is a real mixture of cultures and
faiths within schools. My noble friend Baroness Sharp, with her usual
sagacity, proposed as long ago as the Education Act 2002 that we should
look very carefully at the concept of confederation between schools of
different faiths and non-faith schools. I am sorry that this much more
constructive and, indeed, serious proposal has not been given much time
in this House. I hope it will be given time by the Minister sooner or
later.</p><h5><a name="0610315000293"></a>10

found this debate quite distressing. I never thought that I would sit

was part of the Swann committee, which some noble Lords may know about.
It looked at the education of children from ethnic minority groups. In
our report we took

schools. Now we sit here today, constantly extending faith-based
schools. The next lot might be Rastafarian schools. Why should they not
have schools? Why should anybody not have
schools?</p><p><a name="0610315000111"></a>I was brought up a
Hindu. As such, I do not come from a revealed religious base. We are
taught to respect everybody&#146;s faith, everybody&#146;s belief
and everybody&#146;s way of worshipping God, if they so wish to do.
Abrahamic religions do not do that. Muslims say that they are the true
faith; Catholics say that they are the true faith; Anglicans say that
they are the true faith; and Jews say that they are the true faith.
There are so many true faiths. Do they all have their own separate
gods? If you believe in God, there can be only one. The more we
separate systems of belief, the more divergence we will create in our
society. It is logical and obvious that this will happen.</p><p><a name="0610315000112"></a>No matter: we are at this point; we are
not starting today. We are debating a particular amendment. Whether it
is workable or not, I shall be voting for it, because it at least sets
down a marker towards trying to create some kind of commitment to
bringing children from other faiths into a school. The noble Lord, Lord
Alton, has talked about his mother and father. I am very happy that my
noble friend Lord Waddington mentioned race, because there is a double
whammy here. We have, until now, been dealing mainly with white
faith-based schools. This is the first time for us to look at non-white
faith-based schools. Please do not let us minimise the impact of that
fact. It will not be as easy for a girl educated in a Muslim school to
find someone totally different from somewhere else and get married to
that person. I do not think that it will be that easy. A young white
man recently asked me, &#147;Why are you so fussed about faith-based
schools? I come home, I play with my friends and I have friends from
all over the place&#148;. Will a Muslim child, girl or boy&#151;and
first of all, the girls and boys will not mix together; we know
that&#151;be in the happy position of meeting friends and going to
each other&#146;s houses? I know of many Muslim families who will not
let their children go to anyone&#146;s house if they are not Muslim.
All this will exacerbate these
divisions.</p><p><a name="0610315000113"></a>Let us hope for the
best, but I shall certainly vote for my noble friend Lord
Baker&#146;s amendment, just to make the point. I think we are at a
crucial stage and our young people will live to see the results of all
this and will regret
it.</p><p><a name="0610315000114"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew233"></a><a name="0610315000587"></a>Baroness

have again had a long and interesting debate and many important points

of schools in which children

together, go home on the bus and visit each others&#146; houses. That
is a situation we would like to see. However, we do not like the
amendment for three reasons. The first is that we do not like quotas,
and the main reason we do not like them is that they persuade some
people to pretend to be things that they are not and others to pretend
not to be things that they are. That always happens with
quotas.</p><p><a name="0610315000116"></a>The second reason is one
which the noble Lord, Lord Baker, himself convinced me of; that is,
that the amendment will not achieve much because it will apply only to
a very few schools. We live in a period of falling rolls and not many
schools will be affected by his quotas. The third reason is that we do
not think it is workable. In order to investigate whether it would be
workable, I looked at evidence from existing faith schools that already
open their doors to children of other faiths or none. I discovered that
Al Hijraj School, a voluntary-aided Muslim secondary school in
Birmingham which already accepts non-Muslim pupils, has said that only
one or two inquiries had been received from non-Muslim families since
the school became state funded four years ago. Gatton Primary School in
Wandsworth, south London, which is another state-funded Muslim school,
has had very few applications from non-Muslim children. The Guru Nanak
School in Hillingdon, the country&#146;s only state-funded Sikh
comprehensive, said that it gets about six applications a year from
non-Sikhs. Two faith-based primary schools are about to open in Slough,
one is Sikh and one Muslim. Both have already decided on their own
quotas, one of 20 per cent and the other 25 per cent, of places to be
offered to those not of their faith. Both of the head teachers have
said that they do not really think they will be able to fill those
quotas. If they do not fill them, well, the places cannot be left
empty. According to the law, they have to be
filled.</p><p><a name="0610315000117"></a>The objective of the
noble Lord&#146;s amendment, which I applaud, will not be achieved.
Members on these Benches are not in the business of putting on to the
statute book legislation which is
unworkable.</p><p><a name="0610315000118"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew234"></a><a name="0610315000588"></a>Noble

taking such an interest in this debate. I am only sorry that he does
not see the amendment proposed by myself and the noble Lords, Lord
Alton, Lord Sutherland, Lord Ahmed and Lord Adonis, as a direct
alternative to his amendment. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would
drive a coach and horses through the principles of schools&#146;
freedoms and of parental choice, which we have supported so strongly
throughout this Bill. The real effects of a quota would be to prevent
the establishment of faith schools where not enough children of other
faiths applied or, conversely, to force the attendance at those schools
of children who had deliberately not applied. That is, perhaps
unintentionally, social engineering at its very worst. A quota could
prevent parents from educating children according to their religion or
from educating their children outside religion, a right enshrined in
Article 2 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human
Rights and a right respected and enforced since the Education Act of
1944.</p><p><a name="0610315000123"></a>We wholeheartedly support
inclusion, the inclusion of faith schools in the state system, and we
hope that more will join the maintained sector, as independent state
schools that follow the national curriculum and inspection regime like
other schools. I wish that my noble friend Lord Baker of Dorking could
reconsider his amendment in the light of the earlier debate and that he
could accept that greater practice of community cohesion in schools of
all types is a far better way forward than pursuing a top-down quota
solution with no consultation. The hour is very late. It has been an
amazing and interesting debate, but I would say this&#151;I hope that
all the noble Lords who have spoken will do the House the courtesy of
remaining to hear the debates on the rest of the amendments
tonight.</p><p><a name="0610315000124"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew239"></a><a name="0610315000593"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, on Report I undertook that the
Government would consult on this issue before Third Reading. Having
done so, the Government have concluded that the best and most effective
way of promoting community cohesion is to lay a new duty to promote
community cohesion on the governing bodies of all maintained schools in
England&#151;all Christian faith schools, all Muslim faith schools,
all Sikh schools, Jewish schools and Hindu schools, and not just faith
schools or new faith schools, but all schools. These issues of cohesion
and the promotion of relationships between different parts of the
community affect all schools, whether in Oldham or Orpington, Bradford
or Birmingham. The Government have also agreed with Ofsted that there
should be an effective inspection regime to back up this new duty to
promote community cohesion. The House has now agreed the amendments to
give effect to these new duties on schools and on Ofsted. We have
debated them at length and I do not want to repeat what was
said.</p><p><a name="0610315000125"></a>However, on the issue of
admissions raised in this amendment, absolutist positions have been
stated. On one side there are those who believe that it is
fundamentally wrong for faith schools to have admissions policies that
make it possible for others to join such schools at all. That view has
been put to me 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_126"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the past week by some senior religious leaders. On the other side
there are those who want to require all schools to recruit beyond their
faith as a matter of principle. The Government have consistently
rejected both absolutist positions and, indeed, so have most of the
faith leaders that we have consulted in the past
week.</p><p><a name="0610315000126"></a>As a matter of fact, at
least some faith schools of all faiths and of all denominations offer
places beyond their immediate faith communities, not least Catholic
schools, a third of whose pupils nation-wide comes from beyond the
Catholic community. I should add that Catholic education takes pride in
that fact, as part of its wider service to the nation, particularly in
disadvantaged areas. The Government have made it clear that we welcome
such outreach and have therefore welcomed the voluntary statement of
the Catholic Church that, in planning any new schools, it will take
account of community demand beyond the immediate Catholic community in
agreeing the size and admissions policies of its schools. Other faith
communities are taking a similar approach. But, after the consultation
that we have undertaken, we accept that this should come about with the
agreement, case by case, of the faith community in question. We accept
too that there may be valid reasons why such admissions arrangements
are not appropriate&#151;either to do with local exigencies or to do
with principle in particular cases&#151;although I should stress that
it is the existing law that no faith school may leave places empty
where it is undersubscribed and where others beyond the faith community
wish to attend the school.</p><p><a name="0610315000127"></a>We
have therefore decided that it is not appropriate to introduce new
statutory regulation in this area. We intend to make it clear in the
new school admissions code that while it may be good practice for a new
faith school to open up places to non-faith applicants this must be a
voluntary decision, and that any such modification of a proposal for a
new faith school within the maintained system must not be imposed on
the promoters either by the local authority or by the schools
adjudicator. The Government, therefore, oppose the
amendment.</p><p><a name="0610315000128"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew240"></a><a name="0610315000594"></a>Lord

the noble Lord set out earlier before I can comment in
full.</p><p><a name="0610315000130"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew242"></a><a name="0610315000596"></a>Lord
Baker of Dorking:</b> My Lords, I thank all noble
Lords who have contributed to the debate. I am particularly interested
in the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, because, to the extent
that I understood him, if he is correct in his interpretation of the
Human Rights Act, all new faith schools will be illegal and, indeed,
there will be considerable doubt about existing faith schools. Whether
or not that is good news or stands up legally, I do not know, 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_127"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but it certainly adds a whole new light to the issue. The Minister said
that he will look at the situation. I would very much like him to let
us know what the position is. It is a fundamental change much more
radical than anything I am
suggesting.</p><p><a name="0610315000131"></a>There have been two
threads of comment, hostility or opposition to what I have said. First,
it was said that this is unworkable; that quotas will not work. I am
not a quota man. I always think Liberal education policy is something
of an enigma enveloped in a fog, but the noble Baroness who speaks for
the Liberal Democrats said that it is unworkable. She should come with
me to Northern Ireland in a fortnight&#146;s time; I am going with
the noble Lord, Lord Dubs.We are going to see 53 schools that
work on a quota&#151;40 per cent Catholic, 40 per cent Protestant and
20 per cent other. How do you think Northern Ireland has managed to get
it right? Northern Ireland gets so much wrong, but how do you think it
managed to get that right when it is unworkable. Of course it is
workable if there is a will to make it
work.</p><p><a name="0610315000132"></a>I know the system that I am
proposing is not perfect. I enjoyed the speech of the noble Lord, Lord
Brennan. I looked upon him as an ally. On Friday morning of last week,
after the Government withdrew their amendments, I had to draw up these
amendments but I did not have his advice. I wish I had because I would
have made them better and workable. The Government have that
opportunity and have perfect amendments drafted by the Bill team. I
spoke to the Bill team but, unfortunately, it did not send the
amendments to me. I would have tabled those if it had. I am quite sure
that if I had tabled those amendments, all the problems that the noble
Lord, Lord Brennan, mentioned would have been resolved. It is not a
question of wording but a question of intent. Does the noble Lord want
to see integrated education in our country or not? The noble Lord did
not express his views on that so I do not know what they are, but I
want to see integrated education in our
country.</p><p><a name="0610315000133"></a>The second point was
that the previous amendment does all the work. We debated it earlier
and I supported it, but it is carrying too large a weight. You cannot
expect the inspectors in our schools to by themselves create community
cohesion: it is asking too much of them. The Government have got to do
something. I think that the voluntary undertakings they have got will
not really work.</p><p><a name="0610315000134"></a>I thank the
noble Lord, Lord Waddington, a very old friend, who is not going to
support me tonight. But he is not going to vote with the
Government&#151;we ex-Home Secretaries must stick together. But if
either of us held that post today, there would be thudding on our desk
every week reports about a lack of social cohesion in our inner cities.
The reports would say all the time that you must not allow societies to
develop that are parallel and separate. That is what distinctive faith
schools will do; it is an inevitable result. All the advice goes that
way from the Cantle report in
2001.</p><p><a name="0610315000135"></a>I think it is very
disappointing that only one Member from an Asian community has spoken
in the debate today. I have been told by the noble Lord, 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_128"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Dearing, that we must not push Muslims into the corner. But there
are Muslim Members of this House and this is a debate about the Muslim
faith in our country today. If they want to share their views and
communicate, they have some responsibility to try to do so. We cannot
debate this matter by
ourselves.</p><p><a name="0610315000136"></a>Finally,
I say to the right reverend Prelates&#151;the bishops of my dear old
Anglican Church&#151;that when I was Education Secretary and I had to
deal with the bishops of the Church of England and the bishops of the
Church of Rome, I discovered why bishops move diagonally. I am quite
sure that if these amendments had been tabled by the Government as they
intended to do a week ago&#151;beautifully drafted by the noble Lord,
Lord Brennan, and perfect in their execution but saying exactly what my
amendments do&#151;those on the Bishops&#146; Bench would be voting
for them.</p><p><a name="0610315000137"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew243"></a><a name="0610315000597"></a>The

will never know. But the Anglican Church has the right
solution&#151;it believes in integrated education, it has stumbled
upon the truth and it has picked itself up as if nothing has happened.
If it really believed in that truth it could say that other faiths
ought to follow. I sometimes believe that if some of those currently
sitting on the Bishops&#146; Bench had been living in the 17th
century they might just have missed out on the Reformation.</p><p><a name="0610315000139"></a>This is an interesting and important
debate. It is not just about what is being taught in faith schools
around the country&#151;it is the shape of our society in our inner
cities for the next 20 years. My position and that of the noble Lord,
Lord Sutherland, are very clear but his amendment is not strongly
enough behind integration&#151;I am after children working, playing
and studying together. Imperfect as it may be, it is workable and it is
a correct and desirable aim. I wish to test the opinion of the

words.</p><p><a name="0610315000146"></a>Amendment No.
13, with the subsequent conditions and consequences in Amendments Nos.
21 and 22, is very simple, with a crucial aim of giving more of our
children opportunities for music education in schools. To achieve this,
the amendment will simply remove some anomalies in present legislation
which hamper progress in that direction. I have listened to a lot of
the debate on other matters, with particular interest in subject
matters like languages and science, so I am pleased that, late in the
day, the arts join the club of contents
discussed.</p><p><a name="0610315000147"></a>Your Lordships do not
need reminding of the special importance of the arts, not least for
children. Some of your Lordships may be old enough, as I am, to
remember Jennie Lee, the first Wilson Government Arts Minister. She put
all this so well when she
said:</p><ul><a name="0610315000269"></a>&#147;If children at an
early age become accustomed to the arts as part of everyday life, they
are more likely in maturity first to accept the arts and then to demand
them&#148;.</ul><a name="0610315000244"></a>That is what I
am talking about.<p><a name="0610315000148"></a>My own luck
was that, in my early days in Berlin, music was totally central both at
home and at school. When I came to school in England, within two days I
was in the school choir singing in &#147;Dido and Aeneas&#148;.
Since then, I can honestly say that no day in my life has been without
the enrichment of music, whether listening, playing or learning and/or
working in music organisations and on projects which might widen
musical experience for the young. Such a one&#151;and I declare an
interest as chairman of the project&#151;is the Paul Hamlyn
Foundation&#146;s Musical Futures. The project focuses on secondary
education and on innovating approaches to the teaching and learning of
all kinds of music. I believe it will have an exciting and imaginative
influence on engaging more 11 to 19 year-olds in music
activities.</p><p><a name="0610315000150"></a>The music
manifesto<I></I>document, which has just been published&#151;hence
this amendment&#151;shows a wide range of activities up and down the
country, demonstrating how much is going on in music education. The
champion of the music manifesto is Marc Jaffrey. He pays tribute to all
the progress in the country&#146;s music activities, but he also does
not shirk, nor does the department, the major challenges that remain
or, above all, the fact that many children do not have the access they
deserve to pursue their music, 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_131"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether on instruments or in singing. That is where this amendment can
help positively. Current legislation is actually in the way.</p><p><a name="0610315000151"></a>I must make clear that I am not talking
about music in the national curriculum, which covers children from five
to 14&#151;at which point, sad to relate, all but 7 per cent of
children drop music altogether. The amendment refers to the many
children who, early on, notably in primary school, develop enthusiasm
for any kind of music and want to go on with tuition with a specialist
teacher provided through the music services. That has to be paid for so
that the providers, the specialist teachers, can be properly
financed.</p><p><a name="0610315000152"></a>That is where present
legislation gets in the way. Amazingly enough, instrumental tuition in
groups of over four pupils, or for any vocal tuition, cannot be charged
for. That is a strict anomaly. As regards instruments, it often makes
more sense to teach in larger groups than four. As for singing, it is
necessary to teach in whatever groups make most sense for the children
and for the music. The amendment would remove that confusing
anomaly.</p><p><a name="0610315000153"></a>I should make it clear
that charges would apply only where pupils themselves, after an initial
introduction to music making or singing, choose to take their learning
further, beyond the statutory provision. If their family or school is
prepared to pay, all is well. The regulations will stipulate that, as
now, remission policies will be in place to help pupils from
lower-income families with these charges.</p><p><a name="0610315000154"></a>To summarise: this amendment would achieve
freedom to charge for teaching in large instrumental groups, not just
up to four, and for any vocal tuition. This would actually widen
access, because the cost per pupil would go down significantly.
Moreover, the other important consequence is that it would help to deal
with the shortfall in specialist music teaching, which is a real threat
to progress.</p><p><a name="0610315000155"></a>To put that in a
single sentence: this amendment would get rid of present anomalies and
ensure that music tuition for those who wanted to go on beyond the
statutory condition would be made available and charged for, whatever
the size of the group, for vocal as well as for instrumental lessons. I
know that many of your Lordships share my passion for the importance of
music, and for making it as widely available as possible. I hope this
amendment will commend itself to your Lordships, and to the Government.
I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0610315000156"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew246"></a><a name="0610315000600"></a>Lord

have not been able to discover why the Education Act 1996 restricted to
groups of not more than four those who could receive instrumental
tuition subject to charges and why vocal tuition was completely
excluded. The amendment would allow the department to make regulations
that removed those restrictions, subject to any necessary safeguards.

children to enjoy the opportunity of individual instrumental or vocal
tuition from individual teachers if they had the aptitude and ambition
to do so. The more children that there were in a group, the less would
be the charge for each of them. The remission scheme would help
too.</p><p><a name="0610315000158"></a>It would be splendid if
schools were able to provide that tuition without charges, but I
recognise that the time for that is not yet. I hope that the House will
welcome the amendment, which will enable more children to elect to have
special tuition from individual and well qualified
teachers.</p><p><a name="0610315000159"></a>To my great regret, I
have never learnt to play an instrument, other than the piano&#151;I
cannot match my noble friend Lord Moser in that&#151;but I have never
ceased to sing and have received intense pleasure from doing so. So I
particularly welcome the fact that the amendment will enable pupils who
seek vocal tuition to enjoy the same opportunities as those who seek
instrumental tuition.</p><p><a name="0610315000160"></a>The great
composer William Byrd, who wrote such marvellous music for voices,
said:</p><ul><a name="0610315000270"></a>&#147;Since singing is
so good a thing, I wish all men would learn to
sing&#148;.</ul><a name="0610315000245"></a>He would have
welcomed the amendment, as I hope your Lordships will. Its passing
would bring his wish nearer to
fulfilment.<p><a name="0610315000161"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew247"></a><a name="0610315000601"></a>Lord
Harrison:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment moved
by the noble Lord, Lord Moser, for three reasons. I discovered this
evening that he and I share a love of Henry Purcell&#146;s
&#147;Dido and Aeneas&#148;, which was influential in my musical
instruction. Whatever the form of music, we know that it offers a
different route for many young people to acquire education, culture and
an inquiring mind much beyond other parts of the curriculum. I would
support the amendment for that reason
alone.</p><p><a name="0610315000162"></a>I also support it because,
as the noble Lords, Lord Moser and Lord Armstrong, have identified,
there is the anomaly that singing was excluded from the Act passed 20
or 30 years ago and that instruction to more than four pupils is
likewise forbidden under the current system. Goodness knows what Dave
Brubeck&#146;s &#147;Take Five&#148; would have done in terms of
musical innovation if that principle had been a precedent by which the
law and the issue of support for music was
established.</p><p><a name="0610315000163"></a>My third reason for
supporting the amendment is that, although I was anxious, as others in
the House may be, that we might undermine the principleof
providing free musical education for our schoolchildren, I am convinced
that, if we accept the amendment, that would not be the case, because
it refers to specialist education and removes the current anomaly borne
of 30 year-old legislation. I am convinced also by those who are
interested, particularly as regards the Music Manifesto, that the
amendment would broaden the opportunity for young people to have
musical experience in schools and, I hope, move on to other educational
experiences, because they would be able to enjoy, understand and reach
out to their fellow human beings through the instrument of
music.</p>

Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, I strongly support
the amendment and will add only one other argument to the many that
have been deployed. I regard the narrowing down of the opportunity for
musical education as a real disaster. Music is an essential part of
education.</p><p><a name="0610315000165"></a>My additional point
is that music is an astonishing instrument of cohesion. We have been
talking a great deal about social and community cohesion. Whether it is
the steel band in areas with large Caribbean populations or the brass
band in many cities in the north of England, music has found its way
into all kinds of societies and, in doing so, has enriched
people&#146;s relationships and their capacity to communicate with
others.</p><p><a name="0610315000166"></a>I am speaking not only
about fine classical music, although that is terribly important, but
about the more indigenous forms of culture, which can provide society
with extreme riches. I advocate the amendment and hope that one day we
can get back to the peripatetic music teacher and free music tuition,
because music is one of the great instruments in bringing cultures,
peoples and races together.</p><h5><a name="0610315000296"></a>10.45
pm</h5><p><a name="0610315000167"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew249"></a><a name="0610315000603"></a>Baroness
Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, we, too, support
the amendments. As the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, said, the 1996 Act
is slightly counter-intuitive, particularly in relation to singing, in
that it restricts charging for groups of more than four students. That
is somewhat odd, and I do not understand the logic behind it.</p><p><a name="0610315000168"></a>We have three slight provisos, which
perhaps the Minister will address. First, the noble Lord, Lord Moser,
stated that there would be provision for those who were not able to
afford the tuition. There will be talented youngsters whose parents
will find it difficult to pay for extra tuition. Although the larger
the group, the smaller the charge for each individual, nevertheless,
those charges can be sufficiently large. If you have two or three
children, even a charge of &#163;3 or &#163;4 amounts to quite a
lot, and many families would find it difficult to pay such sums.
Perhaps the Minister can tell us what provisions will be in force in
that regard.</p><p><a name="0610315000169"></a>Secondly, we accept
that the amendment relates to what one might call intermediate tuition
for those who show some talent and need to go a bit further. If they
are really talented, they need to progress further, and, with some
instruments, there is a limit to the value of group tuition. The piano
is one such example. Can the Minister also tell us a little about
provision for individual tuition for the really talented students who
might progress through the
scheme?</p><p><a name="0610315000170"></a>Lastly, as well as access
to tuition, it is important to have access to instruments. Parents
sometimes have difficulty affording the hire of instruments. Therefore,
can the Minister also tell us what provision will be made to help the
children of such parents get access to
instruments?</p><p><a name="0610315000171"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew250"></a><a name="0610315000604"></a>Lord

Buscombe:</b> My Lords, I have pleasure in supporting
the amendment and have added my name to those of the noble Lords, Lord
Moser, Lord Armstrong and Lord Harrison. Music is for making together.
I remember that many years ago I enjoyed singing in school in wonderful
things called &#147;Singing Together&#148; sessions. I also enjoyed
recorder and clarinet lessons. Many people have very good memories of
the pleasure gained from learning to play instruments and from singing
together in schools, as extracurricular opportunities provided in those
days.</p><p><a name="0610315000173"></a>The amendment would afford
pupils wider access in learning instruments and singing. I say to the
noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, that I happen to know that
there are cupboards in schools all over the country full of musical
instruments that are not being played at the moment. There would be
plenty of opportunities for pupils to use those instruments if only
teachers could be provided for on the basis set out by the amendment.
As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Moser, the cost per pupil would
diminish. </p><p><a name="0610315000174"></a>It is also important
to remember that the amendment deals with the shortfall in specialist
music teaching. There are some amazing people out there who are
passionate about this subject, but they have to live. We have to
support them, and we have to support the opportunities that exist for
our children, who have been short-changed by this crazy anomaly. The
amendment is to be welcomed, and I thoroughly support
it.</p><p><a name="0610315000175"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew252"></a><a name="0610315000606"></a>Lord
Renfrew of Kaimsthorn:</b> My Lords, while I had the
privilege of being the master of a Cambridge college, one of the
greatest pleasures in any year was the freshers&#146; concert, which
would take place during the first couple of weeks in October. New
students at Cambridge, who had come from their schools&#151;be they
state schools or whatever&#151;often amazed me and my colleagues with
their skill and dedication. They were not students of music, but they
played music with amazing effectiveness. There is a remarkable vitality
in the musical life of this country, as manifested in those young
people, and it must be encouraged in every way. I know that constraints
exist, as we have heard, so I warmly support the amendment. It is very
important for the musical life of the country, and I hope that it will
be well
received.</p><p><a name="0610315000176"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew253"></a><a name="0610315000607"></a>Lord

amendments for all the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Moser, and
others set out, and we are glad that such a broad consensus of support
for them has been expressed this
evening.</p><p><a name="0610315000177"></a>The current legislation,
contained in the Education Act 1996, allows charges to be made for
instrumental tuition during the school day only for groups of up to
four children. No charges can be made for any vocal tuition during the
school day. We regard those as unjustified restrictions that are
holding back music education in our schools. It is the
Government&#146;s aim that, in time, all primary school children
should, if they choose to, have the opportunity to learn a musical
instrument. We also believe in the importance 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_135"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of singing, including the teaching of singing by
specialist teachers in small groups or one-to-one. The Government have
substantially increased resources for music education in schools in
recent years, particularly in primary schools, including a
new&#163;2 million national scheme to provide musical
instruments to music education services&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady
Sharp, asked me about that.</p><p><a name="0610315000178"></a>We
have been told time and again, most recently in the Music Manifesto
report, that one of the barriers to making the instrumental tuition
pledge a reality and to increasing the opportunities for every child to
sing is the current charging legislation. Restricting instrumental
group sizes to four means that, with the specialist teaching staff who
are available or who are likely to be available in the foreseeable
future, there is simply not enough capacity to provide specialist
tuition for all the children who might want to learn. Also, with groups
restricted to just four, the price per head for lessons is sometimes
prohibitive for parents with limited means. The demand for specialist
singing has increased, but those who want to provide that tuition are
hampered by the fact that lessons during school hours cannot be charged
for, as they can for musical instruments.</p><p><a name="0610315000179"></a>The regulation-making power proposed by
the noble Lord, Lord Moser, would allow us to consult thoroughly on the
best solutions for instrumental and vocal tuition. It is vital that no
child who is currently receiving specialist tuition is disadvantaged by
the introduction of new charging structures. In our consultation on the
regulations, we will propose also that schools and music services be
required to retain or establish remission policies so that
disadvantaged families will be able to access instrumental or vocal
tuition. That meets the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. We
will also ensure that there is no question of charges being made for
tuition that is part of music teaching in the national
curriculum.</p><p><a name="0610315000180"></a>On that basis, I
commend the amendments to the House. I am glad to accept them on behalf

noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am pleased to have an opportunity to
return once again to this debate. I was interested to hear the words of
the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on this topic on
Report and I reserved my right to take those new perspectives into
account in order to return with a solution at Third Reading.</p><p><a name="0610315000185"></a>Allegations of abuse are matters that
deserve sensitive treatment. Children's well-being is the most precious
thing to any parent and that is why I am so thankful that we have a
workforce of teachers and school staff who seek to improve not only
their well-being but also their chances in life. That is why I persist
in this matter. Teachers and school staff give their lives to educating
our children and it is our duty to ensure that they get a fair deal. It
is not a fair deal when, out of 2,210 accusations of physical or sexual
abuse in the past 15 years, fewer than 40 per cent&#151;88&#151;led
to convictions, or when most of the10 per cent who face
charges result in acquittals. It is also not a fair deal when, in one
year, 100 members of NASUWT were exposed to accusations only for it to
be confirmed that, after all, there was no case to
answer.</p><p><a name="0610315000186"></a>Anonymity appears in a
wide variety of legislation. Its most well known uses are for anonymity
for victims of rape and for children under the age of 18 involved in
investigations. Yet it also appears in various guises in the Merchant
Shipping (Liner Conferences) Act 1982 and in giving anonymity to
alleged terrorists under control orders in the Prevention of Terrorism
Act last year. It is amazing that, under Section 6 of that Act,
suspected terrorists who are subject to control orders have a right to
anonymity but teachers do not. The use of anonymity for alleged
terrorists is clear evidence that anonymity is necessary in certain
cases. The Government were so aware of the detrimental effects on trial
of overexposure in the media that suspected terrorists are given
identity protection. I think most of us would agree that child abuse
and terrorism are two of the greatest evils in our society and being
accused of one would be as damaging as being accused of the other.
While the Minister expresses his concerns that anonymity has no place
in legislation, I direct him to the strong precedent in the statute
books.</p><p><a name="0610315000187"></a>On this issue, as on
others that we have debated tonight, as far as possible we have sought
to achieve consensus. This new amendment takes into account 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_137"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the concerns of noble Lords on all Benches and the concerns of unions
and charities, including the NSPCC, the NUT and the NASUWT. The
amendment applies only to allegations of criminal offences. That would
protect teachers and school staff who have to wait the longest for a
charge to be brought or dropped. The Minister acknowledged that three
months would be the minimum wait for accusations of criminal offences,
even under the new guidelines. The amendment answers the concerns of
the NUT by defining anonymity. There are two characteristics: it lasts
only until a charge has been brought and it relates only to reporting
restrictions. In our view the preservation of a possibly innocent
reputation is more important than the provision of sensationalist copy
to the local press. Given a choice between so-called press freedom and
the protection of an innocent person&#146;s livelihood, I know which
one I would choose.</p><p><a name="0610315000188"></a>A further
significant change in the amendment is the process for exemptions from
anonymity. After legal consultation, it has been possible to alter the
amendment. Under the provisions of the amendment, to achieve an
exemption, a chief constable could apply to a magistrates' court to
waive anonymity where it would be expedient to the carrying out of a
criminal investigation or in the interests of security. That would be
done in much the same way as an application for a search warrant. That
takes the exemption procedure out of the hands of the Secretary of
State and reroutes it through a tried and tested system. Just as a
search warrant allows the investigation of premises, so a warrant to
waive anonymity allows the public investigation of a person's
identity.</p><p><a name="0610315000189"></a>I understand the
concerns of noble Lords that providing anonymity for teachers and
school staff could establish a two-tier system, yet I resist that
objection on three counts. First, the point that protection from media
exposure which could wreck careers and lives would not extend to one
group of people does not constitute a principled objection that it
should be provided to another group. Secondly, while we would be very
interested to consider providing anonymity for carers and others who
face malicious and vexatious accusations, such an amendment would be
outside the scope of the Bill. Our business here this evening is
education and ensuring the quality of life within the education system
as a teacher or member of school staff. Perhaps a future social care
Bill will provide an opportunity for provision for social
workers.</p><p><a name="0610315000190"></a>Thirdly, accusation is
an easy route to manipulation. Let us not forget that false allegations
are made not just by children but by other adults. Indeed, I know of a
personal case in that situation; it was horrendous. We must not forget
also that often these cases arise due to misunderstood circumstances
where the comment of a pupil has aroused the suspicion of an adult and
to be on the safe side an allegation is made. It is right that children
retain anonymity. That is something I would defend to the last.
However, we believe that the amendment 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_138"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provides a necessary safeguard that could
provide100 per cent protection from trial by media if the
unproved guidance does not work.</p><h5><a name="0610315000297"></a>11
pm</h5><p><a name="0610315000191"></a>These cases are so sensitive.
They stand to affect the life of a child and that child&#146;s
family, but also the lives of schools, staff and their families in
turn. I do not for one minute suggest that we should not listen to
accusations and treat every single one with 100 per cent seriousness,
but I suggest that there is another side to the story, that instead of
the dramatic sensationalist coverage and exposure of allegations of
abuse, those cases should be treated with care, sincerity and privacy.
We are pleased that there is guidance there and like the Government
hope for the success of the guidance in reducing vexatious or malicious
allegations. However&#151;and this is important&#151;our amendment
does not force the Government to take action now. It is an enabling
power that would give the Government the opportunity to give teachers
the right to anonymity should the guidance prove insufficient. We see
it as a safeguard. I think that that is a sensible amendment and I hope
that noble Lords will support it. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0610315000192"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew256"></a><a name="0610315000610"></a>Baroness

the creation of a group called FACT&#151;Falsely Accused Carers and
Teachers&#151; not long after the major investigations that took
place, first, in north Wales over children&#146;s authorities and
allegations of abuse of children in those authorities and secondly, in
the major Merseyside study of schools and of children&#146;s homes
shortly afterwards. Those were extensive inquiries and many dozens of
people were involved in allegations that were made about them in one
way or another. Undoubtedly some of those allegations held
up.</p><p><a name="0610315000193"></a>The fact that the police
chose a method effectively seeking to obtain evidence from people who
attended those care homes or those schools&#151;which was known in
the trade as cruising for crime&#151;led to a number of people coming
forward from those institutions in order to make allegations, not
discouraged by the fact that it was widely known that there was a
possibility of substantial compensation being paid to someone who had
suffered from abuse. In other words, there was a true motivation for
some fairly unsavoury characters coming forward to make such
allegations. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, that we
are talking not only about the wrecking of the lives of certain
teachers who turn out to be completely innocent but also the shadow
that is cast by the very fact that they are named even though they may
be later found to be innocent, shadows that to my certain
knowledge&#151;I can give a number of cases about which I happen to
know first hand from the association&#151;led to people being unable
to find appointments and stay in their positions, even though it turned
out that there were absolutely no grounds for the allegations made
against them.</p><p><a name="0610315000194"></a>I have not

where we need to protect the good names of teachers until a decision is
made about whether criminal proceedings should be brought. I am being
as brief as I can because of the hour. I would like to say that this is
an extremely serious matter. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, has

other members of the school. So I hope that the Minister will be able
to accept the concept. If he is right and the guidance is satisfactory,
there will be no need for any further action, but the provision could
be there in the background as a

tribute to her for the tenacious way in which she has addressed the

she has addressed some of the concerns that I have expressed.</p><p><a name="0610315000199"></a>We owe the noble Baroness a great debt of
gratitude because the way in which she has raised this issue to the
public eye has put a great deal of pressure on the media&#151;those
who have any tendency to be irresponsible. We all agree that none of us
wants the child&#146;s rights to be counterbalanced with the right of
an innocent person not to be vilified in the media. It is the
responsibility of any of us, if we see the media being irresponsible in

Adonis:</b> My Lords, I appreciate the concerns that
have given rise to the amendment. There have been discussions on the
issue all the way through the progress of the Bill, both in another
place and in your Lordships' House, including a meeting that my
honourable friend Jim Knight held with the noble Baronesses, Lady
Buscombe and Lady Walmsley, along with Members of another place and
representatives from the NSPCC and the NASUWT, to discuss the issue
further.</p><p><a name="0610315000204"></a>As
I say, we appreciate the concerns to protect teachers and other members
of school staff from the damaging effects of allegations and the work
that the noble Baroness has done to develop and refine this amendment
during the course of the Bill. But we must also keep in mind the vital
importance of safeguarding children from abuse wherever they are, and
ensuring that children are encouraged to speak out about abuse they
have suffered. We want all children to be confident in the knowledge
that their concerns will be taken seriously and responded to. It is
getting the balance right which is uppermost on our minds in this very
delicate area.</p><p><a name="0610315000205"></a>As the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, we have taken significant steps to meet
concerns in this area. We issued new guidance on allegations in
educational settings only last November. The guidance was issued under
Section 175 of the Education Act 2002, which means that schools have to
have regard to it when making arrangements to safeguard and to promote
the welfare of children. The guidance states that every effort should
be made to maintain confidentiality and guard against unwanted
publicity while an allegation is being investigated, unless and until a
person is charged with an offence. It also makes clear that in
exceptional circumstances, the police may need to disclose the identity
of a person under
investigation.</p><p><a name="0610315000206"></a>We also issued
further overarching guidance on allegations against anyone working with
children in any setting in the revised version of <I>Working Together 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_141"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to Safeguard Children</I>. This was issued only this April in England
and came into force only at the start of this month. As I explained on
Report, that guidance aims to ensure that allegations are dealt with
consistently, and that issues are resolved as quickly as possible
because time is the big problem in this area and it gives rise to so
much of the concern on the part of the teachers&#146; associations.
The Working Together guidance that I have just referred to, and has
only just come into force, provides target timescales for each step in
the process and sets an overall expectation that 80 per cent of cases
should be resolved within one month, 90 per cent within three months,
and all but the most exceptional cases should be completed within 12
months. The proposed regulations would not, we believe, help to speed
up the handling of
cases.</p><p><a name="0610315000207"></a>Furthermore, in April we
also put in place a network of allegation management advisers based in
government offices. They are working with the new local safeguarding
children boards and their members to ensure that effective arrangements
are in place for dealing with allegations of abuse against people who
work with children, implementing the new guidance on allegations
against teachers and the guidance I just mentioned, <I>Working Together
to Safeguard Children.</I></p><p><a name="0610315000208"></a>Part
of the allegation management advisers&#146; work is to help
organisations avoid allegations arising in the first place through safe
recruitment processes and through advice on staff behaviour when
working with children. The allegation management advisers are also
helping local safeguarding children boards and organisations to develop

allegations.</p><p><a name="0610315000209"></a>All these measures I
have set out have recently been put in place. We believe that they will
help to achieve the right balance between protecting teachers and
others from the damaging effect of false or unfounded allegations
while, on the other hand, safeguarding children. Our strong preference
is not to legislate on this matter but to focus our energies on making
sure that these new arrangements are working
well.</p><p><a name="0610315000210"></a>In response to the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, I can tell the House that we have undertaken
to review the impact of the guidance for the education sector in 2007
with the involvement of all stakeholders, and to reconsider in the
light of that review what further measures may be necessary, which may
include further measures in respect of protecting the anonymity of
teachers. But although we have worked through the many options in this
area, I do not have an option I can bring to the House and I do not
believe it would be appropriate for me to recommend the House to
legislate for a general enabling power when the Government cannot tell
the House how they would propose to implement it.</p><p><a name="0610315000211"></a>We have, however, undertaken to consult
further next year and my officials will be discussing the timetable for
this further work with the teachers&#146; associations, including the
NASUWT which has raised the most consistent concerns in this area. The
NASUWT has said today that it supports our approach, that it wishes to
continue to be involved in

response incredibly depressing. As I have said twice this evening, this
enabling power would give the Government the opportunity to give
teachers the right to anonymity should the guidance prove insufficient.
It is merely a safeguard, but it would be there for teachers if only
the Minister would accept it tonight. I find it incredible that it is
deemed okay for terrorists to have anonymity but not for teachers. The
Minister said that we would have to wait for the results of the
consultation next year, but he consulted on faith schools in one
week.</p><p><a name="0610315000214"></a>I accept that the noble
Lord is working towards having allegations dealt with as quickly as
possible, but it takes no time at all to ruin a person&#146;s life

newspapers take any notice of the guidance? Of course they
won&#146;t.</p><p><a name="0610315000215"></a>The Minister said
that the police may need to waive the right to anonymity. We have
worked hard at this amendment to allow for that possibility, so that in
certain circumstances the police can waive the right to anonymity. I
feel extremely strongly about this. It is right that we should stand up
for teachers; they matter an awful lot more than the terrorists in this
country. I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p><h5><a name="0610315000298"></a>11.16

Secretary of State shall issue, and may from time to time revise,
statutory guidance containing guidelines setting out aims, objectives
and other matters, and such practical guidance as he thinks
appropriate, in respect of the discharge by persons to whom this
section applies of their functions under this
section.&#148;</ul><p><a name="0610315000221"></a>The
noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment requests the sort of
statutory guidance which the Government have recently put in place to
address the important issue we have just been debating, but in this
case it concerns training for teachers on the appropriate use of
physical restraint, and in particular on children with physical or
mental difficulties. We have been advised by the charity TreeHouse, the
Advisory Centre for Education and the National Autistic
Society.</p><p><a name="0610315000222"></a>The Minister
has stated that he is content with the current position and he has
repeatedly assured us that the DfES is not aware that the current
powers have caused any difficulties since 1998. However, the charities
that have briefed us can all point to examples where school staff have
made inappropriate physical interventions with no training and with
serious consequences for pupils and adults. A couple of weeks ago a
special report by Channel 4 News showed a case involving a six year-old
girl with autism and other communication conditions which highlighted
the lack of training on appropriate handling methods and proper
post-incident procedures in a mainstream 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_144"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>primary school. The six year-old girl was restrained firmly on several
occasions. The girl&#146;s treatment at school came to the attention
of her parents only when she came home with ripped clothing. The
parents requested a full incident log and found that their daughter had
been held repeatedly, removed from classrooms and the toilet, and that
staff had not received or requested training until the situation became
known to the parents. No incident had been reported to the parents. A
joint investigation by the police and the local authority found serious
procedural errors in the school, which had no policy on physical
interventions. The department has conceded that it does not collect
data on the number of incidents involving pupils with SEN, but as the
Channel 4 News investigation found from research it commissioned, many
mainstream schools have been &#147;unaffected&#148; by the
non-statutory guidance.</p><p><a name="0610315000223"></a>What is
the basis for the Minister&#146;s assertion that the DfES is not
aware that the current powers have caused difficulties, given the lack
of monitoring and data collection? How can he say that when he does not
really know? A DfES audit of allegations against teachers and other
staff in the education service for September 2003-04 found that the
largest number of allegations against staff arose from inappropriate
physical handling in a mainstream secondary setting. A report by the
National Foundation for Educational Research supports the argument that
mainstream staff need to be better equipped to manage the challenging
behaviours they are increasingly facing today. The report makes it
clear that special schools, for which there is good guidance that is
well known to them, have the highest frequency of incidents but the
least likelihood of a complaint arising. It is pretty obvious why;
their staff have proper training. Equally, the report goes on to note
that mainstream schools have the fewest incidents but the highest
number of complaints. They do not have proper training and they are not
all aware of the non-statutory guidance. Plainly, behind this research
and these case studies there is a very high human and financial cost of
inappropriate interventions, in terms of exclusions, police time,
physical injury, anxiety and the possible need for alternative,
out-of-county placements.</p><p><a name="0610315000224"></a>This
issue is too important to be left to chance, by placing documents on
the Teachernet website and leaving schools to carry out their own risk
assessments. We believe that statutory guidance will ensure that all
schools prioritise this issue when they come to consider their whole
school behaviour and their inclusion and disability discrimination
policies. This is the best way of ensuring that we achieve a more
proactive, preventive and constructive approach across all schools. The
Bill gives a clear statement of the rights of all members of the
school&#146;s work-force to use force where appropriate and
necessary. We believe that there should be a countervailing
responsibility on all schools&#151;especially mainstream schools,
where most children, with autism, for example, are educated&#151;to
train their staff effectively, so that they are as aware and as skilled
as many staff in special schools are in how to deal appropriately with
these situations. I beg to move.</p>

Adonis:</b> My Lords, since Report I have written to
the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on Clause 92 and the issues of
concern to her. In my letter, I said that the department already issues
three pieces of guidance on the use of force, two of which are aimed at
special schools and persons who work with pupils with severe special
educational needs and one, Circular 10/98, for mainstream
schools.</p><p><a name="0610315000226"></a>Circular 10/98 provides
schools with clear, detailed and practical advice on all the key issues
that they will need to consider in making use of this power. In
particular, the guidance gives examples of circumstances in which
physical intervention might be appropriate, factors that staff should
bear in mind when deciding whether to intervene and the kinds of
physical intervention that might or might not be appropriate. It also
discusses the meaning of &#147;reasonable force&#148; and advises
that schools should have a policy about the use of reasonable force and
that they should tell parents about it. It further advises that schools
should record incidents in which any force, other than trivial or minor
force, is used and tell parents of any such incidents involving their
child. The issue of ensuring that school staff understand this
properly, about which the noble Baroness has indicated particular
concern, is also specifically addressed in this
guidance:</p><ul><a name="0610315000280"></a>&#147;The Head
teacher should draw up a policy setting out guidelines about the use of
force to control or restrain pupils, and discuss these with the staff
who may have to apply them, and with the Governing Body of the
school&#148;.</ul><p><a name="0610315000227"></a>The guidance
goes on to advise how, in planning for possible incidents, schools need
to consider:</p><ul><a name="0610315000287"></a>&#147;briefing
staff to ensure they know exactly what action they should be taking
(this may identify a need for training or
guidance)&#148;.</ul><p><a name="0610315000228"></a>I should
emphasise that this does not mean that all staff will necessarily need
training, or that any training needs identified for individual staff
members will be the same as for other staff, but there is a helpful
prompt in this part of the guidance for senior school management to
consider what if any training needs there might be for individual staff
members in the light of their experience, particular responsibilities
and so on.</p><p><a name="0610315000229"></a>We therefore believe
that this guidance, to which schools have had access for many years,
addresses exactly the kinds of concerns to which the noble Baroness has
drawn attention. The reissue of the guidance will help remind schools
of its existence and will provide an opportunity to ensure that it is
fully up-to-date and covers those points that in earlier debates I have
specifically undertaken to ensure are included. The revised guidance
will be issued to coincide with the commencement of Clause 92, after
consultation with key
stakeholders.</p><p><a name="0610315000230"></a>Given this
commitment to producing guidance to support staff in exercising this
power under Clause 92, we do not see the need for a statutory
requirement for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on these
matters. I again emphasise that there is nothing substantially new
about Clause 92. The legislation that it re-enacts has been in force
for eight years. As I say, during that time the Department has not seen
evidence that either the legislation or the associated 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_146"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>guidance has caused particular problems, or that
inappropriate application of the power to use force is a widespread
problem. This is not, of course, to say that there are not individual
cases of concern&#151;as the noble Baroness rightly said, of course
there will be individual cases of concern&#151;but we have no reason
to believe that the non-statutory status of the current guidance has
made staff more willing to use force or less responsible in the way
they use it.</p><p><a name="0610315000231"></a>For these reasons,
with all the reassurances I have given, including the reissue of the
guidance to meet current best practice, I hope the noble Baroness will
feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06103113000003"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew267"></a><a name="06103113000066"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
response. The circular may contain some very laudable guidance and the
measure in the Bill about physical restraint may not be new, but the
fact that it is being re-enacted has ensured that there has been a
certain amount of press coverage, particularly in the specialist press,
and discussion about this issue. That in itself may very well serve the
Minister&#146;s purpose in drawing attention to the circular.
Although it is not statutory, it may well have more attention paid to
it.</p><p><a name="06103113000004"></a>I very much hope that the
case studies I have mentioned are one-offs and very unusual, but it is
quite clear that the school to which I referred did not seem terribly
aware of the guidance. I am concerned that if it is not made statutory
there will be schools that do not pay attention to it and the kind of
situations I have described will arise.</p><p><a name="06103113000005"></a>I think we have cantered around this
course quite long enough. I beg leave to withdraw the

clauses and the attempts he has made to tell me about the steps that
the Government feel able to
take.</p><p><a name="06103113000010"></a>Clause 100 effectively
lays on governing bodies in the case of a fixed-term exclusion and in
the case of a permanent exclusion on local authorities responsibility
for providing the equivalent of full-time education for excluded
children. We have no quarrel with that. Indeed, we much welcome it
because it is clear that the more one can provide alternative education
which is full-time and effective the better. It enables the excluded
child to continue his or her education and, in the case of a fixed
period of exclusion, to, we hope, go back to the mainstream school and
resume their education there.</p>



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_147"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103113000011"></a>The problem is quite straightforward. Even
in the light of the great help that the Minister has extended to us for
moving in these areas, it arises in the description of parents. In a
letter the Minister has kindly sent me, which is addressed to the Local
Government Association, a first group of parents is effectively
described as those willing to take on the responsibility of caring for
their child for the five days before the local authority or the
governing body take over responsibility for educating the child to
ensure that that child in those first five days is not in any public
place during school hours. The second group of parents that the
Government refer to in the clauses, and in particular in the letter to
the Local Government Association, are parents who are unwilling to help
in terms of taking the responsibility to care for their children during
those first five days and to ensure that they are not in any public
place during school hours.</p><p><a name="06103113000012"></a>There
is, however, a third group, which we on these Benches believe is the
biggest group of the three. It is not parents who are able to take
responsibility for the five days; it is not parents who are unwilling
to do so&#151;on both of those points we fully share the
Government&#146;s position. It is a third group of parents who are
simply unable to do so, because of the nature of their work, their
economic situation or because of other children or elderly parents for
whom they have a pressing responsibility. In the letter that I sent to
the Minister, which he was gracious enough to accept and acknowledge, I
said that there are a great many parents in this category&#151;in
particular, of course, a great many single parents&#151;who simply
cannot make themselves free for five days, even if they want to,
without putting their jobs at risk or their other responsibilities at
risk.</p><p><a name="06103113000013"></a>I gave the Minister
examples of, for instance, NHS nurses with responsibility for caring
for people in hospital and teachers with responsibilities to their
schools. In those cases, making a quick arrangement&#151;a matter of
hours in involved&#151;to free themselves from those responsibilities
so that they could look after their child for five days and ensure that
he or she is kept out of a public place is, bluntly, an unrealistic
demand to place upon them. It also carries the basis of being an
offence that is finable and later might even involve a custodial
sentence.</p><p><a name="06103113000014"></a>I recognise that the
Minister has gone a long way to try and meet us and I am grateful to
him for that, but that final step, which recognises that if there is a
good reason or justification for the parents&#146; inability to
respond, it is one that still weighs a little in the balance. We want
to make sure that the parent&#151;in this context I stress that we
refer to a parent with good intentions but whose personal situations
which make it either difficult or almost impossible to respond in the
way required&#151;has three things. I hope that the Minister will be
able to satisfy us that these three things are now in place. The first
thing they need is precise information about the terms of the
exclusion&#151;how long it is for, what conditions may be attached,
whether there are any indications of the situations in which the child
finds himself and so on. The first demand is the exact terms of the
exclusion.</p>



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_148"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103113000015"></a>The second requirement is that the parent
knows and understands the basis of a good reason for his or her
inability to respond or, crucially, to get relatives or friends to
respond in his or her place. That has to be made plain; we would be
grateful if the guidance could give clear examples and explain what
justification might be accepted so that the parent would be most
unlikely to be charged with committing an offence.</p><p><a name="06103113000016"></a>The final requirement is that we want to
ensure that parents have immediate redress if they seek to meet the
requirements of the legislation, find themselves unable to do so, but
want to know what they can do in the situation. We believe that in this
situation the advice that can be made readily available outside office
hours from the education welfare office is important. The Minister has
been most helpful on that point and I am grateful to him. I would like
to make sure that he now feels that the system would be able to be in
place by the time that these clauses come into effect or soon
afterwards, and also that he recognises that where this simply cannot
be done it would be the ultimate responsibility of the local authority
to ensure that the child is safeguarded if, for one reason and another,
there is no ability to ensure that it does not appear in a public place
for five days. </p><p><a name="06103113000017"></a>I have one
final, small question for the Minister. The guidance to the Bill
indicates that for children of a certain age the parent might not need
to be present to take them away from school. But if that child, on his
way home from school, appears in a public place&#151;if she or he
bicycles back home after having been excluded&#151;they are almost
certain to be in a public place for at least for some time. Would that
constitute an offence or would it constitute grounds that would be
accepted because the attempt had been made to try to maintain the
requirement laid upon the parent? I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103113000018"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew269"></a><a name="06103113000068"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, as the noble Baroness said, I
have been in dialogue with her on the issues that she has raised, and I
do not think that we are completely at one. I should stress that the
reason that I think we are not completely at one is in part a simple
issue of resources. I would like to be able to provide the overarching
duties on local authorities to safeguard from the first day, but in my
reply to her noble friend on Report, I set out the costs that would be
associated with that and the limits to which we thought we could go at
this stage in imposing new duties on local authorities, noting that of
course the requirement to provide after the sixth day is itself a new
duty on local authorities, involving considerable additional
expenditure. Although I do not think I can go the whole way in meeting
her concerns, I hope that I can at least go part of the way and explain
our thinking on those other issues that she has raised.</p><p><a name="06103113000019"></a>Amendment No. 16 would require parents to
be given information about the terms of their child&#146;s exclusion
and where they can get advice about it. At Report, I explained that we
accept that parents will need to be properly informed about their

ensure that the model letter my department offers 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_149"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>head teachers to send to parents at the time of exclusion is revised to
set out clearly the nature of their duty under Clause 102, the days on
which that duty will apply, the consequences of failing in that duty
and the availability of the defence of reasonable justification. I also
undertook to include in that letter the contact number of the local
authority&#146;s education welfare service, or equivalent. That would
enable the parents to get further advice about the authority&#146;s
approach to issuing penalty notices for this offence and for them to be
signposted to different types of support, available either through the
local authority or through other national or local agencies and
helplines, such as the Advisory Centre for Education, to which my
department provides
funding.</p><p><a name="06103113000020"></a>Following my further
commitment in debate on Tuesday, I have also written to the Local
Government Association about what support it can provide in this area
and have sent the noble Baroness a copy of the letter. Taking up the
noble Baroness&#146;s proposal, I specifically asked the Local
Government Association if its members could provide a helpline service
with extended hours, as suggested by the amendment. I have asked it to
consider that matter formally and have said that I would be happy to
meet the noble Lord, Lord Bruce-Lockhart, the association&#146;s
president, to discuss this with him directly. It would be a sensible
way forward which could offer a great deal of support to parents who
are in the predicament the noble Baroness has described. I give her my
undertaking that I will pursue those discussions further and report
back to her on the progress I have made. In view of those measures, I
do not believe that a statutory requirement in this area is
necessary.</p><p><a name="06103113000021"></a>On Amendments Nos. 17
and 18, I recognise the noble Baroness&#146;s concern about what is
in some cases regarded as the impracticality of the duty on parents to
ensure that their child is not present in a public place during school
hours in the first five days of exclusion, particularly the burden it
is felt this may place on disadvantaged parents. Amendment No. 17 would
mean that a parent could request a local authority to offer a place at
a pupil referral unit to an excluded pupil during the first five days
of that pupil&#146;s exclusion from school if the parent had good
reason for being unable to comply with their duty under Clause
102.</p><p><a name="06103113000022"></a>We believe that in many
cases it may well be appropriate for such a place to be made available
and would encourage local authorities to consider what provision they
can make in that area. However, to impose a duty of this kind we
believe is problematic. Exclusions tend to take effect very quickly
after the head teacher makes the decision, often on the next day or
even on the same day as the exclusion, as soon as the notice under
Clause 103 can be brought to their attention. The five days start to
run from this point, but if this were to be a statutory duty, the local
authority would need enough time to consider the request to which it
could in any case not be required to accede to because of the parallel
requirements that provision for pupils must be suitable to their
particular needs. As I explained at Report, a place ata pupil
referral unit may not be suitable to the particular needs of a child;
often pupil referral units 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_150"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column 150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are very specialist places for children at high risk or with particular
behavioural difficulties which may not be appropriate to the child in
question.</p><p><a name="06103113000023"></a>When it comes to the
defence of reasonable justification, there is a circular argument
which, despite having given a good deal of consideration to it, I am
unable to resolve. The noble Baroness quite rightly says that there
should be the defence of reasonable justification&#151;which there
is&#151;and that it needs to be clear to parents that it exists. We
accept that. She then wishes us to spell out those reasonable
justifications. As I said when I replied to a similar amendment at
Report, we do not believe it is possible to list exhaustively what
reasonable justifications there might be. The presence of a school
pupil in a place such as a library, a shopping centre or riding a bike
on the way home, as the noble Baroness suggested, may be reasonable in
some cases but not in others. If we were to set this out in formal
guidance, it could provide either a misleading view of what would
constitute reasonable justification in all cases or, worse still, a
list of ready-made excuses which parents or pupils could
use.</p><p><a name="06103113000024"></a>I am anxious not to sound
unduly negative. To meet the first points, under existing arrangements
schools and local authorities can and do make provision earlier than
the sixth day for exclusions. We accept that there will be cases where
there are reasonable justifications for the presence of a pupil in a
public place. While it is for the courts to decide what constitutes a
reasonable justification, it could conceivably cover situations where
it was not possible for parents to make alternative arrangements or to
take time off work in the way that the noble Baroness has
described.</p><p><a name="06103113000025"></a>Taking all of those
factors into account, I hope the noble Baroness will accept that we
have done a good deal to meet the points that she has raised. I accept
that we have not met them all, but I particularly commit myself to
working further on the support services for parents, starting with the
helpline. I will be in touch with her again about
that.</p><p><a name="06103113000026"></a><b><a name="61030-0005.htm_spnew270"></a><a name="06103113000069"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to
the Minister, and I certainly will not push this matter to the point of
asking the opinion of the House. I am grateful for what he has done,
which is very considerable. I would simply like to leave him with the
example of a parent who has reasonable justification and is recognised
by the local authority as having reasonable justification. That parent
cannot then alter the circumstances in which they have justified their
inability to do what the Bill requires, and yet a fixed penalty of some
&#163;50 may still fall upon them. I take it that the matter would
have to go to court in order for the penalty to be lifted. That is not
a wholly satisfactory situation where somebody, by the very wording we
have agreed, would have good reason for what they have done and would
not be behaving
irresponsibly.</p><p><a name="06103113000027"></a>My only other

as having to fall into either the category of being irresponsible or
the category of being fully responsible because they have done what the
law asked them to. I repeat that there is this third category who I
would not wish to see treated effectively as having behaved badly or,
even worse, as if they had committed an offence. The Minister has
hugely narrowed down the areas of concern that I had. This one area of
concern remains. I am grateful to him for saying that he will try to
give it further thought. I beg leave to withdraw the

Baroness said: In speaking to these regulations, I shall also speak to
the Service Voters&#146; Registration Period Order 2006 and the
Review of Polling Districts and Polling Places (Parliamentary
Elections) Regulations 2006, which appear subsequently on the Order
Paper.</p><p><a name="06103047000013"></a>As noble Lords will
recall from our long and happy deliberations on the Electoral
Administration Bill, we aim to tackle four key areas that we believe
are at the core of a healthy democracy: improving access and engagement
in the democratic process; extending openness and transparency in party
financing; improving confidence in the electoral system; and
maintaining professional delivery of elections. The Electoral
Administration Act 2006 will be implemented, where possible, on a
nationwide basis for the May 2007
elections.</p><p><a name="06103047000014"></a>Let me take noble
Lords through the regulations. Part 1 indicates that the majority of
the regulations will come into effect on 1 January 2007 and apply to
England and Wales only. Part 2 concerns anonymous registration. Again,
noble Lords will recall our debates on these issues. Anonymous
registration is for a person who believes that having their name and
address on the register would put their safety or that of others in
their household at risk. As I indicated in our discussions in Committee
and on Report, it is not 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there to be used as an ex-directory system for someone who does not for
whatever reason want their details published on the register. The Act
allows a person to apply to be registered without their details being
made public.</p><p><a name="06103047000015"></a>In drafting the
regulations, the Government consulted a variety of
stakeholders&#151;Victim Support, the Home Office, Scottish
Women&#146;s Aid and the Network for Surviving Stalking. This was to
get their views on, for example, evidence that would be required to go
with an application and who would require access to the record of
anonymous entries. Through consultation&#151;and I am grateful to
those organisations for their support and advice&#151;we were able to
draft the regulations that are now before the
Committee.</p><p><a name="06103047000016"></a>There are strict
criteria for anonymous registration. A person has to provide evidence
such as an order of the types specified in the regulations. These are
made under the Family Law Act 1996 or the Protection from Harassment
Act 1997, and each has the purpose of protecting people from harassment
or molestation. If a person does not have an order, they can apply
using an attestation, which has to be signed by a senior officer from
the organisations that are listed in the regulations, such as the chief
constable of a police force. We did not want a registration officer to
undertake qualitative evaluations as to why someone should have an
anonymous entry, which is why we prescribe in the regulations the
evidence and the forms of attestation that will be acceptable with an
application.As a person&#146;s anonymous entry terminates
after12 months, a registration officer will send out a
reminder, as set out in the regulations, saying to the person that they
need to make a fresh application to remain on the anonymous
register.</p><p><a name="06103047000017"></a>The regulations also
extend the current system of registration objections to empower the
registration officer to remove an elector&#146;s name from the
electoral register if it becomes apparent, after the process of
registration has been completed, that they should not have been
registered. Previously, objections to a person&#146;s registration
could be lodged only before the application for registration was
allowed, and a registration officer&#146;s powers to remove an
incorrect or out-of-date entry were limited. Noble Lords will recall
that we debated that at great length. The regulations allow for any
individual to object to another person&#146;s registration at any
time. An objection can also be made before or after a person&#146;s
registration. The Government feel that this change ensures that
registration is more open to scrutiny and that the registers will be
more accurate, which is something that I know the noble Baroness is
particularly concerned about.</p><p><a name="06103047000018"></a>An electoral registration officer has the
power to remove an elector from the register if he or she determines
that the elector is no longer resident or for other reasons has ceased
to satisfy the conditions of entitlement to be registered. This power
also extends to a person who has an anonymous entry. A separate list is
kept of objections to entries on the register. The list contains the
name and address of the objector and 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the name, address and elector number, if they are already on the
register, of the person being objected to. It also contains particulars
of the objection.</p><p><a name="06103047000019"></a>In Part 3,
the regulations allow a registration officer to make alterations to the
electoral register to correct an error or to give effect to a court
ruling up to 9 pm on polling day. Under the previous system, a person
could have been disfranchised if a clerical error had been made that
was only discovered on the day of the poll or within the five days
preceding it. As errors are likely to come to light when a person goes
to vote, this is a sensible amendment that focuses on the
elector.</p><p><a name="06103047000020"></a>Part 4 of the
regulations gives effect to the changes introduced by the Electoral
Administration Act 2006 to ballot papers. In particular, ballot papers
will no longer need to be attached to a counterfoil. Instead, returning
officers will need to record ballot paper numbers to be used at a
parliamentary election on a corresponding number list, the form of
which is prescribed in the regulations. Noble Lords will recall our
discussions about the administrative burden of having to remove the
counterfoils from the
forms.</p><p><a name="06103047000021"></a>Under Part 5, noble Lords
inserted provisions into the Electoral Administration Act 2006 that
provide for the collection and checking of personal identifiers for
absent voters. These are designed to enhance the security of the postal
voting system. Part 5 sets out in full the details of the new
arrangements. Persons applying to vote by post or proxy are required to
provide their signature and date of birth. At elections, postal voters
must provide these identifiers when they cast their vote. The returning
officer will take steps set out in the regulations to verify the
personal identifiers before the ballot paper may be allowed to proceed
to the count.</p><p><a name="06103047000022"></a>Part 6 amends the
arrangements for proxy vote applications that are being made as a
consequence of provisions in the Electoral Administration Act 2006.
They abolish any rule of common law that could be used to prevent
persons with a mental impairment from voting and remove the restriction
on mental health patients detained under civil powers from voting in
person at polling stations, even if they are well enough to attend the
polling station.</p><p><a name="06103047000023"></a>Paragraph 94 of
Schedule 1 to the Electoral Administration Act 2006 provides for the
cancellation and removal of ballot papers under any prescribed
circumstances. Part 7 of the regulations cover the procedure by which a
cancelled postal ballot paper should be retrieved from a ballot box
under prescribed circumstances. Part 8 of the regulations substitutes
revised forms of official poll card to be sent to the elector or proxy
voter and prescribes the new forms of official poll card to be sent to
postal voters and postal proxy
voters.</p><p><a name="06103047000024"></a>Part 9 is made in
consequence of the introduction of new Rule 31A in the parliamentary
election rules requiring returning officers to record the return of
postal ballots. Part 10 affects access to the records and lists that
registration officers maintain of postal voters, proxy voters and proxy
postal voters. The provisions work in conjunction with and
mirror

register. The new arrangements take into account the decision in the
Robertson case, which concerned the supply of the electoral register.
The High Court found that the supply of the register for direct
marketing purposes without giving individual electors the opportunity
to object was in breach of data protection and human rights
legislation.</p><h5><a name="06103047000119"></a>3.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06103047000025"></a>Part 11 introduces a new
framework of regulations governing access to and the supply and
inspection of the marked electoral register, postal voters list and
other election documents. It broadly mirrors that which is already in
place for the electoral register, and implements change to the
processing of information from the electoral register and the offence
for misuse of the electoral register. Part 12 sets out a number of
miscellaneous amendments relating to postal voting and the conduct of
elections, and a transitional provision about the anonymous
registration process.</p><p><a name="06103047000026"></a>On the
Service Voters&#146; Registration Period Order 2006, noble Lords will
recall that we wished to increase the length of the registration period
on the electoral register for service personnel and their spouse or
civil partner from one year to three years, where a service
qualification has been completed. To allow for the minimum confusion in
implementing the Act, this order will not be made until 18 December so
that it can come into force with the other regulations on 1 January
2007.</p><p><a name="06103047000027"></a>Finally, as regards the
Review of Polling Districts and Polling Places (Parliamentary
Elections) Regulations 2006, Sections 18A to 18E of the Representation
of the People Act 1983, as amended by the Electoral Administration Act
2006, state that a local authority is required to keep the designation
of polling places and polling districts within its area under review.
Schedule A1 to the 1983 Act requires that regulations specify the
manner in which representations made by a returning officer in
connection with the review are to be published by a relevant authority,
and specify the information that a relevant authority must publish on
the completion of a review. These regulations aim to give greater
transparency to the review process. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103047000028"></a>Moved, That the Grand
Committee do report to the House that it has considered the
Representation of the People (England and Wales) (Amendment) (No. 2)
Regulations 2006 [<I>36th Report from the Joint
Committee</I>].&#151;(<I>Baroness Ashton of
Upholland</I>.)</p><p><a name="06103047000029"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0001.htm_spnew280"></a><a name="06103047000125"></a>Baroness
Hanham:</b> I thank the Minister for that very clear
explanation of the regulations, which we discussed in considerable
detail during the passage of the Electoral Administration
Bill&#151;now Act&#151;when an enormous number of changes were
made.</p><p><a name="06103047000030"></a>I do not have much to say
on the Representation of the People (England and Wales)
(Amendment)(No. 2) Regulations 2006. The Minister cleared up a
point that I had not picked up in detail. She said that there will be
an annual requirement to renew anonymous registration. That is
extremely important, 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>otherwise anonymous registration could go on for ever. I was intending
to ask whether there was a time limit, so the noble Baroness&#146;s
explanation saves me asking a question and her giving me an
answer.</p><p><a name="06103047000031"></a>The Minister talked
about absent voting and the personal identifiers provision. She is
correct that we managed to get two identifiers put in during the
passage of the legislation&#151;the signature and the date of birth.
I am a little puzzled about the percentage that has been selected for
examination. I do not remember discussing what a suitable percentage
would be. One in five of all postal votes applied for and cast seems to
be quite small. Is that a sufficient sample to pick up flaws? Against
what criteria was that figure assessed? I know that the Electoral
Commission wants 100 per cent provision, although I understand that,
particularly at these early stages, that may be a step too far. I can
envisage the electoral registration officers getting quite wound up
about having to check every vote until they are used to doing so. But
20 per cent seems very low. Perhaps the Minister will let me know
against what criteria these figures were
set.</p><p><a name="06103047000032"></a>On the service
voters&#146; registration, we have memories of a valiant battle lost.
The Minister will not be surprised to hear that we think that these
measures are extremely second rate. The extension of the duration of
the service voters&#146; registration, which I know has taken place
since we discussed this matter, was originally going to be for five
years, but it seems somehow to have slipped back to three years.
Perhaps the Minister will explain why that has happened. As we made
clear during the passage of the Bill, we are not sure that any of this
is enough to ensure that service voters are given the opportunity to
vote, particularly if they are abroad.</p><p><a name="06103047000033"></a>We still believe that the MoD has behaved
badly. It could have taken far more responsibility for ensuring that
servicemen had the right to vote and were under its eye in order to do
so. The rather wishy-washy proposals, whereby people keep an eye on the
register, do not seem to do anything much to bring about a satisfactory
outcome. The requirement is merely to record a register and to keep an
eye out. We are not happy with that. The Minister will not be surprised
at this, but we must keep on recording our objection to the fact that
these measures simply do not answer the problem. It will be interesting
to see whether at the next election the situation is any better at all
as a result of this.</p><p><a name="06103047000034"></a>On the
review of polling districts, we all agreed that polling stations should
be accessible. These days, it is completely unacceptable that anybody
with a disability should not be able to get into a polling station, or
to get a postal vote if they cannot, or cannot get out. We have no
objections to any of these provisions.</p><p><a name="06103047000035"></a>In general, then, we support these
measures, but with grave reservations about the service voters&#146;
registration.</p><p><a name="06103047000036"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0001.htm_spnew281"></a><a name="06103047000126"></a>Lord
Goodhart:</b> We share many of the concerns expressed
by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. Like her, we have nothing to say on
the review of the 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>polling districts; that seems an entirely proper matter, and I do not
wish to make any comments on it. As for the other matters, we believe
that the provision made for service voters is inadequate. The Act
itself does not go as far as it should, but stronger measures clearly
could and should be taken to make it easier for service
people&#151;particularly those on duty outside the United
Kingdom&#151;to cast their votes, which they of course have
absolutely as much right as anybody else to do. They should be provided
with the best possible facilities. All that has been done is to extend
the period from one year to three. Three years is inadequate; it is
less than the normal gap between general elections. I would have
thought that the original proposal for five could have been implemented
at once. We remain concerned with that, and the battle must
continue.</p><p><a name="06103047000037"></a>On the main
order&#151;the Representation of the People (England and Wales)
(Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations&#151;we are broadly happy with
everything except the provisions for verification of the personal
identifiers. We feel that 20 per cent is much too low. We recognise
that it may not be possible to bring in 100 per cent verification at
once but, as elections happen and experience is gained, the regulations
should have provided&#151;even if they have to provide for 20 per
cent initially&#151;for a target date by which we should be able to
get to 100 per cent verification of the personal identifiers. That
would be an important step forward in what has been a serious problem
in recent elections, particularly local elections. The measures taken
so far are not strong
enough.</p><p><a name="06103047000038"></a>Otherwise, we are
satisfied with the regulations and are grateful to the Minister for the
care with which she has explained them.</p><p><a name="06103047000039"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0001.htm_spnew282"></a><a name="06103047000127"></a>Lord
Greaves:</b> I want to pick at one or two of the
details of these regulations, and I suppose that the Minister will
remind me that I have got my anorak on again. I have tried to work out
how many election counts I have been to, but I lost count, although the
number is into three figures, which is extraordinary. I wonder what I
have done with my life.</p><p><a name="06103047000040"></a>Very
often, ensuring smooth, efficient and well run elections, and the other
side of the coin&#151;stopping people fiddling elections&#151;are a
matter of the detail, which is very often important. Regulation 4 of
the Review of Polling Districts and Polling Places (Parliamentary
Elections) Regulations
states:</p><ul><a name="06103047000115"></a>&#147;On completion
of a review the authority must
publish&#148;,</ul><a name="06103047000113"></a>a list of
provisions. I am not sure what is meant by the word
&#147;publish&#148;, which may be obvious to everyone except me.
What does that mean?<p><a name="06103047000041"></a>I also
have one or two comments on how the regulations in the main document
might work in practice. Part 4, entitled &#147;Replacement of
Counterfoils&#148;, refers to what we will now learn to know and love
as the &#147;corresponding number list&#148;. Are the corresponding
number lists among those documents that can be inspected by people as
set out after the election? I am concerned about those lists, which are
set out on pages 58 and 59. It will be fairly easy for
voters&#151;particularly at a quiet polling station where people
might stay to chat for five minutes with 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those behind the counter because they know them&#151;to have a good
look at the list. They would be able to see the electoral number and
the corresponding ballot paper number. Until now, a real effort has
been made to stop people knowing ballot paper numbers because they then
could go along to the count, see the number and work out how a person
had voted. Usually, that is not very easy to do, but in small wards
where there are not many votes it could be quite easy if forms such as
L2 are just lying on the table as voters go in. The presiding officers
and clerks write down the numbers and then get people to sign. When
people sign, they will be able to see the names of everyone else who
has signed. That worries me a little. Do the Government have a comment
on that?</p><p><a name="06103047000042"></a>On personal
identifiers, noble Lords have picked up on the fact that only 20 per
cent will be checked. The Electoral Commission has expressed concern
about that. New Regulation 85A, on page 25, sets out the procedure for
checking personal identifiers. The implication of new Regulation
85B&#151;on additional personal identifier verification&#151;is
that the returning officer has to check 20 per cent, but, if having
checked 20 per cent they think that things might be going on that ought
not to be going on, they can check more. Is that the case?</p><h5><a name="06103047000120"></a>4
pm</h5><p><a name="06103047000043"></a>I have two questions. First,
if a minimum of 20 per cent must be verified, will places where it is
suggested that there might be more fraud than in others be expected to
verify more than 20 per cent right from the beginning? If so, what
criteria will be used for deciding that in particular places? Will
advice be given to returning officers, or is it entirely up to
them?</p><p><a name="06103047000044"></a>Secondly, once 20 per cent
have been verified, what criteria will be used to decide to verify
more? By that stage, it will be quite difficult to get everything out
again and start re-checking. It will certainly delay everything a great
deal. Will candidates&#146; agents be consulted at that stage? If you
go to a lot of these events, you generally find out quite quickly that
the role and status given to agents varies greatly from place to place.
In some places, agents are given very few rights and are simply
consulted at the end when everything has been added up. In other
places, the culture allows agents to keep an eye on what is happening
as it is happening. I am not clear whether that will be possible under
the regulations. Will it be possible, for example, for the signatures
of the 20 per cent to be checked in the presence of agents, or will
they be checked secretly? This is key. Will this simply be left to
returning officers? If it is, there will be huge differences between
the practices in different places. That is simply the way it works at
the moment.</p><p><a name="06103047000045"></a>On the changes to
proxy applications, I shall talk briefly about the recent case in
Burnley in which two people were found guilty of defrauding the
returning officer as a result of wrongfully filling in proxy forms. I
do not want to say too much about it because I understand that they may
appeal. I shall wait until everything is finished before I have a lot
to say. Nothing in the regulations tightens up the procedure for
applying for a proxy vote. At the moment, it is 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very easy&#151;indeed, it is accepted in a lot of places&#151;simply
to write on the form &#147;away at work&#148;, &#147;in some
other country&#148; or &#147;on holiday&#148;. The judge in the
case recommended that the system of proxy voting should be reconsidered
and tightened up a little, or perhaps a lot. I wonder whether the
Government have taken that on board.</p><p><a name="06103047000046"></a>I have seen proxy application forms, and
I learnt some time ago that, if you are an agent for an election in
some of these areas and your party is submitting proxy applications,
you must insist that you look at all those applications very carefully
before they go in. In the light of what has happened in Burnley, I am
very glad that I have insisted on that in recent years. You find that
people write things such as &#147;shopping&#148;&#151;a classic
one. I upset some of our workers by simply tearing the applications up
and saying that they could not be accepted. The form and the system are
not as rigorous as they should
be.</p><p><a name="06103047000047"></a>We then come to the question
of access to the marked electoral registers and other documents in Part
7. The regulations set out very clearly that it will be possible to
have access to personal statements after the event, and that the people
entitled to make an inspection may make handwritten notes but not
copies. That is a difficulty, because it depends on signatures. At the
moment, it is possible, after the event, to check the declarations of
identity against the witness statements. The ability to photocopy
signatures and check them against the signatures of the people
concerned has been a valuable way of telling whether there has been any
fiddling in postal votes. This is a grey area in the regulations,
although I have certainly been allowed to do it in the past. The fact
that this will no longer be possible will make it more difficult for
representatives of the parties and the candidates to investigate any
possible fiddling.</p><p><a name="06103047000048"></a>One of the
reasons why there are so few prosecutions in election fraud cases is
that it is very difficult to gather evidence. It is especially
difficult to gather evidence within 28 days to seek an election
petition. It would be much easier if one could inspect not only the
statements that people make when they vote but the application forms
for postal or proxy votes. In the past, the regulations have been grey
and it has been possible to inspect those, but in the past two or three
years the Electoral Commission has ruled that that is not possible, and
registration officers seem to have applied that ruling. I do not
understand why it is not possible to look at the application forms for
postal and proxy votes. That would enable evidence on fraudulent
applications to be gathered. At the moment, it is very difficult to do
that.</p><p><a name="06103047000049"></a>On page 39 of the
regulations, under the heading &#147;Miscellaneous
Amendments&#148;, there is reference to an,</p><ul><a name="06103047000116"></a>&#147;Additional requirement for
applications for ballot papers to be sent to different address from
that stated in
application&#148;.</ul><a name="06103047000114"></a>That is
extremely welcome. I hope that the measure will be applied rigorously
and that statements such as &#147;going shopping&#148; will not be
accepted by registration officers as a reason for diverting postal
votes. We all know of the Birmingham case and of many allegations in
other places of the wholesale diversion 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of votes to postal vote &#147;factories&#148;. That is one of the
main problems that has arisen with postal votes. I hope that reasons
will have to be stated in detail so that people cannot just write
vaguely, &#147;Away from home&#148;, which is what has tended to
happen in the past. It would be extremely helpful if applications for
postal votes could be inspected by people who might have evidence on
whether they were
valid.<p><a name="06103047000050"></a>Applications for postal
votes must be made on white paper within a box measuring 5 x 2
centimetres. That is fair enough. Presumably, if they are submitted on
Basildon Bond blue paper, or if the relevant information is outside a
box on the form, they will be sent back. As regards the postal voting
statement that is sent in with the ballot paper, what happens if there
is a perfectly reasonable signature, which is clearly the relevant
person&#146;s signature, but it goes over the edge of the box? Will
that invalidate the vote? Will the form be sent back for another
signature, which would be a recipe for all sorts of complaints and
chaos? Or will it be accepted and looked at manually rather than by
whatever other system will be used? It seems to me that there is great
scope for silly problems to arise in that area if we are not
careful.</p><p><a name="06103047000051"></a>Finally, page 50 of the
regulations refers to the postal voting statement. As regards the boxes
where the voter has to include his date of birth, no doubt it is fairly
obvious to many people where you have to write the day, the month and
the year. However, some people, particularly those from different
cultures, may put those figures in the wrong place or write them back
to front. It would be helpful if under those boxes the words
&#147;day&#148;, &#147;month&#148; and &#147;year&#148;
were included, as often occurs on other
forms.</p><p><a name="06103047000052"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0001.htm_spnew283"></a><a name="06103047000128"></a>Baroness
Ashton of Upholland:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords
who have spoken in this short debate, and I am delighted that I have
light with which to find my answers.</p><p><a name="06103047000053"></a>I begin by addressing the two points
raised on both sides of the Committee concerning the percentages that
we have chosen to use to begin the work on personal identifiers, and
the issue of service voters. The noble Baroness is absolutely right
about the 12-month review of the anonymity requirement. On personal
identifiers, the first thing to say is that 20 per cent is the minimum.
It has been decided in conjunction with electoral administrators and
the Electoral Commission. We expect that in some areas they will want
to look at many more. It is statistically an important percentage, and
it will be done randomly at all stages, therefore acting as a deterrent
to those who wish to try to defraud the system. It does not prevent, in
any circumstances, those electoral officers who wish to go much further
from so doing. That obviously depends to a degree on the individual
circumstances in an area and the electoral officer&#146;s view of
whether more should be done.</p><p><a name="06103047000054"></a>We
share the ambition held on both sides of the Committee to move towards
100 per cent as swiftly as possible, and we have made funding available
to try to achieve that as swiftly as we can. Obviously, that is
dependent on timescales for general elections&#151;as noble Lords
know, I know nothing about those, ever. 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That would certainly be our ambition, and we want to do it as quickly as
we can. We felt that it was important, having talked to the
administrators, to bring this in in a way that could tackle the issue
but that would make it possible to achieve as quickly as possible a
minimum of 20 per cent. Funding of over &#163;4 million is available,
and those who wish to go much further than that minimum could and
should. I hope, recognising that noble Lords want to move as swiftly as
possible, that they will feel comforted by that explanation.</p><p><a name="06103047000055"></a>I rather thought that the valiant battle
on service voters was won, not least because the noble Baroness, Lady
Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Garden, who is not with us this
afternoon, fought it extraordinarily well. I completely accept that
noble Lords want us to go further, and I agree with the principle that
we have to see at the next election whether the plans that we have put
in place have been successful in achieving what we all agreed we wanted
to achieve.</p><p><a name="06103047000056"></a>I say again, as
noble Lords would expect me to, that it is not only this part of the
process that matters; the other work that the Ministry of Defence is
doing matters, too, not least in the registration days, some of which
have already taken place. I hope that the combination of things that it
wanted to do and is keen to do will make a difference. The period of
three years was chosen in consultation again by the Electoral
Commission with the Ministry of Defence. It is the minimum length of
time that service personnel sign up for, and that felt about right, but
it will be kept under review. Although I understand that noble Lords
would like us to go further, the proof inevitably is in the eating of
whether this works, and we will continue to work with our colleagues in
the Ministry of Defence to make sure that it is as effective as
possible. We share completely the ambitions of noble
Lords.</p><p><a name="06103047000057"></a>I will try to deal with a
number of detailed comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. He
began by asking me about the polling district and what the word
&#147;publish&#148; meant. Regulation 3, on the review of polling
districts and polling places, states that the relevant
authority,</p><ul><a name="06103047000118"></a>&#147;must
... publish ... by posting a copy of them at its office and
in at least one conspicuous place in their area; and ... if the
authority maintains a website, by placing a copy on the
authority&#146;s
website&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06103047000058"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0001.htm_spnew284"></a><a name="06103047000129"></a>Lord
Greaves:</b> I did not read
that.</p><p><a name="06103047000059"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0001.htm_spnew285"></a><a name="06103047000130"></a>Baroness
Ashton of Upholland:</b> I am here to help.</p><p><a name="06103047000060"></a>The corresponding number list will be
sealed along with the ballot papers, so the same position as currently
exists with ballot paper counterfoils will apply, which is that they
can be accessed for inspection only after an election by the police
witha court order made under the Electoral Administration
Act.</p><p><a name="06103047000061"></a>On the secrecy of numbers
on the corresponding numbers list, equipment is being developed so that
the voter can see only their own details when signing the list, which I
hope will solve the problem that the noble 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord is concerned about. I have also noted that we ought to ensure that
the guidance covers any remaining problems that there might be with
that. I think that the equipment will solve it, but we will make sure
that it does.</p><p><a name="06103047000062"></a>The noble Lord
asked whether there would be a consultation with the candidates about
increasing the figure from 20 per cent. There is no requirement for a
consultation with the candidates. The noble Lord will know that the
practice varies in different places, and I would expect that candidates
or agents will be keen to make representations when they think that
there is a problem. The noble Lord asked, too, whether checking would
be done in the presence of agents and candidates. The answer is yes, it
would be.</p><h5><a name="06103047000121"></a>4.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06103047000063"></a>The noble Lord asked a couple
of other questions that he has raised in parliamentary Questions, which
I have responded to on behalf of my honourable friend Bridget Prentice,
about Judge Gilbert&#146;s points about proxy voting. The noble Lord
will know that we have not yet had sight of precisely what the judge
has said, which we would want to examine very carefully before
committing further. But I put a copy of the Written Answer that I gave
the noble Lord in the Library. I hope that it will deal with the
specific points about proxy voting. We shall come back to noble Lords
if any further issues arise from the judge&#146;s remarks, when we
have had a chance to see
them.</p><p><a name="06103047000064"></a>The noble Lord asked about
requests to inspect postal voting statements. They are made in writing
to the registration officer; they must state who will inspect the
documents and the date on which they wish to inspect them. They can be
viewed only for electoral or research purposes and under supervision. I
hope that that answers the noble Lord&#146;s
point.</p><p><a name="06103047000065"></a>The noble Lord asked what
would happen if a mark went over the edge of the box. If it
did&#151;because some people have more flamboyant signatures than
others&#151;it would get kicked out by the machine, a person would
look at it and see that it was fine, and it would be fine. So the
machine process points up the fact that there is an issue, but it would
not cause the problems that the noble Lord is concerned
about.</p><p><a name="06103047000066"></a>With the date box, lots
of people print &#147;DDMMYY&#148;, which is a way in which to get
people to put the dates in the right order. We shall havea
look to see whether we have covered that. Thepoint is well
made, especially in these days of Americanisation, when the date is
sometimeschanged
round.</p><p><a name="06103047000067"></a>I think that I have
answered the points that the noble Lord made. If I have not, I shall
pick them up separately with him. I hope that in general noble Lords
will feel that the regulations are worthy of
support.</p><p><a name="06103047000068"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0001.htm_spnew286"></a><a name="06103047000131"></a>Baroness

the equipment to do this. We hope that as soon as possible people move
towards that. I am hesitant about saying that it will happen by the
general election only because I have no idea when that will be. Were it

question about the reasons given for diverting votes, which is a
subject very close to my heart? Is it possible to give guidance to
registration officers that the forms that they put out should require
reasons that are a bit more specific? If people have moved, they should
say where they are now living and, if they are in student
accommodations, they should say where they are studying, rather than
just saying that they are away from home or &#147;gone
shopping&#148;, or things like that. That would make a big difference
in stamping out illegal diversion of votes, which obviously we all want
to do.</p><p><a name="06103047000072"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0001.htm_spnew289"></a><a name="06103047000134"></a>Baroness

answer that point specifically. The Electoral Commission will be giving
that kind of guidance. I have written myself a note to say that we
should pick the point up with the commission; if I might, I shall do so
and ask it to write to the noble Lord directly to address those
concerns.</p><p><a name="06103047000073"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0001.htm_spnew290"></a><a name="06103047000135"></a>Lord

significant proportion are not verified and the figure is so large that
it might affect the outcome, is any guidance given to him that he
should proceed to count the whole

officers will need no guidance and that it will be obvious that they
must do further things. The new regulations allow a returning officer
to make additional checks on any postal ballots opened at a previous
opening session, where they have not been verified. We have left when
to do that to the discretion of the returning officers, but I have no
doubt that there will be additional supportive guidance from the
Electoral Commission. It is part of the ambition of moving to 100 per
cent as quickly as possible.</p><p><a name="06103047000075"></a>On

Regulations 2006 [<I>35th Report from the Joint
Committee</I>].</p><p><a name="06103047000083"></a>The noble
Baroness said: I commend to the Committee the Non-Domestic Rating
(Chargeable Amounts) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2006 which, if
approved, will be made under Section 57A of the Local Government
Finance Act 1988 as inserted by Section 65 of the Local
GovernmentAct 2003.</p><p><a name="06103047000084"></a>These regulations make one specific
change to the transition scheme for the current non-domestic rating
lists. The transition scheme was brought in as part of last
year&#146;s revaluation of non-domestic rates and is designed to
soften the impact of sudden and dramatic rises in business rates bills
as a result of revaluation. The change is required to give effect to a
High Court decision earlier this year and brings into the transition
scheme a very small group of properties that were not covered by the
original transition scheme.</p><p><a name="06103047000085"></a>This
is a small change to a very technical set of regulations and affects
only a very small number of non-domestic properties. I shall do my best
to explain how the scheme works and how the change affects it. 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I hope that noble Lords will bear with me while I attempt to do so. I
should emphasise up front that, although the change will impact on a
handful of properties only, it is good news for them and they will
stand to benefit
financially.</p><p><a name="06103047000086"></a>Under the original
scheme, which took effect on1 April 2005, properties that had
a rateable value of zero pounds on the last day of the previous ratings
list&#151;in this case, 31 March 2005&#151;were not included in the
transition scheme. These regulations bring those properties into the
scheme. Briefly, the transition scheme works by limiting the amount by
which rate bills can increase or decrease compared with the rate
liability for 2004-05. The scheme lasts four years and the cost of
capping increases to some rate bills&#151;for those in upward
transition, obviously&#151;is funded by capping reductions in other
rate bills: those in downward transition. There have been similar
transition schemes as part of each revaluation since 1990, in 1995 and
2000.</p><p><a name="06103047000087"></a>The caps obviously change
depending on whether relief is being given to a large or small
property; they are different. The arrangement for small properties is
more generous, to reflect the greater burden that rates generally pose
for small businesses compared with larger concerns. For the rating
period that began on1 April 2005, however, all ratepayers will
pay their full rates liability in 2009-10&#151;the final year of the
five-year life of the current rating
lists.</p><p><a name="06103047000088"></a>To qualify for
transitional relief under the original scheme, properties had to have a
rateable value greater than zero on 31 March 2005, the last day of the
old rating list. The rateable value of a property is generally based on
the assumed rent that the property would attract if let on the open
market on a specific date. In some cases, this will be a nil value, but
the property must still be shown on the non-domestic rating
list.</p><p><a name="06103047000089"></a>Because the amount of
rates that a property has to pay is calculated according to its
pre-revaluation liability, any property with a rateable value of zero
pounds at 31 March 2000 would continue with a zero liability for the
four-year life of the 2005 scheme. If you multiply anything by zero, it
comes to zero. The most that ratepayers in this position would have to
pay would be a small contribution each year toward the cost of the
small business rate relief
scheme.</p><p><a name="06103047000090"></a>Previous schemes in 1995
and 2000 had allowed properties valued at zero to be considered for
transitional relief. As the 1995 and 2000 transition schemes lasted for
the full five years of the rating lists, the base liability on the last
day of those lists remained at zero because the liability of the final
day on one list was used to calculate the transition bill for the
following five-year rating period. The effect was that the hereditament
never had a liability and would have continued to pay zero
indefinitely. We obviously wanted to avoid that paradox in the 2005
transition scheme. The major institution caught in this contradiction
was British Waterways.</p><p><a name="06103047000091"></a>By
definition, a transition scheme should smooth changes in rates bills,
not act as a <I>de facto</I> exemption from rates. The transition
scheme for the 2005 revaluation set out in the original regulations 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC15"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>addressed this and tried to ensure that it did not happen by excluding
from the scheme properties that had a rateable value of zero on 31
March 2005 but which had moved to a positive rateable value
on1 April 2005. It treated such properties as analogous to a
property that was entered on to the rating list for the first time on 1
April 2005. In both situations, there was no liability in the 2000 list
but there would be a positive liability in the 2005 list.</p><p><a name="06103047000092"></a>In the case of British Waterways, whereas
from 2000 to 2005 it paid no rates, in 2005 it was liable to pay
&#163;746,925. As I will explain in a moment, another 18
hereditaments also fell into the same category, out of&#151;this is a
very important figure&#151;the 1.7 million hereditaments as a whole.
Removing this tiny category from the scope of the transition scheme
meant that those ratepayers would have to start to pay rates, quite
rightly, but that they would also inevitably not qualify for
transitional relief. This approach meant that ratepayers in this
situation would pay their full rates liability from the first year of
the 2005rating
list.</p><p><a name="06103047000093"></a>The scheme came into
effect from April 2005. Ratepayers were issued with rate demands that
had been calculated either in line with the Local Government Finance
Act 1988 or, where the transition scheme applied, the chargeable
amounts regulations. The British Waterways board challenged this aspect
of the regulations. The High Court found that excluding hereditaments
with a rateable value of zero as at 31 March 2005 from the transition
scheme was unlawful. British Waterways is the only ratepayer on the
central rating list to be affected by the court judgment. At the time
when these regulations were laid before Parliament, the Valuation
Office Agency had identified 13 properties on local rating lists that
fell into the same situation as British Waterways. Since then there
have been further changes to the rating lists. We have now identified
18 properties in a similar position to British Waterways.</p><p><a name="06103047000094"></a>These amending regulations give effect to
the court&#146;s decision by bringing British Waterways and the other
affected ratepayers into the existing transition scheme. The effect is
that, instead of having to pay their full rates liability for each of
the five years&#146; life of the 2005 rating list, these ratepayers
will have a greatly reduced rates bill until the final year of the
scheme, beginning 1 April 2009. It is possible that appeals against the
2000 rating lists that have yet to be decided may result in some
additional properties having their rateable value at 31 March 2005
reduced to zero.</p><p><a name="06103047000095"></a>So what have we
done to make redress? The Secretary of State has refunded the money
paid by British Waterways in respect of the 2005-06 rate liability as
required by the court. Refunds due to the other affected ratepayers on
the local lists will be calculated and paid by the relevant billing
authority when these amending regulations have been approved and come
into effect. We have already alerted local authorities to the impending
changes and will let them know when the revised arrangements come into
effect so that they can reassess liability for the affected properties
and adjust payments accordingly.</p>

Scott of Needham Market:</b> It was definitely a
hot-towel afternoon as I settled down yesterday to read the regulations
and the Explanatory Memorandum. It is a pity that the issue had to go
as far as judicial review before it could be resolved. I have a
question that the noble Baroness may not be able to answer today, but I
would appreciate an answer in writing. Although we believe that only a
relatively small number&#151;around 18&#151;of properties are
involved, the amounts of money are quite large. The cost was estimated
at &#163;3.3 million when there were 13 properties. Where the billing
authority is, for example, a small, rural district council, the rebate
would represent quite a large sum of money. I understand that in the
fullness of time the authorities will get this back through the pooling
arrangements of NDR, but I am interested to know, first, how long that
might take and, secondly, whether there will be a clear mechanism for
identifying that the rebate is exactly what was paid out. Anyone who
has experience of local government finance will know that promises are
often made that certain costs will be covered. However, when
settlements arrive they are so opaque that it is difficult to have a
clear audit trail and be able to see whether a local authority has
received back what it has paid out. Apart from that, I am happy to
support the
regulations.</p><p><a name="06103047000100"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0002.htm_spnew297"></a><a name="06103047000142"></a>Baroness
Andrews:</b> I am very grateful for the support of
both noble Baronesses. I am sorry that the Explanatory Memorandum is a
rather surreal read. On the question of multiplying zero by zero, after
a while one begins to wonder whether one can get something more than
zero. On the point that the noble Baroness made about recouping the
money from the local rating arrangement, the costs will of course fall
on those authorities but they can be recouped from the pool as a whole.
In relation to the whole of the distributable amount, which runs to
&#163;17.5 billion, we are talking about a small sum, even though it
is identified as some &#163;3 million. That in itself is often an
unpredictable amount because there are ebbs and flows. I will write
about the process that we will follow to ensure that those authorities
are not out of pocket. I have a very able team of experts behind me who
will help to do that. I should like to thank noble Lords very
much.</p><p><a name="06103047000101"></a>On Question, Motion agreed

Committee</I>].</p><p><a name="06103047000103"></a>The noble Lord
said: The primary purpose of this order is to enable two parts of UK
immigration legislation to be applied in the juxtaposed control zones
at the ports of Calais, Dunkerque and Boulogne. The first purpose of
the order is to apply Sections 40 and 41 of the Immigration, Asylum and
Nationality Act 2006, which provide a power for the Secretary of State
to authorise certain persons other than immigration officers to search
ships, aircraft, vehicles or other things to ascertain whether there
are individuals whom an immigration officer might wish to examine, to
search such persons for specified reasons, to detain such persons for a
period as short as reasonably necessary up to a maximum of three hours
and to escort them as speedily as reasonably practicable to an
immigration officer. The second purpose of the order is to provide for
the taking and retention of fingerprints under Sections 141 and 143 of
the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.</p><p><a name="06103047000104"></a>This order applies two pieces of English
immigration law to the juxtaposed controls in the northern French ports
of Calais, Dunkerque and Boulogne. As the Committee will know, the
United Kingdom has several international agreements with France to
allow UK authorities to carry out immigration and other controls in
France, and for French authorities to do the same in the UK. Controls
are carried out by UK officers in a defined geographical area and for
specified purposes only. These juxtaposed controls, as they are known,
provide the United Kingdom with an important opportunity to carry out
immigration controls before a person physically enters the UK, and are
essential to our ongoing efforts to secure the border.</p><p><a name="06103047000105"></a>The juxtaposed controls in Calais,
Dunkerqueand Boulogne are provided for at an international
level by the Le Touquet treaty, which was signed on4 February
2003 and given domestic effect by the Nationality, Immigration and
Asylum Act 2002 (Juxtaposed Controls) Order 2003&#151;I will refer to
it as the 2003 order for convenience&#151;which was made under
Section 141 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The
order under debate amends the 2003 order to apply, first, the power to
authorise persons other than immigration officers in Sections 40 and 41
of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 and, secondly, the
power to take and retain fingerprints of certain persons under Sections
141 and 143 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to the juxtaposed
controls.</p><p><a name="06103047000106"></a>I shall deal first
with the power to authorise persons other than immigration officers to
search ships, aircraft, vehicles and so on. Before Sections 40 and 41
of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Act 2006 came into force, only an immigration officer had the power to
search a ship, aircraft, vehicle or other thing for the purpose of
ascertaining whether there were individuals whom an immigration officer
might wish to examine. The 2006 Act provides the Secretary of State
with a power to authorise the police, HM Revenue and Customs officers
or private contractors to carry out these searches. It is important
that these powers apply to the juxtaposed controls at Calais, Dunkerque
and Boulogne, where the UK Immigration Service has a considerable
freight examination operation, and it is intended that private
contractors will be authorised to carry out vehicle searches in order
to free up immigration officers to concentrate on other areas of more
complex work, such as forgery detection, the application of civil
penalty and asylum screening and debriefing, for which they have
undergone considerable training. Those contracted to undertake this
work will be known as authorised search officers&#151;ASOs&#151;and
the legislation demands that they are suitably trained and fit for the
task assigned to them. If they are not, the Secretary of State will not
give authorisation. He can and will revoke any authority should the
contracted party fail to perform effectively and in accordance with the
standard set.</p><p><a name="06103047000107"></a>Careful
consideration has been given to the powers of search and detention that
ASOs will have. Those powers have been limited to the minimum necessary
to enable ASOs to fulfil their function properly. The aim is for ASOs
to find people who are seeking to enter the UK clandestinely, to detain
them for the shortest period necessary&#151;and for not more than
three hours&#151;and to take the person as speedily as is reasonably
practicable to an immigration officer for examination. We expect
delivery to be swift as the contractor will have a cellular vehicle
permanently at his disposal. Checks and balances will be in place to
ensure that the ASOs deploy their powers appropriately and efficiently.
They will be directed and supervised by the UK Immigration Service on
site, and a monitor will be appointed by the Secretary of State to
oversee the operation of those powers and to investigate any complaints
or failings.</p><p><a name="06103047000108"></a>On fingerprinting,
when the immigration controls at the juxtaposed controls were initially
established, no provision was made for the application of Sections 141
and 143 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. At the time, it was
felt that it would not be necessary to take and retain fingerprints, as
all persons refused entry at a UK control zone are handed over to the
French authorities. The management of their movement within the UK was
therefore of no significance, because they would not enter the UK.
However, it has become apparent that there is a real need for the
identification of certain persons and that we should have the same
powers as at UK mainland ports to take
fingerprints.</p><p><a name="06103047000109"></a>The application of
this power in the juxtaposed controls would focus on those persons
detected concealed in vehicles who seek to enter the UK clandestinely
and those trying to use false documentation. Taking their fingerprints
will provide a bank of physical data that can be used to identify
people who have previously attempted to enter the 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>UK unlawfully and who subsequently present themselves at the juxtaposed
controls. Fingerprinting will support an intelligence-led approach to
border security, providing information regarding its efficiency and the
level of displacement between
ports.</p><p><a name="06103047000110"></a>For completeness, I
should add that the contracting out of search provisions and taking and
retention of fingerprint powers will also be applied when appropriate
to the juxtaposed controls in France and Belgium connected with the
Channel Tunnel. When secondary legislation is required to do this, it
has been done under the Channel Tunnel Act 1987, which provides for a
negative procedure. The relevant orders are the Channel Tunnel
(International Arrangements) (Amendment) Order 2006 and the
Channel Tunnel (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment)
Order 2006, which came into effect on 26
October.</p><p><a name="06103047000111"></a>The application of
these measures&#151;the use of contractors and the power to
fingerprint&#151;at juxtaposed controls will increase the security of
the border. They will allow warranted immigration staff to concentrate
on more complex work and ensure that all those intent on circumventing
the controls have physical data recorded for future identification. I
commend the order to the Committee. I beg to

to which the Minister referred, allowed French and UK authorities to
implement juxtaposed controls at specified ports. It enables UK
immigration officials to establish control zones in Calais, Dunkerque
and Boulogne. We recognise the value of those zones, because within
them the UK immigration authorities have the power to exercise
immigration control. Criminal offences and the related powers of arrest
are extended to these zones. That has always seemed to us an
appropriate measure.</p><p><a name="06103056000003"></a>The
controls mean that all UK-bound passengers travelling from these ports
should be subject to checks by UK immigration officers before they
travel, and that passengers should be refused permission to depart for
the UK if they do not have proper paperwork. One should remember that
the policy of 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>juxtaposed controls was an attempt by the Government to strike a series
of deals, at international and EU levels, on asylum and immigration.
Previous measures had included the high-profile closure of the Sangatte
refugee camp, and the agreement underlying that; improved security
around the Channel Tunnel entrances, which is always welcomed;
high-tech vehicle scanning for hidden individuals at ferry ports in
France, Belgium and Holland; and UK immigration controls at Coquelles
and Eurostar stations.</p><p><a name="06103056000004"></a>In August
2005, the UK Immigration Service implemented a measure whereby private
contractors worked alongside and under immigration officers. That was a
potentially controversial measure. The Government tell us in the
Explanatory Memorandum to this order that this has been &#147;very
successful&#148;. I and other Members of the Committee would be
grateful if the Minister could expand a little on that to give a
flavour of the level to which the situation has improved as a result of
that activity.</p><p><a name="06103056000005"></a>The broad effect
of the order would be to extend the regime of juxtaposed controls. The
Minister explained the two ways in which that will happen. The nub of
the matter will always be the fact that suitably qualified persons who
are not police or customs officers can be given the authority to carry
out searches. That was debated earlier this year, in relation to the
2006 Act. We always took the view that we were prepared to accept the
proposals becausethe Government gave assurances&#151;in that
case, the Minister dealing with the matter was the noble Baroness, Lady
Ashton of Upholland&#151;that the private contractors who carried out
the searches would have the appropriate training and be under the
appropriate supervision. We note that the regulations are there to put
that into effect.</p><h5><a name="06103056000036"></a>4.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06103056000006"></a>We have throughout supported
the imposition and extension of juxtaposed controls, but our support is
not open ended. It continues only on the basisthat the
training and supervision of the private contractors should be
satisfactory. We maintain that, despite the changes introduced by the
Government, there are still others that could have a much greater
effect on the security of this country. Recently, the noble Lord, Lord
Carlile of Berriew, with the independent review of terrorism
legislation, produced a report that details the inadequacies of
policing at our ports.</p><p><a name="06103056000007"></a>My
honourable friend Patrick Mercer, who is the shadow Minister for
homeland security in another place, has pointed out that we have been
calling for the Government to address the problem of policing the ports
for many years. There are many practical solutions that the Government
could implement to deal with the problem, such as establishing a
single, dedicated border police force or a single department for
homeland security to co-ordinate our border control efforts. Of course,
we wait with patience to see whether at some time the Government might
acknowledge the wisdom of our proposals on the



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC21"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>matter. In the mean time, with the caveats that I have given about the
proper supervision and training of the people taking part in searches,
we support the
order.</p><p><a name="06103056000008"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0002.htm_spnew300"></a><a name="06103056000039"></a>Lord
Avebury:</b> We, too, are grateful to the Minister
for the careful and detailed explanation that he gave of the provisions
in the order and for giving us the opportunity to continue the
discussion that we had during the passage of the 2006 Act, as the noble
Baroness said, when these proposals proved to be among the most
controversial in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06103056000009"></a>If
there is a great deal of anxiety about the management of the UK-based
detention estate, such as we saw last week, arising from the chief
inspector's report on Yarl's Wood, how much greater is the need for
concern about what happens at the juxtaposed controls on the other side
of the Channel, particularly, as under this order, when private
contractors are being employed to arrest, detain, search and
fingerprint passengers, without either French or British officials
being present? Moreover, as the Independent Race Monitor told the Home
Affairs Committee in another place, the likelihood that a person
seeking to enter the UK will be refused is greater at these overseas
ports than in the UK, which raises questions of the relative fairness
of the procedures in the two
locations.</p><p><a name="06103056000010"></a>We know, for
instance, that biometric identification is an imperfect technique, and
many asylum seekers are refused on the basis of a match between their
fingerprints and ones stored on the Eurodac computer system. It would
be interesting to know how many challenges there are on the grounds of
false matches at the juxtaposed controls and at UK ports of entry
respectively, and, of the challenges, what proportion are successful at
each, as an illustration of the fact that greater difficulties are
bound to arise at the juxtaposed controls than at UK ports of
entry.</p><p><a name="06103056000011"></a>We had some assurances
from the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, when we discussed
these matters on 7 February, as the Explanatory Memorandum recalls, but
it was the combination of the employment of private contractors and the
fact that they would operate under an overseas jurisdiction that raised
our anxieties, not the fact that the contractors themselves would be
foreign. We did not say that the French police would not be capable of
applying criminal records checks to the staff employed by contractors
or that the course material for training staff would be deficient,
although we were naturally anxious to ensure that these matters had
been covered. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, repeated that this
afternoon. The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, undertook to place the
training documents in the Library of the House. Will the Minister tell
us whether that is being done or whether it has already been done, so
that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, says, we can be satisfied
that the training procedures are sufficiently
rigorous?</p><p><a name="06103056000012"></a>We said that the
activities of the contractors who are being given these new powers are
intrinsically less liable to come under public scrutiny and are
therefore 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC22"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more liable to give rise to errors. There are several reasons for that.
First, although a person who claimed that he was wrongfully detained
had a right of access to the chief immigration officer and then to the
monitor, who is a Crown servant appointed under Section 41 of the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act to examine the use made of
thepowers conferred on independent contractors, the
complainant would have been returned to his country of origin before
that process could have led to a result. Will the Minister
say&#151;he touched on this in his speech&#151;who has been
appointed as monitor? I rather think that he said that a monitor had
not yet been appointed, but perhaps he will correct me if I am wrong.
If the monitor has been appointed, when did that person assume office?
What statistics are to be published on the complaints received, and at
what intervals? How were they dealt with in the UK and at the
juxtaposed controls respectively? If the monitor has not yet been
appointed, will the Minister explain the reason for that delay and how
long he expects it to be before the monitor takes up
office?</p><p><a name="06103056000013"></a>Secondly, allegations of
the ill treatment of detainees or of failures in the duty of care in
the UK can be pursued by the Chief Inspector of Prisons and, where
children are involved, by the Children&#146;s Commissioner. Both of
them have access to the juxtaposed controls but, given all their other
duties, they may not get around very often to visiting Calais,
Dunkerque and Boulogne&#151;the three ports to which the order
applies&#151;let alone to the Eurostar stations in France and Belgium
where the power to take fingerprints already applies under other orders
mentioned in the Explanatory Memorandum, although not for private
contractors to arrest, detain and search passengers. So far, the chief
inspector has inspected these facilities only once&#151;she visited
the short-term residential holding facilities at Calais in August 2005.
That, of course, was before the authorised search officers mentioned by
the Minister appeared on the scene. At that time, the longest period
for which anyone was held in the previous year was 17 hours&#151;much
longer than the three hours mentioned in the order&#151;and it would
be useful to have at regular intervals more up-to-date information on
the average and maximum lengths of detention. As the Minister will no
doubt acknowledge, under Article 3(2) of the Le Touquet treaty, which
has been mentioned, the maximum period for which a person can lawfully
be held is 24 hours, unless otherwise authorised by legislation in the
state of arrival. Thirdly, will the Minister say what requirements and
procedures to govern this practice have been laid down under the
article?</p><p><a name="06103056000014"></a>Fourthly,
as the Minister will recall, particular concern was expressed
throughout the proceedings on the Immigration, Asylum and
Nationality Bill about the delegation of responsibility to private
contractors for the power to arrest, detain and search unaccompanied
children. The Children&#146;s Commissioner visited Yarl&#146;s Wood
and said that he was shocked and disappointed by the treatment of
children there. He and Anne Owers have both called for a complete
overhaul of the detention of children. As I have said before, if things
can go wrong under our very noses in this country, how much 



<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC23"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>greater is the risk on the other side of the Channel? Astonishingly, the
Children&#146;s Commissioner was not on the list of those consulted
about the use of private contractors before the order was laid. Will
the Minister explain why Sir Albert was left out, and whether he has
nevertheless expressed an opinion on these proposals? In addition, the
chief inspector recommended independent monitoring of short-term
holding centres, instead of which the Government have introduced
monitoring by an official. Why was the chief inspector&#146;s advice
ignored and a government official appointed instead of an independent
person?</p><p><a name="06103056000015"></a>In the consultation
document issued last April, it was stated that private searching by
ASOs independently of immigration officers was to commence at Calais in
August, after they had worked alongside each other since August 2005.
No mention is made of ASOs at Boulogne and Dunkerque, and ILPA read the
document as extending the use of private contractors only to Calais. It
said there would be questions of <I>vires</I> if the order was applied
more broadly, yet the order seems to relate to any of the control
zones. Is that the correct interpretation, and did the Government put
that to the consultees at any stage? What have they to say about ILPA's
warning on
<I>vires</I>?</p><p><a name="06103056000016"></a>Finally, ILPA
points out that the treaty on which these arrangements are based
provides only that responsible officers of the state of arrival have
the power of arrest and detention in the control zone&#151;and that
means immigration officers. The contracting parties have the power to
modify the treaty by exchange of diplomatic notes under Article 23(2),
but are expressly forbidden to change provisions that require
legislative authority. I am sure that I am not saying anything that
will be new to the Minister, because this was all in the ILPA response
to the consultation.</p><p><a name="06103056000017"></a>The noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, made it clear on Third Reading of
the IAN Bill on14 March that the Government were not
delegating responsibility for these matters, which remained in the
hands of the UK immigration authority. It is difficult to see how the
power to arrest, search and detain a passenger can lawfully be
exercised by someone who is not a responsible officer within the
meaning of the treaty, and if any explanation was given to ILPA we hope
that a copy will be placed in the Library of the House, and a brief
summary given by the Minister in winding up this
debate.</p><p><a name="06103056000018"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0002.htm_spnew301"></a><a name="06103056000040"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> I have a couple more questions to add
to those of my noble friend Lord Avebury. First, immigration officers
now hold powers akin to those of police officers and are very much part
of the process that comes under the Independent Police Complaints
Commission when complaints are raised. I refer to the power to arrest,
detain, search and so on. Could complaints in the control zones abroad
now be investigated by the IPCC? Does the IPCC have power to operate in
countries abroad and call for witnesses over there?</p>

authorised search officers. Here there is an interesting situation
whereby the immigration officers can be dealt with by the IPCC. Could
the Minister explain about the accountability of those officers and
whether the IPCC has powers to investigate complaints against the
authorised search officers? It would be very helpful to know whether
they fall within the ambit of the complaints
commission.</p><p><a name="06103056000020"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew302"></a><a name="06103056000041"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to the noble
Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her comments, and to the two noble Lords
from the Liberal Democrat Benches, who have a long history of
persistently ensuring that we are held to proper account on a delicate
area of implementation.</p><p><a name="06103056000021"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, asked about successes. We think that the
way in which the service operates has been very successful. As the
noble Baroness probably knows, the contracts are run by Eamus Cork
Security&#151;ECS&#151;which has worked with the UK Immigration
Service for a number of years, initially at Dunkerque and, since August
last year, in Calais. The firm works to assist UK immigration officers
with a freight-searching operation at berth side. In the past 10
months, the firm has intercepted some 1,200 clandestines and recently
was successful in bidding for the contract to work with the UK
Immigration Service in Calais as escorting officers, transporting
persons detected concealed in vehicles to an immigration officer at a
holding facility in the port. That contract contains an extension that
provides for the work of ASOs, which will become effective only if this
secondary legislation is
approved.</p><h5><a name="06103056000037"></a>5

Avebury:</b> I was wondering how the figure that the
noble Lord has given can be said to result from the use of ASOs,
bearing in mind that, if they had not been there, identical searches
would have been conducted by immigration officers, who presumably would
have found those 1,200 people as well. There is not a control group
with which you can compare the statistics that have been achieved by
ASOs, is
there?</p><p><a name="06103056000023"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew304"></a><a name="06103056000043"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> It is obviously the case, as
I said earlier, that having those contractors there means that
immigration officers can concentrate on more rigorous and demanding
work. In a sense, the ASOs offer and provide activity that is more in
support of the way in which immigration staff work. Of course, the
noble Lord is absolutely right in the sense that, if ASOs were not
there, we would have to deploy immigration officers. It is a question
of having the appropriate level of qualification among staff to carry
out particular work.</p><p><a name="06103056000024"></a>The
personnel who are deployed will have already been subject to rigorous
security screening in the UK and France. They will also have undergone
extensive training with Centrex, the central police training authority.
When it comes to efficiency, they have demonstrated their track record
at the port of Dunkerque where, since January 2004, they have 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intercepted over 3,600 clandestines on behalf of the port authorities
and prevented their entry into the
UK.</p><p><a name="06103056000025"></a>Non-British companies
already undertake a freight-searching role for ferry companies and port
operators outside the UK and have demonstrated themselves to be highly
effective. The performance of the contractors will be scrutinised on a
daily basis by the Immigration Service, which will examine any
suggestion of underperformance or substandard behaviour. ECS personnel
will also come under the scrutiny of the monitor, to which the noble
Lord, Lord Avebury,
referred.</p><p><a name="06103056000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Avebury, asked a number of questions and, as best I can, I will respond
to them today. If I cannot do so, I hope that the noble Lord will be
satisfied by a written response, which I would be more than happy to
share with other Members of the Committee. A copy of the training
material that is used by ASOs will be put into the public domain, and I
am more than happy to ensure that the noble Lord is fully advised on
that. He asked about false matches on Eurodac. I find it hard to
provide the noble Lord with that information this afternoon, but I
undertake to prepare a written response for him as best we can. The
database regulations provide a useful structure for ensuring that
asylum seekers who are processed elsewhere will have been properly
processed. We will ensure that we spell out more of the detail on
that.</p><p><a name="06103056000027"></a>I do not think that the
noble Lord is right in what he said about complainants; they would not
have been returned to their country of origin. It is likely that they
would be refused entry to the United Kingdom, and we would ensure at
that point that they were handed to the French authorities to be
processed.</p><p><a name="06103056000028"></a>The noble Lord asked
me to name the monitor today, but I am not in a position to do that. I
can tell the noble Lord that we are at an advanced stage of talks with
a Crown servant, and we are confident that we will be able to appoint
someone in the very near future. As soon as an agreement is reached, we
will, properly, announce the name of the person who has been
appointed.</p><p><a name="06103056000029"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew305"></a><a name="06103056000044"></a>Lord

the reply given by the chief immigration officer, to whom does he go?
We were told that his route of complaint would be, first, to the chief
immigration officer and then, if he was not satisfied with that, to the
monitor. If no monitor has been appointed, to whom does he go when he
is not satisfied in the first instance?</p><p><a name="06103056000030"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew306"></a><a name="06103056000045"></a>Lord

complaint will be processed and forwarded to the monitor. But, of
course, that process will not kick in until the monitor is appointed. I
will ensure that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is given more
information on how the monitor works so that he can be fully satisfied
on that point. The noble Lord also asked what requirements have been
laid down under Article 3(2) of the Le Touquet agreement. Perhaps I
misunderstood, but the maximum period for which an ASO can detain a
person is three hours. I cannot

than happy to provide the noble Lord with more detail, should he wish
it. Perhaps he will flesh out his question so that we can provide a
fuller response.</p><p><a name="06103056000031"></a>The noble Lord
also asked about the detention of children, on which he made a number
of points. We have offered to facilitate a meeting between the noble
Lord and the Children&#146;s Commissioner, Al Aynsley-Green. I am not
aware that that meeting has taken place, but the offer still stands.
Children detected are taken immediately to an immigration officer. If
the minor does not qualify for entry to the United Kingdom, he or she
is handed to the French authorities and is dealt with under its
domestic law. The French have well established procedures for the
welfare of unaccompanied
children.</p><p><a name="06103056000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Avebury, also asked about ILPA and the question of <I>vires</I>. We
will respond to ILPA&#146;s very long and generally helpful comments.
We are satisfied that we are acting within our <I>vires</I> and that
ILPA&#146;s comments, while useful, are not an issue. Again, I would
be happy to share our response with the noble Lord if ILPA is content
with that. For the avoidance of doubt, I can confirm that this order
relates to the ports at Calais, Dunkerque and Boulogne.</p><p><a name="06103056000033"></a>I will undertake to write to the noble
Lord, Lord Dholakia, in detail in response to his question on the IPCC,
but it is my understanding that the IPCC will not oversee the
juxtaposed controls. I shall of course need to ask my officials to
ensure that that is the case.
</p><p><a name="06103056000034"></a>That answers most of the main
points but, as I said earlier, I would be more than happy to flesh out

noble Lord said: The purpose of the order is to reclassify the
substance methylamphetamine from a class B drug to a class A drug under
the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. As is required by the Act, the Advisory
Council on the Misuse of Drugs has been consulted and agrees with the
proposal. Methylamphetamine has been controlled as a class B drug under
Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act from the outset of that legislation. It also
has recognised medicinal benefits when in the form of a medicinal
product&#151;including treatment of attention deficitand
hyperkinetic disorder&#151;and consequently is categorised as a
Schedule 2 drug under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, so that doctors
can prescribe it where necessary.</p>

has been very low in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, there are sound
reasons for this proposal to reclassify the drug to class A. Relative
harmfulness is central to our drug classification system. Our drugs
laws should accurately reflect the relative harmfulness of drugs, when
they are misused, both to the individual and to society at
large.</p><p><a name="06103085000007"></a>The Committee will know
that the drug classification system under the Misuse of Drugs Act has
come under very close scrutiny recently. The Government believe that
the current three-tier system is fit for its fundamental purpose of
providing a framework within which criminal penalties are set with
reference to the harm caused by a drug and the type of illegal activity
undertaken in regard to that
drug.</p><p><a name="06103085000008"></a>The system allows for
clear and meaningful distinctions to be made between drugs. There is a
wide understanding that class A drugs are the most dangerous substances
and therefore carry the heaviest criminal penalties, while class C
drugs, although still harmful, are not of the same order. It is this
coherent system which has stood the test of time and which, for so long
as it remains, we now propose to reapply to methylamphetamine. The
action that we are taking to reclassify methylamphetamine is a good
example of a fully functioning system where we are revisiting a
drug&#146;s classification in light of new
evidence.</p><p><a name="06103085000009"></a>In the case of
methylamphetamine, we have to decide how to respond to a drug that can
be misused and can cause serious social problems, but has no
significant prevalence in the United Kingdom at present. It is this
potential for harm rather than methylamphetamine&#146;s current
prevalence here that is central to the proposal to reclassify the drug
toclass
A.</p><p><a name="06103085000010"></a>Methylamphetamine&#146;s
harmfulness equates to that of other class A substances, both at the
level of the individual and of society more widely. It is a derivative
of amphetamine, which is a class B drug, but it is much more potent
than other forms of the drug, with the potential for greater physical
and psychological harm. It can quickly become highly addictive. Its
reclassification to a class A drug will accurately reflect this
relative
harmfulness.</p><p><a name="06103085000011"></a>International
experience documents the devastating impact of widespread misuse of
methylamphetamine on society and the environment. Its use can increase
risky sexual behaviour, thereby increasing the risk of blood-borne
virus transmission; and it is a risk factor for aggression and
violence, as well as acquisitive crime. Also, methylamphetamine
manufacture exposes individuals and the environment to flammable and
hazardous chemicals and production methods and to toxic waste
by-products.</p><p><a name="06103085000012"></a>In its report
published in November 2005, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs
considered that, based on the then current situation in the United
Kingdom, it would be inappropriate to reclassify methylamphetamine as a
class A drug. Instead, the council recommended the development of an

council&#146;s report is accessible from the Home Office
website.</p><p><a name="06103085000013"></a>In May this year, the
council reviewed its decision in the light of further evidence and
recommended that methylamphetamine be reclassified as a class A drug.
Again, the council&#146;s advice is available on the Home Office
website. The prevalence of the drug in the United Kingdom continued to
remain low, but the council was persuaded by the harmfulness of
methylamphetamine and the international experience of the serious
social problems caused by methylamphetamine misuse, as well as by
intelligence provided by the Association of Chief Police Officers,
which fully supports the reclassification of methylamphetamine to class
A.</p><p><a name="06103085000014"></a>If the order is approved by
both Housesand is signed in Privy Council when it meets
on14 December, it will come into force five weeks after it has
been made to allow sufficient time to advise the police, the courts and
other interested bodies that methylamphetamine will be the subject of
control as a class A drug. That would result in a commencement date of
18 January
2007.</p><p><a name="06103085000015"></a>The
maximum penalty for unauthorised production, importation and supply of
methylamphetamine as a class A drug will be life imprisonment and/or a
fine. The maximum sentence for the offence of possession of
methylamphetamine will be seven years&#146; imprisonment and/or a
fine.</p><p><a name="06103085000016"></a>Reclassification to a
class A drug will be a key element in the prevention of a significant
escalation in the illicit use of methylamphetamine and the social
problems that it could cause. It will provide a platform for greater
enforcement activity, enabling the police to close premises where
methylamphetamine drugs are being used, sold or manufactured, as they
currently do with &#147;crack houses&#148;, under the Anti-social
Behaviour Act 2003. This police power of closure is for class A drugs
only. In particular, as a class A drug, methylamphetamine will be an
explicit priority for the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which will
direct its resources and enforcement activities accordingly. We are
also implementing key recommendations of the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs&#146; report around an early warning system to
monitor
prevalence.</p><p><a name="06103085000017"></a>Methylamphetamine&#146;s
main precursor chemicals&#151;ephedrine and
pseudoephedrine&#151;are already listed as controlled precursors
under European legislation, and we have now reached agreement on
placing red phosphorus on the EU voluntary monitoring list that checks
for suspicious transactions in chemicals. We are exploring ways to take
a more robust response, but it must be remembered that these substances
also have legitimate industrial uses, so it not simply a case of
halting their supply. We are also taking steps to ensure that national
survey data differentiate between methylamphetamine and amphetamines,
which will assist in our monitoring of
prevalence.</p><p><a name="06103085000018"></a>The Government will

people.</p><p><a name="06103085000019"></a>This measure is very
much in line with the Government&#146;s commitment to cause maximum
disruption to drug markets and thus protect young people from the harms
of being exposed to dangerous drugs. For those reasons, I commend the
proposed change. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06103085000020"></a>Moved, That the Grand
Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2006 [<I>35th Report from the Joint
Committee</I>].&#151;(<I>Lord Bassam of
Brighton</I>.)</p><h5><a name="06103085000184"></a>5.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06103085000021"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew308"></a><a name="06103085000196"></a>Baroness
Anelay of St Johns:</b> I support the order, which
reclassifies methylamphetamine as a class A drug instead of the lower
class B. It seems to us to be an appropriate measure, given the growing
concern about the effect of the misuse of the drug, particularly in its
crystalline form. The Minister was right to point out that there is an
appropriate use of the drug for medicinal purposes under carefully
controlled circumstances. The other part of the process is that
precursors may be involved that have industrial uses. There may well be
proper use of either component parts, precursors or the drug
itself.</p><p><a name="06103085000022"></a>Like other
amphetamines, methylamphetamine is a drug that affects the brain reward
pathways, and its use can lead to the need to take more to achieve the
same effects. It can lead to both psychological and physical
dependence. Using the drug by intravenous injecting or by smoking is
particularly liable to lead to such an addiction. I understand that
smoking the purer crystalline form, also known as &#147;crystal
meth&#148; or &#147;ice&#148;, produces a very intense rush,
similar to that produced by crack cocaine but longer lasting, for
between four and 12 hours. It is highly reinforcing and can quickly
become addictive. The greater potency of the &#147;ice&#148; form,
particularly when smoked, makes it a greater threat than other forms of
methylamphetamine.</p><p><a name="06103085000023"></a>Methylamphetamine-induced psychosis has
been widely reported in other countries where misuse is almost
epidemic, so it is absolutely right that the Government should bring
forward the order as a preventive measure at this stage. That in itself
produces one or two difficulties for proper control. As crystal meth is
considered to be more potent and harmful than speed and other class B
drugs, it is appropriate to reclassify it as class A. As the Minister
said, the penalty will change. Maximum imprisonment for possession will
be seven years instead of five, and for supply it will be life
imprisonment instead of the current 14 years.</p><p><a name="06103085000024"></a>The main issue then must be how the
Government take steps to ensure that the change is known about by those
who might be sucked into the process of taking the drugs or who are
already doing so. The Minister said that there will be an input into
future educational material. How soon will that information be in
schools? I am trying to avoid the use of the phrase &#147;come on
stream&#148;. Obviously, while there is not an epidemic of misuse
here now, one wants to 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make sure that proper signals and deterrents are given out very rapidly.
Will the Minister give us a bit more of an idea of what steps the
Government will take to do that? Above all, it remains important that
treatment, advice and support are available for those who want to avoid
taking illegal drugs or to cease taking them. We support the
order.</p><p><a name="06103085000025"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew309"></a><a name="06103085000197"></a>Lord
Dholakia:</b> I support much of what the noble
Baroness, Lady Anelay, has said. We have no doubt on the basis of
scientific and other evidence that methylamphetamine can, if misused,
cause serious harm. However, there is a disagreement between the
Minister&#146;s remarks on classification and our position on it. We
support the reclassification of this particular drug, but one has to
bear in mind the fact that we are stuck at present with the A, B, C
system of classification. Often there have been confused signals coming
from the Home Office and the
police.</p><p><a name="06103085000026"></a>I cite the
recommendations and comments in the Commons Science and Technology
Committee report from 18 July, <I>Drug classification: making a hash of
it?</I> The report
said:</p><ul><a name="06103085000170"></a>&#147;With respect to
the ABC classification system, we have identified significant anomalies
in the classification of individual drugs and a regrettable lack of
consistency in the rationale used to make classification decisions. In
addition, we have expressed concern at the Government&#146;s
proclivity for using the classification system as a means of
&#145;sending out signals&#146; to potential users and society at
large&#151;it is at odds with the stated objective of classifying
drugs on the basis of harm and the Government has not made any attempt
to develop an evidence base on which to draw in determining the
&#145;signal&#146; being sent
out&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06103085000027"></a>For this reason,
it would be very helpful if the Minister could once again look at
whether the classification system is
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06103085000028"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew310"></a><a name="06103085000198"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to the noble
Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her support and to the noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia, for his. I am grateful, too, for the terms in which the noble
Baroness in particular expressed her support. Clearly, there is an
understanding across the political divide of the importance of
reclassification in terms of the activity that it would unlock for
enforcement purposes. It would enable the police, for instance, to
ensure that they are well placed to stifle any emerging threat from the
drug. It would enable them to attack crack houses much more precisely
and enable us to ensure that there is much more knowledge about the
damage that methylamphetamine can
do.</p><p><a name="06103085000029"></a>The noble Baroness asked
about educational work and information. As soon as we have approved the
orders, the Talk to Frank website will immediately have information
posted on it. As I understand it, we are also preparing educational
materials to distribute. These must obviously be targeted at the
younger generation, which is most likely to be where the problem will
be experienced. We are ensuring that materials are distributed widely,
particularly to schools; I understand that the Talk to Frank campaign
has already produced two information leaflets that will provide more
details of the impact of methylamphetamine, both in its powder form and
in 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC31"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its crystal form. It is also the case that the reclassification debate
has itself resulted in significant media coverage about the dangers of
the drug. We need to work more on that. Material will be provided for
schools, and those doing particular information campaigns will support
us in that effort. We will, of course, ensure that the agencies of law
and order properly understand the impact of
reclassification.</p><p><a name="06103085000030"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Dholakia, asked about classification. The best that I can
say is that in classification we try to ensure that a mix of medical
and social harms is understood in the reports that are prepared. We
integrate that into the way in which the classification system works
through the advice that we receive from the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs. Obviously, at all times there will be
debateand disagreement about the appropriateness of the
classification of some individual drugs, but it isthe
Government&#146;s clear view and the clear position of the advisory
council that the classification system is evidence-based.</p><p><a name="06103085000031"></a>I contend ultimately that the
classification system works well, is effective and provides a readily
understandable framework on which the harms of substances can be
indicated and on which appropriate criminal sanctions for possession
and supply of particular substances can be based. In those terms, there
will be common agreement that it serves a useful purpose. However, it
is only one part of the Government&#146;s wider drugs strategy. The
advice that we have from practitioners in the field&#151;and I agree
with it&#151;is that a review of the classification system at this
time would add very little value to the work that those practitioners
undertake and could in some ways operate as a distraction. Their focus
must be on tackling the problems caused by drugs; improving the quality
of information; ensuring that we crack down on dealers; and making sure
that those who come into contact with law enforcement also get access
to treatment, because in the end that is the best solution. It is about
getting people out of drug-abusing habits and ensuring that they get
the appropriate medical and social
support.</p><p><a name="06103085000032"></a>On Question, Motion

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>acquisitions. I am advised by The Art Fund and leading museum directors
that, in real terms, the public funding devoted to acquisitions in
2004-05, including lottery funding, was worth only 13 per cent of that
available in 1980-81. The Tate&#146;s budget for acquisitions is
smaller now in cash terms than it was 20 years ago. The V&amp;A now has
&#163;200,000 per year for collecting, whereas its purchase grant in
1992 was &#163;1.78
million.</p><p><a name="06103085000037"></a>The Art Fund tells us
that 70 per cent of the 1,800 registered museums now acquire objects
mainly or solely by gift&#151;they are passively acquiring rather
than actively collecting&#151;and 60 per cent allocate no funds at
all for adding to their collections. Time does not permit me to recite
the sad litany of pre-eminent items that have been sold into private
hands or abroad&#151;the ones that got away&#151;nor will I recite
the notable successes in acquisition; the facts are well known to your
Lordships. I will just say that, in case after case of success, The Art
Fund&#151;a private charity&#151;has contributed funds, including
for the purchase of contemporary items. The Art Fund is to our cultural
life as the RNLI is to our maritime
life.</p><p><a name="06103085000038"></a>Why is it so important
that our museums and galleries should continue to collect? There are
four reasons. The entry of a new item into a collection is like a shot
of adrenalin: it stimulates, excites and energises. Curators who
collect look with fresheyes and imagination; collecting
prompts new interpretation. Public collections reflect our senses of
local and national identity and contribute to developing them. They
recall to us our history and heritage and they should express the
changing nature of our society and the mix of cultural influences,
whereby it is renewed.</p><p><a name="06103085000039"></a>We should
be as intensely concerned to promote social cohesion through cultural
policy as we are through educational policy. We are one of the
world&#146;s leading creative economies. If we are to remain so,
students of art and design, and consumers, need to see examples of the
best that is being created in Britain and across the world. We desire
still to conduct ourselves as a beneficent force in the world. Museum
collections that hold a mirror up to the world will help us to
understand with due sensitivity the world with which we
engage.</p><p><a name="06103085000040"></a>What is to be done? What
should the policy be? I suggest that there are three separate although
interrelated issues: regional collecting, the active collecting of
contemporary art and the important heritage
items.</p><p><a name="06103085000041"></a>In relation to the
current inability of so many local museums to collect, the Heritage
Lottery Fund has just now come forward with an important contribution:
a new fund of &#163;3 million dedicated to supporting acquisitions.
Some of the money is to be used for training to develop among museum
staff the skills to collect, and the Museums, Libraries and Archives
Council will also contribute assistance with this
training.</p><p><a name="06103085000042"></a>This initiative
demonstrates the continuing and thoughtful commitment of the Heritage
Lottery Fund, amid all the other pressures and expectations placed on
it, to support for acquisitions. The 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>limitation inherent in the HLF&#146;s terms of reference is that the
fund can only be used to acquire items at least 10 years old. I would
therefore propose that the Arts Council lottery fund should step in
with an equivalent new scheme. It could indeed revive the excellent
scheme that it ran jointly with the Contemporary Art Society.</p><p><a name="06103085000043"></a>I should like to ask the Government to
take the opportunity of the legislation stemming from the new White
Paper on local government to create a statutory duty on local
authorities to support their museums and galleries and, indeed, the
arts and heritage more broadly. As we have seen with libraries, a
statutory duty alone does not do the trick, so I would also ask the
Government to introduce a cultural component to the revenue support
grant system. Without this, it is hard to foresee that the funding will
ever be in place to support the proper formation of curatorial staffs
with the skills and the margin to develop local
collections.</p><p><a name="06103085000044"></a>There is then the
question of how our major regional and national museums are to be able
to acquire items that would significantly enhance their collections.
These include the items that the reviewing committee judges meet the
Waverley criteria. They also include important contemporary or near
contemporary items which it is part of the formal remit of some
museums&#151;the Science Museum, the V&amp;A and the Tate&#151;to
collect.</p><p><a name="06103085000045"></a>The largest single
source of funding for museum acquisitions is the Government&#146;s
acceptance in lieu scheme&#151;one among a number of important tax
concessions that the Government make available. In the year to March
2006, 38 items with a value of &#163;25.2 million were accepted for
the nation in lieu of inheritance tax. In consequence, a great variety
of beautiful things went to a great diversity of places. There is one
enhancement of the AIL scheme which I particularly hope the Treasury
will be willing to consider. Recommendation 27 of the Goodison review
is that owners of pre-eminent objects should be able to submit them
during their lifetime for acceptance in lieu against tax on their
future estate, and that the objects could remain with their ex-owners
by agreement with the museum into whose ownership they
pass.</p><p><a name="06103085000046"></a>The other new tax relief I
would request&#151;and I sought this when I was Minister&#151;is
Goodison&#146;s recommendation 34: that donors should be allowed to
offset the gross value of pre-eminent works of art against income tax,
as is the case in the United States, Canada, Ireland and Australia. The
Labour Party&#146;s manifesto committed the Government to find new
ways to encourage philanthropy in the cultural field, so I am
hopeful.</p><p><a name="06103085000047"></a>Assisted by these
reforms, museums and galleries would be able to step up yet further
their own fundraising. It is perhaps not yet axiomatic on this side of
the Atlantic that trustees have a duty to bring in substantial funds.
When Ministers appoint trustees, they will of course continue to look
for a spread of skills, but among trustees surely there should be some
whose main job is, frankly, to fundraise. It would cost the Government
nothing to be quickly forthcoming in 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their recognition, through the honours system, of benefactors of our
public collections.</p><p><a name="06103085000048"></a>I will not
call upon the Government in present circumstances to increase grant in
aid. As the Minister for the Arts noted with legitimate pride in the
Commons debate on 11 October, spending by DCMS on its sponsored museums
and galleries has increased in real terms by 16 per cent since 1997. I
confine myself to imploring the Government not actually to cut their
grant funding to museums and galleries. We are given to understand that
bodies funded by DCMS are being advised to plan for 7 per cent cuts.
Given the general good health of the economy, given that the culture
budget of the DCMS is so tiny within the totality of public
expenditure, given the havoc that would be caused by 7 per cent cuts
and the uproar that would follow, I hope that the Treasury will spare
these budgets.</p><p><a name="06103085000049"></a>The only request
for an uplift in central government spending that I would make is that,
over the planning period, the Chancellor should go further in
replenishing the National Heritage Memorial Fund. Following the
establishment of the National Lottery, even though the Government had
promised that lottery funding would be additional to public
expenditure, grant in aid to the NHMF was cut from &#163;12 million
in 1993 to &#163;2 million in 1998. The Government have already done
much to make amends. Grant in aid has been increased to &#163;5
million and the Chancellor has promised to increase it again to
&#163;10 million next year. If he would set us on a clear path to
raise it to &#163;20 million, that, together with other resources,
would enable our public collections to secure the acquisition of a good
proportion of the pre-eminent objects that come on the market. To
replenish the NHMF would be seemly. This memorial fund was created to
honour the memory of those who have died for their country. That should
include those who have lost their lives in hostilities in Iraq and
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06103085000050"></a>The one component
of the overall problem that would remain would be that very small
number of supreme works of art that from time to time are put up for
sale and where there are compelling reasons to ensure they are secured
for one of our public collections. A case in point at the moment is the
Halifax Titian, &#147;Portrait of a Man&#148;. This picture may
fetch &#163;80 million, and the National Gallery has concluded that
it cannot make an offer for
it.</p><p><a name="06103085000051"></a>I would like to propose that
a modern version of the Paramount List should be drawn up, with a
similar agreement to that which the Treasury first made in 1922. In
1922 the chairman of the trustees of the National Gallery, Lord
Lansdowne, wrote to the Treasury to say that the
trustees,</p><ul><a name="06103085000177"></a>&#147;feel very
strongly that a certain limited number of works of art, less than a
dozen in all, at present in private possession in England, are of such
international importance, that they deserve special and separate
provision to be made for their retention here...The prices at
present paid for such works may appear large to the unthinking, but
viewed from the standpoint of History and of National repute they are
infinitesimal...their retention, for the Nation which possesses
them is not only a duty but an economy. Their retention is also a
thoroughly democratic 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC35"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>measure. Our Galleries and Museums, apart from their international
significance, exist for the poorer members of the community...the
Trustees...do now definitely ask the Treasury to guarantee them
direct financial assistance if and when any of the few works of vital
importance come upon the market, so that they may be preserved for the
Nation. The total sum required would be infinitesimal compared with
those with which the Lords Commissioners have habitually to
deal...Also the payment of this amount would presumably be spread
over a good many
years&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06103085000052"></a>The Treasury
considered the case and concluded that, if the sums in question
represented the reasonable value of the pictures, this was a proper
thing to do. The Chancellor, Sir Robert Horne, announced the
Government&#146;s commitment to support, at uncertain dates in the
future, the retention in the United Kingdom of the pictures on the
list.</p><p><a name="06103085000053"></a>The agreement held. In
1924, Ramsay MacDonald wrote to the chairman to say that the new
government would &#147;readily&#148; renew the undertaking. Four
out of the seven items on the original list were in due course acquired
by the National Gallery. Another on the list, that did not pass into
National Gallery ownership but instead came to the National Gallery on
long-term loan was the Halifax Titian, now removed from the National
Gallery&#146;s walls to be put up for
sale.</p><p><a name="06103085000054"></a>As late as 1972, a special
Exchequer grant was given to enable the National Gallery to purchase
one of the pictures on the original Paramount List, Titian&#146;s
&#147;The Death of Actaeon&#148;. The history of Exchequer grants
goes back to the earliest years of the National Gallery. Since the
creation of the NHMF in 1980, however, the Government&#146;s line has
been that Exchequer grants would no longer be necessary. This has not
been the view of the Scottish Executive, which in recent years has
provided grants to make possible the purchase by Scottish institutions
of a Botticelli, a Titian and the John Murray Archive. While a
replenished NHMF would indeed obviate the need for an Exchequer grant
in all but a few cases, a special grant is needed if we are to restore
such an item as the Halifax Titian to the walls of the National
Gallery. The cost of a picture of this importance is simply beyond the
scope of the NHMF, the HLF and all the efforts of which the system is
ordinarily capable. However, a sum even of &#163;80 million is, I
submit, affordable. Such a figure is within the margin of error of
national accounting. We are the world&#146;s fifth largest
economy.</p><p><a name="06103085000055"></a>A modern list of,
perhaps, 12 or 15 paramount items in all cultural fields should be
drawn up by those best qualified to judge what they should be;
realistic valuations, though difficult to determine in the nature of
the case, should be made; this Government and Parliament, like their
predecessors, should commit themselves to supply these funds as
occasion in due course
demands.</p><p><a name="06103085000056"></a>I believe we need to do
these things to secure the continuing vitality of our museums and
galleries, for our national self-respect and to present ourselves
confidently to the world. I would hope that all parties could agree on

Lee of Trafford:</b> I congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Howarth, on securing this debate. In my brief contribution, I
first declare an interest as chairman of the Association of Leading
Visitor Attractions. To become a member, one needs to obtain a million
visitors a year. I have been chairman since 1990. Today we have 40
members, 16 of which are major galleries and
museums.</p><p><a name="06103085000058"></a>As the noble Lord said,
there is clearly a major problem with a substantially increasing number
of wealthy national and international collectors and the downward
pressure on budgets, to which the noble Lord referred. He gave some
national examples. I should add that the National Portrait Gallery can
now put aside for acquisitions only about &#163;305,000 out of a
turnover of &#163;11 million. The Imperial War Museum can allocate
only &#163;125,000 annually to acquisitions, which may be less than
the value of a single set of medals at
auction.</p><p><a name="06103085000059"></a>I wish particularly to
draw attention to the position of regional museums. Clearly, they have
problems as there are far fewer private major charitable foundations in
the regions and relatively few major plcs and national bodies have
their headquarters there. Tyne and Wear museums tried to buy
Turner&#146;s &#147;Dark Rigi&#148; painting, which had been
hanging in the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, but in the end it went for
&#163;2.7 million at auction, which was way outside its resources.
National Museums Liverpool saw its annual acquisitions budget fall to
&#163;50,000 by 2001. It managed to lift it back to a quarter of a
million pounds last year but fears that the budgetary cuts being mooted
by the Treasury during the coming CSR round&#151;as referred to by
the noble Lord&#151;will impinge on even that small
figure.</p><p><a name="06103085000060"></a>Finally, the Museum of
Science and Industry in Manchester, which I had the privilege to chair
for nine years, has only the fund for the Preservation of Industrial
and Scientific Material (PRISM), administered by the Museums, Libraries
and Archives Council, to call on, which itself has very limited surplus
funds to provide for new acquisitions. The museum is finding it
increasingly difficult to add to its collection. An item of local
importance, a Model T Ford made in Trafford Park, has come up for sale
and the museum needs to find only &#163;15,000 to &#163;30,000 to
buy it, but it is experiencing real problems in doing so. Those
problems are being experienced regionally and nationally. I fully
support the points that the noble Lord
made.</p><h5><a name="06103085000187"></a>5.54

my interests as director of the Clore Leadership Programme and chairman

served with great distinction as Minister for the Arts when I was

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103085000062"></a>He has highlighted, rightly, the serious
difficulty that museums and galleries throughout the country have in
being able to have any sort of acquisition policy. That is obviously of
particular relevance to those collectors of modern and contemporary
art, who, in order to maintain the contemporary nature of their
collections, have to be able to continue to refresh them. It is also
important for those museums and galleries that remain the great
storehouses of the past. These are the places where our identity as a
nation and as community is kept, stored and made available for
understanding and cherishing by all of us. When particularly important
works of art or objects become available, it is important that these
museums and galleries can add to their
collections.</p><p><a name="06103085000063"></a>A number of helpful
developments have taken place over the course of the past eight or nine
years. The changes that we were able to make in the acceptance in lieu
procedures in 1998 have transformed the way in which acceptance in lieu
has been able to be used. The Heritage Lottery Fund has done sterling
work over the years in assisting museums and galleries with
acquisitions. The Art Fund continues to play an absolutely invaluable
role. But there is a need to look at how we can solve this very real
problem for museums and galleries&#151;and my noble friend identified
a number of them.</p><p><a name="06103085000064"></a>I particularly
draw attention to the proposal that acceptance in lieu could be brought
forward so that it could be triggered while the owner of a work is
still alive, rather than simply being able to be prayed in aid when
they have died. That would make a very real difference. It is a
proposal that a number of us have made to the Exchequer in the past
couple of years in relation to papers and manuscripts of contemporary
writers. Exactly the same principle applies to the works of art that
are held by collectors.</p><p><a name="06103085000065"></a>On the
subject of manuscripts and papers of our living writers, which are
important items for many of our major collections, one very small
change could make a huge difference. At the moment, VAT is not paid by
an acquiring institution if a manuscript or collection of manuscripts
is in bound form; it classifies itself as a book and is therefore free
of VAT. If it is in unbound form and the papers are loose, VAT has to
be paid on them. That is an absurdity, which could easily be solved at
a stroke by the Chancellor.</p><p><a name="06103085000066"></a>All
this has also to be seen in the context of the overall funding for
museums, galleries and the arts in general. My noble friend rightly
identified the anxiety across the whole field of the arts, culture and
museums and galleries about the forthcoming spending review. If one
looks at what this Government have achieved on arts, culture and
museums over the course of the past nine and a half years, one finds
that the record is outstanding. The increases in investment made
available, the opening up of free admission, the rejuvenation of large
parts of the cultural life of this country constitutes a huge success
story. It has been driven by substantial investment by the Exchequer
into this part of the Government&#146;s purview. It would be a
tragedy if all of that were now to come to a juddering halt. If we are
facing either cash standstills in funding or, even 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>worse, percentage cuts in funding for the arts, culture and museums in
this country at the next spending review, not only will our cultural
life be impoverished but the Government&#146;s proud record of what
has been achieved will be severely diminished. I do not want to see
that happen.</p><p><a name="06103085000067"></a>None of us are
asking for the moon. All we need from the Chancellor is current funding
plus an element of inflation. If we were able to achieve that, our
museums, galleries and performing arts could all continue to flourish.
I hope that the message will go out loud and clear to the Chancellor
that that is important. Within that, it will be important for museums
and galleries to be able to maintain, refresh and develop their
collections, and to keep these important storehouses for the benefit of
us all.</p><h5><a name="06103085000188"></a>6.01
pm</h5><p><a name="06103085000068"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew315"></a><a name="06103085000203"></a>Lord
Bragg:</b> I join the other speakers in
congratulating my noble friend Lord Howarth for calling this debate,
and on covering the waterfront so well that I have spent a lot of time
cutting and slashing my own speech. It was cut and slashed even more
after my noble friend Lord Smith got cracking. It will be a bit
shorter, noble Lords will be relieved to hear.</p><p><a name="06103085000069"></a>To start with a digression, the biggest
acquisition of British galleries and museums over the past10
years has been the number of visitors. It has been extraordinary, as
all who go there know. Despite the bumps and ups and downs, which have
been clearly detailed, they pour in, in quite unprecedented numbers,
from many classes of our society and many age groups which did not go
there before. That has been a magnificent acquisition.</p><p><a name="06103085000070"></a>Secondly, not as importantly but quite
interestingly, instead of being something you have to go
to&#151;trailed in navy blue raincoats on wet Wednesday
afternoons&#151;museums and galleries have become a place of buzz and
style. They have becomea focus for cities&#151;not only
London; I think particularly of Newcastle&#151;wherever you go. That
has been a great acquisition to our life. I am bending the word a
little, but not too much.</p><p><a name="06103085000071"></a>I
speak here both as a Member of this House and as the president of the
National Campaign for the Arts, which noble Lords will know is an
independent body. It did research in response to the DCMS&#146;s
committee inquiry, <I>Caring for Our Collections</I>. Researching right
across the country, it came up with some real problems, some of which
have been enumerated. I shall rapidly go over them; they came from a
big poll that it conducted. All over the place, core funding has not
increased with inflation. There are warnings of further cuts, which is
detrimental to staffing levels, expertise, maintenance, research
and,<I>  nos moutons</I>, to acquisitions.</p><p><a name="06103085000072"></a>Acquisition budgets have fallen
dramatically. The Art Fund survey shows that 96 per cent of museums say
that inadequate core funding is a barrier to further collecting, and 60
per cent say that they were unable to allocate any money for
acquisitions over the past year. That is a serious problem. I agree
with my noble friend Lord Smith that the nub of this debate is 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that growth and regeneration come through acquisitions. That is the
MacGuffin in this story. Further, the NCA report says that the UK lacks
adequate tax incentives to promote significant philanthropic donations
of artworks to the nation at a higher level. I agree with the noble
Lord, Lord Lee, that many regional museums are finding their funding
being cut because of the low priority given to them by their local
government. They are in a great deal of trouble.</p><p><a name="06103085000073"></a>So, what is to be done? On the one hand,
we have a party in government which has proved itself&#151;since
1945, if you take the longer term&#151;to be sympathetic to the arts,
consistently advancing its funding, not least under the guidance of my
noble friend Lord Smith. For the remainder of my few minutes, however,
I shall concentrate on the nub of the matter: the great spiralling of
costs in the market.</p><p><a name="06103085000074"></a>We are
having a great springtime for collectors and sellers of works of
art&#151;or perhaps I should say Christmas every day of the
week&#151;not only at the high end of &#163;80 million but all over
the place. It is happening right across high art, middle art and
domestic art; prices have gone up and up. Art is now seen by some
people as a wonderful hedge fund. Perhaps it is a south sea
bubble&#151;who knows. What is happening now is not unlike the way in
which the Russians and certain persons from the City of London are
inflating property prices and affecting property prices throughout the
realm.</p><p><a name="06103085000075"></a>Should the Government
chase these prices and in so doing fan the flames and become a player
in the great auction or casino that we have at present? Might it not be
thought better to let the private sector run riot for a while? After
all, it could be argued, most museums and galleries at the moment are
pretty well stocked; some of them are bulging. To transfer a quotation
from Philip Larkin, &#147;no one actually starves&#148;. After all,
this could be a blip&#151;a real south sea bubble that
bursts&#151;and the gamblers will be burnt and the meek and prudent
will inherit the works and inherit the earth, and that would be very
satisfactory. After all, some private collectors&#151;Peggy
Guggenheim comes to mind, but also the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber,
who is going to donate his collection to the nation&#151;have built
up their collections privately to give to the nation for the public to
see later. Is that not the building up of private initiatives, and is
that not useful? Is it not a way forward? The cry may go up,
&#147;Does the state have to provide all the time and in every
case?&#148;</p><p><a name="06103085000076"></a>Perhaps it is a
good time to let the private sector rip. Our museums and galleries over
the centuries have benefited massively from the private sector being
let rip and ripping off stuff from all over Europe and many parts of
the world, then going straight and turning it in to places where people
can view these works freely. The stately homes of England are full of
such works, which are of great benefit to us
all.</p><p><a name="06103085000077"></a>The solutions have been
proposed well by the noble Lords, Lord Smith and Lord Howarth: clear,
effective tax interventions and money given in lieu. But if the
Treasury is disinclined to do that and disinclined to 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC40"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>join the overheated auction room game, and if it considers that the arts
should be made more able to stand alone, those in the arts must prove
their case&#151;in detail, as I think has been proved already, and in
general terms. Despite the expansion of the arts in the UK in the past
decades, despite unchallengeable arguments about the particular and
overall benefits for a better life, for internal wealth and the pursuit
of happiness, and despite the iconic status of the UK and the art world
and its target destination as a tourist centre&#151;and we can just
imagine what it will be like when people from China and the rest of
Asia begin to target us&#151;we have still not been able fully to
convince the powers that be that while all art might be, as Oscar Wilde
said, &#147;quite useless&#148;, the arts have become a necessary
and important economic and cultural part of our
society.</p><p><a name="06103085000078"></a>So what can we do?
Either we can encourage the Chancellor to have a <I>coup de foudre</I>
and meet his muse in the arts or&#151;although it appears uncommonly
difficult to do this&#151;those of us in this debate and around the
arts can continue to try to persuade the powers that be that the arts
contribute more and more to this country. The contribution of the arts
has increased, is increasing and will not diminish. The men and women
in Whitehall do not necessarily know better than the rest of
us.</p><h5><a name="06103085000189"></a>6.09

Inglewood:</b> Those who know about the state of our
museums, both national and local, know the truth of what the noble
Lord, Lord Howarth, told us in his opening remarks, which has been
underlined by subsequent speakers. The role of museums, as a kind of
bridging between education, both formal and informal, giving pleasure
to domestic British citizens and to those from aboard and as a national
resource in a world where intellectual property will be the driver of
the future wealth creation our country needs, are in peril.</p><p><a name="06103085000080"></a>I shall focus my few comments on the
problems this crisis poses for the system of export control of works of
art and cultural interest in this country, overseen by the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art, which I have the great good
fortune, pleasure and honour to chair. This, we understand, provides a
vignette, which throws light on the wider
problem.</p><p><a name="06103085000081"></a>The reviewing committee
arose from the work of the Waverly committee, set up by Stafford
Cripps, Chancellor in 1950, and reported two years later to RA Butler
in the ensuing Conservative Government. It addressed the implications
of the exodus of items of cultural and historic interest and value from
our country, and to advise what should be done about it. Of the
committee&#146;s members, all but one have separate entries in the
<I>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</I>; the odd one out being
Ruth Dalton, who appears under her husband&#146;s. They produced
recommendations which have been the basis of government policy,
regardless of party, ever since. The system they devised, while it
could be criticised by the intellectually rigorous as illogical,
cleverly balances the interests of owners, the art trade and museums,
all 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of which matter to this country, in a manner generally considered fair,
even handed and workable. As such, it is generally accepted by all
affected by it. In short, the members of the Waverly committee
displayed great wisdom.</p><p><a name="06103085000082"></a>The
system depends on the regular work of the committee itself, which
determines whether items seeking an export licence are of such a high
quality that they meet the rigorous definitions of national treasure
which, in turn, precipitates a time-limited right of pre-emption by a
possible UK purchaser if the market price is matched and certain other
requirements are met. In addition, the committee also prepares an
annual report for the Secretary of State on the workings of the system
of export control, which is, <I>inter alia</I>, always placed in the
Libraries of both Houses.</p><p><a name="06103085000083"></a>Central to the system is that if an item
meets the rigorous definition, it cannot be exported if a UK purchaser
comes forward. In practice, this means that of about 40,000 items
subject to export licences, somewhere between 20 and 40 will meet the
test. While it does not necessarily automatically follow that all items
meeting the criteria should not be exported, a failure to stop more
than a handful represents, it seems to us, a systemic failure. On a
year-by-year basis, the figures fluctuate but, over the past decade
taken as a whole, something like just over 60 per cent of
export-stopped items, taken by value, end up leaving this country. We
believe that is a failure, and that a 60-plus per cent failure
represents a systemic failure, be it in the health service, the
education system or, equally, in this area.</p><p><a name="06103085000084"></a>In money terms, the cost of turning
failure into success is, as a number of other speakers have
said,<I>de minimis</I>: in our context, at current prices, I
would have thought about &#163;25 million a year. I suppose that
sounds quite a lot. Think of what footballers earn, however&#151;one
was reported in the paper last week as earning &#163;100,000 a
week&#151;or what houses down the road from here might cost, or the
cost of hospital equipment or military hardware. After all, despite the
caveat of the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, it also represents an expenditure
where capital growth is more or less guaranteed.</p><p><a name="06103085000085"></a>In public expenditure terms, it is the
equivalent of deciding, when walking down the street, whether to put 50
pence or a pound in the collecting tin for charity. It has nothing to
do with budgeting the public finances, any more than petty change in a
collecting tin materially affects noble Lords&#146; personal budgets.
It represents less than the figure the <I>Times</I> represented as the
cost of removing tattoos by the National Health Service, although I
gather that is now disputed. It is about half the amount of money that
paper reported a couple of days earlier to be the cost of bungled
prosecutions. It pales into complete insignificance compared to the
&#163;2 billion Euro-VAT carousel
scam.</p><p><a name="06103085000086"></a>In return, the monetary
value of the investment will be enormous, as a cursory look at back
reports of the reviewing committee clearly shows. It is a classic case
of policy makers knowing the price of everything and the value of
nothing.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103085000087"></a>What should be done? The reviewing
committeeis not partisan. As its chairman, I consider that
members vote for all three main political parties. That does not stop
us agreeing on the problem. As I have already mentioned, one of our
roles is to advise the Secretary of State on the workings of the
system. Long before I was ever associated with it, for years the
committee had been saying that the system was not working as it should,
for the reasons I have given. If it is not working properly, perhaps we
are all wasting our time. As one leading UK museum director plaintively
said to me recently, &#147;What can I do? You export stop something
of the highest quality. I would like it in my museum, where it would be
entirely suitably placed. Yet I know from experience that I shall not
raise the money. Quite rightly, I have to try. Yet, because it is a
slightly unusual item, I know that I am wasting a lot of my, already
hard-pressed, staff&#146;s time on a futile quest&#148;. I have
every sympathy with him.</p><p><a name="06103085000088"></a>I
shall not suggest that the Government write out a cheque. We have been
around that track already. It could be said, however, that the key is
looking at the problems in as many ways as possible. I shall not argue
that the Heritage Land Fund or the National Heritage Memorial Fund
should be compelled to support respectable applications to acquire all
so-called Waverley items. First, their terms of reference do not and
probably should not overlap exactly. Secondly, they are already under
enormous financial pressure, which looks as though it will get worse,
even though their resources are already too small. Nor shall I argue
that the National Heritage Memorial Fund should be given the full
amount that the National Land Fund was originally allocated, even
though it is hard to think of anything more shameful than government
conscripting men to the war, and then plundering the fund set up in
memory of those who died. It is the kind of thing that private
individuals go to prison for, and it is particularly shameful that my
party was responsible.</p><p><a name="06103085000089"></a>Rather,
I shall press two priorities, one of which has already been touched on.
First, as was mentioned, Sir Nicholas Goodison pointed out in his
report for the Treasury, <I>Securing the Best for Our Museums</I>, the
way in which the tax system encouraged charitable giving to help
museums is not working as it might. The Treasury&#146;s proposition
that nothing is required because the existing arrangements have not
been taken up appears to overlook the simple fact that the evidence
from elsewhere, both inside and outside the English-speaking world,
suggests that the existing UK rules and arrangements are not fit for
that particular purpose. It is therefore hardly surprising when they do
not seem to have the desired effect. They should be made fit for
purpose, and we on the committee firmly believe that discussions should
be entered into to identify the best ways for delivering what we are
today all arguing is in the national interest.</p><p><a name="06103085000090"></a>Secondly, the committee has responded to
the consultation from the Commission on Unclaimed Assets, arguing that
some of the money&#151;there may be an enormous amount&#151;could
properly, and should be, put into an acquisition fund. All kinds of
lobbies 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will no doubt have designs on this money, but to allocate some to remedy
this failure in contemporary Britain seems entirely proper. We have
advised the Secretary of State of our response, and look forward to
her&#151;</p><p><a name="06103085000091"></a>Do I stop or go

that the reviewing committee has responded to the Commission for
Unclaimed Assets, arguing that a fund for acquisitions would be an
appropriate use for at least some of the money. We have advised the
Secretary of State of our response, and look forward to her support in
our endeavours to take forward the best interests of her department and
the wider public interest.</p><p><a name="06103085000098"></a>Thus
far, I have presented our concerns as a failure. It is more than that;
it is a tragedy. For the sake of a ha&#146;p&#146;orth of tar, the
ship is being lost. For the sake of arranging things right, we are
losing objects of enduring value to people now, in the past and, most
important, far into the future when, to misquote Kipling, the vanished
pomps of here today will be as one with Nineveh and Tyre. We are making
the same mistake as the city fathers in Beijing who demolished the
hutongs in the dash for immediate economic growth and so-called
progress. As night follows day, they will regret
it.</p><p><a name="06103085000099"></a>The folly of this approach
can be seen so clearly on the London Underground today. As you look
around, you see a reproduction of the Rokeby Venus, advertising the
blockbuster Velasquez show at the National Gallery, which the cultural
pages of the press have hailed as a &#147;must-see item&#148;,
&#147;the show of the year&#148; and &#147;five star&#148;. We
are lucky in London. We can see the Rokeby Venus, as opposed to many of
the other pictures in the show, almost every day in the National
Gallery because, in its early days, it was saved from export by the
then-National Art Collections Fund. The philistines, the bean-counters,
the Mr Gradgrinds and the Alderman Foodbottoms and Colonel Sibthorps
all decried the cost of this frivolous extravagance, but what goes
round comes round. It was cheap at the price. The best is always cheap,
always endures, is always on the cutting edge, always pays the best
dividends and provides the best value for money to our fellow citizens
and
taxpayers.</p>

Sheldon:</b> I thank my noble friend for bringing
about this debate. The All-Party Parliamentary Arts and Heritage Group
has done much to bring the attention of Parliament to arts and culture,
and it provides a useful link between them. The group came into being
in 1975-76 when the Treasury introduced inheritance tax, which would
have forced historic houses and their contents to be sold, and their
importance to our history and culture would be lost. Fortunately, Sir
Patrick Cormack in another place conducted an impressive campaign and,
in the Treasury, I was pleased to support him. The campaign resulted in
the saving of our precious assets&#151;our historic houses and their
contents.</p><p><a name="06103085000101"></a>The arts and heritage
committee has continued for 30 years and brings together both Houses in
maintaining contact with our great heritage. I have the privilege to
act as president of the committee, but the valuable work of Sir Patrick
Cormack as chairman and the noble Lord, Lord Crathorne, who I see in
his place, as honorary secretary have maintained the close co-operation
between the all-party group and our museums and galleries.</p><p><a name="06103085000102"></a>In Britain, we are particularly fortunate
to have acquired so large a proportion of great works of art. The 18th
century provided many valuable donations, but the 19th century gave us
the great collections which we are privileged to enjoy. The danger now
is that many works of art being put up for sale are being lost because
the museums and galleries do not have the funds to compete with other
purchasers, who are frequently from overseas. Many important works of
art are in danger of being lost and much needs to be done to meet this
trend.</p><p><a name="06103085000103"></a>We have some outstanding
directors of our museums and galleries, including Neil MacGregor at the
British Museum&#151;some people claim it to be the largest museum in
the world and it has the Elgin Marbles among other outstanding
collections&#151;Charles Saumarez Smith at the National Gallery and
Sir Nicholas Serota at the Tate galleries. Additional to these are the
famous Victoria &amp; Albert and the Natural History Museum. So we are
very well supplied. One weakness is the low salaries which are paid to
the curators of our smaller museums and galleries. We are fortunate to
have well qualified staff at many of them, but I have a fear of
retaining their expertise over the next few years. I must ask my noble
friend to comment on that.</p><p><a name="06103085000104"></a>One
outstanding contribution was the decision by the noble Lord, Lord
Smith, who I am delighted to see in his place, when he was Secretary of
State at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to bring about
free entry to galleries and museums. I, like others, had argued
strongly for free entry, which came on 1 December 2001. It has had a
revolutionary effect on entry&#151;attendances have increased
dramatically. When visiting several galleries over this weekend, I was
able to compare the number of visitors to those that I can recall. In
my teens I visited a number of museums in the Manchester area. In some
smaller towns, I frequently found myself alone looking at the paintings
and other exhibits. That achievement is a 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tribute to my noble friend. We now have a vibrant and active audience
for the great works of art and even for the most modest displays in
smaller towns, which always have important works which are worth
examining.</p><p><a name="06103085000105"></a>The valuable report,
<I>Renaissance in the Regions</I>, which was produced by the committee
chaired by my noble friend Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, and on which I
served, had the important recommendation on regional hubs, which would
provide regional and local assistance to smaller museums and galleries,
as well as create centres where museums and galleries can join together
for assistance and advice.</p><p><a name="06103085000106"></a>What
worries me about the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is that in
the title &#147;culture&#148; rightly comes first and
&#147;sport&#148; last. With the coming of the 2012 Olympics, sport
has become a more important part of the work of the department. As a
consequence, culture and the arts will not receive as high a priority
as in previous years. Since the sports aspect is likely to increase its
demand over the years, the position could get worse, which is
important. Last Thursday, Sir Patrick Cormack and I met with the chief
executive of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, Chris Batt.
On Wednesday, they will have an afternoon in the Terrace Pavilion when
I hope that they will get a good attendance as their national role can
be very important in the years ahead. The real problem is that after
valuable help has been given to the arts progress has not been
maintained. We need to continue to appreciate the value of our museums
and galleries and to provide the financial assistance which they need
to maintain their valuable
contribution.</p><h5><a name="06103085000191"></a>6.33

Crathorne:</b> It is a great pleasure to take part in
this debate. I agree with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Howarth,
said in his excellent opening remarks. It is a particular pleasure to
follow the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, president of the All-Party
Parliamentary Arts and Heritage Group. As the noble Lord, Lord Howarth,
said, it is very nice to welcome the Heritage Lottery Fund initiative
of an investment of &#163;3 million to be allocated in 2007-08.
Grants will be available from &#163;50,000 up to a maximum of
&#163;200,000. It is envisaged that as many as 20 projects around the
UK could be funded from this
initiative.</p><p><a name="06103085000108"></a>Obviously, much has
been covered in this debate. I should like to emphasise one or two
things. Members of the Committee have touched on how well served we are
in this country by our museum directors and their professional staff
who have transformed our great museums in an extraordinary way in the
past few years. That has been greatly helped by the lottery. I much
enjoyed my time as a Heritage Lottery Fund trustee. As the noble Lord,
Lord Bragg, said, people pour into museums now in unprecedented
numbers, which is wonderful. I am glad to know that all Members of the
Committee get the All-Party Parliamentary Arts and Heritage Group
notice&#151;if anyone does not, please see me and I will make sure
that you go on the list.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06103085000109"></a>The Committee will have seen from the
recent notice that the group goes to exhibitions of quite extraordinary
quality&#151;Velasquez, Rodin, Holbein, Leonardo and Hockney. I do
not believe that there is anywhere else in the world at this moment
where one could put together such a programme. This is wonderful stuff,
but it is a different story when it comes to museums and galleries
adding to their collections, as we have heard. The noble Lord, Lord
Inglewood, made a quite salutary speech. He explained that putting an
export stop does not mean that something is saved for the nation. It is
sad to hear the 60 per cent failure rate that he
described.</p><p><a name="06103085000110"></a>One of the main
problems is the vast prices that pictures command. We read press
headlines, such as &#147;Mystery Russian pays &#163;51 million for
Picasso&#146;s Mistress&#148;. A few years ago no Russian would
possibly have paid more than &#163;5,000. There are so many more
people now in this international market. No government can be expected
to pick up the tab for keeping everything in the country that we would
like to keep. However, I hope that there will be some additional
help.</p><p><a name="06103085000111"></a>Another area which has
been touched on, and where I feel that a more imaginative approach
would be possible, is tax regimes. In America, private donors are
encouraged to give, and it has a very effective tax regime. In this
country, a little extra encouragement would mean that a lot more items
are given to the country. I am not sure that the Goodison report has
been taken on board. As various Members of the Committee have said,
there were lots of very good things in that. Perhaps the Minister could
look further at the Goodison report. We are talking about government
support for museums and galleries, but on looking at galleries over the
years and centuries and at how they obtained items, most have come from
private donors&#151;not from government at any point. I hope that the
tax regime can be looked at
further.</p><p><a name="06103085000112"></a>When private owners
wish to sell high value items for the maximum that they can get, they
are quite often depicted as being extremely greedy and it is suggested
that they should donate them. When the Duke of Northumberland was
criticised because he wanted to sell Raphael&#146;s &#147;Madonna
of the Pinks&#148;, his response was, &#147;I am selling this
painting to preserve our national heritage&#148;. He meant that he
was using the money to preserve a castle, two Grade I listed buildings,
200 Grade 2 listed buildings and a famous collection seen by 100,000
people a year. His outlay on all that is massive. In that case, the
picture was saved for the nation by the lottery, but that will not
happen very often.</p><p><a name="06103085000113"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Howarth, mentioned the 1922 list. Perhaps the Minister will
comment on its status because there are very few items on it and it
always seems that it should not be left to lie. In fact, the Halifax
Titian is on it. It is not always easy to know with certainty what to
keep for the country for future generations. I do not suppose that
Damien Hirst&#146;s &#147;The Physical Impossibility of Death in
the Mind of Someone Living&#148; of 1991, otherwise known as the
&#147;Shark in Formaldehyde&#148; would make the list. But that was
bought in 1991 for &#163;50,000 and sold

indication of the problems that there are in keeping up with
prices.</p><p><a name="06103085000114"></a>Recently, I was sent a
card showing people in a contemporary art gallery where one person is
scrutinising a red box on the gallery wall. The caption
read:</p><ul><a name="06103085000171"></a>&#147;Dot making a fool
of herself in the art gallery by admiring the fire
alarm&#148;.</ul><a name="06103085000159"></a>None of us
have that problem when looking at a Raphael or a Titian, but there are
endless opinions about what should or should not be kept for the
nation. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
reply.<h5><a name="06103085000192"></a>6.40

Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury:</b> I join others in
thanking the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, for initiating the debate. It is
always good to have a debate about the arts, a subject which is spoken
on too rarely. As the noble Lord, Lord Crathorne, mentioned, it comes
hot on the heels of the announcement of a new &#163;3 million fund to
invest in acquisitions, training for curators and research; something
else that is to be welcomed, but, to paraphrase Maev Kennedy of the
<I>Guardian</I>, not worth one elegant leather glove of Titian&#146;s
&#147;Portrait of a Young Man&#148;, which was until recently on
the walls of the National Gallery and is now in a sale
room.</p><p><a name="06103085000116"></a>The arts, of which museums
and galleries are so integral, are a central part of our civic and
community life&#151;as others have mentioned&#151;not an optional
extra. They give people a place in which they can exercise and enjoy
their imagination. They define and bind communities, provide
understanding of the world we inhabit and of what makes us
human.</p><p><a name="06103085000117"></a>Neil MacGregor, director
of the British Museum, who recently gave evidence to a House of Commons
committee, spoke of how an exhibition at the museum, Building of Durga,
has attracted large numbers of Bengalis, both Hindu and Muslim, from
across the country. He said that the role of
museums,</p><ul><a name="06103085000178"></a>&#147;in allowing
different parts of the community in the United Kingdom to see how they
fit together is a role that very few other public institutions can
play&#148;.</ul><a name="06103085000160"></a>The opening
of the new Islamic Gallery at the V&amp;Ais another example of
that. The gallery embraces Islamic culture and welcomes it as important
to us collectively. Across the country, through initiatives like these,
our museums and galleries are contributing to social cohesion, which is
so important in the troubled times in which we live. Thanks to the
Government and the noble Lord, Lord Smith, having introduced free
admission to DCMS sponsored museums and galleries, many more people are
able to benefit from the enlightenment as well as the pleasure that
they offer.<p><a name="06103085000118"></a>Museums and
galleries are also clearly an educational resource, and a resource with
untapped potential in this area. According to the Museums Association,
in areas where the very successful Renaissance in the Regions programme
has been fully funded, there has been a 120 per cent increase in 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>attendance by schoolchildren. In the areas where it has not been fully
funded, there has been only a20 per cent increase. Only three
out of nine regions have at this time received full funding. Why, when
the contribution made is so clear, is the funding not forthcoming for
the other six?</p><p><a name="06103085000119"></a>Then, as the
noble Lords, Lord Howarth and Lord Inglewood, mentioned, there is the
contribution these wonderful collections make to the creative
industries. The V&amp;A calculates that 30 per cent of its visitors are
directly involved in the creative arts. Real value nowadays is in
design, not manufacture. Values lies in ideas and the creative
industries are now a key economic driver, growing twice as fast as the
overall economy. Gordon Brown seems to recognise this and has
said:</p><ul><a name="06103085000172"></a>&#147;The Arts sector
is not a sideshow, but right at the centre of the
economy&#148;.</ul><a name="06103085000161"></a>But despite
this it still feels that it is treated as exactly that&#151;a
sideshow. Core funding for our museums and galleries, as has been
mentioned earlier, has not kept up with inflation, while costs have
risen at a rate higher than inflation. The DCMS consultation document
<I>Understanding the Future</I>
says:<ul><a name="06103085000173"></a>&#147;Collections are
at the heart of all that museums do, but they need to remain dynamic
resources&#148;.</ul><a name="06103085000162"></a>And yet,
acquisition budgets have fallen dramatically. The Art Fund Museum
Survey 2006 found that60 per cent of
museums,<ul><a name="06103085000179"></a>&#147;were
unable to allocate any income to collecting last
year&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06103085000120"></a>Everyone agrees
that collections need to remain dynamic, which means that acquisitions
have to be,</p><ul><a name="06103085000180"></a>&#147;at the
heart of the mandate of
museums&#148;.</ul><a name="06103085000163"></a>The
converse of the need to acquire is that there is not enough exhibition
space for all that has been acquired over the centuries. Troves of
treasure languish in basements, cupboards and behind locked
safes. <p><a name="06103085000121"></a>We welcome the fact
that the Museums Association is due to conduct a review of what is
referred to as &#147;disposals&#148; and the consequent debate that
this has opened up. It is a complicated area because of the risk of
loss to the nation&#146;s heritage, and one that should be treated
with caution with the proper checks and balances. For decades, there
has been a strong presumption in the museums and galleries sector
rejecting disposal. However, against the backdrop of the realities of
collecting in the21st century, it is a debate that needs to be
revisited.</p><p><a name="06103085000122"></a>There are
fundamental questions to be asked: should collections be there forever?
Is it the case that everything in a collection should necessarily have
been collected in the first place? Should precious resources be used on
conserving objects that are rarely seen? Then there is the question of
sales. The recent decision of Bury Council to sell its Lowry, not to
enhance the museum collection but to plug a&#163;10 million
shortfall in its budget is obviously wrong, but we should consider
sales if the money is used to reinvest in collections. The Tate has
started talking about selling things from its collection to raise money
for future acquisition.</p><p><a name="06103085000123"></a>Then
there is the question of partnership. The last major acquisition made
by the British Museum was 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC49"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made jointly with the museums of Stoke-on-Trent and Carlisle, and is
owned by the three collections. That seems extremely sensible. The
national collections must also be willing to lend to their regional
cousins, which have less power to acquire.</p><p><a name="06103085000124"></a>We welcome the increased funding that the
arts have received under this Government. The money has proved well
spent, but the future does not look so positive. National museums are
nervous about the next Comprehensive Spending Review, and I support
what the noble Lords, Lord Smith and Lord Howarth, said in their plea
to the Chancellor not to impose cuts.</p><p><a name="06103085000125"></a>In the introduction to the consultation
document that I mentioned earlier, Estelle Morris, then arts Minister,
stated:</p><ul><a name="06103085000174"></a>&#147;Museums are as
important to our quality of life as any of the public
services&#148;.</ul><a name="06103085000164"></a>And yet
that is not how they are treated. The contribution made by galleries
and museums to our quality of life in both various and specific ways is
not sufficiently taken into account when the question of what they are
literally worth is
calculated.<h5><a name="06103085000193"></a>6.48

Astor:</b> I shall quote one important sentence from
the Government&#146;s recent
manifesto:</p><ul><a name="06103085000175"></a>&#147;We will
explore further ways to encourage philanthropy to boost the quality of
our public art
collections&#148;.</ul><a name="06103085000165"></a>That was
a welcome statement. This debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord
Howarth, is timely because it gives the Minister a chance to respond
and tell your Lordships what progress is being made.
<p><a name="06103085000127"></a>I add one word of
congratulation&#151;because one should always given the Government
credit where it is due&#151;on the introduction of free admission to
national museums and galleries. It was an extremely important step, and
we congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Smith, for winkling the money out
of the Treasury to enable it to be done. It has made an enormous
difference, and the numbers of visitors have gone up. It has encouraged
overall museum visits to other museums as well. It is a great
achievement.</p><p><a name="06103085000128"></a>I
add one word of caution, however. Under the original scheme, museums
and galleries were given an amount of money to take into account what
they lost from the admissions. That is now going to be all put in as
the allocation of their DCMS funding. We will have to watch very
carefully that there are no cuts so that those museums in that position
are not penalised by going down that route. Not only have they lost
admissions but, due to the increasing number of people, the cost of
running the galleries is increasing,
too.</p><p><a name="06103085000129"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Sheldon, asked the Minister a Question in July about funding, and the
Minister gave an interesting answer to a question of my own. He said
that the Government
would,</p><ul><a name="06103085000181"></a>&#147;continue to
explore options for encouraging philanthropy and are in discussion with
the working group on the UK&#146;s literary heritage, chaired by my
noble friend Lord Smith of
Finsbury&#148;.</ul><a name="06103085000166"></a>He went
on to say that there was a meeting. The noble Lord, Lord Smith of
Finsbury, did not mention that 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>meeting, which rather concerned me. I worry that the fact that he did
not mention it means that progress has not been made&#151;because I
am sure that if it had he would have said so. Perhaps the Minister
could comment on that. He went on to say
that,<ul><a name="06103085000182"></a>&#147;there was a
meeting between DCMS and key people and directors in the museums and
galleries world where all the concerns that we are talking about today
were raised and discussed&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
24/7/06; col. 1541.]</ul><a name="06103085000167"></a>I
think that noble Lords would be interested in what progress has been
made.<p><a name="06103085000130"></a>To be fair, the Minister
acknowledged the concerns that exist on funding. He quoted a report
from the National Art Collections Fund that argued
that,</p><ul><a name="06103085000183"></a>&#147;92 per cent of
museums surveyed felt that there was inadequate
funding&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/7/06; col.
1542.]</ul><a name="06103085000168"></a>We all know of the
concerns that they have.<p><a name="06103085000131"></a>I
shall try to limit my remarks to what I regard as the collections and
how we can ensure that acquisitions continue. There are two routes to
go down: there is the National Heritage Memorial Fund, which is the
fund of last resort for the nation&#146;s heritage and comes to the
rescue by making emergency acquisitions. Because of that it is always
under a timetable problem. It is always in a mad panic to try to raise
money to stop works of art that have gone through the reviewing
committee, chaired by my noble friend Lord Inglewood, going abroad.
That is not very satisfactory. An interesting idea was put forward this
evening of acceptance in lieu being brought forward into
people&#146;s lifetime. It would make life much easier and give the
National Heritage Memorial Fund and the museums much more ability to
raise the money. That is certainly a sensible idea. I hope that the
Government will look at it carefully. As we have heard, the amounts of
money are increasing in the art world all the time. There is nothing we
can do about that; I suspect that every time a museum has ever bought
something over the years, everybody has always said that it has paid
too much. That is always going to go on&#151;and in 20 years&#146;
time, if we are still around, we will look back and say how cheap
things were at the time.</p><p><a name="06103085000132"></a>The
other source of funding is the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has funded
the National Heritage Memorial Fund and has given some money for
acquisitions&#151;but there seems to be a reluctance to do so on the
part of that fund. Can the Minister explain that? The Heritage Lottery
Fund seems fundamentally reluctant to give money for acquisitions. Is
that because of the way it is set up? After all, the Government are
responsible for it. The fund is, of course, getting less money as a
result of the changes that the Government have made to the National
Lottery, because more money is going to the Big Lottery Fund, and that
is a concern. The Heritage Lottery Fund funding has come
down&#151;and that is something that we would do something
about.</p><p><a name="06103085000133"></a>We are all concerned
about the same things: we are all concerned about the collections in
our country, how to add to them and what to do about it. We are all
here to give the Minister support in the perpetual fight against the
powers that be to improve funding for the arts.</p>

our debate into some sort of context. The noble Lord, Lord Lee, made
this point. The past ten years&#151;described by my noble friend Lord

cultural life in this country, and for our museums and galleries and
their collections in particular.</p><p><a name="06103085000136"></a>There is no denying the enormous, and

alongside this, economic forces have been at work. We have seen a
tremendous rise in the rate of inflation at the high end of the
international art market&#151;a point eloquently made by my noble
friend Lord Bragg. The very finest pieces are now fetching well into
the high millions. And, in the way that these things go, the soaring
prices have encouraged a number of owners to place their works on the
market. Who can blame them? There was a story in the <I>Sunday
Times</I> yesterday&#151;true or false&#151;that the noble Lord,
Lord Lloyd-Webber, is going to sell a Picasso in New York, which is
expected to raise in the region of &#163;10 million. This has led to
very real concerns, which we have heard this evening, about the ability
of museums and galleries to keep up with these movements in the
marketplace. To compete with the deep coffers of the big international
collectors and institutions will be a problem, and we all have to
acknowledge that.</p><p><a name="06103085000137"></a>Against such a
backdrop it will come as no surprise to noble Lords that the Treasury
is unwilling simply to throw money at the problem, and, further, that
there is no appetite in Government for a free-standing acquisitions
fund. This evening we have heard figures like &#147;only &#163;25
million is needed&#148; and &#147;&#163;90 million&#148; for a
picture. This sort of rhetoric&#151;and I do not have a political
background&#151;is designed to drive Treasury officials crazy. Are
noble Lords suggesting that any picture regarded as an important UK
treasure that comes on the market should be purchased? I am afraid that
we have to get real; that will not happen. It is absolutely essential
that museums and galleries make the very most of existing Treasury tax
concessions before they move on and try to persuade the Treasury on new
ideas for tax relief.</p><p><a name="06103085000138"></a>It is a
testimony to the self-confidence and sheer energy that surrounds our
museums and galleries that this autumn sees what many believe to be the
richest array of exhibitions ever seen in the capital&#151;a point
made by the noble Lord, Lord Crathorne&#151;of Hockney, Holbein,
Velazquez, Michelangelo, Rodin and Cezanne. These riches are not just
restricted to the capital; terrific things are happening in the
regions. People all over the country have a genuine

the Bacon show in Norwich, or public art projects like Anthony
Gormley's Angel of the North beside the A1, and the iron men on the
sands at Crosby, which enjoy enormous public support and affection.
Millions have enjoyed the angel and in just a year 600,000 people have
walked across the sands to see the iron men.</p><p><a name="06103085000139"></a>So what can, and should, the Government
do for the arts? Jennie Lee got it right, I think. In another phrase
that has become a little shiny from overuse, but is nonetheless
resoundingly true, she
said:</p><ul><a name="06103085000176"></a>&#147;What the arts
need from Government is money, policy and
silence&#148;.</ul><a name="06103085000169"></a>Let us start
with money, particularly for acquisitions, because this is the nub of
the debate this evening. It is nearly 15 years since our national
museums had ring-fenced acquisition funds. One of the most important
principles underpinning this and previous Governments&#146; approach
to museum funding is that one size does not fit all. The best placed
people to decide spending priorities are in the museums themselves, not
in Whitehall&#151;a point that I believe we all acknowledge. But, as
my noble friend knows from first-hand experience, and thanks to his own
good campaigning and lobbying, there is a good story to tell on funding
overall. DCMS spending on its sponsored museums has increased from
&#163;205 million in 1997 to &#163;294 million today&#151;about
16 per cent in real terms. This includes an increase of &#163;28
million in the past four
years.<p><a name="06103085000140"></a>Further afield,
&#163;150 million has been invested in the Renaissance in the Regions
programme, as we have heard. This is the first-ever sustained programme
of central government investment in the infrastructure of our regional
museums and galleries. It is putting new life into institutions across
the country, reversing generations of underinvestment, and helping to
equip the museums&#146; workforce with the skills it needs to survive
in the 21st century.</p><p><a name="06103085000141"></a>The
National Heritage Memorial Fund has committed more than &#163;135
million to acquiring cultural property, usually a true fund of last
resort, since 1980. Its grant from the Government will double from
&#163;5 million to &#163;10 million next year. Since its creation
in 1994, the National Lottery, through the Heritage Lottery Fund, has
awarded grants of more than &#163;1 billion to museums, galleries,
libraries and archives in the UK. This includes &#163;141 million to
museums and galleries for the acquisition of art and other objects.
Only last week, it announced a ring-fenced acquisitions fund of
&#163;3 million, which will be targeted at our regional collections.
At this point, I join my noble friend Lord Howarth in paying tribute to
the Art Fund, under the guidance of David Barrie, for its excellent
work in helping museums and galleries all over the country to acquire
objects of all kinds. Since its inception in 1903, it has helped to
save more than 850,000 works of art, and it manages to offer about
&#163;4 million in grants annually to museums and galleries around
the UK. That is the first leg of Jennie Lee&#146;s tripod
money.</p>

Inglewood:</b> The Minister has
entirelyfairly explained the amounts of money that the
Government have made available. I believe that everyone who has
participated in this debate supports that unequivocally. At the same
time, however, it does not address the core problem; namely, the
current crisis in acquisitions. It has been explained to us that going
to museums is more and more popular. It follows that providing money
for museums and acquisitions would be electorally popular. The
Government are faced with the problem of this crisis in the museum
sector. How do we resolve that in the future, rather than quite fairly
commenting on the successes of the
past?</p><p><a name="06103085000143"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew328"></a><a name="06103085000216"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> When we
talkabout what we will do in the future, it is essential to
establish where we are now. My point is that this Government&#151;my
Government&#151;have done the most extraordinary things in the past
10 years to contribute to museums, galleries and many other art forms.
It is essential that I lay the groundwork before going on to say what
we should do about it. The question is, after all, what we should do
about it. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, made a very important point
when he said that this is not one political party&#146;s problem but
our problem. It is a national problem, and it must be dealt with in an
overarching, intelligent and creative way. So that is money.</p><p><a name="06103085000144"></a>Policy, of course, is a more elusive
creature. The Government believe in the arm&#146;s length principle,
which means, as we have heard, that detailed decisions on individual
art forms should be taken not by Government but in the field. The
Government do what they can to create the conditions in which culture
can flourish. For museums and galleries, this begins with appointing
the very best directors, chairmen and trustees. Here we come to a
positive point. As chairman of Resource, I spent some considerable time
looking at museums and talking to museum
directors.</p><p><a name="06103085000145"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Howarth, made the important point that some trustees
should be appointed if they have entrepreneurial skills. It could be
argued that the museum world is too passive. It waits for things to
happen rather than making them happen, and it should be more
entrepreneurial. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, too, made an important
point about how philanthropists should be encouraged to move into this
world, particularly when one compares the situation and the atmosphere
in the UK with what happens in America. Such an important change in the
direction that museums and galleries take would be of benefit and would
help to alleviate some of the problems about which we are
talking.</p><p><a name="06103085000146"></a>Creating the conditions
goes beyond this. The Treasury has created a number of tax reliefs over
the years&#151;I urge the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, not to say that
he knows all this; he may do, but there is a sting in the
tale&#151;that help private owners to give, and public institutions
to receive, important cultural items. There is, for example, a
conditional exemption, which allows estates to defer the settlement of
inheritance tax bills in exchange for public access to 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC54"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fine works&#151;douceurs, or sweeteners if you
prefer, that make private treaty sales of works of art to public
institutions more tax effective. Again, I repeat that these
opportunities are there, but they are not being exploited to the full.
It weakens any argument for further tax concessions and further help
from the Treasury if things that are already in place are simply not
used.</p><p><a name="06103085000147"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew329"></a><a name="06103085000217"></a>Lord
Inglewood:</b> If experience elsewhere in Europe and
around the globe suggests that the detail of the existing tax
arrangements are not the most efficacious way of achieving the shared
wishes of everyone in this debate, does it not follow that it is right
to try to tailor the detail of the mechanisms to deliver what we all
want? If they are not working properly now, that may be because they
have not been drawn up in the right
way.</p><p><a name="06103085000148"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew330"></a><a name="06103085000218"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I would look at this
from the other end of the telescope. I would not say that it has not
been drawn up in the right way. I am now straying well away from my
brief, but I would argue that the museums and galleries have not spoken
with one voice, so they have not been an efficient or effective
pressure group. I was about to say that there should be one voice that
says, &#147;Here is a series of proposals. Will you please react to
them?&#148;. At the moment, there are a number of organisations all
doing valuable work but all presenting a very diffuse image. That is
not a good thing.</p><p><a name="06103085000149"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Inglewood, talked about the UK system of export licences,
which gives UK institutions a second chance to match the price paid for
the very best items before they go overseas. I pay tribute to the noble
Lord as chairman of the reviewing committee. I am told that there is
ample evidence in the department&#146;s files that the committee has
been complaining about insufficient funds to do its work ever since it
was founded in 1952. We could argue about whether the bottle is half
full or half empty, but I am pleased to say that, last year, more than
50 per cent of the items on which the Government placed a temporary
export bar were subsequently saved for the nation. That is on top of
the literally hundreds of items that have been saved since the
committee was set up in 1952.</p><p><a name="06103085000150"></a>I
shall now discuss the third part of Jennie Lee&#146;s
prescription&#151;silence. I am not sure whether this has ever been
part of the approach of this Government or any other Government. I
should, however, like to finish with a further word on acquisitions.
The problem, which I have already touched on, is in part created by the
fact that the international art market is a law unto itself. Indeed, it
could be said that it is in some, but happily not all, respects second
only to the world of international football&#151;an analogy made by
the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood. It is extraordinary that Chelsea, which
is top of the
league&#151;</p><p><a name="06103085000151"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew331"></a><a name="06103085000219"></a>Noble

Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> Extraordinarily, it
declared a loss of &#163;140 million pounds last year. There is
irrationality about this world, some of which perhaps applies to the
art world, too. Fashion, questions of attribution and provenance, and 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC55"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>collectors&#146; choices all play their part. The way through&#151;I
have touched on this&#151;is to begin by making better use of
existing tax regimes and mechanisms. Take tax relief, for example. As I
have already said, several good concessions are already in place to
encourage private and corporate giving, but take-up has not been as
wide as we might have expected. The Government are considering ways of
addressing this, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, for
securing this debate today and to all noble Lords for airing these
issues once again. The most interesting thing about the debate is that
almost everything that has been said has been directed not at me but at
the Chancellor of the
Exchequer.</p><p><a name="06103085000153"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Howarth, has made several very interesting points that will definitely
set us thinking. Matters of taxation are, of course, for my right
honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I welcome the
noble Lord&#146;s helpful suggestions for a number of imaginative
ways to increase the resources available to allow museums and galleries
to add to their collections. These will certainly be worth exploring
further, although I fear that creating a new paramount list would count
as unreasonable interference in the art market and in the fundamental
right of owners to the free enjoyment of their property, including the
right to sell it at the market price. I do not know whether noble Lords
are aware of this, but France recently tried to buy a van Gogh from a
private collector, arguing that the price reflected France&#146;s
inalienability. The owner took France to the European Court of Human
Rights; France lost and had to pay four times the price that was
originally asked for the
picture.</p><p><a name="06103085000154"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew333"></a><a name="06103085000221"></a>Lord
Howarth of Newport:</b> The Minister need not have
the fear that he has just expressed. I see no difference in principle
between this and the procedures followed by the reviewing committee. In
1922, the Treasury committed itself in the future to providing funds at
a reasonable valuation that was made at the time. It did not undertake
to chase the art market forever upwards, but it did undertake to
support the National Gallery to pay up to what was considered to be a
fair valuation at that moment in the history of the art market. It
worked; the National Gallery subsequently secured four out of the seven
on the original list. I do not think there was any question 


<notus-date day="30" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>30 Oct 2006 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of an infringement of property rights, as they were understood in those
days or, indeed, as they are understood
now.</p><p><a name="06103085000155"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew334"></a><a name="06103085000222"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> Again, my point relates
to huge inflation in the art market. An arrangement might be made with
someone in, say, 1920, when there was very little inflation in price
over 10, 15 or 20 years. However, I do not think that an owner would be
very happy if an arrangement was made to pay &#163;10 million for art
that was worth&#163;150 million 20 years later. As I have
said, however, we will carefully consider all the ideas that have been
expressed today.</p><p><a name="06103085000156"></a>It has been a
fascinating debate. Many valuable points have been made, and they will
be considered, as I have said. I stress again that I have been involved
in many aspects of the arts over the years, and the ones that have
really worked are where a pressure group or a lobby speaks with one
voice. The problem is analysed, and a straightforward solution is
proposed that can then be
considered.</p><p><a name="06103085000157"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew335"></a><a name="06103085000223"></a>Lord
Lee of Trafford:</b> The noble Lord talks about an
industry coming together. The tourism industry has come together, has
formed the Tourism Alliance and is speaking with one voice. There is no
evidence that it has increased government expenditure or support for
the tourist industry.</p><p><a name="06103085000158"></a><b><a name="61030-gc0003.htm_spnew336"></a><a name="06103085000224"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> First, I am not talking
about an industry: I am talking about museums and galleries where
everyone acknowledges the importance to culture, education and all
other contributions that they make. Here is a Government who have
invested massively in the arts in the past10 years. I would
hope&#151;this view is shared by the noble Lord, Lord Smith, and
others&#151;that the Treasury will respond to some of the arguments
that we have heard today. In conclusion, we have not heard a word of
criticism about our museums and galleries. There is a general view that
they are run by brilliant directors and have terrific dedicated staff.
I should like to finish by paying tribute to those people who are
giving us a better museum and gallery service than anywhere else in the
world.</p><ul><ul><ul>The Committee adjourned

Department (Liam Byrne) has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06103014000012"></a>Today the Government
publish a consultation paper on a new charging regime for immigration
and nationality fees, meeting our commitments to consult on charging
for the new points-based system and significant changes to visa fees,
and to support the boost to our border security and enforcement
capability set out in the IND review last
July.</p><p><a name="06103014000013"></a>Migration and tourism
benefit Britain greatly. But to continue to welcome legitimate
migrants, we need an immigration system that is fair and effective. The
integrity of the immigration system depends on robust borders, with
effective security overseas and in the UK ensuring and enforcing
compliance with our immigration laws. As the Home Office implements the
measures outlined in the IND review, and improved controls and measures
are introduced overseas and in-country by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office and Home Office jointly, we need to consider how immigration and
nationality services are paid for and whether our charging strategy
should better reflect the end-to-end cost of the whole immigration
system. We want improved enforcement of a fair and effective
immigration system. We believe that it is right that a greater
contribution towards the costs of maintaining such a system should fall
to those for whom immigration to our country brings benefits and
rewards.</p><p><a name="06103014000014"></a>The Government are
committed to boosting Britain's economy by bringing the right skills
from around the world and ensuring that it is easy to visit

business people and students who come here, recognizing the valuable
contribution they make to economic growth and the way that they enrich
our society through cultural
exchange.</p><p><a name="06103014000015"></a>The consultation paper
sets out some options on how we charge for our immigration and
nationality services. We want a genuine debate on the most appropriate
way to charge and hope that key stakeholders and members of the public
engage with this consultation process. We will be holding a number of
stakeholder events throughout the consultation period in order to get
the views and ideas of as many people as
possible.</p><p><a name="06103014000016"></a>Copies of the

Under-Secretary of State (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written
Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="06103014000028"></a>On 5 June
I was pleased to announce new funding of &#163;27million spread over
three years for children's hospice services. Applications for the
Children's Hospice and Children's Hospice at Home Grant have now been
considered by a group which included key stakeholders and I am pleased
to announce that 35 hospice services successfully applied for grants
and will benefit from this funding. The payments will be made as soon
as possible.</p><p><a name="06103014000029"></a>At the same time as
announcing this grant I announced a review of children's hospice
services and subsequently announced in a Written Ministerial Statement
on 18 September that the review had been extended to consider the long
term sustainability of children's palliative care services and funding
more generally. I am pleased to announce that Professor Sir Alan Craft
and Ms Sue Killen have agreed to lead this important review. The
consultation phase of this review commenced in October and
contributions are being sought. Contact can be made with the review
team at childpalliativecare@dh.gsi.gov.uk. I expect the review to be
completed by spring
2007.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61030-wms0001.htmstate_5"></a><a name="06103014000006"></a>North

Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on 14 October
2006 unanimously adopted UNSCR 1718 (2006) under Chapter VII of the UN
charter. The Security Council's rapid and decisive action, in response
to DPRK's nuclear test on 9 October, sends a strong signal to the DPRK
Government that the international community will not tolerate their
irresponsible and provocative
actions.</p><p><a name="06103014000032"></a>The resolution is
targeted at stopping the DPRK's WMD and missile programmes and changing
the behaviour of the regime in Pyongyang. We now expect the DPRK to
comply with the resolution and return to the six-party talks without
pre-conditions. If it does comply fully with the resolution's
provisions and if the talks resume successfully, the UK would expect
the Security Council to lift the measures imposed by the
resolution.</p><p><a name="06103014000033"></a>The resolution backs
these demands by imposing sanctions against the DPRK. All states have a
legal obligation to comply. The individual sanctions comprise an assets
freeze and travel ban on individuals and entities involved in or
supporting DPRK's nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes; a ban on
making funds available to those individuals and entities; a ban on the
export or supply of certain substantial military items, nuclear
materials, missiles and sensitive technologies; the export of luxury
goods; the provision of any technical assistance, training or other
advice in relation to the military or nuclear/ballistic-missile items
and the procurement of any of the sensitive items so that DPRK cannot
export proliferation-sensitive technologies to other countries. The
resolution also includes a provision calling on states to inspect cargo
going to and from DPRK subject to action being in conformity with
international law and member states' own national laws, where such
action is necessary to prevent illicit trafficking in prohibited goods
and
materials.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61030-wms0001.htmstate_6"></a><a name="06103014000007"></a>Pensions:

Policing, Security and Community Safety (Tony McNulty) has made the
following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06103014000040"></a>Following the
decision to abandon plans for police force mergers in the immediate
future, I agreed in principle to provide police authorities with
assistance towards the additional costs incurred through the
preparatory work they had carried out. The Home Office invited claims
for the marginal costs incurred and these have now been received from
all authorities. The Metropolitan Police Service and City of London
Police have claimed no additional
costs.</p><p><a name="06103014000041"></a>In deciding how best to
contribute towards these claims, consideration has been given to the
need to treat all forces fairly given the wide disparity in the amounts
claimed. Other factors included:</p>the
affordability of the total amount of money to be paid
out;where costs have been incurred by
individual forces or authorities on behalf of others;
andspecific advice given to individual
police forces and police authorities to make financial commitments,
including an undertaking to provide additional funds to support the
work of the pilot strategic force merger of Lancashire and Cumbria
constabularies.<p><a name="06103014000042"></a>An upper
limit of &#163;100,000 has been applied to the amount to be paid to
any single police authority, in line with these considerations.
Exceptions to this upper limit are:</p>Lancashire
and Cumbria police authorities, because their claims include joint
programme office commitments undertaken on specific advice from the
Home Office which also undertook to meet the exceptional start-up costs
associated with the pioneer status of this merger
group;Lincolnshire police authority, because
its claim includes premises costs on behalf of its merger group
incurred on specific advice from the Home Office; and
Dorset police authority, because its claim is made on
behalf of the five south-west region forces and authorities
(Avon and Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, Dorset, Gloucestershire and
Wiltshire).

co-ordinate rural development funding with other EU derived

introduction of domestic water charges from 1 April 2007 as
part of their programme of public service reinvestment and reform in
Northern Ireland. The possible costs of delay have not been calculated
in any detail and it would require significant effort to do so.
However, in the event of a delay in the introduction of charges until
April 2008, it is estimated that some &#163;80 million to &#163;90
million of income from customers would be forgone. Additionally access
to the borrowing power of up to &#163;200 million annually under the
Reinvestment and Reform Initiative is conditional upon the introduction
of water charging. In the absence of detailed costing, the range of
&#163;130 million to &#163;180 million represents an indicative
estimate of the impact of delay.</p>
