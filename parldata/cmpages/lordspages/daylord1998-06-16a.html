<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Irvine of Lairg): </B>  My Lords, before business begins, I take the opportunity to inform the House that I will be visiting the Combined Court at Winchester and meeting local magistrates on Friday, 19th June. Accordingly, I trust the House will grant me leave of absence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80616-01_para0"></a>What is their policy with respect to the prescribing of beta-interferon for patients with multiple sclerosis.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80616-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Jay of Paddington): </B>  My Lords, the noble Lord will of course be aware from his own distinguished career in medicine that Her Majesty's Government do not have policies about individual prescribing decisions, which are naturally best left to members of the clinical professions. However, in November 1995 the NHS Executive issued a circular to health authorities and trusts about the introduction of a newly licensed beta-interferon product for multiple sclerosis. Copies of it are available in the Library. The circular suggested that the product should be prescribed by hospital neurologists where clinically appropriate. It asked health authorities to implement local arrangements to manage the entry of such drugs into the NHS. The guidance in that circular is still in force.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I appreciate to the full the dilemma for many health authorities faced with the prospect of paying for a drug which costs &#163;10,000 per patient per year. However, does the noble Baroness accept that the evidence indicating the benefit of the drug in the relaxing and remitting form of multiple sclerosis has been known for some time, but that a recent multi-centre European trial has shown that the drug also produces substantial benefit in the chronic progressive form of the disease? Is it therefore acceptable that many health authorities and trusts are refusing to allow prescription of the drug and others are offering only token support? One per cent. of patients <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>with multiple sclerosis in the UK receive it, compared with 7 per cent. in France, Germany and Italy and 15 per cent. in Australia and Greece.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I naturally hesitate to have any discussion based on my own understanding of the references that the noble Lord made to individual trials of the beta-interferon product. As I understand it--and I bow to the noble Lord's greater clinical knowledge--there are some conditions within multiple sclerosis which are affected by some of the drugs which are at present on the market and some which are not. One trial in particular, which I understand the recent health technology assessment of the NHS conducted, concluded that it was poor value for money in certain circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-01_para1"></a>However, that certainly does not prevent the Government from feeling that the, as it is called, "post-code" prescribing decisions by individual health authorities affect the understanding of the national care that we want to see offered under the health service. That is why we are introducing new ways of organising the introduction of drugs. For example, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence--and details will be published shortly--will issue guidelines to health authorities about their prescribing practices. They will perhaps be slightly more forceful than the previous ones.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, when the Minister talks about value for money, is not the whole issue in the case of this drug its cost? The cost is now half what it was when it was introduced. As the noble Lord, Lord Walton, said, recent research has shown that it is effective in treating not only the form that the Minister mentioned but also all forms of multiple sclerosis. Yet, as I understand it--and I ask the Minister to confirm this--from the time when patients are told that they would benefit from it and should definitely have it, there is a procedural delay of over six months before the drug is received. It is a deliberate cost-saving tactic.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I can only re-emphasise what I said in reply to the supplementary question by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, that we are aware that there are examples of what is called colloquially "post-code" prescribing. Through it, some people are prevented from having the drug but others are not. It is unfortunate and something which we are determined to improve through the national guidelines, the national performance framework and the national clinical service frameworks. Those will come into force once we can achieve the legislative process through Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-01_para2"></a>As to the specifics about individual patients being asked to wait six months, I suspect that that has to do with the individual decisions of health authorities. Unfortunately, they vary across the country.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, because interferon is being used now for the treatment of <P>


<a name="column_1443"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1443</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hepatitis C and other conditions as well as multiple sclerosis, what are the chances of the pharmaceutical industry bringing down prices?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, that is a complicated industrial question. It is something about which patient groups feel strongly, and probably rightly so. It would be helpful if pressures could be brought to bear on the pharmaceutical industry for the introduction of effective and cost-effective drugs at lower prices.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-01_para3"></a>To return to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, which I believe to be the same as that being made by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, the decisions in relation to these drugs should be made not simply on cost terms, but on cost-effectiveness terms. It is not simply a question of the marketing price, but of the relative marketing price in terms of other methods of treatment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that this is a tricky question? Clinical judgment is of little value if, when it is exercised, the health authority will not fund the necessary provision. I know of some health authorities which do not keep up to date with modern developments--I can provide my noble friend with evidence of that statement if necessary. Would it be worth while for the Government to monitor whether health authorities keep up to date with modern developments so that they know whether or not to take action?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that it is a tricky question. It is a question of balance between the individual clinical freedom of practitioners in the medical profession and the understanding of local health authorities. I re-emphasise to my noble friend that we hope that, with the introduction of so-called clinical governance, variations from the expected good practice which will be recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence will be increasingly challenged. We expect that guidance to be implemented consistently across the NHS. How well that happens in practice will determine whether and how NICE's powers may or may not be strengthened in the future.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, following the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, is there anything to prevent the Government from acting as a bulk buyer to bring down the price of drugs?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, that is precisely what the NHS is; that is, a bulk buyer of drugs. That is why, overall, patients who obtain drugs on prescription through the NHS do so at competitive prices, particularly if we draw comparisons with our neighbours in Europe.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Thurlow: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the promising evidence that MS sufferers can be restored to normal health and activity by controlled <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>diet and lifestyle change is mainly anecdotal at present? Will she encourage research to endeavour to establish the facts?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord was kind enough to tell me that he might raise this issue. I asked people what the situation was on research into the matter, which is broadly in the area of complementary medicine for MS. At the moment the people involved in funding clinical trials, which would be the basis on which the NHS would make a decision about treatment, are not intending to conduct such trials.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-01_spnew13"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the NHS White Paper commits the Government to ensuring consistent access to beneficial care across the NHS. Yet the unfortunate fact is that the strong guidance issued in 1995 by the NHS Executive has been ignored by many health authorities. Perhaps I can draw the Minister a little more on what she said about the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. What prospect is there that any guidance which may be issued by the institute will carry any more force than the guidance already promulgated? If it does not, then these inequalities in treatment will persist.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, we are aware of the concerns expressed by the noble Earl. I wish I could be tempted into being slightly more exact about the terms of the consultative paper which will be issued on the subject. All I can say is that I promise it will not be more than a matter of days, let alone weeks, before such information is available.

<A NAME = "80616-02_para0"></a>Whether they are still unable to reply to Peers' Written Questions by e-mail.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80616-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, considerable progress is being made towards implementing a system for delivering electronic Answers to parliamentary Questions. Many issues have needed to be considered, including security. We are getting close to resolving those and hope to be in a position to make an announcement fairly shortly. It will be our intention to consult noble Lords on any proposals.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to hear that Answer, which is a great deal better than I expected, having asked a similar Question in written form over many months. It is astonishing that it has taken 13 months for a government who claim to be cool, with it and wired to produce such a complicated Answer to a simple Question. Can the noble Lord assure me that when this announcement is made after such a long gestation we will receive a live-born infant and not just wind?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may turn away wrath with a soft answer by expressing <P>


<a name="column_1445"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1445</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my gratitude to the noble Lord for pursuing this matter over a number of months, even though he now seems to be getting a little impatient. I can assure him that the announcement, when it comes, will address the issues, which are not simple, involved in providing Answers to Written Questions by electronic mail. For example, it is important that any Answers which are sent to noble Lords should have their provenance well established. In other words, it should be as clear that they come from the Minister as a signed Written Answer. It is also important that they should arrive on time and not be delayed by, for example, a server going down.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, in view of the fact that all Written Answers appear in Hansard, what is the secrecy problem?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I did not say there was a secrecy problem; I said there was a security problem, which is not quite the same thing. It is important that an Answer should go first to the noble Lord who has asked the Question before it goes anywhere else.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the Minute Room already welcomes Questions for Written Answer by e-mail? If the Member wants the Answers in electronic form, he or she can get them from the PDVN the day after they are published. Is the Minister prepared to say that Ministers will answer correspondence by e-mail; and, if so, where can Members find the e-mail addresses of Ministers?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, in answer to the noble Lord's first question, Questions are available electronically after they have been replied to and received by the noble Lord asking the Question. There is no issue of secrecy or security on that. As to the question of correspondence, I think that will naturally follow from the solution to the problems I have described. When that time comes, there will be no difficulty in providing noble Lords with e-mail addresses.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that it is not exactly the brightest spark on the Opposition Front Bench who has asked the Question today? In relation to Answers by electronic mail, as I look round your Lordships' House, is there not a strong argument for slowing life down rather than speeding it up?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not agree with my noble friend on either of the points that he makes. I do not think unnecessary delay in administrative procedures is to anyone's benefit.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have to be honest about these things. The provision of Answers by e-mail, which is the subject of the Question, does not bring with it, alas, any greater speed in decision-making in government departments. Any complaints which the noble Countess has should be addressed to the department concerned, although I will certainly pass them on.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Randall of St. Budeaux: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that in Britain now a number of companies are paperless? I had the opportunity of visiting Andersen Consulting in Paris a few months ago. It has no paper at all. What consideration have the Government given to having a paperless Parliament; or if not that, how about having a less paper-using Parliament?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we are a long way from a paperless society. The Government have well advanced plans, which will be announced fairly shortly, for an improvement in electronic communications between government and citizens and of course parliamentarians as well. But anyone who thinks that that will result in a paperless society has another think coming.

<P>
</UL><A NAME="80616-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, the Home Secretary announced on 30th April that he had asked the Permanent Secretary to investigate the circumstances in which Home Office officials had become aware that Mary Bell was proposing to co-operate in the writing of a book about her life. My right honourable friend has asked for the investigation to be completed by the end of this month and will publish the main findings. A separate internal review of the legal position concerning criminal memoirs is continuing. I understand that the Press Complaints Commission is still considering a complaint that the newspaper serialisation of this book was in breach of the industry's code of practice.

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1447</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>issues raised back in April by the publication of that book and that kicking the matter into the long grass in Whitehall is not an adequate response; neither is it for us to rely on the Press Complaints Commission, which seems to be adept at slamming the stable door rather than dealing with press abuses? Can the Minister give an assurance that the House will return to this issue constantly until we have a proper response from government and from the Press Complaints Commission and better behaviour from the media themselves?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, there is no question of kicking the issue into the long grass. The investigation was announced on 30th April and I have just indicated that the Home Secretary has directed that he wants it concluded by the end of this month. That is two months, which is not a bad effort. As regards the PCC, I know from my conversations with the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, that it is considering this matter. But it is not an easy matter, capable of a simplistic answer.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord accept that if the Government are contemplating legislation-- I do not know whether they are: we shall have to wait until the end of the month--the matter may be difficult to resolve without contravening the provisions of the Human Rights Bill which was recently passed by this House and is now going through another place? Will he give a commitment that the Government will consider carefully the relevant aspects of the Human Rights Bill in relation to these matters?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Yes, my Lords. It is important to bear in mind that I drew a careful distinction between the internal investigation to which I referred in my reply to the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and a review of the legal position. If one wants a review of the legal position, legislation may be required which would have to bear carefully in mind Article 10 on freedom of expression. However, other articles are important; namely, the right to decent respect for private and family life.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord clarify a point about an often repeated desire by Ministers not to see criminals profit from their criminal past? Does this apply to those who have been convicted of criminal offences abroad?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-02_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I do not think one can give a global answer to that question. Some people will have been convicted of criminal offences abroad which neither the noble Lord nor the rest of your Lordships would think ought to be correctly designated as crime. Therefore, one cannot produce a simplistic answer. It is our view that it is morally wrong for criminals who have been convicted in this country of what is properly described in a civilised jurisdiction as crime should profit from crime. But the noble Lord will know that the ability to recover funds from those <P>

<A NAME="80616-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, my reference in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, about a decent respect for privacy and family life was directed to the daughter of Mary Bell, who is wholly innocent of any wrong-doing and has had her life irredeemably damaged. Whether or not the Press Complaints Commission will consider that aspect I do not know. However, knowing the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, as I do, I think it more likely than not that it will.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80616-03_para0"></a>Why Geografix was not included in the shortlist of companies who have been invited to submit formal tenders for electronic tagging contracts.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80616-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, we have selected four companies to bid to operate electronic monitoring services for home detention curfew and other uses throughout England and Wales. Geografix Limited did not score sufficiently highly in comparison to the other expressions of interest which were evaluated against financial and technical criteria designed with the new contract requirements in mind. This decision is in no way a criticism of the service which the company has delivered during the trials of electronically enforced curfew orders since 1995, which has been excellent. But the needs of the new contracts are different from those required for the trials.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord confirm that at a conference of probation officers in November, the Home Secretary singled out Geografix for high praise for the quality of its work, and more particularly, for its offender management practice, which achieved an unparalleled 90 per cent. compliance with curfew orders? Will the Minister say more as to why a company with such a remarkable track record, which has been so effective and successful, was rejected and why the criteria for selection were inconsistent with the information pack issued and signed by the Home Secretary?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that the criteria were inconsistent. I repeat with great pleasure that the performance of Geografix has been extremely good. What we did properly and in the usual way was to advertise openly for expressions of interest. The noble Baroness shakes her head. We advertised for expressions of interest in the Official Journal of the <P>

Geografix was not one of them because it did not do sufficiently well on the assessment of criteria which were specifically designed not to discriminate against smaller companies.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Janner of Braunstone: </B>   My Lords, whoever provides the electronic tagging equipment, can my noble friend say how greatly its use is to be increased and what effect it will have on the horrendous increase in the number of people in prison?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, as I believe my noble friend will know, under the Crime and Disorder Bill presently going through Parliament, a home detention curfew will be introduced. At any one time that is estimated to produce a reduction in the number of prison places required--and I stress at any one time--of about 3,000. Thereafter, if sentences are developed to include a curfew or a tracking element, then it is open to the courts, whose discretion it is, not to pass prison sentences but to use the alternatives which will be available.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that electronic tagging will play a very useful part in the early release scheme for inmates? Is he aware that there is a drawback in the sense that those who do not have a home to go to will not benefit? There are a number of groups of people in prison who may not necessarily benefit. Will the Minister ensure that there is some kind of contractual arrangement provided by those who are contracted to produce electronic tagging to show that such facilities are available in voluntary hostels and probation hostels so that vulnerable groups will also benefit from the early release schemes?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, are valid. There has to be a risk assessment before a prisoner is released. If a prisoner has somewhere settled to go, I would have thought that that would feature in the balance. There have been over 1,400 curfew orders made and a gratifyingly high success rate of 80 per cent. successful completions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us how many of the companies are British? What are the implications in accepting one of the estimates for British employment? Will it increase employment prospects by a certain number of jobs or will there be a loss of jobs if the successful applicant is not British?

<A NAME="80616-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, from their descriptions and judging by their names, the majority of the companies appear to be British. Obviously, I cannot know immediately as to where the holding company may lie. If it is of assistance I shall research all 11 companies and find out exactly in which jurisdiction <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the holding company resides. I do not know that at the moment; but I shall certainly do what I have said and write to the noble Baroness.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may come back on that. I understand that none of the four companies which finally submitted bids is British. I shall be very grateful if the answer can be given to me in due course.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I shall do better than that. I shall research all 11 companies. I believe that two at least of the four are British. I shall obviously check that with care and cast the net wider than the noble Baroness has asked.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, I believe the noble Lord said that 11 companies expressed interest initially and that from them a list of four was selected. That sounds very good practice. However, what happens in the case of a company which has not tendered before but which has a specific interest in putting in a tender? Will such a company have any difficulty getting on to the list? To close the list, even if it is a long one, has inherent dangers in it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the Government have to adopt prudent commercial practice. If one advertises and asks for expressions of interest and there are 11 replies, and that number is whittled down to four, it seems to me that that is a proper way to behave and also a fair way if the opportunities have been publicly advertised.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, the Minister spoke about drafting the specification in such a manner which would allow smaller companies to tender. That is very welcome. Is he aware of certain anxieties that contracts have been awarded preferentially to some of the bigger companies in the past thereby reducing the amount of competition in the future? Is he satisfied that the procedures for tendering are now such as to ensure that all government tenders do not finish up with a few companies?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I repeat that one has to put the matter out to advertisement. We did that. One has then to wait for expressions of interest, and we did that. Thereafter we used criteria which do not discriminate against small firms. Four have been invited to tender. In due time, bearing in mind the respective interests, the best of those four will be chosen. I believe that to be fair.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I find the noble Lord's answers somewhat surprising. We have heard that Geografix is already doing this kind of work. It has been praised by the Home Secretary for the work it has done. Surely it would have been fair to allow that company to move from the list of 11, on which, presumably its name <P>


<a name="column_1451"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1451</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appeared, to the final shortlist of four so that it could have another chance of proving, as it has done already, that it can do the job.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, no. We advertised and asked for expressions of interest. There was then a careful assessment in the public interest--bearing in mind that public funds are involved--to see which companies should move from the 11 to the four. The mere fact that Geografix did extremely well on a limited basis and in a limited geographic area is no guarantee nor an overwhelming indication that it would be one of the best companies to get on the list of four companies.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, there has been some concern expressed about parts of the criminal justice system being privatised. I believe that that is now accepted. Can my noble friend advise us whether those parts of the system which are in the private sector will be owned and controlled within British jurisdiction at least?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-03_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I have already indicated to the noble Baroness that as regards the 11 companies I shall research her questions. I cannot say that forever and a day all aspects of privatised activity in the prison estate are bound to be within the ultimate control of a company within this jurisdiction.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80616-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, after the Business Statement last Thursday and further discussions by the usual channels, it has been agreed that two full days will now be set aside for the Second Reading of the Scotland Bill. Those two days will be tomorrow and Thursday. The draft of the list of speakers, produced after consultation within the usual channels, is now available in the Government Whips' Office. It had been hoped to accommodate on Thursday the debate set down in the name of my noble friend Lord Barnett, but, given the number of Peers who now wish to speak on the Scotland Bill, that is no longer realistic and a further date will be found for that debate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, on behalf of these Benches, perhaps I may say how grateful I am that the Government Chief Whip has come to that conclusion. It shows admirable wisdom on his part. On the question of the debate in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, as the House will know, the noble Lord had the prime slot on Thursday afternoon immediately after Questions, so will the Government try to find an equally prominent slot as quickly as possible for that important debate on the report on the European Central Bank, produced by the Select Committee on the European Communities?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, all reports from your Lordships' Select Committees are important, not least <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>when they are on a topic such as the European Central Bank. The chairman of the Select Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, has today written to my noble friend the Leader of the House asking for time to be found to debate that report. Every effort will be made in that regard. The points that the noble Lord the Opposition Chief Whip has just made will certainly be taken into account.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may express my appreciation of the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. I know that he did not press any noble Lord to put down his name to speak on the Scotland Bill! Indeed, I wondered whether I should speak on the Barnett formula on Second Reading, but decided against that. Perhaps I may advise my noble friend Lord Carter that I recognise that he has problems with the timetable. However, there has not been a debate on the European Central Bank in your Lordships' House for a very long time, if ever, and it is an important issue. I hope that my noble friend will be able to assure us of an early debate in prime time on that vital subject on which I know that many noble Lords on all sides of the House would like to speak.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I always listen with very great interest to everything that my noble friend Lord Barnett says. I shall read Hansard very carefully and bear in mind all that he has said.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord accept my congratulations on having come to that decision? The document in question is the finest piece of speculative soothsaying since the first publication of Old Moore's Almanac and ought to be studied with great care by all Members of your Lordships' House.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, if I have managed to please both the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, and the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, I am not doing too badly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Tordoff: </B>   My Lords, from what the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, said, it was not clear whether he was referring to the report produced by my noble friend or to the Scotland Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, on behalf of at least six Peers on these Benches, perhaps I may express what I hope will not prove to be premature appreciation of the consideration presently being given to our modest request for an alternative day for the Northern Ireland release of terrorists Bill, which was scheduled, I understand, for consideration on what is polling day for the assembly. On those grounds, I am afraid that our absence from the polling stations might have been misunderstood.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of that. In fact, I have taken fully into account the points made last Thursday. Active discussions are proceeding through the usual channels to see whether we can resolve the situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   moved Amendment No. 241N: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 90, line 37, leave out subsection (3) and insert--
<BR>
("(3) Section 80 shall apply in relation to the code as it applies in relation to a code of practice under section 79.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: Government Amendment No. 241N provides for the code of practice on LEA-school relations to be subject to parliamentary approval. This meets the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee which suggested that the code be subject to approval by the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para6"></a>I am happy to accept the recommendation of the committee. I am also grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, for tabling Amendment No. 243, which would have the same effect as this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para7"></a>It is vitally important that all the partners in the education service work together effectively if we are to achieve the challenging targets we have set ourselves for raising standards. The code will play a key role in establishing and maintaining a positive relationship between local education authorities and schools in the new framework. Getting this relationship right will be essential to our success.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para8"></a>Making the code subject to parliamentary approval will allow a further opportunity to ensure that the detail of the code is right. The government amendment achieves this by applying the procedure set out for the parliamentary scrutiny of the code of practice on admissions to any codes made under Clause 119. This will allow Parliament a full opportunity to comment on the draft of the code--as revised following our current wide consultation exercise--before it can be put into force.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para9"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord is slightly less economical in its approach and would require a couple of additional consequential amendments. I hope, therefore, that they feel able to withdraw their amendment in favour of the approach taken by the Government's amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para10"></a>Amendment No. 241G has been included in this group, but perhaps it will be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak to it after it has been spoken to by either the noble Lord, Lord Tope, or the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   The noble Lord has invited us to speak to our amendment now. If that is not thought to be the wrong way round, that is what I propose to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para11"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the code of practice for securing effective relationships between LEAs and the maintained schools takes account of the functions of an LEA in relation to children with special educational needs. As it stands, the draft code of practice on LEA-school relations specifically excludes SEN responsibilities, indicating that they are covered elsewhere in the code of practice. However, the code of practice looks at special educational needs from the point of view of the process of the child's various stages of assessment. It does not look at the whole interface between the school and the LEA with regard to special educational needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para12"></a>In addition, in paragraph 8 of the draft code, one of the criteria for including particular functions in the code on LEA school relations is stated as its relevance to raising school standards with a reminder that that is government policy. In the debates on Clause 6 on the education development plan, repeated assurances were given about the importance attached to addressing special educational needs as part of the agenda on raising standards for all children. To omit SEN from the code would be to undermine those assurances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para13"></a>In addition, the relationship between schools and LEAs on the subject of special educational needs and the curriculum is complex. Those are the three reasons why we thought it important to table our modest amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-04_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My amendment, Amendment No. 243, is grouped with Amendment No. 241N. I thank the noble Lord for what he said and for the fact that the Government have tabled their own amendment, which the noble Lord claims is more effective and more economic than mine.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para14"></a>I have one question. The penultimate part of my amendment asks that for the purposes of counting the 40 days no account should be taken of any period during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued. In other words, the counting of the 40-day period should be frozen during that time. May I be assured that those provisions of subsection (7) are subsumed by the government amendment?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para15"></a>There are now a number of questions about the status of the code in relation to, for example, education action zones. It appears to cut across some of the rhetoric used about the establishment of the action zones. It seems extraordinary that there is not more mention of the roles of the school organisation committees and of the adjudicator. It seems extraordinary that a document, to which local authorities will have to have regard, is to be on the face of the Bill when that is not the case for the most undemocratic of the Government's proposals. <P>


<a name="column_1455"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I refer to the establishment of the school organisation committees and to the role of the adjudicator. They will take upon themselves a great deal of the work which has hitherto been the remit of the local authorities. It would be helpful if something could be said about the interaction of that and about the fact that nothing on the face of the Bill subsumes the interaction between the LEAs and the roles of the adjudicator and of the school organisation committees.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para16"></a>As to special needs, referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, the functions of local authorities are enormously enhanced by the Bill. In almost every clause there is a new function for local education authorities, particularly in planning. We now have the interim admissions document. There are even more hares running in terms of the functions of local authorities and the way in which LEAs relate to schools and the education establishment generally. The code of practice will be a particularly important document.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para17"></a>My final point displays my depression about the whole of this matter. The code of practice is no more than exhortation. In reality, the law will require local education authorities only to have regard to the code of practice. There is no obligation upon them whatsoever to do anything other than have regard to the code. All one has is exhortation about a light touch, no intervention without good cause and what I would regard as a requirement about the way in which LEAs relate to their schools to achieve what the Government want; namely, to give as much autonomy at school level with as light a touch as possible at LEA level. It adds up to no more than exhortation, with some kind of threat that if the Secretary of State is not impressed with the way in which local education authorities behave he will not take power under this Bill but will rely on an old power. That will be invoked only if it can be proven that the LEA has no good reason for exercising its functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-04_para18"></a>It will not take an LEA very long to realise that the scope for intervention and taking a slightly heavier hand as opposed to a light touch in approaching schools is considerable. All it must do is prove that it is concerned about a school on the grounds that people in the community may be complaining, or there are articles in the newspapers, or there is a hint that something is going on in a particular department, or perhaps a teacher is not marking work--the kinds of operational matters that should be for the governors and the school itself. I believe that the import of the code of practice, being no more than exhortation, is deeply worrying given the enormous number of new functions for LEAs and in particular the practice and work of the organisational committees and the adjudicator.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I support what has been said by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood. I urge the Government to accept Amendment No. 241G. As I understand it, the special educational needs code of practice is designed to show how the assessments are worked through, not the relationship between schools and the local education authorities. It is important that this amendment is included in the Bill and that schools do not start with one code of practice for their <P>


<a name="column_1456"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1456</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>relationships with local education authorities which must be amended in a few months' time to take account of special educational needs.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I believe that I have three tasks to perform. The first simple task is to assure the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that the Government's amendment will achieve exactly what her amendment seeks to achieve in relation to the calculation of the 40-day period. Indeed, the amendment of the noble Baroness is taken word for word from Clause 80. That is what the government amendment applies to the code of practice. As in her amendment, so Clause 80 provides:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(7) In this section '40-day period' ... means ... no account being taken of any period during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-05_para0"></a>I refer next to Amendment No. 241G as spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling this amendment. It draws attention to the fact that special educational needs are an important dimension of LEA-school relations. The principles which are set out in the code of practice will certainly apply to the relationship between LEAs and special schools and to the provision that mainstream schools make for statemented pupils. Those principles include raising standards; intervention in inverse proportion to success; partnership and co-operation; and zero tolerance of under-performance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-05_para1"></a>Our starting point with the draft code for England has been that in most circumstances the way LEAs, head teachers and governors use their powers and fulfil their responsibilities will apply equally to mainstream and SEN provision. But we also recognise that some special schools and children with special needs in mainstream schools require additional or different kinds of support from their LEA. When considering our consultation responses we shall look particularly carefully at those which suggest areas where different treatment may be needed. We shall certainly take account of these in preparing the final version of the code. However, I do not want to rule out the possibility of having separate guidance relating specifically to SEN provision if in the light of responses to our consultation that seems to be the most appropriate way to cover it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-05_para2"></a>I can assure the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, that SEN issues will be given full and proper consideration. This is a very important part of the role of LEAs and we recognise the need to get the arrangements absolutely right. The list in subsection (6) of this clause is not intended to be exhaustive. It is therefore already open to us to include SEN issues in the code of practice in whatever way is considered most appropriate. As already discussed, noble Lords will have another opportunity to comment, if they are dissatisfied with the approach we decide to adopt, when the revised version of the code is laid before both Houses. In view of these assurances, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment. In the meantime, I shall be happy to receive any further advice that she or the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, wishes to offer on this subject.
<P>


<a name="column_1457"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1457</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-05_para3"></a>My third task is to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, about the nature of the code of practice. First, I assure her that the code will apply to the relationship between local education authorities in all circumstances, including education action zones. It is comprehensive in that respect. The noble Baroness claimed that the code was only exhortation and clearly wished, although she did not spell it out, greater central control than the approach taken by the Government. It will be open to schools to appeal against unreasonable action by local education authorities, and the Secretary of State in considering any such appeal must have regard to the code. Therefore, the code is a good deal more than exhortation; it applies to all parties and provides a procedure for the resolution of disputes. The Government do not fear either that this code will depart from the light touch that has been discussed or that it will be unworkable in the sense that it is only exhortation, as the noble Baroness believes. On that basis, I beg to move Amendment No. 241N.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Before the noble Lord formally moves the amendment, I do not seek greater central control. My amendment seeks the opposite: greater autonomy at school level. I suggest that schools that are successful and improve year on year should be left to get on with it and there should not be any intervention at all by the local education authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-05_time0"></A><H5>3.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is a point of view. If the noble Baroness says that there should be no intervention whatsoever, we would argue the contrary. However successful the school, the need for a properly thought out education provision in any area involves a local education authority. If the accusation is more limited--that there would be unreasonable intervention by the local education authority--that is answered by the provisions for appeal to which I referred.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I do not find myself entirely satisfied with the response from the Minister. During this Committee stage, there has been a long struggle to get the special requirements of pupils with special educational needs on to the face of the Bill. That process has occurred with other education Bills as they have passed through this House. My recollection is that more often than not that recognition was put on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-05_para4"></a>It is not terribly consoling to find that some reference will be made in accordance with requests made by other people during the consultation process on the code, even given the fact that the code will be discussed in your Lordships' House. The code will include--I sought to write the list down; I have not completed it yet--the education development plan, warnings to schools on standards, the suspended rights to a delegated budget, reports from governors, staffing of schools and discipline within schools. In all those areas there should be specific responsibilities, for example, on governors, to account for how they have dealt with pupils with special needs. I do not include pupils with statements because those pupils are usually accompanied by a small <P>


<a name="column_1458"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1458</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amount of money--it may not be a large amount--and some additional help. However, a large number of children have special educational needs. A wide range of different needs are covered. I believe, as do others, that those children's needs are as important as the needs of children with statements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-05_para5"></a>This would be an excellent place to insert on the face of the Bill the Government's concern for the well-being of children with special educational needs. It is no good saying, as the Minister has done in the past, that this is a special interest. It is not a special interest in the ordinary recognisable sense of the word. We are talking of up to 20 per cent. of the population and their parents. This may be one of the two best places to put the Government's concern on the face of the Bill. The code will cover many of the relations between LEAs and schools. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, pointed out the increased responsibilities of schools for the curriculum. Many on this side share the Government's concern. This is the ideal place to put that concern on the face of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I confess that I did not expect to satisfy the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas. The noble Baroness knows that whenever the issue has been raised--it has been raised properly on a number of occasions as we have considered the Bill--the Government have tried to listen to, and evaluate, the relative merits of the different amendments relating to special educational needs. We have sought to consider, as we undertook to do, what might best be done between now and Report stage. We have undertaken to talk to any noble Lords who wish to discuss these issues. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, in company with the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, have already visited the department to set out their stall, so to speak, and to discuss the matter with officials. That offer is open to anyone who wishes to discuss with Ministers or officials the issues of special educational needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-05_para6"></a>I understand the noble Baroness's disappointment over what I said. I understand her point that the provision of parliamentary scrutiny for a draft code of practice does not meet what she intended to achieve. The six considerations set out in the draft code of practice, as I said, are not intended to be exhaustive. The consultation process has only just begun. I hope that that process will meet the points the noble Baroness raises. In any case there will be an opportunity for further debate on Report.

<A NAME="80616-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch </B>   moved Amendment 244A: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 119, insert the following new clause--
<BR>
("Inspection of voluntary aided and foundation schools 
<center><B>Inspection of voluntary aided and foundation schools </B></center><BR>
.--(1) The School Inspections Act 1996 shall be amended as follows.
<BR>
(2) In section 25 (power of local education authority to inspect maintained school for specific purpose), before "Where" there shall be inserted "Subject to section 25A below,".
<BR>
(3) After that section there shall be inserted--
<BR>
"Inspection of voluntary aided and foundation schools. 
<BR>
25A.--(1) In the case of a voluntary aided or foundation school to which the special measures provisions of this Act do not apply at the time, a local education authority may only exercise their powers under section 25 above with the agreement of the governing body.
<BR>
(2) Where the governing body of a school does not agree to a request by a local education authority to exercise their powers under section 25, the authority may appeal against the decision of the governing body to the Secretary of State.
<BR>
(3) Where a local education authority make an appeal under subsection (2) the decision of the Secretary of State shall be binding on both parties.".").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment aims to put on the face of the Bill the precise meaning of what we understand the Secretary of State to be saying about local authorities carrying out their functions. The draft code and the School Inspections Act make it absolutely clear that a local education authority may exercise its rights under Section 25 only for the purpose of exercising statutory functions. LEA functions are considerable. I have catalogued some. One has only to read through this considerable Bill to realise that. They will be even greater when the Bill is enacted. Many are very general. A large number are left open to wide interpretation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para1"></a>Not only does the provision undermine the autonomy of good schools--a point I made a moment ago--but a local education authority could make life difficult for a school and still keep within the provisions of the code of practice. The LEA has only to argue that it is doing something in the interest of raising standards or school improvement under the functions in the Bill and that would pass muster.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para2"></a>The education development plan is one example. It is a new function which will open up many opportunities for LEAs to intervene in school life. As is well known, grant-maintained schools have functioned successfully without being subject to those provisions. We understand there to be a willingness in the department to sustain the level of autonomy that has been enjoyed by grant-maintained schools and to build on that. The Government have said that they want schools to be able to exercise greater autonomy. That is set out in paragraph 2 of the code of practice. The first words in that paragraph are the Government's starting point: there is a presumption in favour of school autonomy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para3"></a>Paragraphs 3 and 4 refer to the need for that autonomy to be matched by accountability and the need to build in the necessary checks and balances. That is understood. My amendment will give statutory force to the Government's sentiments while providing a right of appeal to the Secretary of State by a local education <P>


<a name="column_1460"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1460</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority which felt that a school was being unreasonable and hindering its ability to fulfil its statutory duty. It builds in the safeguard that where a local authority believes that it has a good case for intervention where the school is being difficult, it is possible to have that case considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para4"></a>The Minister will note that I have restricted the amendment to voluntary aided and foundation schools. There might be difficulty extending the provision to other types of schools, especially community schools, which under the provisions of the Bill have opted to remain community schools. From what the Minister said at a previous stage of the Bill I understand that about a year or so after Royal Assent community schools will have an option to become foundation schools. In other words, they will opt for yet more autonomy. If they remain community schools they are directly accountable to the local education authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para5"></a>I have restricted the amendment to foundation schools for the reasons I have set out. As other schools have a statutory relationship with the LEA, the right of access will work differently.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para6"></a>It may be that my amendment is in the wrong place in the Bill. If that is the case I shall be advised by the noble Lord. However, the point I wish to make is this. Schools which are performing well and are achieving at a high level, and schools which are showing discernible improvement year on year and are showing no grounds for concern, should be protected from an LEA which might wish to move in for inspectorial reasons. My amendment does no more than codify on the face of the Bill an important protection for the present grant-maintained schools and what will become foundation schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para7"></a>Whether the foundations come from the cohort of grant-maintained schools or from the cohort of community schools when that part of the Bill is implemented makes no odds. It is an important way of allaying some of the fears behind some of the press comment we have seen in the past few days about the Oratory School. It is no secret that Hammersmith and Fulham LEA is looking forward with relish to seeing the school return to it, the LEA having increased powers under the Bill. If the Government are serious, the amendment will protect such schools from undue interference from the local education authorities. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Baroness in introducing the amendment expressed doubt about whether it is in the proper place in the Bill. She also commented on its scope. They are matters of fact to which I must respond. So far as we understand, there is no problem about the amendment's place in the Bill. It would have the effect which the noble Baroness intends. However, I must remind her about the provisions of the School Inspections Act 1996. Under that Act local education authorities have a right of access to any school maintained by them where they require information about the school for the purposes of exercising any of their functions and where it is not reasonably practicable to gain the information in any <P>


<a name="column_1461"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1461</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other manner. The Bill provides that that right of access shall be extended to voluntary-aided and foundation schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para8"></a>The proposed new clause would give the governing bodies of voluntary-aided and foundation schools almost total discretion over the extent to which the local authority was allowed access to the school. I accept that under the noble Baroness's amendment local authorities would have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State and that the Secretary of State's decision would be final. But our view is that the approach provided for in existing legislation and the draft code of practice on LEA-school relations will give schools adequate safeguards against the risk of unreasonable action on the part of the LEA. The code takes a much more positive view of LEA-school relations. It encourages collaborative working arrangements rather than assuming that there will be disputes and relying on rights of appeal to the Secretary of State to resolve disputes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para9"></a>The present draft of the code uses Section 25 of the School Inspections Act 1996 as the starting point on LEA rights of access into schools. This gives them the right to inspect any school maintained by them where they require information about the school for the purpose of exercising any of their functions and where it is not reasonably practicable for them to obtain the information in any other manner. The code also makes it clear that LEAs have no general legal power to insist on entry to schools against the wishes of the school. These arrangements have been in place for some time for existing categories of maintained school, except grant-maintained schools which are not maintained by the LEA. We are not aware that they have caused problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para10"></a>If a school at any time believes that the LEA is using those powers unreasonably, it can appeal to the Secretary of State. It would be open to the Secretary of State to issue a direction under Section 496 of the Education Act 1996. But, in general, we would expect the LEA and school to resolve any differences of view and to reach an agreed way of working which suits both parties without recourse to the appeals process. The present draft of the code offers appropriate guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para11"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will recognise that the policy which is being implemented in this part of the Bill is predicated on agreement and consensus rather than on conflict. We do not want to see a significant number of appeals, although the right to appeal has been properly observed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para12"></a>The noble Baroness raised the issue of community schools and their right to choose a new category. It is true that community schools will be able to choose a different category one year after implementation of the new framework. I stress that that is not one year after Royal Assent, as the noble Baroness appears to believe.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-06_para13"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will recognise that there is nothing particularly new in the nature of the access which is provided. It is already provided in the School Inspections Act 1996 and the appeals procedure is already provided in the Education Act 1996. I hope that on that basis, and on the basis of our determination <P>


<a name="column_1462"></a>

<P>
<A NAME="80616-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Local authorities do not intervene in grant-maintained schools, but as they are to become foundation schools that situation will change considerably. In reply, the Minister referred to the right of access being extended to local education authorities, but he went on to say that schools will have "total discretion". When a school and its governors reject the LEA case for intervention, does the school have total discretion to refuse to allow it to intervene?<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980616/text/80616-07.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I believe that we should examine the kind of occasions when it might be necessary for a local education authority to seek access to a school. It might be necessary when a school's performance falls below an acceptable level. The LEA must have access to the school to know how best to support its improvement. The same is true in respect of an issue of health and safety, for example. The responsibility on the LEA is to promote high standards in all the schools for which it has responsibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para0"></a>The noble Baroness is right in saying that we are returning grant-maintained schools to a relationship with the local education authority which was removed by previous Conservative legislation. That political decision was taken before the election, announced before the election and included in the manifesto on which the people of this country decided to elect a Labour Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para1"></a>We do not intend to back down on our commitment to return grant-maintained schools to LEAs and to set up the foundation process. If we were to do so on an issue of this kind we would be betraying the whole purpose of the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to improve standards in our schools and a main agent for that purpose is the local education authority.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The Minister has still not answered my question so I wish to put it again. Perhaps he will relate his answer to schools such as the Oratory School and many others which have been in touch with us and are concerned about this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para2"></a>First, the noble Lord referred to "total discretion". Can he explain over what? Secondly, I agree that reaching agreement is a better course. If the LEA, the governors of a school and the staff believe that there is a good case for intervention, for providing information or whatever, that is the best way in which to move forward. Certainly on past records, there will be occasions when the school believes that the case for LEA intervention is not strong, and will take issue with it and resist it. Does "total discretion" come in there? Is it possible for a school to resist intervention by the LEA?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para3"></a>I return to a point made by the noble Lord about the previous government. They put a measure in an Act of Parliament which allows schools to opt voluntarily for grant-maintained status. Every single grant-maintained <P>


<a name="column_1463"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>school did so because the parents, by popular consent, voted that the school should become a grant-maintained school. It was never imposed by the government. The government never took a power to impose grant-maintained status on any school.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I have looked carefully at my speaking notes and the only time that I used the phrase "total discretion" was when I referred to the effect of the noble Baroness's amendment. I said that the amendment would give the governing bodies of voluntary-aided and foundation schools almost total discretion over the extent to which the local authority was allowed access to the school.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para4"></a>The only other reference which could possibly justify the noble Baroness's intervention is when I said that the code makes it clear that LEAs have no general legal power to insist on entry to a school against the wishes of the school. That must be what the noble Baroness was referring to.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para5"></a>I used the phrase "almost total discretion" with reference to the amendment because it provides that there shall be reference to the Secretary of State in the course of dispute. I used the phrase that there is no general legal power to insist on entry because the code of conduct sets out quite clearly the circumstances in which entry might be necessary and, of course, provides that there is a system for appeal to the Secretary of State by any school which claims that entry is not necessary. Therefore, the description of a general power is entirely inaccurate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para6"></a> If the noble Baroness suggests that there is a total discretion in relation to governors, the answer is that if access to the school were refused unreasonably--in other words, not in accordance with a code of practice--it would be open to the LEA to seek a direction from the Secretary of State. It would also be open to the LEA to issue a formal warning notice if it has concerns about a school's performance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para7"></a>However, I repeat that it is important--and I am sure that it will be adhered to in 99.9 per cent. of cases--for schools and local education authorities to work together to promote standards rather than setting up a system of institutionalised conflict which could be brought about by the amendment which has been moved.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-07_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Ripon: </B>   Perhaps I may make a point in relation to voluntary-aided schools. I take it that those schools are included in the amendment because they have that degree of autonomy to which the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para8"></a>I make three simple points. First, church schools, not least aided schools, have always maintained that they do not wish for separate or special treatment in those ordinary provisions. This appears to me to be a special provision for aided schools which the majority of them would reject.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para9"></a>Secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said, our experience is that there are inhibitors in place. There is the code of practice and, on the whole, aided schools <P>


<a name="column_1464"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have not found any difficulty in abiding by that code of practice. They have found it a good code to which to work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para10"></a>Thirdly, I make the point made already by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. Good relationships lie clearly at the heart of building up standards. The experience of the vast bulk of schools--aided as well as controlled schools--is that there are those good relationships. As I said, aided schools have a measure of autonomy. There is no necessary reason why that autonomy should lead to any kind of conflict. It is possible to have the autonomy that aided and foundation schools will have in the future and still to work closely with LEAs. I hope that that will be the outcome.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-07_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am surprised that the right reverend Prelate said that the voluntary-aided schools have had no difficulty abiding by the code of practice because it is not yet in being. The document is out for consultation; the first draft has not yet come back to the department; and we shall not know what the final document looks like until it comes before the House.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-07_spnew5"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Ripon: </B>   I apologise if I used the wrong phrase but I understand that there are already agreed constraints within which this whole matter is carried out. Am I not right about that?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The right reverend Prelate is quite right. Although the code of practice to which we have referred is not yet in force, I can confirm on the part of the local education authorities that they value the constructive co-operation which exists with voluntary-aided schools.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   So do I, but I believe that we are talking about two different things. We are talking about a code of practice which refers to many statutes which are not yet on the statute book. Therefore, it is not yet in being. The autonomy which grant-maintained and voluntary-aided schools enjoy at this moment is greater than that which they will enjoy under the Bill when it is enacted. That is the point I was making.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para11"></a>I return to the fundamental point that I was making. The code of practice is no more than an exhortation. We all applaud when things are going right and are going as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, describes. That is very important. It is far better to have harmony and agreement. But we know that when a large number of schools obtained grant-maintained status they did not enjoy a very good relationship with their LEAs. Many will now come together again. We want that to work and we shall applaud if it does work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para12"></a>However, we must think of the most difficult scenario; namely, where the situation does not work out. We must ensure that the rights of a school are protected in this Bill. My amendment refers to the schools which are performing very well indeed. They are successful and are improving year on year. My amendment asks that they should be left alone. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve. Where a school is claiming to be successful and improving year on year but the LEA takes a different view, then it is possible <P>


<a name="column_1465"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1465</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for the LEA to appeal, to make its case and to have the decision overturned. That is entirely accepted within the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-07_para13"></a>The noble Lord has not given me a satisfactory answer and I wish to test the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<A NAME="80616-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   moved amendment No. 245:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 91, line 24, leave out ("Subject to subsection (2),").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: It was not so very long ago in terms of memories in this place when Labour Party policy was expressed as:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Private schools are a major obstacle to a free and fair education system able to serve the needs of the whole community. We will integrate private schools with the local authority sector where necessary." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para1"></a>That was the Labour Party manifesto of 1993. The words have changed. Now we hear:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The time has come for old prejudices to be buried. I want independent schools to know that the Government is looking forward to working in partnership with independent schools to raise standards." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para2"></a>That was Mr. Stephen Byers writing in the magazine Prep School, which I am sure is required reading for all members of the Government Benches these days. Mr. Byers goes on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government has made it clear that we wish to build bridges wherever we can across education divides. The education apartheid created by the public/private divide diminishes the whole education system. The independent sector plays a vital role within our education system. That is why we are fully committed to fostering closer links between the state and private sector. Through partnership we will be able to raise standards for all our children." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para3"></a>Fine words. Suddenly, with Clause 120, when the Government discover that there is a prospect of actual co-operation between local authorities and private sector schools, they react like some schoolgirl who has discovered a snail in her salad. They shriek and shriek and want to do everything that they can to remove that offending object as quickly as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para4"></a>In addressing the last amendment the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, heaped considerable praise and indeed responsibility on LEAs. However, in this next clause, we find that the Government are desperately trying to claw back any responsibility from those authorities for concluding deals in the interests of their children with neighbouring schools in the private sector in case they should, unhappily, come to an arrangement which might involve some active co-operation with the hated independent schools. I find that disturbing; indeed, it suggests to me that, although the words may have changed, the sentiments remain the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para5"></a>In abolishing assisted places and by the other action that they have taken towards the independent sector, it seems to me that the Government have demonstrated their true feelings which are against private education. The fine words of Mr. Byers are merely that: just words. I hope the noble Baroness will be able to prove me wrong and that she will be able to show that this clause is intended to allow for greater co-operation and to provide new avenues for co-operation. That is not evident from the face of the Bill, but I am willing to be convinced. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   This is another example of the mean-spirited politics of envy. We have yet another <P>


<a name="column_1468"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1468</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rung of the ladder being taken away from able young people coming from low-income families. We have lost the assisted places scheme and, with the introduction of the work of the adjudicator, we are about to lose selection. We understand that children cannot be selected on the grounds of ability, but that, according to yesterday's statement,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"bright children can be selected on the grounds of ability for Master Classes". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para6"></a>We now have the most incredible dog's breakfast of what it is that the Government believe or think about bright children: tinkering at the edges with gimmicky schemes and yet removing the bread-and-butter schemes which have been such a lifeline to bright young people from low-income families.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para7"></a>As I understand it, having abolished the assisted places scheme, the Government discovered one day to their horror that at least one LEA, thinking very much about the children in its area who were bright and who were suited to a fast-stream academic education, resolved to do something about it. The moment that the Government got wind of that they rushed into the back room and brought out counsel to draft them some words to ensure that no LEA could provide such a scheme. I cannot imagine a more mean-spirited action on the part of the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para8"></a>Now that we have had the admissions document and are putting some flesh on the bones of the Bill as we go through it, we are beginning to see the real colour of the Government; indeed, the real intention behind the Bill. It is a levelling down and it is a dumbing down. In other words, you can have any colour car as long as it is black. They have removed all the chances that were there for children--autonomy of schools, assisted places schemes--and have attacked Oxford and Cambridge. All those actions add up to a comprehensive system and a levelling down and, ultimately, offer no chances for our bright young people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para9"></a>I wholeheartedly support my noble friend's amendments. As the Minister knows, it is my intention to oppose the Question that Clause 120 should stand part of the Bill. I do not mind whether the clause is removed by that means or whether it is done by means of my noble friend's amendments. I believe that the amendments should succeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para10"></a>We had a most interesting debate the other day between the Liberal Democrat Front Bench and the Government Front Bench about what the Liberals would do if they were masters of this Bill. They would have been unequivocal in addressing and getting out of the system the selection of bright children in this way. The assisted places scheme certainly received their support. They would have been much more clear cut about how they dealt with grammar schools in the Bill. The Government talk and use the rhetoric of high standards. They use the rhetoric of looking to raise standards in education and, indeed, they use the rhetoric of being concerned about bright, able young children. However, when one looks at their actions, they simply do not match the rhetoric. Young people throughout the country will lose such opportunities.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para11"></a>I was deeply saddened the other day to hear about a young boy attending a school in East Anglia under the assisted places scheme who has a disabled father. So that the father could better cope with the situation, an application was made for the young boy to be transferred to a school under the assisted places scheme which was nearer to his home. A school was found and it was willing to accept him. However, what happened? The DfEE said that, once the link is broken with the assisted places scheme, that is an end to the matter. In fact, if the boy had been placed in the other school which was willing to accept him, it would have saved the Government &#163;5,000. Nevertheless, it counted for nothing. Those concerned rather cold-heartedly said that the boy must stay at the school which is not appropriate in terms of the logistics of the family or he must leave and take his chance in another local school. That is my understanding of the Government's intentions. I do not like what I see. I most warmly support my noble friend's amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_time0"></A><H5>4.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, briefly but accurately described my party's position on assisted places schemes, selection, grammar schools, and so on. I believe that I have made no secret of that in this Chamber or elsewhere. However, I have considerable sympathy with the amendment, although not necessarily with all that was said in moving it. Indeed, I was not sure whether the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, was making a sexist remark about snails in lettuce or launching an attack on organic farming. Either way, I do not wish to be associated with those remarks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para12"></a>In supporting the abolition of the assisted places scheme, it was part of my party's policy that it is right and proper for LEAs to be able to determine what they do with the money they have in exercising their responsibility to ensure the proper education of the children in their area. I personally have a view about that, but I do not wish to impose it on other LEAs which may feel that there is another and more appropriate way in certain circumstances for particular children.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para13"></a>Therefore, for those reasons, although I start almost from the opposite point of view to the mover, I have considerable sympathy with the intention behind the amendment. I certainly feel that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is tackling the issue more appropriately with his amendment than the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, will in her desire to remove the clause from the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   I very much support my noble friend Lord Lucas in his amendment. Shortly after the general election there was a great deal of press coverage about a consensus on education as regards raising standards, together with agreement on the national curriculum, testing and assessment, and so on. As the year has progressed and the education Bills have come before us, we have clearly seen a widening rather than a coming together. The saddest part about this clause is the fact that it does not actually support the individual child. I take perhaps a very simple view of education, but I believe that it is about the pupils; indeed, each individual pupil.
<P>


<a name="column_1470"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1470</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para14"></a>I shall not repeat all the arguments about the assisted places scheme, but perhaps I may give Members of the Committee just two examples about two assisted-place pupils who are well known to me. One has just obtained a place at Cambridge. I do not believe that she would ever have been able to achieve such a place coming from the area in which she lived with the education normally available to her. She is an extremely clever girl and comes from a very poor home. The other pupil has, as I understand it, become part of a team which has won a gold medal for rowing internationally. That is an opportunity which she certainly would never have had if she had not been on an assisted places scheme. I quote those instances because they concern actual children who have benefited from the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para15"></a>The other argument is the one which was made very clearly by the noble Lord, Lord Tope. Those in local government have an education budget, but it is a matter for the relevant committee to determine how that money should be spent. There has been a great deal of argument about the cost of sending a child to an independent school as compared with the cost of sending that child to a maintained school. However, if you compare like with like and include administrative costs and other such costs in a maintained school, the difference is not that great. If an opportunity can be offered to a child to develop a talent or a skill where the local authority for one reason or another cannot provide an appropriate course--that may apply to a course in a modern language, or Latin or Greek--and the child and the child's parents want that opportunity, and the local education authority is prepared to offer it, I believe it should have the right to do so. After all, the local education authority comprises democratically elected councillors who make these decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-08_para16"></a>The whole matter rests on the needs of the child concerned. I do not believe that we should say that local education authorities should not make these opportunities available under any circumstances. It may be a case of a special needs child who requires a particular course. It is extraordinary that we are debating this matter on a day when we hear on the radio and read in the newspapers that the Government will publish a paper on gifted children who will be singled out at primary school to attend special schools. I am not in the least against that. It is sensible that able children should be selected in that way. However, it is completely the opposite of what the Government said only last week in this Chamber. If we are seriously interested in helping the individual child, I hope very much that the Committee will support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Lucas.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980616/text/80616-09.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Warnock: </B>   I speak in support of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. It is extraordinary that we hear so much about collaboration between the private sector and the public sector--I am very much in favour of it--except in the field of education. I do not wish to discuss at length two highly successful schemes that existed in the past which illustrated that co-operation. One was the direct grant schools and, later, there was the assisted places scheme. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Young, I can think of <P>


<a name="column_1471"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1471</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>innumerable cases of the successful use of assisted places. The Girls' Public Dayschool Trust with which I am associated has the largest number of assisted places in the country. Therefore, I know that that scheme worked.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para0"></a>However, let us forget about those two excellent systems that have now gone and ask why collaboration between the private sector and the public sector should not be permitted in this case. Although it is frequently thought that independent schools are somehow privileged, wonderful places which are rich by some curious means and which continue to exist through some kind of miracle, but which will die some day, the facts are different. Independent schools are kept going almost entirely by the private money of parents. Those parents make an enormous contribution to education in this country, even if we consider the matter from a numerical aspect and forget about what the schools offer. The private sector is educating an increasing number of our young people at the moment. To rule out collaboration between people who are putting their private money into the education of the country and the public sector seems to me an act of folly. It centres around an age old ambiguity surrounding the word "elite". There is an absolute endemic failure to distinguish between "elite" in the sense of a well selected, meritocratic number of people and an unjustly privileged number of people, as it were. Those people may overlap but the meaning of the word is not the same in those two contexts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para1"></a>It is paradoxical that the Government are perfectly prepared to talk about centres of excellence but are not prepared to permit any elite institutions where this excellence may exist. Therefore I very much support the amendment. Alternatively, I would support omitting the clause altogether.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede: </B>   In speaking against the amendment I am interested to hear what the Government's plans are to achieve greater co-operation with the private sector. I recognise the point the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, made, and I wonder what the Government's plans are in this area. I also wish to respond to some of the extreme language of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. The noble Baroness used the expressions, "removing all chances" and "dumbing down". We are talking about sending children to schools in the state sector. The noble Baroness often goes out of her way to say that some comprehensive schools are excellent. She has said on a number of occasions that her own children attended a good comprehensive school. Therefore I do not understand how she can use such extreme language with regard to children attending state schools. That is quite out of keeping with many of the points she makes on the more detailed aspects of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I was not expressing outrage at sending children to state schools. I was concerned that an opportunity should be given to certain children to attend private schools.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede: </B>   Nevertheless the noble Baroness used the expression "dumbing down". <P>


<a name="column_1472"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1472</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Presumably she meant that in the context of sending children to a state school. Further, there seems to be no recognition at all on the Opposition Benches that the Bill before us introduces a diversity of schools. Although some of my colleagues on this side of the Chamber do not like to admit it, the Bill takes on board many of the developments of grant-maintained schools, local management of schools and other such issues that we have seen develop over the past 10 years. We are far from going back to a fully comprehensive system. It is a shame that the Opposition are not addressing the nitty-gritty of the Bill and are choosing to have an argument with old Labour, as it were, about an issue that is really not on the table. They are not arguing about the details and the diversity of the system which the Bill seeks to put in place. Those are the points I wish to make. I believe that the Bill as a whole seeks to introduce equality for all children rather than protecting quality for those who are most privileged.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   I have been an enthusiastic supporter of maintained education but I am also an enthusiastic supporter of collaboration between the public and private sectors. At a time in the National Health Service when the Government are attempting to reduce waiting lists it has been well recognised that health authorities may, when circumstances allow, purchase surgical procedures in the private sector. The question I pose to the Government is the following. Will this clause as it stands prevent any local authority, which recognises that particular pupils with special aptitudes cannot receive the education they deserve in the state sector, from purchasing education facilities in the independent sector, thereby furthering that kind of collaboration? My reading of the clause is that that will be the case and therefore I am in sympathy with the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   Before the Minister responds I hope I may put a particular gloss on the question that the noble Lord, Lord Detchant, asked. What about pupils who are sent to ballet schools, for the sake of argument, none of which, as far as I know, is maintained in the public sector? They are all private. Yet, without the support provided by local education authorities to pupils who attend ballet and acting schools, many who need that education and could benefit from it will not be able to receive it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_time0"></A><H5>4.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-09_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   There has been a great deal of misunderstanding about this clause in today's debate. The Government gave a clear manifesto commitment to phase out the assisted places scheme. Indeed, they were elected with a large majority to do so. The Education (Schools) Act 1997 gave effect to that commitment. Resources freed as a result have already been allocated to allow the appointment of 1,500 teachers to keep over 100,000 pupils out of large infant classes. Funding previously allocated to benefit a favoured few will now be used to secure that many children make a strong and positive start to their school education. As more resources are freed they will further support the <P>


<a name="column_1473"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1473</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reduction in infant class sizes. I challenge Members of the Committee to suggest that that is not a good use of those resources.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para2"></a>Clause 120 seeks to achieve the same positive benefits at local level. It provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations prescribing the circumstances under which LEAs will be permitted to buy places at independent schools and preventing LEAs buying such places under any other circumstances. The key objective is to prevent LEAs establishing the assisted places scheme at local level. Again, we are absolutely committed to that manifesto pledge.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para3"></a>The clause has no effect on LEAs' powers to buy places at independent schools for pupils with special educational needs. Section 348 of the Education Act 1996 covers such provision and is not amended by the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para4"></a>The noble Lord's amendments would entirely wreck the purpose of the clause by giving LEAs an unrestricted ability to buy places at independent schools. I stress that is simply not consistent with the commitment given in our manifesto. We are clear that we want the regulations to enable LEAs to develop genuine partnerships--I say this to the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, and the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock--between the maintained and independent sectors similar to those which we are already supporting. Invitations to apply for support for partnership projects which were given out last year attracted an excellent response, with nearly 300 applications seeking over &#163;5 million of support. We are presently providing a total of &#163;600,000, of which &#163;350,000 was government money, the rest supported by a trust, to support 48 projects covering a wide range of activities which bring independent and state schools together as equal partners. Projects involving numeracy, arts and science subjects, as well as sports and the performing arts, are being supported. All types of schools are involved and schemes will run in inner city, rural and urban settings.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para5"></a>Let me give just a few examples of the projects bidding for this support which were successful. First, there is a project involving one maintained and two independent schools in Bromley where the schools are sharing their different expertise to improve provision for modern foreign languages at all three schools, the type of project mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Young. There is a project promoted by Wakefield local education authority in which pupils from five secondary schools--three maintained and two independent--in the town are working together in cross-sector groups and attending joint lectures and master classes. Pairs of maintained and independent schools in north Somerset and separately in Wiltshire are collaborating to provide an A-level in music technology where small numbers of pupils in the individual schools make it more effective to run the course jointly. Simultaneous timetabling will support joint working, and there will be joint teaching.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para6"></a>We are making funding available for one year only (1998-99) at present in order to assess the impact before deciding on future arrangements. So in a sense those are pilot projects. The partnerships scheme will help pupils, staff and schools in both sectors through the sharing of expertise, skills and facilities. That is a long way from <P>


<a name="column_1474"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the assisted places scheme which was of no benefit to the maintained sector, did not represent a genuine partnership between the sectors, and was poor value for taxpayers' money.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para7"></a>Of course this is not an overnight solution: change will have to be incremental and at a pace that both sectors set. We are looking long term for much increased interaction between independent and maintained schools based on a recognition that both sectors working together can make an impact greater than they would by working separately. Regulations made under this clause will allow LEAs to develop that sort of co-operation locally. I hope that that is of some reassurance to the noble Lord, Lord Tope, the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, and the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para8"></a>We shall consult in detail during the autumn on the provisions of the regulations to be made under Clause 120. Those regulations would be made by April 1999. We shall not commence the provisions of Clause 120 until regulations are ready to be laid. The existing provisions of the Education Act 1996 which give LEAs power to provide financial assistance to independent schools and to pay the fees of children attending such schools will remain in place until that time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para9"></a>But we are clear that genuine partnership must involve at least two parties, and that there must be benefit to both sides. A scheme which would pay independent school fees in order to take a child wholly out of the maintained sector and place him or her full time in an independent school is in no sense a partnership between the two sectors. In those circumstances, where is the involvement of, or benefit to, the maintained sector? An LEA proposing such a course of action would be abdicating its responsibilities for its more able pupils and should be concentrating its resources on ensuring that all children, including the very able, can flourish within the maintained sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para10"></a>I agree with the remarks of my noble friend Lord Ponsonby. The language used by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, gave her position away. She simply wants to retain the assisted places scheme so that certain numbers of pupils for whom the state sector ought to be able to provide properly can receive a private education. It is not dumbing down for able pupils to be properly educated in the state sector. The noble Baroness said that her own children were properly educated in the state sector. So were mine. And that can be so for all pupils except those who have special needs and require special provision which not all local authorities are able to make.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-09_para11"></a>I hope, in the light of my remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, will be able to welcome the building of bridges referred to in the article he quoted by my honourable friend the Minister for School Standards. I hope that the noble Lord can feel pleased with the partnership schemes that we are now developing and intend to take further. I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80616-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken on this amendment. I am particularly <P>


<a name="column_1475"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1475</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope. I have so often found myself in disagreement with amendments that they have proposed, and have probably said so in no uncertain terms. So I am conscious of the honour they do me on this occasion. I am indebted finally to the immense wisdom of my noble friend Lady Young. What this matter should be about is not systems and which system benefits, but about the children and what is best for the individual children.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-10_para0"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned a range of products and I welcome them. I am delighted that the Government are turning their faces in this direction. I can think of a number of projects involving relationships between Dauntsey's and its neighbouring school in West Lavington which had to be abandoned when the colour of that particular local education authority changed. I hope that the colleagues of the noble Lord, Lord Tope, in that part of the world will be listening to what the Government are proposing and perhaps reviving the sort of co-operation which used to exist. Whatever criticisms the Government may have of the assisted places scheme, within that scheme were a number of schools in the independent sector, particularly the Girls' Public Dayschool Trust and the likes of Manchester Grammar, which were committed to it heart and soul because it enabled them to fulfil their ambition, which was to educate the children of the poor--or at least the needy--rather than just the children of the rich, which is the prospect they now have to face returning to.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-10_para1"></a>I give particular praise to the efforts that the Girls' Public Dayschool Trust is making to raise funds to enable it to continue to offer full fee scholarships to those who need them. It has done extremely well to date and I wish it every continued success. However, what the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said is also important. Local authorities are democratically elected bodies, and it seems to me they can quite reasonably be trusted to take these kinds of decisions themselves. If they start behaving unfairly and doing something which most of their electors will consider to be to the disadvantage of their children, they will not be long in office. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, if he found himself in an opposition party in such a council, would be very sanguine of his prospects at the next election. I do not think there is any danger of creating something which will be unpopular locally, and if it is popular locally and if it is what the people want I do not see why the Government should be afraid of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-10_para2"></a>There is a lot to be said for looking at the needs of the individual child and recognising that in some circumstances the independent schools will have the particular facilities and the particular resources which can enable particular children to benefit in a way that they could not in state sector schools which are necessarily constrained as to resources and the variety of experience they can provide. Like my noble friend Lady Blatch, I am a user of the state sector and extremely happy to be so, but I can certainly appreciate that there are some children who would be better off if they could have the benefit of the <P>


<a name="column_1476"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>facilities of an independent school. The noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, pointed out that in medicine the National Health Service is free to go private when it wishes and where it is best for the patient. That is the principle which should apply to these cases. I know that the noble Baroness the Minister is coming from a position and a commitment which makes this difficult for her, but I think the Government are in error here. I do not see that they can offer me anything by way of concessions or conversations until Report stage, and so I would very much like to test the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<A NAME="80616-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone </B>   moved Amendment No. 246F: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 120, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Payment of school expenses; grant of scholarships, etc </B></center><BR>
(" . For section 518 of the Education Act 1996 there shall be substituted--
<BR>
"Payment of school expenses; grant of scholarships, etc. 
<BR>
518.--(1) A local education authority, for the purpose of enabling persons to take advantage of any educational facilities available to them, may in such circumstances as may be specified in or determined in accordance with regulations--
<BR>
(a) pay such expenses of children attending community, foundation, voluntary or special schools as may be necessary to enable them to take part in any school activities,
<BR>
(b) grant scholarships, exhibitions, bursaries and other allowances in respect of persons over compulsory school age.
<BR>
(2) Regulations may make provision--
<BR>
(a) for requiring a local education authority to make, in relation to each financial year, a determination relating to the extent to which they propose to exercise their power under subsection (1)(b) in that year; and
<BR>
(b) for authorising an authority to determine not to exercise that power in a financial year--
<BR>
(i) generally,
<BR>
(ii) in such cases as may be prescribed, or
<BR>
(iii) in such cases as may be determined by the authority." ").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: The new clause replaces Section 518 of the Education Act 1996, which was partially amended in the Commons at Report stage by the removal of Section 518(1)(b). It confers a power on the Secretary of State to make regulations to allow LEAs to pay expenses of pupils attending maintained schools to take part in school activities such as school trips, and to assist with the cost of items such as school uniform and sports equipment. This reproduces--with only minor changes to reflect the new school structure--the provisions of existing Section 518(a) of the 1996 Act. It repeats the repeal of existing Section 518(1)(b) agreed elsewhere, which allows LEAs to pay the whole or any part of the fees or expenses for a child attending an independent school so as to avoid hardship on the part of the parents. The circumstances in which LEAs may pay all or part of such expenses will be dealt with under regulations to be made under Clause 120. As I have said, we shall consult in detail during the autumn on the provisions of these regulations, which would be <P>


<a name="column_1479"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1479</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made by April 1999. I have also made clear that we shall not commence the provisions of Clause 120 until regulations are ready to be laid. The existing provisions of the Education Act 1996 which give LEAs the power to provide financial assistance to independent schools and to pay fees of children attending such schools will remain in place until that time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para3"></a>This amendment also contains a provision on financial support for students which is supplementary to that included under the Teaching and Higher Education Bill. That other Bill will allow the Secretary of State to remove discretionary awards for further and higher education students and put new arrangements in their place. The new clause gives the Secretary of State a power to make regulations to allow LEAs to offer additional financial support to students, if they so choose. It will, however, leave it open to LEAs to decide whether or not to do so, although they will have to review their decisions annually.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para4"></a>The current arrangements for post-16 LEA discretionary awards fail many students. Overall LEA expenditure on awards has declined steadily over a number of years and availability of support increasingly depends on where a student happens to live. Shoring up these discredited arrangements will not allow us to deliver lasting reform. That is why we introduced provisions in the Teaching and Higher Education Bill which will allow us to discontinue LEA discretionary awards under Section 1(6) and Section 2 of the Education Act 1962 and replace them with a new system of post-16 student support which is more consistent across the country and more effective in helping those most in need.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para5"></a>I should make clear that the new arrangements to replace LEA discretionary awards are quite separate and distinct from the system of student support which will replace mandatory awards for students in higher education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para6"></a>To inform our decisions about the new support arrangements for post-16 students in schools and FE colleges, I asked an advisory group, chaired by Graham Lane of the Local Government Association, and including representatives from LEAs, the FEFC, colleges, the NUS and other interested bodies, for its advice. The group's remit was to consider a simpler, fairer, better targeted system for financial support to replace LEA discretionary awards for FE students. The group's report, which is part of our wider review of post-16 student support, will be published very shortly and we will be consulting on its recommendations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para7"></a>I have, however, listened carefully to LEA representations about the need to retain a power to offer financial help to students in exceptional circumstances, in addition to the new arrangements which we will introduce. I have accepted that no system of student support, however well designed, will be able specifically to address the potential needs of every student facing financial difficulties. LEAs have a key role in their communities and some have argued that their ability to make exceptional payments to students can be an <P>


<a name="column_1480"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1480</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important part of that role. We agree. This new clause will enable LEAs to make such payments, where they so choose.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para8"></a>Where LEAs determine that the new arrangements are sufficient for the students in their areas, it will be open to them to decide not to make such payments. I believe it would be unreasonable in these circumstances to require authorities to consider applications and appeals from all-comers, including some who might apply for "exceptional" payments on top of their entitlement to support under the new system. This amendment will relieve LEAs of that burden, subject to the annual review. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   I have a particular concern about this amendment, on which I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me. A few months ago I initiated a debate in your Lordships' House about the funding of drama students and, by association, dance students, art students and so on. The present Arts Council funding system is clearly not working. Can the Minister tell me more about whether the new arrangements are likely to improve the current situation or, as I fear, make it worse? In particular, is she able to tell me, either now or later, when the Government expect to announce their new plans in respect of drama students?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   I cannot give a precise date as to when we shall be able to announce our new plans. As I said in the debate on the noble Lord's Motion, we are working on a scheme to replace the interim scheme. But those arrangements will in no way impinge on the interim scheme; it will be a totally different scheme.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 246FA, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 246FB. Perhaps I should make it clear at the outset of this debate--I have no doubt that my intentions will be misinterpreted--that I am not supporting mindless beatings of children, ritual punishment, unlawful punishment or punishment that would be decreed unlawful under the European Convention on Human Rights. I am supporting the freedom of parents to choose independent education and to sign up voluntarily to a specific regime of firm discipline within a caring and loving ethos of a school. That is from where I start.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para12"></a>The two largest postbags I received on this Bill involve parish councils being represented on governing bodies of schools--a matter about which they felt strongly--and discipline. Many schools, particularly schools with a Christian ethos, have been concerned that the sensible regimes they operate and the supportive parent bodies of those schools where parents wish their children to be <P>


<a name="column_1481"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1481</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>brought up with a disciplinary regime which is both fair and firm, are now in jeopardy because of the amendment moved in the House of Commons.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para13"></a>An organisation called Families for Discipline does not support unnecessary punishment for children, but supports the firm and fair approach. It wrote to a number of Members of the Committee and made some cogent points. It argued that the new clause should be opposed because it undermines parental responsibility. Indeed it does. It is based on false assumptions about school corporal punishment. As the headmaster of an independent school in Liverpool explained, corporal discipline is based on the guiding principles of love and correction. The school ethos is an extension of discipline in the home and I am saddened to see, having heard the protestations of the present Ministers in the Department for Education saying that they had no intention of extending the abolition of corporal punishment to the home--the smacking of children--that that extension is now to emanate from the European Community and no doubt there will be an extension to the home.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para14"></a>The clause should be opposed because it fails to recognise the religious basis of many independent schools. It fails to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 2, Protocol 1 requires a state to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"respect the rights of parents to ensure that such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para15"></a>The European Court of Human Rights established that such corporal punishment falls within the ambit of this clause. It also exposes pupils and teachers to the risk of increased violence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para16"></a>It is no good our going around wringing our hands about the behaviour of some young people in our schools; about the rise in expulsions; about the rise in disruptive behaviour in the classroom and the lack of response to the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers. Its members are concerned about the protection of teachers in the classroom. How can we wring our hands about that and not allow the teachers to exercise some form of corporal punishment? Indeed, the Government distributed a guidance document to schools arguing that some force can be used and some of that force, when one reads the guidance, is a form of corporal punishment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para17"></a>The clause disregards the views of the majority of the United Kingdom public. The Government make much play of saying that people think this or that. But by a considerable majority people believe that there should be corporal punishment in the context of firm but fair discipline. The clause paves the way for legislation against parents using corporal discipline in the home and we are now hearing interesting mutterings from the European Union on that subject.

<A NAME = "80616-11_para19"></a>That is precisely what the state is proposing to do in the new clause in relation to independent schools. The state is removing from parents the responsibility to decide for themselves. School is an extension of loco parentis. It is acting in loco parentis while the children are at school.

<A NAME = "80616-11_para20"></a>I have no doubt that we will hear much of the Swedish case, which was declared inadmissible by the European Court of Human Rights. Of the two cases therefore only Costello-Roberts was referred to the European Court. Neither the Commission nor the court opposed corporal punishment in schools in either case. I can expand on that if it is brought up during the course of the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para21"></a>The Minister appears to consider that the European court would be unlikely to uphold any argument that the new clause would result in a violation of the rights of parents under Article 2 of Protocol 1. However, legal advice received on the matter from a barrister specialising in human rights suggests otherwise. In his view, Campbell and Cousins v. The United Kingdom is a case for positive respect by the state for religious and philosophical convictions to which pluralism in education is fundamental to a democratic society. In Campbell and Cousins the court established that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"corporal punishment of children in schools falls within the ambit of Article 2 of Protocol 1". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para22"></a>The British public think otherwise. In polls taken towards the end of 1996 two-thirds of the general public registered support for the restoration of corporal punishment in state schools. That subject has been dealt with by Parliament and I have no wish to restore that debate today. However, I wish to argue strongly that we are talking about parents who freely enter into a contract with an independent school. I believe that they have a human right not only to do that, but also to enter voluntarily into an agreement with that school, knowing what the regime running that school is and knowing that corporal punishment is administered within the law and certainly within what is acceptable under the European Convention on Human Rights. The amendment I tabled makes it clear that the intention is to be lawful at all times.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para23"></a>In the independent sector many schools have the support of governors, teachers and parents to retain the right to use moderate and reasonable corporal punishment in appropriate circumstances. Many of those schools are relatively small; some are faith based and seek to provide an education and disciplinary ethos in harmony with the homes from which the children come. Who are we to deny them that right? These are parents who are not opting for state education over which the Department for Education has control. They opted for independent education and take what comes with it in a voluntary way, entering into a contract voluntarily.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-11_para24"></a>Such a desire is in keeping with national law; it is certainly in keeping with international instruments and conforms to the Department of Health Guidance to the Children Act 1989. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80616-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henderson of Brompton: </B>   Is the noble Baroness speaking for the Official Opposition? She speaks from the Opposition Front Bench. It would be nice to know whether or not she is speaking for the Opposition and, indeed, whether a free vote will be allowed on all Benches, especially the Benches of the noble Baroness.

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1483</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that, when the subject came up in this Chamber, as an official government party we supported, as long as it was within reasonable bounds and conformed to the European Convention on Human Rights, corporal punishment as a good thing in schools. For the purposes of this amendment, the vote will be a free vote.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henderson of Brompton: </B>   The noble Baroness was speaking from the Opposition Front Bench. Is what she said Official Opposition policy?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I was speaking to the amendment in a personal capacity. I have made it clear that when the subject came up when we were on the Government Benches we certainly supported that. Nevertheless, at that time there was a free vote and some noble Lords on our Benches took a contrary view. We believe that this is a subject for a free vote, and there will indeed be a free vote on the subject this evening.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   If there is to be a free vote on the Opposition side of the Committee, I find it strange that the noble Baroness did not make that clear when she started to speak from her position as the Opposition's official spokesman for education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-12_para0"></a>When this amendment was put into the Bill in another place, there was a free vote on all sides of the House. The Government won by a substantial majority on a free vote--by 211 to 15. We now understand that there is to be a free vote. I am delighted to hear that. We are certainly having a free vote on this side of the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-12_para1"></a>The aim of the clause is to extend the abolition of corporal punishment to cover all pupils in private schools and also those in nursery education. Its purpose is to close a sordid and embarrassing chapter in the history of our education system and to end the form of discrimination which has allowed some schools to go on beating some pupils whose parents were paying fees but not others where the state was paying the fees. These amendments are wrecking amendments intended to remove the clause altogether or to keep corporal punishment for some schools and for some pupils in the private sector. I do not know how many Members of the Committee remember Sir Keith Joseph's Bill in the Session 1984-85 which proposed in the state sector that if parents chose they could have their children beaten but that parents could choose not to. That Bill was voted out of the House at Report stage and had to be withdrawn by the then government.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. She referred to this as a wrecking amendment. This clause was not in the Bill when the Bill was published in another place. In fact the clause was added to the Bill not by the Government, but with the support of the Government, by a Liberal Democrat Member in another place. Therefore, in the sense that we are just taking a different view about that clause, it is not a wrecking amendment.
<P>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1484</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>confuse everyone if she continues in this vein. A decision was made in another place not by the Government but by Parliament. The Government did not support this amendment. Members of the Government took a personal position on it and decided to vote in favour of the amendment, but that is quite different from saying that this is in any way a government amendment. The noble Baroness referred a little earlier to the state imposing certain constraints in relation to corporal punishment. That, again, is inaccurate. This is a decision of Parliament, which wishes to see this practice come to an end. Perhaps I may also confirm what my noble friend Lady David said. The Government believe that there should be a free vote on this important issue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, will she clarify one point? She said twice that this is a decision of Parliament. It is in fact a decision of the House of Commons. There is a distinction.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Young. It is of course a decision of the House of Commons--of another place.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I would have made the same point. But perhaps I may also add that I did not say that it was a government amendment. I rose to make that very point. I rose to say that it would have been a wrecking amendment had it been a government amendment. It was actually an amendment of a member of another party in another place which received the support of the majority of the House of Commons. Many on the Government Benches supported the amendment. I have looked down the list. But it is not a government amendment. It was not put as a government amendment and it was not spoken to as a government amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   When the noble Baroness reads Hansard, she will see that just two or three minutes ago she said that the amendment had the support of the Government. That is not accurate. It did have the support of individual members of the Government who voted in favour of it, but that is a completely different matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   Perhaps I may now get on with what I was saying. On several occasions in the past this House has taken the initiative to rid our school system of this abhorrent, anti-education and dangerous practice. I have had a great deal to do with getting as far as we have in this House. I have supported all the Bills and was the opposition spokesman on some of those Bills when we won amendments which sought to abolish corporal punishment in the state system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-12_para2"></a>The private schools associations want abolition. That is an important point. On 5th March, Ian Beer, who is the chairman of the Independent Schools Council, issued a statement in which he said that the independent schools welcome the proposal to ban all corporate punishment. The statement said that many private <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80616-12_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, talked about parents sending their children to independent schools. If parents want to send their children to independent schools, they are quite free to do so. But if they send their children to an independent school which has banned corporal punishment, that is settled. That is the policy of the school and they can either send their children to it or not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-12_para4"></a>The teachers want abolition. Full prohibition is supported by all the teacher unions, by the other education organisations and, of course, by all child welfare and child protection groups. In particular, effective child protection demands full abolition. The national committee of inquiry into the prevention of child abuse, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, and Sir William Utting's recent review of safeguards for all looked-after children--children in care--including those in boarding schools, also strongly recommended full prohibition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-12_para5"></a>Our obligations under international human rights law demand full abolition. Three United Nations human rights treaty bodies--the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Committee on the Rights of the Child--had formally recommended that the Government should extend prohibition to cover all pupils. Each committee expressed concern at the continued legality of corporal punishment for some pupils.

<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. Why does she believe that her views and the views of other people, which are worthy of the greatest respect, should be imposed on the population of this country?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I do not know whether the noble Lord is referring to the European rights committees.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   I am referring to the noble Baroness's personal views, which she has expressed most eloquently.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-12_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I believe that corporal punishment is a bad thing in all our schools. I am hoping to persuade noble Lords that this clause should remain part of the Bill and help to abolish corporal punishment in our schools and in our nursery schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-12_para7"></a>In its most recent judgment on this issue, the European Court of Human Rights stated unanimously that it did not wish to be taken to approve in any way the retention of corporal punishment as part of the disciplinary regime for schools. The noble Baroness forgets our clear obligation to remove corporal punishment from our school system altogether under the other international human rights treaties. For years <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>private schools in the UK have been the only educational institutions in Europe, east or west, in which corporal punishment of children has remained lawful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-12_para8"></a>I hope that the Committee will decisively reject the amendments and thus ensure at long last that our school system--the whole of our school system--is rid of this sordid practice. It was 35 years ago that Baroness Wootton of Abinger, whom we all admired enormously, sought to get this House to accept full abolition. She said then, "If a thing is wrong today it should be put right today and not tomorrow or the day after". It has taken a very long time to get as far as this, but I hope that today we shall clear that up.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-12_para9"></a>By adopting this clause in another place by such a huge majority on a free vote, the Bill has achieved for what so many of us have pleaded for a long time. I hope that this Committee will show its strong support for this clause in the Bill. We have a free vote.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80616-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   It is a privilege for me to be able follow the noble Baroness, Lady David, on this subject. In my comparatively short time in your Lordships' House I have seen how she has campaigned tirelessly on this issue. I know that she has been campaigning for many years before I came here. In that sense I am very pleased and very proud to be able to follow her in this debate. I am sure that she will understand that it is a privilege that I hoped very much I would not have. During the Second Reading debate on the Bill I commented that I hoped that we had heard the end of the issue of corporal punishment when it had been determined in the other place. When I said that there were murmurs of agreement around your Lordships' House. If I remember rightly, in her reply the Minister echoed my sentiments although I am sure that she was speaking solely in a personal capacity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para0"></a>So I was surprised and very disappointed to find at the last possible moment in the Committee stage of this Bill that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, the Opposition education spokesperson, had tabled this amendment. I do not know why she waited until the last possible moment and I do not propose to speculate on that today. She mentioned that it was the second largest issue in her postbag. That must say something for the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and for the image that her party still has because I have not had a single letter on this subject until today. The letters I have received expressed the horror and alarm that I feel that we are again debating this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para1"></a>I am astonished that the Conservative Party education spokesperson in this House should table this amendment. I do not understand how that fits into the image of the modern Conservative Party which her leader is apparently so keen to promote. Much has been said about public opinion outside this House. I believe when it is heard that the Conservative Party has chosen at the last minute to reintroduce this issue determined overwhelmingly in another place, it will agree that is different from taking a view when the issue was first introduced in the other place.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-13_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I have said that there will be a free vote on <P>


<a name="column_1487"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>these Benches. I have already said that there are Members on these Benches who will not support this amendment and therefore there is a free vote. The amendment was tabled last week. As we have gone through the Bill, and given the fact that we have no back-up and we have had to deal with amendments on a very complicated Bill, at every stage I have tabled amendments for the next day of the Committee stage. The noble Lord will know that this amendment was tabled last week and not yesterday at the last minute.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   I believe I referred specifically to last Friday and not to yesterday. Nevertheless, it is at the last minute. I am not going to enter into an argument with the noble Baroness as to why and when she did what she did. Of course it is a free vote. I should say--although I thought it was unnecessary--that it is a free vote for my party as it always is on an issue of this kind and that is as it should be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para2"></a>I still express astonishment that the Conservative Party should wish to project this image. That is a matter for that party and I care very little about it, but I care quite a lot about the reputation of your Lordships' House. Were this amendment to be accepted today, I cannot believe that we would be doing anything to enhance the reputation of this House or to suggest that we were ready to face the 21st century and not to be still steeped in the 19th century as some people mistakenly believe.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady David, made all the right points in opposition to the amendment. I agree with her that the Independent Schools Joint Council, which represents 80 per cent. of the independent schools, was very clear and unequivocal in its support of the successful amendment in the other place. It is a point of interest to me that Ian Beer, the chairman of that organisation, whom the noble Baroness, Lady David, mentioned, and I went to the same school and, I imagine, a few years before me. He suffered--if that is the right word--the same regime as I did. I am interested that he now takes the same view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, made reference to the issue of human rights and the legal position. It seems to me that that was something of a perversion of a view of human rights. I am enormously encouraged that I have sitting behind me my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill who is an acknowledged expert and authority on such matters. I know that he intends to speak shortly. I am sure that he will have something very important and wise to say on the issue. I would not presume to dwell further on it in his presence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para5"></a>Not surprisingly, all the child care organisations oppose corporal punishment. The noble Baroness, Lady David, has referred to various commissions including the one chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn. They have all come out against corporal punishment. We are the only country in Europe which still condones corporal punishment. There are many things about the uniqueness of Britain which should make us very proud, but corporal punishment is not one of them.
<P>


<a name="column_1488"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1488</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para6"></a>The noble Baroness spoke about the need for fair and firm discipline. I do not believe that any of us would argue with that as a statement. But to suggest that firm discipline means hitting small children--or even large ones for that matter--with a cane (that is corporal punishment) is a view that is rejected overwhelmingly by teachers, child care professionals and by most other informed opinion on the subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para7"></a>Discipline in the home was mentioned. I hope that we shall not be distracted by that debate. It is entirely outside the scope of this Bill. I have a view on it, as I am sure all Members of the Committee have. It is not the issue that we are talking about here. Needless to say, I shall oppose this amendment most strongly. I deeply regret that it has been introduced into your Lordships' House. On a free vote the other place determined the issue and, I hoped, once and for all. There was an overwhelming vote of 211 to only 15. I had hoped that that was the last word, but clearly it was not. I hope that this afternoon this House will show that we are ready to move into the 21st century and that we will have the last word on this issue by rejecting this amendment at least as overwhelmingly as in the other place.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wilberforce: </B>   I rise as calmly and dispassionately as one can to support the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. As the Committee will have seen from the Marshalled List, I put my name to oppose the Question that this clause stand part of the Bill. I was motivated to do that by a sense of considerable disquiet as to the legislative process which has taken place on this matter. I need not go into it at length because Members of the Committee know quite well what happened. We have a very elaborate and important Bill which we are now considering. It was put forward by the Government without any mention whatever of corporal punishment. At a very late stage; namely, five o'clock in the morning, at the instance of a Member, two clauses were put in, of which this is one, dealing with this matter. It was voted on in a free vote.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para8"></a>I felt that such a process in relation to a matter of civil liberties, importantly affecting the rights of parents and schools, should receive further consideration, at any rate in this House. I was very much disturbed that until last Thursday, I believe it was, although we had had six days in Committee and about 300 amendments, no mention appeared to have been made of this important subject. Therefore I was very much relieved when the noble Lady, Baroness Blatch, tabled this amendment enabling us to discuss this problem calmly and dispassionately as we ought.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para9"></a>No more than the noble Baroness am I arguing in favour of corporal punishment or against it. I am completely agnostic on the subject and so I should be. Between the age of six and 17 I attended no fewer than six independent schools and at five of those there was some degree of corporal punishment, ranging right down the scale from a slap on the wrist from a woman teacher to what I may call the "full Monty" meaning thereby one administered by Monty Rendall, our headmaster.
<P>


<a name="column_1489"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para10"></a>Those experiences led me to realise that what matters in schools is the disciplinary ethos--some call it the disciplinary code--which exists and which is built up by agreement between the headmaster or headteacher, the board of governors and above all, the parents. It may or may not contain an element of corporal punishment. My position--I believe that I am in agreement with the noble Baroness on this--is that, as a matter of freedom, we ought not interfere with that sort of bargain of choice, freely made, unless there is some manifest public interest which requires to be safeguarded.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para11"></a>We all agree that children have to be protected from abuse. That is an overriding consideration. However, let us consider the position. We are not arguing here about ritualistic flogging. I know that that phrase creeps in from time to time; it did in the other place. We are not arguing about that; we are arguing about reasonable measures of correction or, as they are called in Australia, reasonable measures of chastisement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para12"></a>The child is well protected by the common law under the law of battery. As your Lordships know, "battery" is widely interpreted even to go beyond physical contact. The child will now also protected by the Human Rights Bill 1998, which makes the European Convention on Human Rights part of our law. Article 3 of that convention prohibits inhuman and degrading punishment. Your Lordships have already been told by the noble Baroness--I believe this to be correct--that the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has so far been cautious about what it says in relation to corporal punishment in schools. The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, will correct any imbalance in that statement. I believe it to be correct that the court has left open the question of whether corporal punishment in schools should be prohibited. It depends on the circumstances. Those considerations are reflected in the amendment of the noble Baroness. I refer to the case of Costello-Roberts in 1993.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para13"></a>What is the scale of the problem with which we are dealing? It is a very small-scale problem. Many of the larger schools--I mention in correct order, Winchester, Eton and Harrow--have already disposed of it, as have others. We were told by speakers in the other place that fewer than 200 private schools have some measure of corporal punishment. There is no evidence of any scandal or excess. No research has been carried out into what is done in those schools and what effect it has. There is no perceived demand for the abolition of corporal punishment in those schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para14"></a>I submit that it is absolutely contrary to the sound principles of legislation that one should interfere with the reasonable choices of persons unless there is clear evidence of some public interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para15"></a>One other consideration has already been mentioned. I refer to the relationship between corporal punishment in schools and in the home. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Tope, says that that has nothing to do with this case, but the two situations are closely related. Once one begins to attempt to legislate about punishment in schools, one runs up against the question of what is going to happen in the home. If, in the home, it is legitimate to give reasonable and moderate <P>


<a name="column_1490"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1490</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>chastisement--I think that most people would accept that--it is difficult to see why, when a parent has delegated that responsibility to a school, it should be prohibited. After all, many parents--they may be lone parents without a man in the house--who have an unruly child with whom they cannot cope decide that the only thing to do is to send that child to an independent boarding school, as to which they have verified that the disciplinary situation is sound and well thought out. How can the one remain separated from the other? Conversely, if one prohibits any such punishment in schools, one is faced with the question of how far one can justify allowing it in the home. That will arouse some difficulties.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para16"></a>That point was perfectly well perceived in the discussions in the other place where opinions were expressed, which I think have been quoted, that the original clause--it was then Clause 21--would create difficulties and a dangerous thin end of the wedge in relation to the situation in the home. Therefore, at the very last moment, at about 6 a.m., Clause 23--it is now Clause 121--was substituted for the original clause; namely, Clause 21.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para17"></a>However, the matter does not stop there. We are again running into difficulties with the European Court of Human Rights. I understand that a case is before it at the moment of corporal punishment in the home involving a step-father who caned his boy on the legs with a cane. I understand that judgment may be given in the course of next week. If that were to be so, the Government would have at least to consider adjusting the law in this country. I respectfully ask whether it would not be wiser to leave the matter for consideration until we know what the European Court has to say, when we can then consider with greater calm and detachment and away from the difficulties of this Bill the whole question of control and discipline in the home and its relation to a small number of independent schools. I support the attempt of the noble Baroness to regulate the situation in a calm and moderate way and in accordance with the European convention. I hope that her amendment will be carried.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para18"></a>Perhaps I may draw attention finally to two good points about the amendment. First, it contains definitions of both "corporal punishment" and of "lawful corporal punishment". Those are helpful. Secondly, the amendment refers to the reasons why corporal punishment may be administered in certain circumstances, taken pretty well directly from the judgment of the court in the case of Costello-Roberts. I support the amendment.

<A NAME="80616-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Annan: </B>   I am extremely sorry to be in disagreement with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, whose words of wisdom I have always admired enormously. The noble and learned Lord said that we are not talking about ritual punishment. All corporal punishment in a school inevitably becomes ritualised. Curious tremors go through a school when corporal punishment is to be administered.

<A NAME = "80616-13_para19"></a>I must ask the noble Baroness what she means by "lawful corporal punishment". Does the noble Baroness favour the tawse, the riding crop, the cane or perhaps the birch, which used to be a great cry from the women at Conservative Party conferences long ago? Does the noble Baroness favour the mode of punishment that I remember from my own prep school, which was administered by what was called "Punishment Bat No. 1" on sale at Harrods? We must have some response on this matter. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, said that "corporal punishment" is defined in the amendment, but it does not seem to me to be defined at all. I should like an answer to that question.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-13_para20"></a>I turn now to subsection (2)(b) and to the position of two pupils committing an offence. Of course, we have had this discussion before in the debate on, I believe, the 1996 Bill. What happens if two pupils commit an offence and one, by his parents' permission, is soundly caned while the other who is "an assisted pupil" is therefore not allowed to submit to corporal punishment? Is that a fair way of dealing with the two children? The second child will no doubt be punished by many hours of physical drill or detention, but is that really fair? What if the assisted pupil is so disgusted by the unfair differentiation that he or she insists that he or she suffers the fate of the fellow delinquent? Note that I say "he or she". Nothing in this amendment differentiates between boys and girls. Will girls be subjected to corporal punishment? Under many recent Acts that have been passed to outlaw discrimination of any kind, that will happen. Who is to administer the punishment to the girls? Will it be administered by a male member of staff? That is perfectly possible within the terms of this amendment. The sexual implications of that have not been made clear, and I hope that they will not escape the attention of the Committee.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80616-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I thank my noble friend for allowing me to intervene. The noble Baroness does not introduce any new principle. The amendment simply permits the continuation of what happens at the moment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Annan: </B>   I do not address the principle but the legal document before us by which these things will be possible. Is this punishment to be administered only by members of the staff or by the boys and girls themselves? Perhaps the only good thing that came out of the Public Schools Commission was its recommendation that the beating of boys by boys was something that schools should abolish. I am glad that many of them have done so. But under this amendment it is perfectly possible for a school to say that the prefects shall have power to beat the boys.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para0"></a>I remind the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, of what happened to a near-contemporary of his, Lord Clark. When Kenneth Clark boarded the school train at Waterloo as a new boy, unaware of any of the Winchester "notions", i.e. the rules about how boys should behave towards one another, he chatted away to a lot of the other boys. When he arrived he was summoned by the head of his house and told--I use the Wykehamist phrase--to "sport an arse" and he was <P>


<a name="column_1492"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>soundly beaten. Of course, that disappeared from Winchester and enlightened public schools long ago. Nevertheless, in the terms of this amendment it is possible for that to happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para1"></a>In an amendment of this kind should we not make it perfectly clear who is entitled to administer corporal punishment to other pupils in the school? For example, referring to subsection (4), what form of corporal punishment does not involve inhuman and degrading treatment and contravene the pupil's convention rights? I should very much like to be enlightened on that point. Nearly all corporal punishment involves degrading treatment; indeed, that is one of its main purposes. I pose that question because I believe that in view of subsections (5)(d), (e) and (f) the court would be almost bound to conclude that the punishment was degrading.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para2"></a>There may be parents who still believe that to spare the rod spoils the child. In that respect I am very much on the side of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce. I believe that parental rights should not be invaded. If they want to flog and beat their children--of course within the law--they are entitled to do so. But when one is considering a school the state has a right to interfere and to lay down exactly what should and should not be done. This practice should not be legalised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para3"></a>It is often said that it never did anyone any harm, but can one number the autobiographies written in the past 40 to 50 years that have made perfectly plain that such a practice caused harm? It is also responsible for a good deal of perverse conduct. Some years ago I recall going up Wellington Road and observing among the graffiti the statement "Bring back the birch!" Underneath it some willing suppliant had written "Please!" This kind of conduct is encouraged by the continuation of beating in schools. I have no wish to interfere with the right of anyone who gets pleasure from being whipped or whipping another, but there is no doubt that from the poet Swinburne onwards what stimulates this in the first place is corporal punishment.

As the noble Lord, Lord Monson, points out, this amendment does not legalise anything but merely prevents something that has gone on for a long time from being made illegal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para4"></a>I return to the more central point. I am one of those noble Lords--not many--who took part in the debate when the noble Baroness, Lady David, managed to persuade this House to abolish corporal punishment in state schools. I said at the time that the results would be disastrous, and so it has proved. We have seen endless assaults by young hooligans and pupils--it is now fashionable to refer to them as students--upon their teachers. We have seen them backed up by parents who have assaulted teachers. We have removed a protection from the teaching profession and have not substituted anything else. Whether the current leaders of the teachers' unions take a different view is another matter.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para5"></a>It goes further than that. We have seen a general reluctance in our society to check behaviour, however bad. One of the consequences of the success of the noble Baroness, Lady David, is the recent events in the streets of Marseilles. That is how the young English who have been freed from corporal punishment find it easy and profitable to behave. This is a fact.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para6"></a>We are told that corporal punishment does not happen in other countries. No doubt they have other forms of penalty. For instance, we have not devised appropriate penalties for parents who allow their children to play truant from school and when in school to obstruct the teaching of others. We have become a totally undisciplined society and it is beginning to make Britain look foolish in the eyes of the world. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady David, and even that absurd institution, the European Court of Human Rights, did not intend to bring that about, but they have done so. Although I believe that the question whether a few independent schools are or are not allowed to inflict corporal punishment is a relatively minor matter, the passing of this amendment will show that at least some Members of this House know what is going on and regret it.

<A NAME="80616-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I should like to make one response in regard to football hooligans. The fact is that in no other country in Europe is corporal punishment allowed in schools. They have had some trouble on the cricket pitches and in other places.

<P>
<A NAME="80616-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   I do not wish to detain the Committee long, but it may be appropriate for me to make a few observations based on my long experience as a schoolmaster rather a long time ago. The boys I taught did not frequently go to Oxford or Cambridge. They attended schools which sometimes presented the teachers with severe challenges.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para7"></a>As the years passed, my experience of 17 years in education in a mining area led me to become less and less enthusiastic or supportive of the case for corporal punishment. The noble Lord, Lord Annan, has given examples of the sheer impracticality which surrounds the amendment. The noble Lord referred to the situation where two boys commit an offence and the parents of one say, "Yes, cane him", and the parents of the other say, "You cannot cane my son". Do you cane one and not the other?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para8"></a>Even worse, if a boy commits an offence at school and is caned, and another boy commits a similar offence the following week and his parents object to caning, is that boy caned? What does the Committee think will happen to relationships in schools if some boys are caned for one offence and others are not caned for committing a similar offence? What will be the relationship between boy and teacher, or boy and boy? It will be impossible to operate a school in an effective and fair manner without experiencing a quite corrosive effect on relationships.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para9"></a>I share the distaste, horror and abhorrence of the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, for the events in Marseilles. Perhaps we need more order in our society. It is a pity that the noble Lord did not offer those examples to the <P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para10"></a>One has to be practical about the law and the requirements of discipline. But we shall not beat children into good behaviour. We have to apply common sense; and I do not see much common sense in the amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="80616-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   I have listened carefully to all the speeches. I do not understand any noble Lord to be arguing that it is in the nature of liberalism or libertarianism that children should be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by teachers in state or private schools. All Members of the Committee seem to agree that the universal human right proclaimed 50 years ago in the universal declaration, in the English Bill of Rights of 1689, and subsequently defined in all the international human rights codes--that there should be no inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment--is one with which every Member of this House would agree.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, asked how it is the business of this House (or of another place, I suppose he would argue) to impose standards in the circumstances of the amendment. I shall try to answer him.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para12"></a>I have only two qualifications for making this speech. First, I inflicted corporal punishment as a prefect in a boys' school in front of a group of other prefects. I did so only once. It degraded me; it degraded the pupil; and it convinced me that corporal punishment is inherently degrading. But I would not seek to inflict that view on the population at large for obvious libertarian reasons, if that were all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-14_para13"></a>My only other qualification is that I argued one of the first corporal punishment cases. I should like briefly to recall what it was about. It answers the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, who argued that the common law perfectly protects pupils in this country against inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. At least, I think that that is what he submitted, among other things.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80616-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wilberforce: </B>   Not "perfectly".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   Certainly in the case of Karen it was far from perfect. The story of Karen could apply equally to any independent private school. She had been smoking outside the school premises. I think that she was 15. She was caned by a male deputy headmaster in the presence of another master. We took the case to Strasbourg and had no difficulty in showing that le vice anglais, as it is called by the rest of Europe--the vice that the English and Irish, unlike the rest of Europe, have enthusiastically and less enthusiastically indulged in for a long time--had led to her degrading punishment. As a result the government of the day had to settle the case. As we know, corporal punishment in state schools had eventually to be <P>


<a name="column_1495"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1495</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>abolished by Parliament in order to comply with Article 3 of the human rights convention which forbids inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para0"></a>Meanwhile the steady evolution of the European court's case law--the court of which the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, so disapproved but which has been so careful in gradually moving in this area--has made it clear that states have a positive obligation to protect children against inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, whether in state or private schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para1"></a>In the early cases there was concern about freedom of choice. In cases where parents did not want their children to be subjected to corporal punishment, the court said that it was an interference with their freedom of choice not to be able to protect their children. But then the court became stronger and said in some of its cases that there would be breach of the guarantee against ill treatment in Article 3 of the convention. I have little doubt that quite soon the court will hold that corporal punishment in any circumstances except those provided for in Clause 121 of the Bill, where one is dealing with imminent threats to the person or property, is inherently degrading and in breach of Article 3.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para2"></a>My difficulty about the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness is this. Although I know that it is not the noble Baroness's intention, I believe that the amendment would authorise breaches of Article 3 of the convention; or at best be so confusing as to make it difficult to know what the law was. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, said that the amendment was agnostic. With respect, I do not think that that is right. It is not an agnostic amendment. It authorises corporal punishment in the circumstances set out in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para3"></a>What is wrong with the provision in a nutshell is that it does not embody the criteria needed to guarantee against inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Perhaps I may explain. First, it does not refer to the nature and gravity of the pupil's misconduct. It does not refer to the proportionality of the punishment to the nature and gravity of the pupil's misconduct--a crucial principle being that the punishment must fit the crime. As the noble Lord, Lord Annan, pointed out, it does not refer to the gender or age of the pupil, and of the teacher inflicting the punishment. Under the amendment, it is perfectly possible to authorise Karen's example: a male teacher, perhaps in the presence of another male teacher, inflicting corporal punishment on a 15 year-old girl. And it assumes that corporal punishment is not inherently degrading. As I explained, I believe that it is; and I believe that the European Court will say so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, asked how it is our business to give effect to international human rights guarantees to which we must give effect under international human rights law. What is the business of the state or the legislature in giving effect to those safeguards? The answer is, first, that there are universal human rights to which all civilised countries adhere and recognise, of which the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment is one of the most fundamental.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para5"></a>Secondly, the state has a positive obligation to protect its citizens, especially its children, against ill treatment. That is not paternalism, it is not a breach of the John Stuart Mill principles, it is simply a recognition that the state has a responsibility to protect against the ill treatment of children.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para6"></a>Thirdly, it does not matter whether 66 per cent. of the British people are or are not in favour of corporal punishment in schools. It does not matter because, I suggest, basic human rights and their protection do not depend on the outcome of elections or the determination of majoritarian beliefs. Furthermore, if the democratic branch of the legislature by an overwhelming vote--that is, the elected representatives of the people--find it possible on a free vote in accordance with their consciences to disregard the beliefs of the majority, it does not behove us, the unelected part of the legislature, to disregard that massive vote in another place and make ourselves look somewhat older than we are and somewhat more outmoded and ridiculous than we would like to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para7"></a>I do not criticise the noble Baroness for tabling the amendment. To that extent, I respectfully disagree with my noble friend Lord Tope. The noble Baroness is perfectly entitled to table the amendment and we have had a healthy debate. However, I very much hope that she will not press it to a vote, but that if she does the answer will be the same as in another place.

<A NAME="80616-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I am glad to support my noble and learned friend Lord Wilberforce and the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. Clause 121, which was not in the Labour Party manifesto--and rightly so because it would have done it no good--is wholly illiberal in that it seeks to force progressive prejudices--or "trendy Leftist prejudices", to use a populist description--on those who in all sincerity and honesty take a different view. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, will agree that we are not talking about inhuman treatment. No one advocates that. Nor are we talking about boys beating other boys, a practice which rightly disappeared a long time ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para8"></a>Why should not thoughtful and caring parents who want their children to receive fair but firm discipline--firmer than they would receive at a state school and which may involve in extremis corporal punishment administered by those in loco parentis (a point that has been forgotten all too often in the debate)--be allowed to continue to make that choice? We are not talking only about conventional public and prep schools, many of which have already abolished corporal punishment; we are talking also, for example, about private day schools with a strong religious influence catering largely for children of West Indian descent. As anyone with any knowledge of the Caribbean will confirm, discipline in schools in the English-speaking West Indies is as strict as it used to be in this country prior to the 1960s. Many West Indian parents know that their children thrive on such firm discipline and are prepared to make <P>

<P>
<A NAME="80616-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   In many respects, I find the debate extremely distressing. It is extraordinary that one should hear arguments supporting the retention of a degrading and demeaning form of punishment if only because it is thought by some that the application of corporal punishment has a deterrent effect. Surely, that can be the only justification for proposing that it be retained in any sector of our educational establishment. Over the years, a great deal of evidence has accumulated to the effect that, for instance, capital punishment has no deterrent effect in relation to violent crime. The same arguments have been adduced in relation to the deterrent effect of corporal punishment in schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para9"></a>Discipline can be introduced and maintained in schools without any suggestion of applying some demeaning treatment. It is a mechanism which breeds hostility and resentment. I recall my early school days in an elementary council school in Durham County of which my father was the head teacher. His senior assistant master caned every child in the class for failure to complete a mathematical programme. I confess that I deeply resented that and even now recall it with a sense of resentment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para10"></a>It seems to me that we are looking at an anachronistic clause in a Bill which, if added to by the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, will allow the retention in our society of a punishment which is no deterrent and which I believe was properly removed from the maintained school sector a considerable number of years ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para11"></a>I found it astonishing that the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, in talking about the desperately offensive and degrading behaviour of English fans in Marseilles, should suggest that corporal punishment would have prevented that. Surely, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that punishment such as the restriction of liberty, the removal of passports and even a life long ban on attending football matches would be a much more effective deterrent than corporal punishment. I cannot believe that to treat those individuals with the birch, to which reference has already been made, would have had any effect other than to increase violence on their part and to breed increasing hostility. The delivery of a violent form of punishment will in my view breed violence in return. For that reason, I trust that the Committee will reject the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="80616-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   I support the amendment moved by my noble friend and so cogently and eloquently supported by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce. I found the arguments in support of the amendment much more convincing than the list of hypothetical cases put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Annan. It seems to have fewer reference to contemporary circumstances than to those of his own childhood. Neither did I find convincing the list of the noble Lord, Lord Tope, of organisations which supported his view. I was not brought up to believe that trotting out a list of people who agree with one is an argument.

<A NAME = "80616-15_para12"></a>Furthermore, the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, appears to be unable to distinguish between his right to hold his opinions and his right to enforce them on everyone else. That is the nub of our disagreement. We all repudiate the right of people to inflict barbarous and inhuman punishment on their own children. However, our opinions differ as to what constitutes barbarous and degrading punishment. We are arguing for the right of parents to inflict lawful punishment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para13"></a>My argument is based passionately on my belief in liberty, on the absolute lexicographical priority of liberty; that is to say, that we do not trade-off liberty against certain other goods; that liberty is prior and must be upheld at all costs unless a clear harm is being done to others. That is John Stuart Mill's argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para14"></a>The question I wish to ask is: what is the difference in law between allowing parents to administer certain punishments in their own homes and delegating that right to others to administer them? What is the relevant difference? It seems to me that the logical consequence of the argument put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Lester--and he admitted it--is that because there is no logical difference the law will be driven by steps to control the right of parents to administer punishments which they deem right in their own homes. In other words, the parental slap will sooner or later become a battery as far as the law is concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-15_para15"></a>What is the consequence of that? Children will be encouraged to report on their parents. Neighbours will be encouraged to report on what is going on next door, possibly by a special line to Esther Rantzen. We shall gradually creep into a position which we so deplored when it happened in the Soviet Union. It will be said that that is impossible; that it cannot happen in England. But it can happen because things which seem reasonable in themselves, if continued by small steps, can lead to a situation which no one would wish. That is why I emphasise the priority of liberty. Of course the Minister understands that argument. But does she believe in it?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80616-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   I am sure I must be right about this but in his argument about liberty, the noble Lord is not arguing, is he, that liberty justifies infringement of basic human rights and freedoms, including the ill treatment of children even by their own parents, any more than it justifies, for example, slavery or racial discrimination? He is not an absolutist about liberty. Does he then accept that if the international human rights codes forbid a certain level of punishment as being inhuman or degrading it is our obligation to make sure that we protect our children from the possibility that their basic rights will be infringed by institutions, whether state or independent, when those children are at school?

<A NAME="80616-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   I believe that we have a right to make up our own minds as to what constitutes barbarous and inhuman treatment.

It does not introduce any new principles or laws. It simply safeguards a liberty which exists. I do not believe that corporal punishment will have a long and glorious future. Most people already do not believe in it very much. I believe that it has its uses under exceptional and special circumstances and that the right to it should be retained.

<A NAME="80616-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   I cannot support the amendment but I see difficulties and understand some of the thinking that prompted it. First, I am afraid that I warmly support the spanking of children by their parents, particularly when they are small. Very often, a spank and a kiss solves everything whereas cold-hearted treatment and reasoning leaves a much greater mark on a child. It is much better to administer a brisk spank and then to make up and say sorry. I believe in that, but I do not support what the amendment proposes to retain. However, I acknowledge the major difficulty raised by my noble friend Lord Beloff. I do not yet see what will be done to enable teachers to keep order now that they have lost a rather simple remedy when dealing with violent children.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-16_para1"></a>I know an excellent Somerville graduate who became a teacher. She was the daughter of teachers and the only thing she wanted to do was to teach. She achieved a first in physics and I rejoiced to think that a good scientist would be teaching in our schools. After six years and three schools she gave up, because, as she told me, in each school she had encountered one hard core of children in a class--sometimes there could be more--who were not only determined not to learn but who were also determined to prevent others from learning. They were violent and impossible to control. In each case when she asked her headmaster what sanctions she had, she was told there were none. She was not allowed to send them home. In one case she was told, "Don't, for God's sake, do anything or we shall have the parents coming and beating us up." That situation is extremely dangerous and something must be done to solve it. It may be one reason for suggesting the retention of the power, but I cannot support the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>punishment is frequently the easy way out when one is talking of discipline. There are other ways of disciplining which are far more effective. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, talked about discipline within a caring ethos. There are ways of disciplining within a caring ethos which are far more demanding both for those who administer the discipline and for those who receive it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-16_para3"></a>Earlier, there was mention of the association between corporal discipline and religion. I found that rather difficult to follow. I am not clear quite what forms of religion were being referred to. Certainly, the religious tradition in which I stand goes back to the gospels. I should find it difficult to find in the gospels any mention of corporal punishment. In the gospels there is a strong sense of discipline and I should point out that the word "discipline" is related to the word "disciple". A disciple is one who learns and discipline is to enable us to learn. But it is difficult to find in my religious tradition the notion of corporal punishment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-16_para4"></a>I always understood the phrase in loco parentis to mean those who took over responsibility and care of children, not that those who took over that particular role could do whatever parents do. It seems to me that there is a distinction between what institutions do and what a parent does. Again, I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Park, said. There is an immediacy about parental involvement, held as it is within a strong framework of affection which is different from discipline administered by an institution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-16_para5"></a>Finally, I make the point that many people these days choose to send their children to Church schools because they believe that in such schools there is precisely that strong, firm discipline within a caring ethos. But within Church schools, certainly those in the maintained sector, corporal punishment is not allowed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Milverton: </B>   I am afraid that I cannot support my noble friend's amendment. Perhaps my wife and I have been fortunate. We never wanted to smack. We never found it necessary and we never wanted to do it. To me, it seems senseless and pointless just as it seems to me to be pointless to have caning in some schools. I was caned. Why? Just because one had a half-cross mark for some misdemeanour. If one reached four crosses, one knew that meant the cane. One was caned by a sixth former, with the rest of the sixth form watching. Although it was meant to be hush-hush in the house, everybody knew that it would happen after prayers. One went to one's study and knew that there would be knock, knock, knock, and one would be told to go along to the library to receive one's punishment. It seems pointless.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-16_para6"></a>In all this, surely discipline comes from winning respect. One knows that it is dashed hard for teachers in many state schools. Is one of the reasons for nuisance children who prevent others from learning that their parents have not been able to win their children's respect, or that those children have not seen their parents give respect to others? Surely the core of discipline is respect, not only towards others but towards oneself.

<A NAME = "80616-16_para7"></a>Children will respect adults who respect them. That is how it must be done. That is a hard task. At the school where my wife teaches, Marlborough College, a girl from a state school is attending for her sixth form years. She and her sister found it dashed hard to learn at the state school because it was made hard for them to do so. The staff were, in a sense, tired out by doing what they had to do. It was difficult for those girls to get the staff to help them. All credit to that girl's sister: she got through it and went to university. Discipline comes from respect between all.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-16_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Warnock: </B>   I hope that this debate will turn out satisfactorily for me. I hope that we shall not be high on the concept of liberty--that we are depriving people of their liberty by refusing to continue to permit corporal punishment in independent schools. It is clear that we are divided morally--that is, whether we think corporal punishment is right or wrong is a moral question. There is also a tremendous amount of evidence in schools that violence breeds violence. The best schools are those where corporal punishment has not for a long time been used even if it is permitted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-16_para8"></a>There is a huge difference between passing and enforcing a law that is intrusive and would in any case be difficult to enforce--such as one making it illegal to exercise corporal punishment in the home. The concept of corporal punishment in an institution, be it a private school or maintained school, is ultimately under the eye of the law. What happens there can be discovered without undue intrusiveness or spying. It is one of those frequent cases where, for example, one might wish for a law against adultery but to have such a law would be obviously and hopelessly intrusive. The evils that came from such a law would be far worse than any good that could come of it. One must always take into account the difference between private morality and public morality. We are undoubtedly debating what is public morality.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-16_para9"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Meston, knows, I am not much enamoured of the concept of human rights but, where we are prepared to talk about human rights, we are talking about a consensus of what is evil and bad for human beings in general. If we must talk about human rights, there is a consensus--as demonstrated in another place, against corporal punishment. We would be utterly wrong to go against that consensus--although we are all perfectly entitled to express our own moral opinions.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   If the noble Baroness believes that corporal punishment, however humanely administered or however loving the environment, harms the child, how can she say that such punishment can be justified at home but not at school--especially at private school?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Warnock: </B>   I do not believe that corporal punishment is justified in the home. I was merely saying that it would be extremely contrary to the general public good to have a law against it, because that would be too intrusive. Respect for privacy would tell against such a law. I would not say that corporal punishment is justified in the home. On the contrary. We are in a <P>


<a name="column_1502"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1502</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>position to prevent corporal punishment in schools. We are probably not in a position to prevent corporal punishment in the home. It is not that corporal punishment is good in one case and bad in the other. It is bad in all cases. In my view, modern morality must be taught largely by example. The exercise of violence is no way to encourage inner discipline and goodness. I certainly do not think that by law there should be the freedom to commit that kind of harm on a child.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   I apologise to the Committee for rising to speak, having just come in. I had a public duty in the North and I have just arrived.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-17_spnew3"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   I want the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, to amplify her remark that many schools want the exemption that she advocates in her amendment. Just how many private independent schools want exemption? What proportion of the private independent educational sector supports the noble Baroness? I understood my noble friend, Lord Tope, to say that level of support has not been reflected in the representative body of private independent schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para0"></a>I spend much of my professional life involved in cases concerning the physical abuse of children. That abuse is often inflicted in the home, by a parent or step-parent. They are people who, with the best will in the world, do not know where to draw the line, then seek to justify their actions after the event by saying that they were exercising reasonable chastisement--sometimes, with quite dreadful results.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para1"></a>Of course there is a distinction to be drawn between what happens and can be regulated in the home and what can happen in a school. The common theme is that violence begets violence and does so from one generation to another. Quite the wrong message will go out from this Committee if we support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-17_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Debates on corporal punishment always demonstrate a very wide range of personal views, most of them irreconcilable. This debate is no exception. It would be quite wrong for me to try to respond to the debate or indeed in any way to sum it up. As I said earlier, this is a matter for a free vote. All I want to do is make a few brief points where I understand that the factual position may not be entirely clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para2"></a>It is perhaps worth noting that very few independent schools still use corporal punishment and that there was broad support from the independent schools associations for the intent of Clause 121. Moreover, I should also like to mention that there is continuing international criticism of the UK's seemingly inconsistent position: both the UN Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended in 1995 that corporal punishment in independent schools should be outlawed completely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, has called for the restoration of corporal punishment following its abolition in another place on a free vote. As Her <P>


<a name="column_1503"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Majesty's Chief Inspector has reported, we should remember that most schools are orderly communities, although there were one or two purple passages in this debate which suggested otherwise. Where there are serious problems of indiscipline, Section 4 of the Education Act 1997, which comes into force on 1st September of this year, will allow teachers to use "reasonable force" to restrain a pupil from doing certain things; for example, committing an offence, causing personal injury to himself and others, or causing serious disruption. It is also the case that there are powers for schools to exclude extremely difficult and disruptive pupils. In the independent sector, which we are discussing today, there are powers, as has already been mentioned, to expel pupils.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para4"></a>Most teachers do not believe that corporal punishment is the answer or that it would have any practical impact on enforcing discipline or maintaining high standards of behaviour. There have been no demands from school governors or the teacher associations to restore corporal punishment in maintained schools since the amendment was passed in another place. Noble Lords will also recall that attempts during the last Parliament to do so were also soundly defeated on a free vote.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para5"></a>Under this clause a member of staff at a school or a nursery education institution would no longer be able to rely in any type of criminal proceedings--for example, a prosecution for assault--on the common law defence of "reasonable chastisement" to justify the use of corporal punishment. This would affect maintained as well as independent schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para6"></a>The provision as it affects nursery education is very tightly drawn: it would not extend to institutions, groups or premises (such as private homes) where only childcare services are provided, or to parents who teach their children at home. I am advised that these are outside the scope of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para7"></a>I should like to reiterate what my honourable friend Estelle Morris said in another place. The Government have no intention of using the new clause or any other provision to extend the ban on corporal punishment into the family setting. If I understood the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, correctly, she seemed to imply that the Government would seek such a ban at some point. It is the personal responsibility of parents to decide for themselves what disciplinary arrangements are appropriate for their child at home. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, said, it would be extremely intrusive to try to impose a ban on corporal punishment in the home.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para8"></a>It has also been argued that Clause 121 would contravene the European Convention on Human Rights. I understand that similar arguments were used in a case brought against Sweden in 1982, which prohibited corporal punishment in all its schools. The case failed. The European Court of Human Rights has on several occasions made it absolutely clear that it is against corporal punishment in schools. I have received legal advice to the effect that the European Court would therefore be most unlikely to uphold any argument that <P>


<a name="column_1504"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1504</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the new clause would violate the rights of parents, under Article 2 of Protocol 1, who wanted to send their child to a school where corporal punishment was used.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para9"></a>I shall simply end by saying that I personally support this clause and oppose the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-17_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I should like to pick up one of the points made by the Minister about the department's view on punishment. There is much concern among teachers about unruly behaviour in schools and actual damage done to teaching staff. Indeed, one only has to remember the awful death of Mr. Lawrence, because we understand that the young people involved were of school age. In only February of this year the Department for Education and Employment felt compelled to issue draft guidance permitting schools,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the most exceptional circumstances"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para10"></a>and we are talking about in extremis--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to use force in a way that might reasonably be expected to cause injury". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para11"></a>Examples were given in that respect, such as: holding a pupil around the neck by the collar or in any other way that might restrict the pupil's ability to breathe; slapping, punching or kicking a pupil; twisting or forcing limbs against a joint; tripping up a pupil and holding or pulling a pupil by the hair. I understand those are very exceptional circumstances. They are situations where teachers have to intervene in what might be an extreme fight and where someone is in danger of being seriously hurt. I understand the context in which those examples were outlined; nevertheless, they do constitute a form of corporal punishment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para12"></a>In answer to many points that have been made by Members of the Committee during the course of the debate, I should point out that the Department of Health issued guidance to independent schools following the abolition of corporal punishment in state schools. I shall read from the document because it is important and will answer a number of points that have been raised. I shall quote from paragraphs 391 to 395 of the Children Act Guidance, Volume 5, for independent schools:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In normal circumstances children should be encouraged to behave well by the frequent expression of approval by staff and by the generous use of awards rather than by the extensive imposition of sanctions. The latter might reasonably include: temporary removal of privileges, mild or moderate verbal reprimand, additional household chores and restriction of leisure activities. Sanctions which are unproductive, eg writing out of lines, or which involve the use of educational activities, such as essay-writing, should be avoided as a means of punishment. If in exceptional circumstances it is decided to use corporal punishment, it should not be unreasonable (for trivial offences or applied indiscriminately to whole classes) or excessive. In all circumstances punishments and sanctions need to be applied fairly and consistently, making the distinction between minor and serious offences clear, yet at the same time allowing a degree of flexibility for individual circumstances. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In deciding how these criteria are to be applied some allowance needs to be made for the cultural ethos and declared policy of the school. Corporal punishment is widely regarded as particularly inappropriate for children with sensory, physical and intellectual impairment and those with emotional and behavioural difficulties. Details of corporal punishment--date, nature of offence, nature of punishment--should be recorded in the punishment book and the record witnessed by another adult. In normal circumstances corporal <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1505"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1505</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>punishment should only be administered by the head teacher. The imposition of sanctions (but not corporal punishment) by prefects or teachers is permissible". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para13"></a>In other words, to answer the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Annan, no one other than the head teacher can administer corporal punishment but other sanctions can be administered by teachers or prefects, including the minor sanctions to which I have already referred. The document goes on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sanctions administered or imposed should be recorded stating clearly the nature of the transgression and the nature of the sanction, and be subject to monitoring by a senior member of staff who is concerned with care of children within the school. The record should be available to parents". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para14"></a>That is the end of the quotation from the guidance document. Independent schools are bound by that. That is the guidance to independent schools. All those who have written to me have argued strongly that they are entirely happy to live within the guidance of our health department.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para15"></a>The schools are also subject to external inspection. The records and the regime of the school are made available for inspectors to make a judgment on that. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Meston, that I am not in any way supporting something comparable to the abuse of children in the home. Many of the letters I have received state movingly that abolishing corporal punishment in schools will not lessen the incidence of abuse in the home, which we all certainly abhor.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para16"></a>I refer to the point on the European Convention on Human Rights mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. I defer to his expertise in these matters. In the Costello-Roberts v. United Kingdom case the court stressed that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in order for punishment to be 'degrading' and in breach of Article 3, the humiliation and debasement involved must attain a particular level of severity and must in any event be other than that usual element of humiliation inherent in any punishment. Indeed, Article 3, by expressly prohibiting 'inhuman' and 'degrading' punishment, implies that there is a distinction between such punishment and punishment more generally". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para17"></a>In the case of Costello-Roberts, the court expressed,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'certain misgivings about the automatic nature of the punishment and the three-day wait before its imposition', but still considered that the minimum level of severity had not been reached". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para18"></a>We are not talking about excessive severity. We are talking about legal punishment. I wish to quote extracts from letters I have received,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I write as a former parent of a Christian Independent School where I now teach. Never have I taught in a school where there was more loving concern for the whole child. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>When our child was admitted to the school we gave our written consent, giving the school the authority to exercise corporal discipline if it should be deemed necessary. We love our daughter dearly and we felt confident in the staff being just, loving and merciful, and knew that this type of discipline was only used in cases of persistent disobedience or the breaking of the moral code. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>I am glad to say that this type of discipline was never necessary, but I have seen the positive effects of corporal discipline being used. When children choose to cross boundaries set they, like all of us, need to know there is a cost. In our school (very much as it is at home) when the punishment is over the slate is wiped clean and the children have a fresh start. They know they are loved and their value as human beings is undiminished. We trust that they have learned from the episode". <P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para19"></a>Another letter states,

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"While not wishing to denigrate the importance of ensuring that children are not subject to abuse or put at risk we believe it is important to respect the religious convictions of parents who consider that under certain circumstances and after careful consideration, it may be necessary for a school to apply corporal discipline ...

If the amendment is carried, it opens the way for further legislation against any parent using corporal discipline in the home". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para21"></a>Yet another letter states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As a parent I feel this is an infringement on my belief and rights as a parent on how I feel my child should be brought up.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>My son is now 16 years and has benefited greatly from standards and boundaries being set which then had a punishment appropriate that was carried out if he did not stay within the limits set.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>I feel this is the thin end of the wedge. Next ... the home. All of these rules will make no difference to the child battering parents--" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para22"></a>I refer to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Meston--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I feel these are two completely different issues. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>I feel as a parent my need for 'respect of my rights to ensure education and teaching in conformity with my own religious and philosophical convictions' as the European Convention on Human Rights allows". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para23"></a>We are not talking here about inhuman and degrading treatment; that is ruled out by the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para24"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, criticised me for tabling this amendment at the last minute. However, it was tabled on Thursday. If one compares that with the tail end stages of the Bill in another place discussed at 5 o'clock in the morning, I think I probably win as regards having a fuller Chamber to debate this issue. The noble Lord, Lord Annan, asked me about my preference in terms of punishment. Even if I were against corporal punishment, I would support this amendment. I have no preference. I do not wish to choose between a tawse and something else. In fact I think a tawse would be totally outlawed under the present law. I support the right of parents to choose independent education and to choose within the law a punishment regime that they believe is right for their child.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-17_para25"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, made clear, this amendment is not about the merits or demerits of corporal punishment. It is about defending the right of parents to send their children to a school that in extremis applies corporal punishment fairly and within the limits of the European Convention on Human Rights, if that is what they choose.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80616-18_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 257AA and 257AC, 258P and 258S.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-18_para7"></a>These amendments relate to the functions of the Education Transfer Council, which will take over from the Education Assets Board. They are mainly technical and seek to apply the existing transfer provisions in Section 198 of, and Schedule 10 to, the 1988 Act to those transfers that may be necessary under the new framework. Those sections set out the functions of the Education Assets Board (EAB), which is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the department and is responsible for effecting those transfers of property, rights and liabilities required under the 1988 Act. The EAB will be renamed the Education Transfer Council under Clause 126 of this Bill and will have responsibility for effecting those transfers of land required under the new framework.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-18_para8"></a>Amendment No. 246G will also enable the Secretary of State to make such amendments to the transfer provisions as he considers appropriate. If, for example, he were persuaded at a later date that the transfer provisions should be amended, then he could do so. However, in those circumstances I assure the Committee that he would consult fully.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-18_para9"></a>Schedule 10 to the 1988 Act deals with the ownership of shared property. The new schedule introduces those amendments necessary to apply the provisions of Schedule 10 to the 1988 Act to those transfers required under this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-18_para10"></a>At present the EAB acts on behalf of the transferee (for example, a GM school) but we envisage that under the new framework the Education Transfer Council should in most cases have a more neutral role. Its duties would be to assist all parties in their negotiations. The one exception is where the transferor is an LEA and the transferee is a foundation school. In such cases the ETC <P>


<a name="column_1510"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1510</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will continue to act on behalf of the school. This amendment also changes the way in which transfer disputes are resolved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-18_para11"></a>Under provisions contained in Schedule 8 to the 1988 Act, the Secretary of State may determine the pension arrangements and remuneration payable to staff and members of the Education Transfer Council. The Treasury has indicated that such decisions should be delegated to departments, and Amendments Nos. 257AC and 258P formalise that arrangement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-18_para12"></a>The Further and Higher Education Act 1992 contains a number of references that will have to be repealed because they will no longer be needed when the Bill becomes law. They are mainly references to grant-maintained schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-18_para13"></a>This is a fairly straightforward set of amendments to deal with the new framework. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment forms part of a whole batch of 30 amendments and in moving this amendment I will speak to the others in this group. Of the 30 amendments, only three amend substantive clauses. Amendment No. 246D refers to Clause 127, Amendment No. 257R refers to Clause 131 and Amendment No. 257Z refers to Clause 133. The remaining amendments are minor and consequential upon other amendments or to existing legislation. I have provided to the two Front Benches a full and detailed letter, explaining these clauses. I hesitate to risk this procedure, but in view of that fairly full explanation and in the temporary, no doubt, absence of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, I suggest, subject to any questions there may be, that, since the two Front Benches are fairly well informed about these proposals, I should move this amendment without further details, full details having been provided. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   A good try! First of all, I should like to say that had it not been for the pressure that we put on the Government earlier during the passage of this Bill, we would not even have these explanatory notes. For earlier amendments, which came in prolific numbers at the beginning stages, we received no technical notes. The first we knew of what they were about was on the Floor of the Committee and it was only as a result of pressure that we have now received them. I received these this morning and I have had some difficulty in going through the notes and understanding them. I am afraid that, although they are full, they are not quite full enough for my purposes and I have a number of questions.
<P>


<a name="column_1511"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1511</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para2"></a>I have to say to the noble Lord that, although this Bill has been through all the procedures of the House of Commons and is now at the end of the Committee stage in your Lordships' House, we are receiving masses of amendments. I believe that the Liberal Democrats have already made a tally of the number of amendments that have come through--and these are not amendments which have arisen in response to concerns that have been voiced during the course of our deliberations on the Bill. Many of them constitute a rewriting of the Bill and actually putting it right as we go along. One wonders just when this is going to end. Are we going to end up at Report stage with more batches of amendments which alter main schedules or add schedules and alter the technicalities of the Bill? Most of the amendments represent omissions, because this Bill was badly drafted when it was submitted in another place, but how it is that the department has waited until this late stage of the Bill to present so many technical amendments to your Lordships is difficult to understand. I do think we should have an explanation from the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para3"></a>On Amendment No. 246D, why will the order not be a statutory instrument? On Amendment No. 255D, the explanatory note says that some provisions listed in Schedule 30 will be repealed. I would ask: which of them will be repealed? On Amendment No. 257Z, the noble Lord said that the amendment provides for regulations to be made enabling governing bodies to reconstitute in advance of the appointed day and prepare for the new framework and that there will be consultations. Again, may I ask: when?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para4"></a>I have a query about Amendments Nos. 257AE and 258R. There appears to be no mention of Catholic or other denominational schools. I just wonder if that is an oversight or if there is a technical reason why this should be so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para5"></a>On Section 25 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, under Amendment No. 257AF, I understand this to be a section which concerns the transfer of property rights. I simply want to ask about Sections 25 and 26 in relation to the reorganisation of schools in response to a successful ballot to take all grammar schools out of an LEA where perhaps there are a very large number which will require reorganisation. I do not know how this will inter-relate. Interestingly, the amendment talks about movements from the school sector into the further education sector. I would ask: in what situation could that be so? Are we saying that a grammar school could be closed and opened up as a further education college or part of one. If so, we are talking about a very different form of reorganisation from the rather mild form of reorganisation which the noble Baroness hinted at when we talked about grant-maintained schools on a previous occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para6"></a>Section 28(2)(a) refers to options. Why is it intended that the options designated should not be open to former county or community schools which are now part of a group of schools for which a foundation acts under Clause 21 of the Bill? On Section 37, again I understand that this concerns the attribution of surpluses and deficits and applies to institutions entering the FE sector. <P>


<a name="column_1512"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1512</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Again we are talking about movement into the FE sector by institutions which are maintained by an LEA or designated assisted institutions dependent on assistance from a local education authority. How will surpluses and deficits be attributed or allocated?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para7"></a>Section 44 relates to provision for collective worship in further education colleges. Where a grant-maintained school or a grammar school is part of a reorganisation, how is the religious ethos in a grant-maintained school which will become a foundation school, or indeed a voluntary aided school, to be protected if it becomes part of a further education institution? Presumably it will now jump to becoming a further education college which does not have a religious ethos. It is almost inconceivable that a school could become a further education college in itself and so the likelihood is that it would become an adjunct to another one--but, again, what about the protection of the religious ethos?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para8"></a>Turning to Section 58 and seeing how that dovetails with reorganisation plans, this is the one that deals with the reorganisation of schools needed as a result of some local authority land being transferred to or possibly shared with a further education corporation. Again the whole point about reorganisations comes into that. Amendments Nos. 257AG and 258F, together with Amendment No. 258T, will remove the references to instruments and articles of government contained in the Education Act 1994. May I ask: why are these being removed?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para9"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 257AH and 257AJ, I should like to have some clarification here. The amendments relate to Section 324(5) of the Education Act 1996, which provides that if a maintained school is named in a child's statement of special educational needs the governing body of the school must admit the child. This, as I understand it, is about the class size pledge. Where that happens, it means that a school that already has 30 children in a class will be forced to take a child who is statemented, and that will add a considerable burden to the load of the teacher in the classroom, given that teachers who have in a class 30 children who do not have special needs, or at least the sort of special needs which will be subject to a statement, are deemed to have too many children in that class. I should like some clarification that resources, in that eventuality, are guaranteed to the school that would be forced to take such a child.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para10"></a>My final point concerns Amendment No. 259E, which refers to the last paragraph, which states that there will not be provision for interest which is accrued on the proceeds of sale to be included in the compensation. Why?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I was about to say that I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness for raising these issues, but I do not think she would believe me! The noble Baroness was referring to sections in the schedule, where it is quite difficult to relate to the different amendments, but I shall do my best. She raised, on Amendment No. 246D, the question as to why the order will not be a statutory instrument. Such an order will be of particularly limited interest and we have had no recommendations from the delegated powers scrutiny <P>


<a name="column_1513"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>committee or anyone else on this issue. We do not consider that it would require the statutory instrument procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para11"></a>On Amendment No. 255D, relating to the repeal of provisions because they have been spent, they will only become spent when they have accomplished the purpose for which they were enacted. The amendments relate to a number of the clauses. I take the point the noble Baroness made.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My question on the amendment was, which provisions?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   On that clause, they relate to enactments on frameworks under the Education Reform Act 1988 and other legislation which no longer relates to the framework under this Act. A number of other amendments relate to spent amendments. I can go through them if the noble Baroness wishes. Perhaps I may take them together with the other issues she raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-19_para12"></a>The spent amendments are as follows. Amendments Nos. 258M and 258N relate to the local government Acts and deal with the Inner London Education Authority, which is clearly no longer with us. Amendment No. 259J is consequential on other changes. Amendment No. 259K is relevant to the point in respect of spent Acts. The 1966 Act contains transitional arrangements which are deleted. Lastly, Amendment No. 259N relates to the Audit Commission Act, whose provisions are changed by the Bill. I appreciate that the noble Baroness asked why we did not come forward with these amendments or better drafting earlier. However, they are all clearly redundant provisions.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980616/text/80616-20.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble Lord refers to amendments which I have not raised. The ones I raised are quite clear. I gave the numbers of the amendments but so far I have raised no query at all on three of those to which the noble Lord spoke.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   No doubt I should be grateful for that. The noble Baroness referred to spent amendments, spent provisions and spent enactments. She started with Amendment No. 255D. She has in fact received information for which she did not ask, and I shall check whether I have covered Amendment No. 255D in my remarks and come back to her in writing, if I may.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para0"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned Amendment No. 257Z, which relates to the governing bodies being able to be reconstituted in advance of the appointed day. We would wish to consult further on precisely when such a body could be reconstituted. It obviously relates to the point where the new framework comes into effect and further consultation is required as to precisely how that will be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para1"></a>As regards Amendment No. 259E, the noble Baroness asked about interest where transfers were made, and it would not be to the benefit of schools if we were to include the interest where transfers were made under the education Act 1996 rather than this Bill. She also mentioned Amendments Nos. 257AE and 258R, which <P>


<a name="column_1514"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1514</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>relate to Church of England schools. She asked why they did not apply also to Catholic schools. The amendments relate to the Diocesan Board of Education Measure 1991 which does not apply to Catholic schools, only to Church of England schools. They have been brought into line to accord with the provisions of the Bill and have been agreed with the Church of England Board of Education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para2"></a>Amendments Nos. 257AG and 257AF relate to the removal of the instruments and articles of government which we dealt with a few days ago. As articles are being dispensed with, the reference to those instruments will no longer be relevant because they will not contain the relevant information.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para3"></a>Amendments Nos. 257AH and 257AJ relate to the SEN provisions and raise questions of class size, which we dealt with at an earlier stage of the Committee. The question was whether it related to children without statements. The answer is no, not in this provision. We have indicated that provisions for a child with a statement would override the other provisions relating to class size.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para4"></a>As regards funding, we indicated at earlier stages in Committee that funding would meet those provisions. If the noble Baroness requires more detail of that commitment, no doubt we can provide it in writing. That is the principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para5"></a>As to the whole question of the FE sector, the noble Baroness went into details, referring to schedules, which I could not entirely follow. Again, it would be better if we dealt with the implications for the FE sector. Amendment No. 257F and other amendments were covered in the noble Baroness's remarks. There are other provisions where I did not fully follow the questions because they related to sections rather than amendments. I need to provide her with more information which we can return to at Report Stage, if she wishes. I hope that I have covered at least some of her queries.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_time0"></A><H5>7.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I do not find it at all satisfactory. It was almost impossible to follow some of the noble Lord's answers. When I referred to spent provisions, I referred only to one amendment put down by the noble Lord, Amendment No. 255D, and some of the provisions listed in Schedule 30. I asked which provisions. The noble Lord misunderstood my question on Amendment No. 257Z. I did not want the answer that he would consult on the content of such regulations. I know that because it is stated in the note. I asked when the Government would consult on the regulations. That was my question.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para6"></a>I thank the Minister for his answer on Church of England schools and Catholic schools. On FE, he gave me no answer. He said that, yes, there was an FE sector and perhaps we would deal with it another time. But he did not answer my question as to how the provisions relate to the provisions on the grammar school sector where there may be re-organisations. Nor did he say why it is intended that the option of designation should not be open to former county or community schools or <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>how services and deficits would be attributed in Section 37 and whether the religious ethos of a school would be protected in the event of re-organisation where a school was closed and became part of an FE college. That was not referred to, nor was Section 58. The noble Lord has not answered all my questions to my satisfaction.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In terms of the consultation in relation to Amendment No. 257Z and the reconstitution of the governing bodies, I can indicate that the consultation will be engaged in during the coming months. As for further education, in general it would be helpful for me to provide further information on the FE interface. The reason for the reference to further education is that the Further and Higher Education Act contains references which will be overtaken by the new framework. Most of the amendments relating to FE are therefore consequential.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para7"></a>On Amendment No. 255D, I may have indirectly answered the question by going on to the other amendments which relate to spent enactments. I am informed that those specifically covered by Amendment No. 255D are Section 31 of the London Government Act 1963 and Sections 166 and 167 of the Education Reform Act 1988. It would be sensible for me to deal with any other queries at this stage in writing and perhaps clarify some of the answers I have given so that the noble Baroness can be clear whether or not she needs to come back on any of these matters at Report stage.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I shall be grateful if the noble Lord will write to me. However, it makes my point that to bring forward this number of technical amendments with only an explanatory note is not acceptable. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Tope, received such a note. It is difficult to follow and hard work to look up each clause of the Bill to see exactly what is going on and then be expected to accept a block of 30 amendments which range right across the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para8"></a>It is difficult to understand the explanations given. I do not blame the noble Lord; he is probably having as much difficulty as I am understanding the amendments. I should like to think that some of them could be held over until Report stage pending the explanatory letter from the noble Lord. The noble Lord was kind enough to do that in relation to the previous block of amendments which we found difficult to understand.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This is a different situation. The noble Baroness on the Front Bench opposite received no information on the first block and I therefore withdrew the amendments to return at Report stage. With these amendments, as with some intervening amendments, we have attempted to explain them. The vast majority deal with issues which relate to transfers of property and land; they do not deal with any point of educational substance. I therefore ask the noble Baroness to accept that we shall try to clarify the amendments further between now and Report stage, but at this stage perhaps <P>


<a name="column_1516"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1516</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Baroness will accept them. I take the general admonition of the noble Baroness that it is a large number of amendments, but they relate to detailed consequential areas and not to the main points of substance of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-20_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am sorry to come back on the FE amendments. One of my questions was how Sections 25 and 26 interact with the reorganisation proposals, particularly in the light of some of the changes that will come about as a result of the Bill? In Section 28(2)(a), why is it intended that the option for designation should not be open to former county or community schools? They are now part of the group of schools for which a foundation acts under Clause 21 of the Bill. In relation to Section 37, how will surpluses and deficits be attributed? In Section 44, how will the religious ethos of a school be protected? The school may be closed and taken into an extension of a further education college. As I said earlier, it is inconceivable that a school could be closed and become a further education college. But it is helpful to know that the protection is there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para9"></a>If I am wrong, fine. However, the noble Lord is not even attempting in a cursory way to answer those questions. My final question concerns Section 58 and the way in which that section interacts with the reorganisation proposals.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-20_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   These amendments relate solely to the areas that I described. Clearly, they are consequent upon changing the framework of the schools. There are some implications for FE. I am happy to provide further explanation. The whole question of the religious ethos of the schools was dealt with under earlier amendments. It is clear that the religious ethos of schools will be protected and the possibility of a religious school being absorbed, as a result of these provisions, into an FE institution is extraordinarily unlikely. However, in earlier amendments--I recall the exchanges but cannot immediately point to the precise clause--provision was made for the religious ethos to be protected by the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para10"></a>In relation to options on designation, in that sense designation has never been available to county or voluntary controlled schools. The amendments do not make any substantive change to the situation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-20_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   I had not intended to intervene on this batch of amendments and I am not particularly keen to do so now. But this situation is unsatisfactory. We have a large batch of amendments from the Government. I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, says; that is, that they are technical. We received nine pages of explanation this morning. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is rather more diligent than I am; I have not had time to go through and understand them all. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is asking a lot of questions about them but I am in no position to judge the merit or otherwise of her questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-20_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is clearly struggling to answer the noble Baroness. I say that by way of statement and not criticism. I understand why he is struggling; I would be. But I do not understand why, in all the circumstances, the Government feel that they <P>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1517</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot defer the amendments until Report stage when even I might have had a chance to understand them. The noble Baroness may well have received answers that satisfy her and at that stage the Minister will have had a better chance to understand them. Why cannot the Government agree to that?<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980616/text/80616-21.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I understand why the Opposition Benches are concerned at this number of amendments. However, I can assure Members of the Committee that none of them raises the kind of anxieties which lie behind the questions of the noble Baroness. I offered to provide further information to give further reassurance between now and Report stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-21_para0"></a>At Report stage we should be dealing with the central issues of the Bill. I do not believe that there will be sufficient additional information on the content of these amendments to erase anxieties among Members of the Committee. When there was no written information available earlier to noble Lords, it was sensible for me to withdraw my amendments and suggest that we come back to them at Report stage. On this block, it is not sensible. Far less central issues are involved than on many amendments we agreed earlier. The position was that the noble Baroness would not oppose the amendments at this stage but would reserve her opposition until Report stage. I hope that the noble Baroness will do the same for this set of amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I regard this situation as extremely serious. In practice we have had almost no sight of the explanation at all. I was lucky enough to come in an hour early and was able to skim through the amendments, although I have only just done so. The noble Lord has made no serious attempt to offer a satisfactory explanation. Like the noble Lord, Lord Tope, I am not making a personal criticism of the noble Lord. However, he made no attempt to answer my queries. We are asked to take the amendments on trust. We are told that we should not be anxious. Yet there has been no attempt to answer the points I raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-21_para1"></a>The noble Lord cannot treat the Committee with that kind of contempt. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, has not even had an opportunity to read the amendments. To send a nine-page explanatory note on the day of the Bill when we are already busy--we do not have the back-up that the Minister has and are doing most of the work on our own--is not on. It is not part of our democratic process and is certainly not in keeping with the character of this Chamber to ask us to accept 30 amendments on trust with no proper explanation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-21_para2"></a>My questions are fairly detailed and concern eventualities that will happen after the Bill has gone through. For example, Section 28(2) says that it is intended that the options for designation should not be open for county or community schools. But they do not even exist at the moment. They are now part of a group of schools. Section 44 relates to voluntary schools within the meaning of the Bill which need to be included because a number of them will have entered the FE sector before 1st September 1999.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-21_para3"></a>The explanation goes on to say that the provision also covers those foundation and voluntary schools which may enter the FE sector on or after that date but <P>


<a name="column_1518"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1518</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>excludes those foundation schools which might be ex-county GM schools because they will not have denominational status. I asked a question in relation to religious ethos protection and that does not relate to the discussions we had earlier about a school changing within a school sector; this relates to a school moving into the FE sector. We have not had a proper answer to any of those questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-21_time0"></A><H5>7.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   On the noble Baroness's final point, it is clear that any change of status of a school, whether by reorganisation, absorption or any other method, is protected by the earlier clause which relates to protection. That would include absorption in the extremely unlikely situation of absorption into an FE institution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-21_para4"></a>Most of the rest of the noble Baroness's questions will easily be clarified in written information, but not on the basis of exchanges across the Floor, either now or at Report stage. I accept that, in relation to the whole batch of provisions raised by Amendment No. 257AF, which relates to the further education sector, I was not able to follow all the noble Baroness's questions. Therefore, I would be content to withdraw that amendment and its implications and come back to it at Report. However, the rest of the points raised by the noble Baroness on the amendments are highly technical and hypothetical. I do not think it would be sensible for me to withdraw the amendments at this stage. I hope the Committee will accept those amendments on the basis of my withdrawing Amendment No. 257AF relating to the whole of the FE sector and the interface with that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful for that, because that is where my concerns lie and that is what I understand the noble Lord is going to write to us about. If Amendment No. 257AF, with all its sections, is remitted until the next stage of the Bill, I shall be happy. However, the noble Lord, Lord Tope, has already said that he has not had an opportunity even to consider the other amendments. If he is happy with the proposition, we can move on.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   I would accept that, but I would do so unhappily. I asked the Minister directly why this cannot be deferred until Report stage. His only answer was that the purpose of Report stage is to consider the broader issues and matters of substance. Of course it is, but the situation we face now is not of our making; it is entirely of the Government's making. If the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is prepared to accept the Government's word on the matter, I am as well. However, we are supposed to be here to scrutinise a Bill and we are supposed to be scrutinising amendments. Frankly, we have not had an opportunity to do so on a large batch of government amendments. Although that is not the primary purpose of Report stage, I was suggesting that it would at least allow us the opportunity to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-21_para5"></a>I will accept, as others will, what the Minister is proposing. However, I still have not had an answer as to why the Government are not prepared to give us the two weeks--perhaps slightly more than that by the time <P>


<a name="column_1519"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1519</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we reach Report stage--to enable us to do that, and probably to reach the same conclusion the Minister is assuring us we will reach, but at least to be reassured and to know that we have done the job we are put here to do.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-21_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Perhaps I may add to that because I think the noble Lord, Lord Tope, and his colleagues are at a disadvantage. What is the problem with delay? Once we have had an explanatory letter, this should have a fairly smooth passage at the next stage. What is to be lost between this stage of the Bill and Report stage? I really cannot see the Government's problem.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We would have a very distorted Report stage if we had to come back with these amendments at that stage. We are moving into a grave difficulty if we are not prepared to accept the technical amendments which appear on every Bill. They appeared on the previous government's Bills and they will appear on our Bills. Even if the noble Baroness was not personally responsible for some of those Bills, she will find that there were late amendments to a large number of Bills, both in this House and another place, during the previous 18 years. I fear that the draftsmanship of Whitehall has not dramatically improved in the past 12 months, for which I apologise, but it was not one of our early pledges. I hope it will improve over the course of this Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-21_para6"></a>I believe it will be more sensible for the proceedings of the House if we study carefully the issue which the noble Baroness indicates is her major concern--the inadequacies of my answers and her main substantive concern which is the interface with the FE sector--and try to reassure her between now and Report stage. Clearly, she will still have the right to bring back issues at Report stage if she is still unhappy. The whole proceedings at Report stage would make more sense if we accepted the amendments now, subject to the commitments I have given and the withdrawal of Amendment No. 257AF. Then we can make some sensible progress at Report stage on what I think are the more substantive issues.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-21_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   This is becoming more absurd as we go on. If the noble Lord is really saying that we will have a distorted Report stage if these amendments are put on ice until then, that is just the most bizarre statement I have heard today. If the noble Lord is not prepared to give us, the noble Lord, Lord Tope, and his colleagues, and indeed other Members of the Committee, a proper explanation of what the amendments are about and answer some of the questions I asked and perhaps some of the questions the noble Lord, Lord Tope, when he has read them, may also raise, the only course left for us would be to ask for a recommittal of this part of the Bill. That really would hold up the Report stage. To say that what I have proposed would distort the Report stage is nonsense. I overheard the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, saying from a sedentary position that the Report stage would not make sense. I have to say that I am not sure that the <P>


<a name="column_1520"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1520</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill makes sense. But if it does not make sense, the whole idea of the Report stage is to put the Bill into a state in which it does make sense. Therefore, the amendments could be put forward at Report stage.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I did not say from a sedentary position that the Report stage would not make sense. I said that the Bill would not make sense. It would make more sense if noble Lords opposite saw the amendments in their place together with the explanation which will be provided. It will simply be easier at Report stage if we proceed in the way that my noble friend proposes.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980616/text/80616-22.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am not prepared to accept that. That would leave us looking at 30 detailed amendments and having to start changing, modifying and bringing forward amendments in order to address our own concerns. Once the amendments are passed, they are passed and they are in the Bill. We have things to do other than trying to work on these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-22_para0"></a>The noble Lord should simply withdraw the amendments and give us proper explanations and some answers to the questions we have asked. He should also give the noble Lord, Lord Tope, an opportunity to study the amendments. After all, a nine-page letter was delivered today to explain 30 technical amendments. All the questions that were put on the amendments have not been answered satisfactorily. That is not acceptable. Either we will ask for a recommittal or the noble Lord will find that we have great difficulty at the next stage. If the noble Lord is minded to put this to the vote now, it will create a distasteful atmosphere in the Chamber, in that we in the Opposition were not privy to a full explanation of what the amendments are about. That is unacceptable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   Having spent a number of years on the Opposition Front Bench when the party opposite were in government, I had the privilege of receiving 50 new clauses on the Financial Services Bill at Report stage in this House without receiving any explanation at all. The only solution was to move amendments on Third Reading. When the noble Baroness is objecting to what my noble friend is saying, I hope she will bear in mind that she is perfectly entitled to move amendments on Report. There is no problem about that. But please do not waste the time of the House in quarrelling about government amendments that come forward in Committee.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   As a newcomer to the House, I am slightly appalled by the noble Lord's comments. I happened to be in the office this morning when we received the letter. It was very complex and very full. Just to say that that happened in the past and it is therefore acceptable seems completely irrelevant. We should have plenty of time to discuss these complex matters. My noble friend Lady Blatch has done extremely well to come up with as much as she has today, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, has honestly <P>


<a name="column_1521"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>admitted that he has not had a chance to study the amendments. I do think that that kind of intervention is most unwise.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   If the noble Baroness thinks that the intervention is unwise, I would just refer her to Hansard under the previous government, which will show that the Opposition had exactly the same problem. I accept that this is a problem, but this is the Committee stage. If the amendments are, in my view rightly, written into the Bill, it is perfectly possible for the Opposition, in whatever capacity they may be--Liberal Democrats or Conservatives--to move amendments to the Bill when it is reprinted for Report stage. There is no problem with that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   Before the noble Baroness replies, I rise to confirm what my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel said about the passage of business under the previous government. I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, is in her place. She will recall, as I do, that over 90 amendments were tabled on a health service Bill at Third Reading a week prior to the dissolution of the last Parliament.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Both the noble Lord and the noble Baroness make my point. There are two distinctions. The first is that where the Opposition were very concerned they won recommittals as regards some Bills where the House took the view that there had not been sufficient discussion. Secondly, I can say hand on heart that in the years when I took Bills through this House I did most of the work on those Bills myself, being the lead Minister. I was never left wanting in order to answer questions on technical amendments. If I had come into the Chamber armed with 30 amendments in one batch, I would have made absolutely certain that I had the answers to all the devil's advocate questions which might have been put to me.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-22_para1"></a>The distinction here is that there is not a Minister on the Government Front Bench who can answer the questions that I have put on this Bill and these amendments. As I said, the noble Lord, Lord Tope, and his colleagues only had sight of the explanatory letter this morning. I am simply saying that if the noble Lord had been able to answer our questions today the situation would be different.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-22_para2"></a>I know that my colleagues, including the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, and others, with whom I have worked on the Front Bench, and indeed my noble friend Lady Cumberlege, were assiduous in being prepared. My noble friend Lady Cumberlege was assiduous in always having answers to technical questions. The noble Baroness, Lady Jay, shakes her head. My noble friend Lady Cumberlege had a very high reputation and was much respected for the way in which she took legislation through this House. She was usually able to handle questions about her Bills.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   Perhaps I may respond to that point. I was not in any way attempting to undermine any confidence that the House rightly has in the competence of the noble Baroness, <P>


<a name="column_1522"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1522</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lady Cumberlege. She was indeed kind in her explanations to the Opposition. But it is true that there were many occasions on which business of a complex kind was tabled at a very late stage and that is the point under discussion.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   May I make what I hope is a constructive suggestion? If we allow these amendments, with the exception of Amendment No. 251AF, to go into the Bill it will then be possible to prepare two versions of the Bill, one with the amendments and one without. In Opposition I would have found that enormously more helpful than having to do what an Opposition have to do now, which is to put the amendments into the Bill in order to understand what difference they make. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and I had that experience on Home Office Bills.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-22_para3"></a>I suggest to the noble Baroness that we have the two Bills side by side, both amended and unamended, and that we have a full explanation for each amendment. The noble Baroness and the noble Lord Tope will be invited to spend as much time as they think appropriate after receiving the written briefing. The noble Baroness was good enough to say earlier on--the noble Lord, Lord Tope, agreed reluctantly with her--that she was prepared to let these amendments go through without that particular amendment. On the basis of what the noble Baroness and the noble Lord have already agreed, I hope that we can now make progress.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am mainly concerned about the dismissive answers we had from the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, in reducing this to a trivial matter which we should not bother our pretty little heads about. I am saying that there could be quite important points involved. We have asked specific questions and we have had no answers to them. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is suggesting two Bills. I have transposed the amendments on to my Bill. I do not need someone to print them out in a Bill. I did that work this morning when I received the letter and that is what took such a long time. The amendments are already transposed. We do not need two versions of the Bill, one with the amendments and one without.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-22_para4"></a>The point made by the noble Baroness about Third Reading is very difficult especially if the legislation has to go to the other place. We are talking about the Committee stage in this House. The Report stage is to come and these amendments could easily be dealt at that stage. By the time we fully understand them and we have had our anxieties allayed, there will not be a problem.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   I said at the beginning that I had not intended to intervene in this matter at all. As the Government Front Bench has continued digging, the hole has got deeper and deeper. At first we were assured by the Minister that the amendments were technical and that we would find no objection to them. I cannot find that consistent with why, taking them at Report stage, they would distort that stage of the Bill. If the Minister <P>


<a name="column_1523"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1523</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is right--and I am prepared to believe him--the amendments would probably have gone through without comment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-22_para5"></a>The next thing I heard was that this performance is justifiable because the last government may have behaved in a worse manner or in the same way. I do not wish to join in an argument about that, but it is no assurance to me and my colleagues on these Benches that the present Government are as bad as the previous administration.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-22_para6"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. I am sorry it has taken so long to get to this stage. He has made a helpful and constructive suggestion. I did not get the letter until this afternoon because I did not arrive at the House until then. I have not done all the work that the noble Baroness has done. I find the noble Lord's suggestion very helpful. If we can proceed on that basis, we can bring an end to the matter now. But it has been a very unsatisfactory performance.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   On the basis of what the noble Lord, Lord Tope, has just said I hope that we can complete Amendment No. 246D and then move on, as suggested by my noble friend Lord McIntosh.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-22_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am not going to oppose that because it would hold up things even more. I intend to make a complaint through the usual channels because I find the dismissive way in which my questions were treated quite distressing.

<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am not what I seem. I am No. 445590 Morris, Brian, d.o.b. 4.12.30, male, C of E. I know this because it was written on the little plastic bracelet placed on my wrist on 21st January last when I became a patient in The Royal Hospital, Chesterfield, whence I came this morning to ask the Question standing in my name.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para11"></a>The facts are not in dispute. We are facing the worst nurse shortage crisis in 25 years: the first ever shortfall in applications for nurse education places in England. In 1993/4 there were 18,100 applications for 12,000 places. In 1996/7 there were 15,400 applications for 16,100 places. Turnover among registered nurses was 21 per cent. in 1997, up from 12 per cent. in 1992. Vacancies remain unfilled. One report in 1997 suggested that there was a shortage of more than 8,000 full-time posts across Britain. The Royal College of Nursing reports that the number of nurses aged over 55 will double over the next five years, with 25 per cent. of registered nurses in the NHS eligible for retirement by the year 2000.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para12"></a>What a boring recital that is. How easy it is to ignore that set of percentages. It will be all right; someone will do something. The Government will find some money. After all, nursing is a vocation, is it not? Nurses will not take industrial action; they care too much about their patients. That is not good enough; it will not do. Try being one of those patients and see how you feel.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para13"></a>Last March the Nuffield Trust published Improving the Health of the NHS Workforce. That report said that the most commonly cited causes of psychological disturbance among nurses were high workload, workload pressures, the effect of workload on personal life, staff shortages, unpredictable staffing and scheduling, and not enough time to provide emotional support to patients. I have watched that happen every day since 21st January on a medical ward in a typical county hospital. On the morning I was admitted to The Royal Hospital, Chesterfield, my first impression was of nurses hurtling about, moving beds, answering telephones, dishing out meals like waitresses, making beds, dispensing drugs, or sitting at the nurses station writing up reports, requests and readjusting notes, endlessly rushing round or writing. One senior nurse said as she left the ward that she had done a nine-hour shift. She had not had time for a break. She had not had time to eat or go to the loo all day. The reference in the Nuffield Trust report to the "effect of workload on personal life" is euphemistically polite. It means: how does one cope with a physically and emotionally exhausting hospital shift and then go home and look after one's children or dependent relatives, or study for hours to get additional qualifications, or to keep up to date, and then do the housework? One young nurse who <P>


<a name="column_1540"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1540</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>had been married for only a year or so summed it up cynically and succinctly when she said that these days nursing did not do much for wedded bliss. I could see what she meant.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "80616-26_para15"></a>What is the remedy?"
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para16"></a>My noble friend the Minister may well put the same question to me, since I have told her little that she does not already know and I have suggested no solutions. What we can all welcome is the Government's &#163;2.15 million nationwide campaign to recruit nurses. I hope that when my noble friend replies she will be able to give the House an up-to-date report on progress in that initiative. A young woman, or now a young man, aged 18 considering nursing as a career must qualify via a three-year course given or validated by a university, which is equivalent to any other university first degree course. It is true that bursaries worth some &#163;4,000 to &#163;5,000 are available, but upon graduating successfully the nurse will start work with a salary of some &#163;12,000 while her contemporaries entering other professions or businesses will immediately command a much higher figure. Those contemporaries will rarely be called upon to empty bedpans, clean up the incontinent, or mop up vomit in the earliest years of their employment; nor will they often carry life or death responsibility for their clients. A higher starting salary after registration may encourage potential students to view the prospect of nursing as a career with greater equanimity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para17"></a>Better career development plans would help. Almost the only way to gain significant promotion is to leave the bedside and go into management or academic work. Is there not a case for establishing a new grade of top rank nurse? That is exactly what is proposed for really good teachers in schools who do not wish to become head teachers because that would remove them from the classroom teaching in which they excel. Something must also be done about the high drop-out rate in pre-registration training. Some areas report 30 per cent. and more. This is surely an avoidable waste of scarce resources. This is closely studied in the attrition formula described on page 123 of the report Project 2000: Fitness for Purpose by the Universities of Liverpool and Warwick. Perhaps the Minister can also bring us up to date on the prospects for that report's recommendations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para18"></a>One thing comes through again and again about pre-registration training: practical clinical skills are not sufficiently achieved by the student. The clinical teacher role has gone and quite senior clinicians have to waste their time teaching new nurses how to do things on the wards. Perhaps an internship for the diplomates at the end of their course is necessary. After all, new nurses are in law accountable for their practice from day one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para19"></a>The Project 2000 report also discusses the possibility of an entirely new structure for training health service professionals in which medical students, nursing students and others are taught together those basic, elementary things they all need to know, for example how to give injections correctly, and even how to wash <P>


<a name="column_1541"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1541</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hands correctly. I have seen several very dry thumbs in the past five months. An integrated preliminary course could lift the status of the nurse and aid recruitment considerably. Will my noble friend look kindly on the idea?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para20"></a>Turning to the problems of retention and the awesome 21 per cent. turnover rate, can my noble friend assure me that family-friendly employment policies are being fostered by her department? Forty-eight per cent. of nurses have caring responsibilities for dependent children. Twenty-five per cent. have caring responsibilities for dependent adults. How on earth do they cope? The RCN reports that some 66 per cent. of nurses have no workplace creche or nursery facilities available. Surely, this must be given higher priority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para21"></a>Related to this is the issue of so-called goodwill hours. In the past months I have watched very many nurses due to stop work at the end of a shift work on for several hours simply because there is work to do for one or more of their patients. They cannot and would not charge money for this time, nor could they demand time off in lieu because that would complicate the shift rotas. They simply work the extra hours for nothing. I tried to find out the national figures for this voluntary work and was told they were not recorded, no doubt on the fine old Civil Service principle of "do not ask a question if you think you might be appalled at the answer". Can my noble friend give us some idea of the extent to which the NHS is dependent on this free service?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para22"></a>I am sure that the retention of nurses is being improved by the developments that this Government are bringing in: skillmix, the NHS Direct Scheme, nurse prescribing, primary care groups and clinical governance. They will make the job more challenging and responsible, but there is still a long way to go.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para23"></a>To solve the retirement problem is in a way much simpler. Either you let most nurses retire at 55 and concentrate on recruitment and retention to maintain the workforce, which is simple but risky, or you make the final decade of employment a period in which the physical workload is reduced and these experienced nurses are given increased administrative, advisory and mentoring responsibilities. I suspect that what most of them want is not power or riches but job satisfaction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para24"></a>All reassurances and good news that my noble friend can give in her reply will be gratefully received by patient No. 445590 and by every nurse in the nation.

I wish also to thank the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, for the brisk and arresting way in which he introduced this important debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para25"></a>Nursing is probably as much an art as a science, for although nurses have embraced modern technology with flair and enthusiasm, nursing has also a scientific base. It is as much about good communication, advocacy, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>supporting carers and understanding complex family relationships as mending broken minds and broken bones. GPs now recognise that in addition to those skills nurses are fast becoming the experts in asthma and diabetic care and that with an increasingly elderly population we need nurses now more than ever before.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para26"></a>That is the dilemma which the Government face. Nurses' salaries account for 2.6 per cent. of total public expenditure. That is not NHS expenditure, but total public expenditure. One per cent. on nurses' salaries adds &#163;83 million to the NHS pay bill. In terms of public expenditure, one suspects the Treasury feels that there are too many nurses. But the public beg to differ. There are too few.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para27"></a>This morning the Secretary of State announced another 2,000 hospital beds in order to tackle waiting lists. I, among others, rejoice in that. And, he added,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we will recruit more doctors and more nurses". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para28"></a>It takes three years to train a nurse. On a rough calculation, the Secretary of State is talking about another 2,000 nurses in the next few months. So my first question to the Minister is this. From whence cometh these nurses? The ENB statistics show a shortfall in applications for nurse education places. We know that 60 per cent. of employers report "current and significant problems" in recruitment; and the pay review body suggests a shortfall of 8,000 nurses across the UK.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para29"></a>My second question concerns the status of nursing. When I left school there were really only three careers open to young women unless they were pioneers. One could be a teacher, a nurse or a secretary. Today women are making successful careers in the law, the City, the media, medicine, accountancy and so on. This means competition to recruit to nursing has never been harder. In order to attract more of the very best candidates, I believe that we have to raise yet again the status of nursing. It should be a career regarded as fruitful as those I have mentioned, and that requires an all-degree profession. Of course the work still has to be done and there is an important role for those with national vocational qualifications. But we need the brightest men and women to join this all-important profession. Does the Minister agree, and would she like to comment on that?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para30"></a>My third question relates to retention. Nurses have a thirst for knowledge. The vast majority want to realise their potential and practise the art and science of nursing to their maximum ability. Doctors receive a postgraduate educational allowance. Most nurses have to pay for their postgraduate courses, and it is difficult when they require to be released from their duties by their employer, in particular when it is a GP. That seems to me unfair. Can the Minister consider this inequality in opportunity and ensure that nurses also receive an allowance for postgraduate courses?

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1543</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dinner hour debate, the subject needs your Lordships' highest priority. I hope that the Government will treat it with the utmost urgency.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para31"></a>When I broke my back years ago and had multiple injuries resulting in a great deal of pain, my life was saved by the skill of excellent doctors and nurses who understood the specialty of spinal injuries. In the hospital there was a matron who was highly respected, and sisters who worked on the wards with the patients, junior doctors and nurses, and knew how to make a patient comfortable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para32"></a>Those days have gone. Recently my husband, my noble kinsman Lord Swinton, was in hospital for three months. I saw the sister once, and that was when he had emboli in his lungs--a very dangerous condition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para33"></a>The removal of senior staff from the wards was recently brought home to me when I visited a private hospital in Aylesbury. One of the very senior and best sisters from Stoke Mandeville Hospital was running the nursing in that private hospital. As a result of regrading, her senior post had been made redundant, just to save money. What about her years of experience, which were lost to the National Health Service?
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para34"></a>For many nurses the only way to gain promotion is to leave the bedside and move into management or academic work instead, according to the Royal College of Nursing. I feel that not giving junior nurses the security and benefit of having senior specialised nurses to give them back-up and support is one of the many reasons that young nurses with very difficult patients to nurse feel unable to cope and leave the profession. It is even worse at night when a young, inexperienced nurse can be left in charge of very ill patients who are recovering from operations. She or he may feel overwhelmed and patients may feel insecure. Patients as well as nurses need emotional support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para35"></a>When there are staff shortages and difficulties in recruitment, the wrong people may be appointed. With so many very seriously ill patients to nurse, more and more equipment--I refer to turning beds, low air loss beds, hoists and so on--is being used. Many agency and pool nurses do not know how to use the equipment and are frightened to do so. Why not have specially trained non-nursing staff, such as handymen or security staff, to work such equipment? This would save the nurses' time and their backs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para36"></a>I come from North Yorkshire, where at the moment the turnover in nursing staff is low compared with many parts of the country. But all the chief nurses are concerned about midwifery. A new system is being introduced nationally from next April under which trusts will receive only partial reimbursement of the costs of midwifery training. Many fear that trusts will be put off from encouraging nurses into midwifery training. The main problem in York is a shortage of theatre nurses. That has an impact on the number of operations the trust can perform, and therefore influences the waiting list situation.

<A NAME="80616-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris for instituting this important debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para38"></a>As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the NHS, it is an opportunity to reflect on the contribution which nurses are making in care, professional development, teaching and research, and, above all, in improving the quality of service that we give to patients. It is also appropriate to reflect on the extraordinary change in the role of the nurse in the past few years. Nursing practice has changed dramatically. Nurses have taken over many of the duties previously undertaken by junior doctors. Not only has the service been more effective, but many patients very much enjoy that and support it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para39"></a>The shift towards primary care will also enhance the role of nurses. I refer to the increase in the number of practice nurses and nurse practitioners. I am anxious that primary care groups will give to nurses a strong leadership role. Perhaps some primary care groups will be led by nurses. I certainly hope so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para40"></a>The agenda for the future is exciting for the nursing profession. We have to set that against the context of the problems in recruiting which have been so graphically described in the debate tonight. Some of those issues can surely be dealt with through good practice. We have heard about family friendly policies and initiatives to attract nurses back to the profession. But I am convinced that overriding that factor is the need to enhance the role of nurses in management and leadership. I take the point that those nurses who wish to stay in nursing and practise nursing at the patient level should be encouraged and rewarded to do so. But equally we must have strong leadership in management positions in the health service.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para41"></a>In the past few years we have seen many trusts remove a range of management posts so that between the ward sister and the director of nursing we have lost a number of nurse managers. That means that there is no clear progression for nurses who wish to pursue a career in management. Nurses on wards sometimes believe that their voices are not heard at high levels.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para42"></a>I commend the RCN approach in encouraging nurses to take up leadership positions and leadership projects. But the NHS must do much more. We need more nurses at the top table, whether in trusts, health authorities or at the Department of Health. We need more nurses leading debate not only about nursing issues but about the whole future of the NHS and the key priorities that we need to address. If we can do that I am sure that we can improve the quality of service and begin to improve the quality of support given to nurses in so many stressful situations. Above all, I am sure that we will then be able to recruit and retain more nurses.

<A NAME="80616-26_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness McFarlane of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, we are all delighted to have the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, here tonight and we are grateful for the vigorous way in which he raised the Question. He promises to be the most cherished patient in the NHS from here on. He has given us the three Rs of nursing workforce deployment. I wish to focus on the relevance of educational issues to those three problems. Since 1932 and the Lancet Report on nursing, there have been successive reports at five or 10-yearly intervals. Perhaps the time is ripe to look closely at what is happening in the service, in particular nursing education.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para43"></a>The report which changed the face of nursing education was the UKCC report Project 2000, published in 1986. As the noble Lord said, since 1989 nurses have been educated in the higher education sector and take courses in diploma and degree level qualifications. Yet I hear criticism of the Project 2000 system and it is timely that we should examine that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para44"></a>The major criticism I hear is that the newly registered nurse is no longer a confident practitioner when she comes to the ward. The noble Lord referred to that. The perception is that the amount of clinical practice has been greatly reduced to accommodate academic studies. I believe that that is a misconception. Dame Betty Kershaw has confirmed to me that 50 per cent. of the course is in clinical practice, as compared with her figures of 53-54 per cent. in 1989. The major difference is that 50 per cent. of that clinical practice takes place in the community, which is where the majority of patients are nursed. That is right and proper, but it may explain why nurses coming to a ward appear less confident. I join the noble Lord in recommending that we examine the possibility of an intern year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para45"></a>Secondly, the consortia of trusts which commission nursing education rightly do so with an eye to workforce needs. But there is very tight control on the numbers and little ability for the students to change the branch of nursing into which they have been recruited. This may be a disincentive and we should look at whether some relaxation of that strict control by consortia is possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para46"></a>Thirdly, the Project 2000 system may create certain shortages. There is no longer a direct entry in psychiatric nursing. The student follows the foundation course and may never see a psychiatric nurse or psychiatric practice for the first 18 months. One can understand the increased wastage in that area. Therefore, there may be a case for looking at how we prepare psychiatric nurses. A course more allied to social work may be beneficial.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para47"></a>We have a widened date of entry, with people with BTEC and NVQ qualifications, but there is also greater wastage and academic failure in the courses. We need to address that problem and the causes of it.

<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para48"></a>I declare an interest. I am chairman of a large acute trust, chairman of the Nurses Welfare Service and a nurse on the effective register of the UKCC. Furthermore, I must confess that I was chairman of the UKCC when Project 2000 was introduced. I wish to make a few suggestions relating to the recruitment, retention and retirement of nurses.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para49"></a>Recruitment and retention is cyclical within the health service. There is no doubt that there is now a real problem in the NHS. A multiplicity of factors have an effect on recruitment and retention and to a certain extent on retirement. We have already heard mention of the reduction in the number of entrants into nursing. However, this Government have invested more money in training and there has been an increase in the number of training places. The problem lies in attracting more young people and more mature entrants into the nursing profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para50"></a>Nursing is a caring profession. I believe that the ethos of caring needs to be developed in our young people. Will the Minister consider discussing with her colleagues in education using the school curriculum to influence more young people in community service during their final year in school, perhaps introducing caring skills into the curriculum? I am sure that we all agree that society generally is not a caring society and that we need to influence young people to enter the profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para51"></a>The attrition of students remains high and we need to examine selection procedures. Now that we have nursing education within higher education, perhaps we need to examine our selection procedures. I suggest that research is undertaken into what we are looking for in nurses entering the profession. While nurses need a good academic base, they need a good theoretical knowledge, too. They also need to be able to correlate that in delivering practical skills. We must be able to identify that in our selection process. I believe that we need a research project into selection techniques.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para52"></a>As regards retention, we in the NHS recognise that we live in a dynamic organisation with many changes. Nurses still give 80 per cent. of direct patient care. However, there is a worrying factor in relation to sickness and absence. Mention has been made of the recently published report, Improving the Health of the NHS Workforce. At present, 29-48 per cent. of nurses suffer from exhaustion leading to suicide. That is a high level and considered to be significantly higher in nurses than in equivalent professional groups. The trust that I chair sets a target of 3 per cent. sickness. We reduced the level from 6 per cent. to 3.5 per cent., but it has now risen to 5 per cent. I believe that we really could improve matters if the Government would take a lead on the points made by the Nuffield Trust.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para53"></a>Finally, the Nurses Welfare Service is caring for 166 nurses suffering health problems as a result of issues not picked up during their period of work. More sensitive management would probably enable those problems to be identified more easily.

On behalf of many colleagues who are unable to be with me tonight, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Morris, that we are delighted that he is here and in comparative good health because I know that he has been through a great deal during the past few months. I am pleased to see also that he is in good heart and fighting fit.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para54"></a>I have been fascinated by the amount of expertise and experience that has been demonstrated on all sides of the House. That must stand the Minister and her colleagues in good stead. Not for the first time, the noble Lord, Lord Morris, has rendered a great service to this House and to the nation by reminding the Minister and her colleagues of problems of which they may be aware but about which it does not do any harm to publicise the anxieties of members of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para55"></a>I suffered an illness and someone must have gone very carefully through my CV because when it was noted that I was a former Chief Whip, I was sent to Whipps Cross. It should have been Chief Whipps Cross and it is a cross that I have had to bear more than once. There is better to come!
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para56"></a>From the experiences that I had, I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Morris, was describing my ward--which, incidentally, was called Peace Ward--when I think of the frenetic manner in which the servants of the nation, whatever their rank, were looking after their patients. I came away from my stay in hospital not only, as I hope most people do, with a deep sense of indebtedness for the professional care but I was grateful also for the calmness, steadfastness and the patience of all those who work in our hospitals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para57"></a>What staggered me was that from seven in the morning until nine at night--and there were some who worked all those hours--the staff never seemed to have one minute's rest. The noble Lord referred earlier to someone working for nine hours. I formed the view that everyone who served in that hospital worked extremely hard. It was a Victorian hospital which the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, will know from her experience as a Minister. It was one of those hospitals which was built to serve the needs of a large number of people over many years. It is loved by the people who look upon it as their hospital. The same is true of Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield, where I lived for many years. Those hospitals have a special place in the heart of the community. The North Middlesex Hospital, which I know very well from my constituency, is another example of that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para58"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to say this evening that she and her colleagues appreciate very much the dedication of the nursing staff. Of course they are entitled to a fair reward. As a trade unionist all my life, I believe that they should be vigorous in putting forward their case. But, even if no more money can be provided, there should be at least an acknowledgement--and the Minister may be able to give that this evening--of the care and comfort which <P>


<a name="column_1548"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the Minister and her colleagues must take from knowing that we, the nation, are served so well by extremely devoted nursing staff.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-26_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I too thank my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris for introducing this important debate. I must declare an interest as a non-executive director of University College London Hospitals and also as chair of the Royal College of Nursing Institute. I should like to focus on recruitment and retention in London. The main issues are that there are not enough qualified nurses in the system, a point made already by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege. London trusts are competing for the same staff and therefore they have difficulties working in partnership, although the Promoting London Campaign has begun to address that, as several London hospitals are now advertising collaboratively.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para59"></a>There are particular shortages in some specialist areas--for example, theatres, intensive care and renal nursing. Accommodation costs tend to be much higher in London in relation to comparative accommodation outside. Host-registration rotation programmes have been difficult to establish and maintain. Those problems might be resolved if rotation became an educational requirement as it is currently in the medical profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para60"></a>Over the past three years, UCL hospitals have made significant improvements in their recruitment techniques to increase effectiveness. But the retention of nursing staff has remained a problem. During 1997-98, the overall turnover was 30 per cent. and was particularly significant in the lower nursing groups of D and E.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para61"></a>So how have we sought to address our particular needs? Our trust board has ensured that recruitment and retention issues have been identified as a high level performance indicator, and on the recruitment front, like many trusts, we have sought to recruit abroad. We have targeted newly qualified staff and we were involved with a customised job fair in 1997 which had the additional benefit of promoting the trust and promoting nursing in particular. We are in the process of reviewing our publicity material to ensure that we are recruiting from as wide and diverse a group as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para62"></a>I endorse the view of my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath that we must enhance the role of nurses among management and leadership. But it is clear that we need to change the image of the National Health Service and promote the benefits of working in the service if we are to attract and retain nurses. I am particularly concerned that although historically, ethnic minorities have been over-represented in nursing, many of those nurses would not recommend it as a career to their children because of the way they have been treated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para63"></a>I turn now to retention. Initiatives have included extending the scope of appraisal and personal development planning, agreeing a study leave policy and being more flexible as regards working hours. I am aware that the Government's strategy is to increase training levels and to invest in initiatives to improve the recruitment and retention and return to the practice of <P>


<a name="column_1549"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1549</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>trained staff. I have been encouraged by the national promotion of flexible and family-friendly working hours.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para64"></a>I am encouraged also by the continuing commitment and high quality of care demonstrated by our nurses. We need to find ways to support and sustain that commitment. At a national level, we need to continue to increase training levels; to encourage more trained nurses to return to the profession; and we need to focus on valuing, motivating and involving nurses by looking at working practices, stress levels in the work place, employment security and protecting staff from discrimination and harassment. Most important, we need a clear framework at national level for local autonomy, flexibility and accountability.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-26_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, first, I am very happy to take on--duty is not the right word--the task of saying how good it is to see the noble Lord, Lord Morris, back. I have always felt that he is one of the most forceful and entertaining speakers in your Lordships' House. No matter what else he has been through, I am extremely pleased to see that he has not lost his touch.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para65"></a>When one thinks of nurses, a series of images comes to mind based on personal experience. I usually think of a nurse desperately trying to get the damaged rugby player patched up and thrown out of the place on a Saturday before the real work starts. She tells him to go to see a physiotherapist and pushes him away. That is because there is always that horrible experience about to happen when the pub shuts. That is when the real work starts. That is when nursing staff encounter people falling over, or into, each other, often wielding bits of glass. That is when the sportsman will say, "I don't care if it's broken, I will come back tomorrow." One felt that one should not be there because something more serious was going on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para66"></a>Nursing is a comparatively low paid profession that has never enjoyed a proper status, despite having to deal with a society literally red in tooth and claw. We do not pay the profession enough respect and never have done. Nursing's image has always been tainted by sexism and the view that it was for the worthy female. Nursing has always been the Cinderella of the medical profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para67"></a>Often, an experienced nurse is infinitely of more use, especially in a casualty ward--which is my only real experience of hospitals--than a junior doctor, who is usually rummaging around for help most of the time. Anybody who attended university with junior doctors had the feeling that they should not be allowed anywhere near patients for the next 10 years anyway.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para68"></a>The only thing we can really do for nurses is pay them more. It is easy for the Government to say, "We are spending more on the National Health Service and pay rises are coming." But when a government say that a pay claim is to be split and not implemented in full, that sends the wrong message. Unless we up pay standards for nursing, the profession will not retain staff--particularly in areas where work is hard and accommodation is expensive. The noble Baroness, <P>


<a name="column_1550"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1550</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lady Amos, put her finger exactly on the point, but was probably too kind to members of her own Front Bench to follow through on the comment. We must pay for a quality service. Unless we are prepared to invest in those people, we will have problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para69"></a>The similarities between nursing and the teaching profession were pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris who referred to a super grade of practitioner who would be paid more. That will not do, even if it is introduced. We do not want one wonderful nurse running around; we want lots of good nurses. Overworked nurses will make mistakes, no matter how good they are. The real problem is status, and that is so closely linked to pay that one might as well put them in the same sentence. The problem of status is particularly acute where there is need for staff of the highest quality.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_time9"></A><H5>8.42 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616-26_spnew12"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, has shone a spotlight on the most important challenge facing the National Health Service--the need to recruit, train and retain sufficient numbers of nurses for every branch of health care. We are all immensely grateful to him, even though the time made available for this debate was so short.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para70"></a>There is little doubt that the pressures on the health service from nursing shortages are real and growing. Over the past few years there has been a steady decline in the initial entries to the UKCC register of about 25 per cent. since a decade ago. In 1985, student nurses numbered some 71,000--all of them employed in the NHS. By 1995 there were fewer than 40,000 student nurses--not all of them working in the NHS. Nursing shortages are apparent across the board, but obvious in specialist disciplines such as cancer care, paediatrics and mental health. The difficult recruitment climate is partly due to the smaller pool of potential recruits in the current demographic trough of 17 to 20 year-olds. It reflects also the stiff competition that nursing, as an increasingly graduate profession, faces in the employment market. As my noble friend Lady Cumberlege mentioned, young people see nursing portrayed in the press and elsewhere in a less favourable light than other professions and decide that it is not worth considering.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para71"></a>A welcome if only partial counterbalance is the enhanced appeal of nursing as a broader-based profession. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, said, nurses now do many things previously done only by doctors. That widening of skills undoubtedly makes nursing more attractive to individuals--usually graduates--who relish a higher intellectual challenge.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para72"></a>If we are to improve the recruitment graph, the so-called entry gate must be as wide as possible so that not only graduates but bright, caring school leavers with motivation, as well as mature adults, are enabled to join the nursing register. Also, much more information needs to be made available to school children about what nursing is all about. I agree entirely with the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton. There needs to be specific targeting to attract new entrants and the projection of a <P>


<a name="column_1551"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1551</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>positive image of nursing and patient care. There are numerous opportunities for universities and hospital trusts to target by way of job fairs, open days, work placements and links with specific schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para73"></a>In some parts of the country, the retention picture is worrying. As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Morris, national turnover is around 21 per cent a year. Although that figure is bad enough, it is an average. I have visited trust hospitals where staff turnover is only just in double figures. Other hospitals have to manage what seems to be a never-ending haemorrhage of nursing staff and, simultaneously, a constant recruitment crisis. With the cost to a hospital trust of replacing a nurse estimated at &#163;4,900, a high or even average staff turnover represents a substantial drain on resources.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para74"></a>There are many reasons for nurses leaving, but the most significant seem to be stress and lack of job satisfaction. Pay appears not to be an issue in itself but, when combined with other grievances, its importance tends to be magnified. The extent to which good human resource management in a hospital trust can make all the difference is striking. Trusts that adopt family-friendly policies such as flexible rostering and creches seem to do a lot better. The same is true of trusts that provide automatic clinical updates for nurses and where emphasis is placed on professional development and career progression.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para75"></a>All too often, nurses find that the ability to do their jobs as they wish is hampered by competing time demands, not least from paperwork. Perhaps the biggest single source of stress is the shortage of nursing and support staff. From that perspective, the current crisis in nurse numbers has the potential to become self-fuelling, which must concern us. I am convinced that much can be done to improve the situation. We need to encourage nurses who have moved away from the profession to return. Hospitals should offer re-entry courses, preferably free of charge. Also, to alleviate the stress felt by qualified nurses that the noble Lord, Lord Morris, graphically described, we must examine closely ways of improving the skill levels of health care assistants, to enable them to take on greater responsibilities. The best way is a national register of qualified health care workers, to act as a lever for raising standards in hospitals and social care generally.

<A NAME="80616-26_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, my thanks to my noble friend, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, go beyond the normal courtesies. I am delighted that he was in his place to introduce this short but authoritative debate and to find him in such characteristically vigorous form. It is wonderfully characteristic of my noble friend not only to slip unnoticed into his place following his recent illness but to mark his return by opening a debate that clearly reflects his lifelong concerns for the caring professions and his capacity to identify the most important issues in our public services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para76"></a>No one who participated in the debate needs reminding that without nurses there could be no National Health Service. The debate gives me a <P>


<a name="column_1552"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1552</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>welcome opportunity to pay tribute, as I was encouraged to do by my noble friend, Lord Graham of Edmonton, to the one million staff of the NHS, particularly members of the nursing profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para77"></a>Everyone taking part in this debate has recognised the huge variety of roles that nurses undertake every day of the year. However, we all recognise that there are problems and tensions. We know that there are very real issues to address. Perhaps I may focus briefly on some of the key issues that have been raised which the Government feel are priorities to improve the essential three Rs encompassed in my noble friend's Question; namely, recruitment, retention and retirement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para78"></a>My noble friend was right to call for a strategic approach to the 3Rs. The Government have recognised that a new overall development programme for nursing into the next century is vital and necessary in the short term. In our White Paper, The New NHS, published just before Christmas, the Government made clear their commitment to strengthen the nursing contribution to healthcare. To follow this, in April my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced to the Royal College of Nursing congress that we would start a consultation exercise on the development of a nursing, midwifery and health visiting strategy. That is currently under way and we expect to see some results from a nationwide exercise involving widespread written and spoken consultation before the end of the year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para79"></a>Our fundamental aim is to ensure that the nursing profession is given all the support that it deserves so that nurses can feel involved and can achieve their correct status, as mentioned by several speakers. Their efforts in delivering high quality healthcare to our communities must be both recognised and rewarded. For example, we are anxious to see nurses take their rightful leadership role in the organisation and governance of the new NHS. That will be especially important in the primary care groups where each board will be required to have a nurse representative.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para80"></a>We already have around 80 personal medical service pilots, as they are called, under the primary care Act, which are taking place. It is worth pointing out that 10 of those 80 are led by nurses and that they involve nurse practitioners and GPs working in partnership. In addition, two of the pilots involve nurses taking full responsibility for the practice contract and, indeed, employing a salaried GP. My noble friend Lord Morris may be interested to know that one of these, covering a population of about 2,000 people, is in south Derbyshire where a salaried GP is employed and the pilot aims to develop a nurse triage system for appropriate GP referrals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para81"></a>We welcome those developments and we are of course seeking to encourage them, but to recruit and retain nurses who are willing to take on those leadership roles we must first address the things to which noble Lords have drawn attention tonight which are important to individual nurses--better promotion prospects, gaining broader experience, better training and development opportunities and better or more suitable working hours with less stress. We also recognise the need to address violence, employment security and <P>


<a name="column_1553"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1553</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discrimination as well as the need for a fair pay system. Just as important is the need to invest in nurses and to improve their training and development--the first of my noble friend's 3Rs, recruitment. I am pleased to tell my noble friend that we are investing &#163;800 million this year on training nurses and on professions allied to medicine. Last year the numbers entering training increased by 1,700 places and a further increase is planned for this year. It is not enough, but it is a good start.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para82"></a>New students are of course the lifeblood of nursing and, therefore, the lifeblood of the NHS. It is essential that they are properly valued and supported while they are training. Their financial security is of course most important. The new funding arrangements being introduced this September in response to the Dearing Report are good news for them and for the other professions involved. After agreement last autumn between the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Employment, they, together with midwives and PAMS, will have tuition costs met and will have access to NHS bursaries, which have just been uplifted. We expect this to mean a better deal financially for nurses and for other healthcare students.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para83"></a>It is possible that these new financial arrangements are encouraging new applicants and that may partly explain the success of our latest recruitment programme, which my noble friend and other noble Lords mentioned. As my noble friend said, the &#163;2.15 million initiative was announced in the autumn to boost recruitment and aid retention. It includes a national nurse publicity programme. So far I am pleased to tell your Lordships that the campaign has attracted 14,000 responses, which is very encouraging.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para84"></a>However, to take up the point made by the noble Baroness and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, we need to try to introduce the values of public service at an even earlier stage. I am pleased to tell the House that the NHS Executive will be running a competition in secondary schools in the next academic year with the idea of challenging negative and traditional stereotypes about health service employment, raising awareness about NHS career opportunities and encouraging a broad range of applicants from across society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para85"></a>Of course, attracting young people to take an interest in the NHS is only the beginning. Retaining them, once they have been recruited, is the next of my noble friend's significant Rs. Perhaps I may quite frankly say that we are concerned that about 100,000 nurses who are on the UKCC register do not appear to be working. We need to provide much more imaginative and good career opportunities to help people return when often they have retired temporarily for very good reasons. They take career breaks because of their family responsibilities, as several Lords mentioned, but may want to return to a profession which they valued at an earlier stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para86"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced at this year's RCN congress a further &#163;4 million for local investment in return-to-practice initiatives; for example, to run projects which seek out nurses in the local community who are currently not practising to encourage them to consider resuming their <P>


<a name="column_1554"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1554</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>careers on a personal basis and to prepare them for a return to work. In my personal experience of talking to trust chief executives who have been attempting new recruitment programmes, especially following up the waiting-list initiative, these local campaigns seem to be successful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para87"></a>The NHS Executive recently sent out a resource pack called "Sharing Ideas" to all trusts. It is aimed at helping employers both to recruit and retain staff. The pack is called "Sharing Ideas" because that is simply what it aims to do. For example, a consortium of employers comprising 10 trusts pooled its investment of return-to-practice moneys to fund an area-wide initiative beyond the catchment basis of their individual trusts to recruit non-practising nurses living locally and outside the usual recruitment channels. That initiative resulted in 200 inquiries ranging from nurses who had last practised between six months and 20 years before. Indeed, 75 of them subsequently took up courses and a re-run of the advertisements produced a further 150 inquiries. We are also determined to exploit the added attractive employment opportunities of NHS Direct. These 24-hour nurse-led helplines are proving an enormous success in the three pilot sites already established. We are going to press ahead with the plans to make this a nationwide service as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para88"></a>The new system has advantages for some of the nurses we have been discussing, as well as for patients. I have in mind nurses who perhaps want to work different hours than those in traditional shift patterns, nurses who want less physically demanding roles than those on the wards or those who are often older women who want to revitalise their skills in a different environment. All of them can be very satisfactorily and satisfyingly enrolled in NHS Direct.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para89"></a>There are some concerns about a retirement bulge developing within the nursing profession. Although many nurses are in their 40s and 50s and are technically eligible to retire from the age of 50, I can assure noble Lords that the average retirement age is around 59. Rising numbers of retirements are expected from the turn of the century but we have this under review. The impact is being assessed as part of the workforce planning being undertaken by the NHS. We cannot alter the natural demography but we can develop a strategy for dealing with it; and we are doing so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para90"></a>We are determined overall to make the NHS a better and more attractive place to work. The general human resources strategy which my honourable friend Alan Milburn is spearheading is directed towards a more co-operative culture where staff are listened to and where there is an evolutionary approach to management and change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para91"></a>Trusts are already tackling a range of immediate issues. My noble friend Lady Amos gave examples from her own experience in London. However, those trusts include in their considerations the role of promoting health at work, recognising and dealing with racism, developing family friendly employment policies and ensuring that staff can speak out when necessary without victimisation. I was glad that my noble friend Lord Hunt raised that point. At a nurse leadership conference last <P>


<a name="column_1555"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1555</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>week I spoke on the theme that people should not be afraid to rock the boat; indeed, they should be confident in speaking out about their concerns both as regards professional standards and their personal interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para92"></a>We understand that nurses need to work flexibly to combine careers and family responsibilities. We also understand the need not just for words and policies but for practical demonstrations. We have, for example, been piloting self-rostering IT software which allows staff much greater control over the hours they work while covering peaks and troughs in the workload. Pilots have been set up across 19 sites within 11 trusts. Early findings suggest that if the system is well managed there can be significant savings in casual absenteeism and staff can plan their work around their known personal commitments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para93"></a>As regards the more general and less tangible problems that several noble Lords have mentioned of stress, work related illness and job satisfaction, my noble friend and others were right to draw attention to the Nuffield Report Improving the Health of the NHS Workforce. It is an important piece of work which confirms the need for the package of action we have started to put in place. We recognise that stress is a major cause of absence in the health service. We have issued guidance on the management of sickness; piloted a model to reduce organisational stress; and published practical ways of tackling stress at work. A task force of nurses, doctors and other health service workers has just been set up to advise Ministers on the way to increase staff involvement in improving services, thus, we hope, improving their job satisfaction.
<P>


<a name="column_1556"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column 1556</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para94"></a>The importance of pay was commented on--that point was taken up vigorously by the noble Lord, Lord Addington--and in particular the idea of a top ranking nurse. Rather than planning to establish a new grade of nurse, we have been looking at the whole NHS pay system. Exploratory talks have already been undertaken with the RCN, other NHS unions and the professional bodies, as well as with NHS managers, on how best to achieve a system of nationally determined pay which is fair, efficient and has appropriate flexibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para95"></a>All of the important issues that the Government are addressing, as well as the pay issue, were mentioned in the speeches of my noble friends and other noble Lords who have contributed to the debate. They are, for example, well run clinical placements; flexible hours; continuing professional development; encouragement and support from managers; less bureaucracy, and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616-26_para96"></a>I realise that I have overrun my speaking time slightly but I say in conclusion that next month the health service celebrates its 50th anniversary. As I said at the beginning of my reply to the debate, the high reputation of the NHS in its history has often depended on the reputation of its nursing workforce. I hope that what I have said tonight reassures your Lordships that the Government recognise that the skills and dedication of our nurses are key components in maintaining the trust we want the public to enjoy into the next century. Once again I must say how splendid it is to see my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris leading our discussion on this important topic. Long may he and the nursing profession continue to flourish.

<A NAME="80616w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Judd </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What discussions they have had with the Disasters Emergency Committee to clarify whether there is a difference of analysis between that committee (and its member organisations) and the Government on the nature of the crisis in Sudan and on what response is most appropriate; and, if they have had discussions, what the outcome of those discussions proved to be.[HL2187]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We have had no discussions directly with the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) on the analysis of the crisis in Sudan. We are in close contact with our international non-government organisation partners, many of whom are members of the DEC, and we actively support the work of several of them in the Bahr el Ghazal region. We have a common aim, to ensure that enough food reaches the most vulnerable as quickly as possible to prevent more people dying.

<A NAME="80616w01_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Judd </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action they have taken to help resolve the logistical difficulties being encountered in getting supplies to victims of the earthquake in Afghanistan.[HL2190]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616w01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We are very conscious of these difficulties, and in particular the urgent need for helicopters, which are the only way of reaching some of the villages affected by the earthquake. We have investigated through both military and civilian channels the possibility of providing helicopters from the UK, but our enquiries suggested that it would be much more cost-effective and considerably quicker
to source helicopters from countries closer to Afghanistan. We have provided details of potential suppliers in the region to the UN, who are now securing additional capacity. We have offered to consider requests for funding to meet hire costs, but we understand this is not required at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para0"></a>As part of an aid package announced earlier this year we provided &#163;1.9 million to the UN to help agency co-ordination and logistics. This included funding for the UN aircraft which are now being used to deliver relief supplies and personnel to the earthquake affected areas.

<A NAME="80616w01_wqn2"></A><B> Baroness Mallalieu </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action they will take following the new United Nations Security Council resolution on Sierra Leone adopted on 5 June lifting the arms embargo and imposing one on non-governmental forces in Sierra Leone.[HL2269]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The new resolution supersedes part of UN Security Council Resolution 1132. It ensures that the arms embargo to Sierra Leone applies to non-governmental forces and makes explicit exception for the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG) and the United Nations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para1"></a>Following the adoption by the UN Security Council on 5 June of the new resolution, Orders in Council are now being prepared giving full effect in our law to the arms embargo imposed by the new resolution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616w01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I would refer the noble Lord to the Answer I gave to his question of 6 April, which referred him to Public Expenditure: Statistical Analyses 1998-99 (Cm 3901). As well as figures for aggregate identifiable general government expenditure by country, to which my previous Answer referred, the same publication also includes--in Tables 7.2A to 7.6B--a breakdown of identifiable expenditure by country from 1992-93 to 1996-97 into 11 functional categories, presented in both cash and per capita terms together with their respective indices. Data back to 1984-85 can be obtained from the earlier publications referred to in my previous Answer.

<P>
Further to the Written Answer by the Chairman of Committees on 1 June (WA 12), why cars under the control of the Government Car and Despatch Agency are not fitted with security devices which can be powered from the car battery alone for extensive lengths of time; and[HL2142]

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
Whether the Government Car and Despatch Agency require that the engines of their cars are kept running in their parking places in government offices in order to provide power for their security devices; and, if not, why the parking areas at the House of Lords are so much less secure that battery-draining security systems have to remain operational.[HL2143]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Responsibility for these matters has been delegated under the terms of its Framework Document to the Government Car and Despatch Agency. I have asked its Chief Executive,
Mr. Nick Matheson, to write to the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para2"></a>Letter to Lord Berkeley from the Chief Executive of the Government Car and Despatch Agency, Mr. N. Matheson.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para3"></a>Lord McIntosh of Haringey has asked me in my capacity as the Chief Executive responsible for the Government Car Service (GCS) to reply to your parliamentary Questions dated 4 June 1998 about (a) the proper use of catalytic converters in GCS cars; (b) the power needs of security devices fitted to some GCS cars; and (c) the appropriate use of such devices within the precincts of the House of Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para4"></a>All GCS cars are fitted with catalytic converters. Broadly speaking, a catalytic converter works by engine exhaust emissions reacting with compounds within the catalytic converter, cleaning the emissions from the engine. This reaction only works when the compounds in the converter have reached a high temperature. Until that point, the emissions from a cold engine are no cleaner than from a normal car engine. Therefore it is important that the car engine should be kept at an optimum operating temperature if the car is going to be used frequently. However if the car is likely to be stationary for some time, then it makes sense to turn off the engine. Our drivers are under clear instruction to keep their engines running to a minimum consistent with security requirements, and to be mindful of the environmental impact of our operations at all times. Our drivers use their professional judgment on when to keep their vehicle engines running.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para5"></a>The agency's security vehicles are fitted with a number of security devices. I cannot discuss in any detail what these devices are, or how they operate, but I can assure you that the most modern and efficient equipment is used. These devices are always kept active when a vehicle is on official duty and is occupied. One particular system requires that the engine is running for it to function at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para6"></a>It is for these reasons that the engines of security vehicles are kept running when occupied and not because there is any inherent lack of security in the areas surrounding the House of Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  The names of individuals who work in the Prison Service or information that could identify them are not normally published. On 6 April 1998, there were 10 staff working on a temporary basis in the Directorate of Health Care. Their duties included a variety of tasks, largely of a clerical or secretarial nature.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616w01_wqn8"></A><B> Lord Orme </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have any plans to change the boundaries of the Metropolitan Police District to make them coterminous with the boundaries of the
32 London boroughs.[HL2302]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616w01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The Government are committed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system. Aligning the operational boundaries of the different agencies is an important element in this. The Crime and Disorder Bill's proposed changes to the youth justice system and creation of local crime reduction partnerships give added emphasis to
the importance of boundary alignment. The recently <P>


<a name="column_WA127"></a>

<B>16 Jun 1998 : Column WA127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>announced changes to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will make police and CPS operational boundaries coterminous.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para7"></a>We have in recent months received strong representations that the boundaries of the Metropolitan Police District, which stretch into Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey, make more difficult effective joint working between the different criminal justice agencies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para8"></a>The present boundaries are an historical anachronism dating back to early in the 19th century, before the advent of modern local government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para9"></a>The Government have therefore decided that the Greater London Authority Bill, which will come before this House later this year, will provide for a change to the boundaries of the Metropolitan Police District to make them coterminous with those of the 32 London boroughs. As a result, those parts of Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey which are currently policed by the Metropolitan Police Service will be policed by the respective county police forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para10"></a>This change will mean that local councils and criminal justice agencies in the county districts of the Metropolitan Police District will not have to work with two different police forces, which leads to inefficiency and duplication. The change will help to promote effective joint working between agencies as they implement the provisions in the Crime and Disorder Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para11"></a>These boundary changes will also support democratic accountability and enable the Metropolitan Police to focus on policing London, a major task in itself. A majority of elected members on the new Metropolitan Police Authority will provide the vital democratic link between Londoners and the Metropolitan Police. Residents in those parts of Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey currently policed by the Metropolitan Police will not have a vote in the elections for the mayor and assembly members. It is therefore right that those areas be policed by county forces whose police authorities already provide local democratic accountability in their areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w01_para12"></a>We expect this change to take place in April 2000. Implementing it will require close co-operation between the relevant police forces, police authorities and local councils, and other interested parties. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has written to them today to inform them of this decision and to seek their views on how it should be implemented.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

J. Coker OBE, published in the Journal of the Royal Naval Medical Service 1996; 82: 141-146. A copy of this paper has already been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w02_para1"></a>Assessments by the consultant physicians at the MAP are based upon their clinical judgment, a patient's clinical history, and examination findings.

We do not believe that it would be appropriate to invite the Independent Panel to extend its role beyond this specialised task.

<A NAME = "80616w02_para4"></a>The aim of the Medical Assessment Programme, MAP, is to provide Gulf veterans who are concerned about their health with a clinical diagnosis of their medical conditions and to collate statistical information.

<A NAME="80616w03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   As part of the two ongoing reviews into the alleged detections of chemical and biological warfare agents during the Gulf conflict, MoD officials are analysing all available documentation from the period which may be relevant to these matters. The results of this review work, which will also involve interviews with personnel directly involved, will be made available once it is complete. As has been the practice of this Government when publishing information about Operation Granby, these reports will include appropriate extracts from contemporary documents in MoD's possession.

<P>
<UL>Whether the anthrax vaccine currently administered to members of the Armed Forces is proven to be effective against all known strains of anthrax bacilli, including aerosolised and "dusty" anthrax, given that such stains are reported to be capable of penetrating nuclear, chemical and biological warfare protection equipment; and[HL1826]

What is the source of the anthrax vaccine currently being administered to members of the Armed Forces; what is its date of manufacture; what is its "shelf life"; and against how many strains of anthrax bacilli does it offer protection.[HL1827]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80616w03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   The anthrax vaccine which is currently being offered to British troops deploying to the Gulf region has been produced by the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, CAMR; the Department of Health holds the product licence. These batches of vaccine were produced in 1991 and were given a shelf life of 2 years. They were subsequently retested in October 1966, when their shelf life was extended to January 1998. They underwent further potency testing in November 1997 and full safety testing by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in January 1998, following which the Medicines Control Agency extended the shelf life of these batches of vaccine to November 1998.

<FONT SIZE=3>of these. However, the UK vaccine, which contains the purified proteins produced by the anthrax bacterium, has been tested against a representative selection of strains and has been shown to provide protection against both injected and aerosolised anthrax bacteria. The degree of protection afforded would, though, depend upon the inherent virulence characteristics of the particular strain encountered and upon the size of the challenge presented; no vaccine could guarantee 100 per cent. protection in all circumstances.

<FONT SIZE=3>its lowest level, the air in a modern aircraft cabin is completely changed every 3 minutes on average. This
is well above the standard for public buildings.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w03_para2"></a>All cabin air is taken from the external atmosphere, and there is no added oxygen. The degree of recirculation is determined by the aircraft designer and in some cases may be adjusted by the crew. The oxygen used by passengers is a small proportion, approximately 5 per cent. of the oxygen supplied at the minimum flow rate. The oxygen level in cabin air therefore remains at around 20 per cent. for the duration of a flight, which is virtually the same as normal atmospheric oxygen levels.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w03_para3"></a>The air pressure in aircrafts in flight is roughly equivalent to the atmospheric pressure at 8,000 feet above sea level. People with some chronic respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis, emphysema and bronchiolitis may be affected by the lower air pressure in aircraft and could require supplementary oxygen. They are advised to consult their own doctor and the airline before flying. Lower air pressure will not affect those with well controlled asthma but stress or anxiety caused by travel could precipitate an attack.
<P>

<A NAME = "80616w03_para4"></a>There is no proven link between cabin air quality, flow rates and the spread of disease. The filters used in most modern aircraft are similar to those used in critical wards of hospitals, operating theatres and burn units, and provide protection against the circulation of biological agents such as viruses. We have no plans to conduct any research into this issue at present.
