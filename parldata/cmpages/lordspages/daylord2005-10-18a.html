<a name="51018-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Monson </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether, during the remaining weeks of the United Kingdom&#039;s presidency of the European Union, they will seek to secure fairer treatment for whistleblowers who reveal corruption and financial irregularities in European Union institutions.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, we believe that whistleblowers already enjoy adequate protection. Under the European Communities Staff Regulations of May 2004, EC staff will not suffer any detriment as a result of making a protected disclosure. Staff are also obliged to raise any concerns that they have with either the director-general of their institution, the secretary-general, &quot;persons in equivalent positions&quot; or the European Anti-Fraud Office. That compares with the provisions of the United Kingdom&#039;s Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his reply, disappointing though it is. Does he not agree that the main problem is that far too many people in Brussels sincerely believe that to publicise wrongdoing within the EU is tantamount to blasphemy, treason or a combination of the two? Not even the most ardent Euro-enthusiast in Britain shares those attitudes. Does he not further agree that it is surely up to us to secure justice for those public-spirited people&#151;British, Danish, Dutch and Spanish&#151;who are persecuted simply for doing their jobs with honesty and integrity?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, we have been systematic in encouraging those who detect wrongdoing to bring it to the attention of the people responsible for them as their line-manager, and, where that has failed, to bring it to wider public attention. I ask the noble Lord whether there is any evidence that somebody who has brought such a case has not had a fair hearing, where that hearing has not taken place in the court of first instance, and where they have been the subject of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_670"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 670</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

unfair discrimination as a result. With great respect, it is impossible to sustain the proposition that the noble Lord puts.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dykes: </b>   My Lords, happily there have been very few cases. Some so-called whistleblowers have strange right-wing, anti-European credentials as well, so the Europhobes in Britain will wish to wallow occasionally in this kind of putative scandal. But would the Minister not accept that the vast majority of Europhiles and pro-Europeans in Britain prefer to see a really effective system of audit and control surveillance and supervision, both of the European Parliament structure and of the Court of Auditors to ensure the effectiveness of these systems so that there are no whistleblowers in the future?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, it must be right to get the systems in the best possible working order so that problems do not occur, although I stand by my view that if people detect wrongdoing they should most certainly bring it to the attention of their managers and then to the public. By far the greatest problems that have been detected in Europe have not been fraud so much as systems where farmers, for example, have been overpaid and where the money has to be claimed back. These can all be portrayed as being very serious problems or administrative problems which most certainly should be put right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Harrison: </b>   My Lords, is it not a fact that, further to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, often where there are financial irregularities, they are attributable to member states themselves and not to this putative person in Brussels that the original Question talks about?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, that is absolutely right. It is certainly true that the European Commission&#039;s annual fight against fraud report, which publishes all the details, specifies the extent to which these are problems in member states. It is incumbent on all of us as member states to ensure that we put our part right as well. I repeat that the problems have not been simply those in Brussels.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister the first to accept that what has been called institutional fraud at the heart of the European Union could be a very serious matter? It has nothing whatever to do with whether one is for or against a particular structure of the European Union&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, was trying to suggest&#151;but everything to do with seeing that huge amounts of British taxpayers&#039; money are properly spent in a fully accountable way. Does the Minister agree with that? I believe that two years ago, Marta Andreasen, with a member of the European Parliament&#151;I think from the governing party&#151;put to the Serious Fraud Office in London very detailed documentation about very serious fraud being organised in Brussels, not related to the member states <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_671"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 671</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but to the EU institutions. What happened to those papers? Was any action taken? If not, surely now is the time that we should take some action.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I wholly accept the point that where fraud is detected it is a serious matter for taxpayers in the United Kingdom, and indeed taxpayers across Europe. I repeat that a great number of the financial management issues have concerned matters that have not strictly or technically been fraud, but over-payments which have not been reclaimed very rapidly. Marta Andreasen was the former chief accountant of the Commission who made allegations to the press about the Commission&#039;s accounting systems. She was suspended in 2002 and dismissed in October 2004 on the grounds that she had broken the rules by going to the press. She did, however, identify some significant issues. The Commission fully implemented the accruals&#039; accounting which would have overcome the problem in the first place from 1 January 2005 in a new system that addressed precisely the criticisms she had made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, would the noble Lord accept that irregularities have occurred year after year, but nothing as yet has been effective in dealing with it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, there have been problems each year. It is helpful to note that the assessment of the amount of money involved in these problematic areas has been decreasing. It declined between 2002 and 2003 by 21 per cent. But I emphasise to your Lordships&#039; House that the extensive problems have largely been in areas where overpayments have been made under legitimate European schemes and where there has been a delay in getting the moneys back from those who have been overpaid. That is not technically fraud, but it is a significant problem, which I accept. That must continue to be dealt with and improved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the fraud that has been discussed in Brussels is of rather less significance than some of the fraud that is exposed by our National Audit Office in relation to the United Kingdom&#151;for example, the recent report in relation to social security&#151;and that had the people in Brussels taken the proper steps and gone through the proper procedures, it would have had the same level of thorough investigation, as do allegations of fraud in this country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, there is a lot of truth in that. I take the view that where people have discovered things that they think are problematic, there must be robust systems in the European Union, as indeed there must be in the United Kingdom, to investigate them properly. I also confirm, because it is important, that if the investigation is not thorough, is not carried through, does not lead to a proper inspection, whether in the United Kingdom under our legislation or in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_672"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 672</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Europe under the arrangements that I have described to the House, it must be right for people to draw it to the attention of the public. They are public funds and it is right that they should be dealt with here, as elsewhere, in a transparent way.

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51018-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My Lords, foster carers play a vital role in society. More than two-thirds of looked-after children are now in foster placements. The report is a useful analysis of the key elements of an effective fostering service. On the issue of allowances, the Government are currently working with stakeholders, including local authorities, to develop proposals for a national minimum allowance. We shall be consulting on that in the new year.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51018-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his helpful reply. What is the estimate of the cost to adult services of supporting children who have left state care&#151;for instance, those in prisons, where 25 per cent of prisoners have had experience of care, those in mental health services or those in homelessness services? What progress has there been to the TOPSS report recommendation that 50 per cent of foster carers should have National Vocational Qualification Level 3?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, on the issue of training foster carers, we had a report in July on which we are consulting at the moment. We have draft statutory guidance on a new duty on local authorities to promote the educational achievement of looked-after children, on which we consulted earlier in the year, which includes a specific reference to the need for local authorities to deliver appropriate training and support to foster carers. The cost to society through prisons and so forth for those who fail in the care system, of course, is very high. But we should not forget that 91 per cent of those who have been in foster care are completely clear of the criminal justice system. The overwhelming majority lead successful lives after they have been in care.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   My Lords, around 10,000 children in the care of the state were moved to a new placement at least three times last year, often at a great distance from all that is familiar. The financial cost is enormous. The human cost is a tragedy. How urgently are the Government addressing that problem and what measures are they taking to ensure that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_673"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 673</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

children are placed with foster carers near their locality where they can remain in contact with their extended family and friends?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness rightly raises the serious issue of the excessively large number of out-of-area placements. The Commission for Social Care Inspection has set performance indicators for local authorities to reduce the number of looked-after children placed more than 20 miles from their address when they were taken into care. The funding that we are providing for local authorities, both through the normal social services block and through Choice Protects, which is a dedicated fund of &#163;60 million this year, will enable local authorities to improve outcomes for looked-after children, including organising more placements nearer to their homes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the cause of numerous problems for fostered children is the shortage of 10,000 foster carers, including the problem just outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton? What are the Government doing to recruit and retain more foster carers of high quality, and to train them to the standard we need?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, we accept that we need more foster carers. That is why next year we intend to consult on a minimum allowance for foster carers so that the arrangements for financial support for foster carers are better and more consistent across the country. We are also providing a good deal of support to the Fostering Network to ensure high recruitment standards, including the introduction of the new national advice line, Fosterline, set up in January. It provides an independent source of information and advice to foster carers. Funding of &#163;1 million over three years is being provided for the helpline.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that we ought to regard foster carers as some of the heroes of our society, given how they open their homes and families to hitherto unknown children, often with very special needs? Does he further agree that everything which can be done should be done to improve their status and the level of support we provide for them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, I agree absolutely with the noble Lord. Foster carers play an extremely important role in our society. Moreover, they are now looking after a significantly higher proportion of children in care than has been the case. That is a great success of policy over recent years.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, given the shortage of foster carers, which we all deplore, does the Minister agree that grandparents could play a much greater role if they were given more support? I am not thinking just of a financial payment, but perhaps extra support with taking children to school and so forth, which they might not fully be able to undertake?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_674"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 674</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Baroness, but I am not aware that our national minimum allowances will extend to grandparents. However, I shall look at the issue further.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Chan: </b>   My Lords, to what extent will the report influence the work of the children&#039;s trusts in the new arrangements that are due to start next year?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, it will be central to the new children&#039;s trusts because local authorities will be taking forward the work on national minimum allowances and on the other measures we have set out to encourage the greater recruitment of foster carers, as well as better training and support for them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister elaborate a little on his reply to the noble Earl on the subject of the training that foster carers should receive? A little training would do a great deal to qualify many more people to become foster carers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, I understand that training in foster care is variable at the moment. While many local authorities and independent fostering agencies provide excellent training, the standard is not consistent. We are seeking to ensure that a consistent level of training is available across the country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew14"></a><b> The Countess of Mar: </b>   My Lords, what are the Government doing to overcome the problem that arises out of their policy of encouraging women to go out to work and encouraging them to be foster carers? A balance needs to be struck. If women are to be foster carers, they should be compensated sufficiently for not going out to work. On the whole, fostered children need much more care than do children from so-called &quot;normal&quot; families.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="51018-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, that is a fair point and is precisely why the introduction of the national minimum allowance is so important. We need also to look at the issue of fees which are paid over and above that allowance to foster carers. They must be sufficient to recruit and retain an adequate number of foster carers in each area.

At the moment, we have about 2.5 million courses and we are working steadily with Roche, the manufacturer, to increase that number.

<a name="51018-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I repeat that we have put in place arrangements to produce a stockpile of some 14 million doses of antivirals by next September. That dosage is consistent with the estimate in the UK&#039;s contingency plan for a 25 per cent infection rate in a pandemic. That action is in hand. I understand that in this case Roche has expressed a willingness to consider an application from an Indian company to manufacture its product, provided that quality standards are met, and it is waiting to hear an approach from that country. We do not see the need to take steps at this time. We are already well on the path to meeting the stockpile requirements that we set out in the UK&#039;s contingency plan.

   &quot;RESTRICTIONS ON MORTGAGING

<br>
(1)   Section 38 of the 1993 Act (restrictions on mortgaging) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   For subsections (2) and (3) substitute&#151;


<br>
&quot;(2)   Subsection (1) above shall not apply to a mortgage of any such land if the charity trustees have, before executing the mortgage, obtained and considered proper advice, given to them in writing, on the relevant matters or matter mentioned in subsection (3) or (3A) below (as the case may be).


<br>
(3)   In the case of a mortgage to secure the repayment of a proposed loan or grant, the relevant matters are&#151;


<br>
(a)   whether the loan or grant is necessary in order for the charity trustees to be able to pursue the particular course of action in connection with which they are seeking the loan or grant;


<br>
(b)   whether the terms of the loan or grant are reasonable having regard to the status of the charity as the prospective recipient of the loan or grant; and


<br>
(c)   the ability of the charity to repay on those terms the sum proposed to be paid by way of loan or grant.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_681"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 681</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(3A)   In the case of a mortgage to secure the discharge of any other proposed obligation, the relevant matter is whether it is reasonable for the charity trustees to undertake to discharge the obligation, having regard to the charity&#039;s purposes.

<br>
(3B)   Subsection (3) or (as the case may be) subsection (3A) above applies in relation to such a mortgage as is mentioned in that subsection whether the mortgage&#151;


<br>
(a)   would only have effect to secure the repayment of the proposed loan or grant or the discharge of the proposed obligation, or


<br>
(b)   would also have effect to secure the repayment of sums paid by way of loan or grant, or the discharge of other obligations undertaken, after the date of its execution.


<br>
(3C)   Subsection (3D) below applies where&#151;


<br>
(a)   the charity trustees of a charity have executed a mortgage of land held by or in trust for a charity in accordance with subsection (2) above, and


<br>
(b)   the mortgage has effect to secure the repayment of sums paid by way of loan or grant, or the discharge of other obligations undertaken, after the date of its execution.


<br>
(3D)   In such a case, the charity trustees must not after that date enter into any transaction involving&#151;


<br>
(a)   the payment of any such sums, or


<br>
(b)   the undertaking of any such obligations,

unless they have, before entering into the transaction, obtained and considered proper advice, given to them in writing, on the matters or matter mentioned in subsection (3)(a) to (c) or (3A) above (as the case may be).&quot;

(a)   for &quot;subsection (2)&quot; substitute &quot;this section&quot;; and

<p><a name="st_62"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move the amendment standing in the name of my noble friend Lady Scotland of Asthal and to speak to Amendment No.101. These are deregulatory amendments.
</p>

<a name="51018-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>At present, the grant of a mortgage over charity land requires the Charity Commission&#039;s or the court&#039;s consent unless the mortgage is being granted by way of security for the repayment of a specific loan. Where the mortgage is granted for that purpose, the commission&#039;s or the court&#039;s consent is not needed provided that the trustees of the charity follow what I shall call the no-consent procedure. This requires the trustees to take advice on certain specified matters such as the charity&#039;s ability to repay the loan on the terms proposed. The advice-taking requirement is concerned with whether it is in the interests of the charity to take out the loan.
</p>

<a name="51018-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>In Committee the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, tabled amendments intended to enable a mortgage over charity land to be granted via the no-consent procedure in one other circumstance. That circumstance was where the mortgage is granted by way of security for the repayment of a conditional grant made to a charity.
</p>

<a name="51018-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The Government accept that the current scope of the no-consent procedure is more limited than is necessary for effective regulation. We agree that the circumstances in which a mortgage over charity land can be given without the need for the court&#039;s or the commission&#039;s consent ought to be extended. We propose to go a little further than the noble Lord, Lord <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_682"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 682</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Phillips, and to allow trustees to avoid the need for consent provided they follow the no-consent procedure to a mortgage which is granted to securing the discharge of any obligation&#151;not just the repayment of a loan or a grant. Liability under a guarantee is an example of another type of obligation which could be secured by a mortgage.
</p>

<a name="51018-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Our amendments will also remove another restriction on the scope of the no-consent procedure.
</p>

<a name="51018-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>It is common practice for a commercial lender to take mortgages which are intended to secure not only the loan which is under immediate consideration but also of any future loan which the lender might make to the borrower. This approach saves administrative and legal expense. But the grant of a mortgage of this nature over charity land has been understood to require the court&#039;s or the commission&#039;s consent every time a future loan is made. This is on the basis that a mortgage can be granted under the no-consent procedure only if it is intended to secure solely the discharge of a loan on which trustees have taken advice before the grant of the mortgage.
</p>

<a name="51018-04_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Section 38 was not drafted with such mortgages in mind and this understanding of the law is the source of frequent complaint to the Charity Commission. Our amendments will have the effect of bringing this sort of mortgage within the no-consent procedure. But a condition is that before a new loan can become validly secured by this sort of mortgage, the trustees will have to obtain and consider the same sort of advice that they would have had to obtain and consider in relation to the original loan.
</p>

<a name="51018-04_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The amendments to Section 39 of the Charities Act 1993 are consequential on the amendments to Section 38, the effect of which I have just described. I apologise for the length of that explanation, but I thought that it might be useful to your Lordships in terms of the amendment&#039;s complexity and so on.

As the noble Lord said in conclusion, it is a pity that such a simple change requires 50 lines of new statute law. However, that is the nature of legislation these days. Everything is so complicated that a simple change requires an &quot;unsimple&quot; amendment. I am grateful for the improvement that it represents for life in the real world.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>After Clause 26, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
   &quot;RIGHT OF REPLY TO INQUIRY REPORTS

<br>
   After section 8(6)(b) of the 1993 Act insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(c)   all persons and organisations referred to in a report which is to be published must be invited on 28 days notice to sign their agreement with the report or alternatively to submit a dissenting opinion which must be published as an appendix with the report, and no agreement or dissenting opinion or lack of them shall be <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 683</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

taken into account by the Commission or the court in deciding whether a trustee subject to an order removing him as a trustee shall be re-instated.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_65"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of the amendment is to require the Charity Commission to publish with its inquiry reports the agreement or otherwise of the affected parties. The proposal is necessary because the commission&#039;s reports are often very one-sided and leave a burning sense of injustice in the people referred to in the reports, giving them no opportunity to refute unbalanced information. In too many of the commission&#039;s cases, the victims have suffered unjust treatment and then have had to further suffer a one-sided account published on the Charity Commission&#039;s much-visited website where it remains, I understand, for two years.
</p>

<a name="51018-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>On 12 July, at col. 1054 of <i>Hansard, </i>I quoted the Minister as saying that anyone affected by an inquiry is free to publish his own account of it however he wishes. That is of course true, but I do not believe that it is good enough. The Minister also said that maligned trustees would already have had the opportunity to put evidence to the commission during an inquiry. So they would, but that does not help them to feel better if the commission publishes a one-sided account justifying its own behaviour. The Minister added that the trustees were asked to comment on the draft before it was published. That is true, but they are often given only a few days to comment on a document that has taken months to prepare and are confined to commenting only on factual content. They may well feel that the playing field is tilted towards the vertical.
</p>

<a name="51018-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I have seen a recent case in which an inquiry was closed, but the charity, its lawyers, and its trustees were not told. I understand that the Charity Commission prepared a report on the charity on 11 February that was not sent to the charity until 13 July&#151;at any rate that is the date on the covering letter. It was received by first class post on 15 July, with the reply to the report required by 25 July. That allowed, as there were two weekends in between, a pure six working days for it to arrive not by 25 July but on 25 July. Really that gave only five working days if one was to take first class postage into account as guaranteed by Royal Mail.
</p>

<a name="51018-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Bearing in mind that many people, trustees included, can be away for a fortnight at that time of year on holiday, that is not good enough, and it is not fair and reasonable. It is because of that cavalier attitude of the commission that I move the amendment. I hope that noble Lords will agree it. I beg to move.

First, it must be understood that anyone who does not agree with all or part of an inquiry or report published by the commission is, as I have made plain and as the noble Lord has also explained to the House, entirely at liberty to publish their own account. Secondly, trustees have the opportunity to express their views to the commission throughout the course of any inquiry that is conducted. Finally, the commission routinely sends inquiry reports to persons affected for comments on factual issues.
</p>

<a name="51018-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The commission has a statutory duty to undertake inquiries, and the inquiry report reflects the commission&#039;s view and the commission&#039;s conclusions. It is entirely right to express those views and draw conclusions from its own inquiry. It is a neutral body and is entirely independent. It does not take sides in inquiries but aims to take an objective view on the best interests of the charity. There are a number of internal quality checks on the report before it is published. Once the caseworker has drafted the report, it is checked by a senior manager and additionally by legal advisers. It is then sent to those who are affected by the inquiry. If substantive comments are received, the report could be rewritten, and the checking mechanisms would be processed again.
</p>

<a name="51018-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>At the commission&#039;s recent open AGM, it was made plain through an announcement that it was reviewing the form and content of inquiry reports, although the review itself does not extend to including a right of reply on inquiry reports. It is also reviewing how long inquiry reports remain on its website&#151;the point that the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, raised in moving the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51018-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I cannot agree that it is appropriate for people other than the commission to add comments to a report that is nothing more and nothing less than the commission&#039;s own description of its inquiry and its own conclusions. We have to have confidence in the commission. It cannot be right that Parliament does not trust the independent regulator to draw up properly considered inquiry reports to the extent that it expects future inquiry reports to be unfair and unbalanced and in need of a right of reply. Other regulators work in the same way, and I do not see that we could accept the amendment and expect the commission to differ from what most Members of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_685"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 685</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

your Lordships&#039; House would agree is a practical and workable model that has served this regulator and other regulators well.
</p>

<a name="51018-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The commission will ensure that those affected by an inquiry report will have a reasonable time to consider a draft report and make representations about it. That is a guarantee from the commission. I am interested in the case that the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has raised. It is entirely reasonable that the time limits for a response are clear and that those affected are given ample opportunity to make their views known to the commission in the way in which it prepares its inquiry reports. I am assured that the commission is determined to provide reasonable time for proper representations to be made. For all those reasons, I cannot accept the noble Lord&#039;s amendment today, as I have been unable to accept it on other occasions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="51018-05_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   My Lords, I note what the Minister says. I hope that, when ensuring that sufficient time is given for trustees and those working for charities to respond to a draft report, account will be taken of the time of year. At the time of year that the report was sent to that small charity, those who were actually running it&#151;the trustees&#151;might have been away on holiday, which is not unreasonable in July, as a lot of people go on holiday in July, including some Members of the House. When most people go on holiday, they go for at least a fortnight. If that five or six days fell within that fortnight there would be no earthly chance, with the letter in the charity&#039;s office and those running the charity in the Mediterranean, of anyone having an opportunity to read it, let alone comment on it.
</p>

<a name="51018-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The Charity Commission should make certain that ample time is given to consider reports. I will read carefully what the Minister said, but I maintain my right to come back on the matter at Third Reading if I feel it necessary. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51018-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Swinfen </b>   moved Amendment No. 63:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>After Clause 26, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
   &quot;RECEIVER AND MANAGER TO BE PAID BY COMMISSION

<br>
   In section 19(6)(b) of the 1993 Act, for &quot;income of the charities concerned&quot; substitute &quot;Charity Commission for England and Wales&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_70"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is on a rather different matter. Its purpose is to make the Charity Commission responsible for paying its own receivers and managers, rather than the charity on which the receivers and managers are imposed having to pay. The Charity Commission already has the power to pay its own receivers and managers, as set out in the 1993 Act, but usually if not invariably charges those costs to the charity. The commission should also pay the fees and expenses of any receiver and manager, and consultants appointed to assist a receiver and manager, in all cases.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_686"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 686</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51018-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>In the past, the commission has shown itself to be somewhat careless with charity funds when appointing and monitoring receivers and managers. For example, in the Voice of Methodism Association case, the receiver and manager was in post for more than six years, at a cost to that charity of &#163;100,000. In the current Cancer Care Foundation case, the receiver and manager has already run up costs in excess of &#163;600,000, and those costs are increasing. The commission&#039;s legal authority for appointing a receiver and manager is to protect the assets of the charity. Running up such costs is hardly protecting the assets of the charity. Questions may well be asked in certain cases on whether such an appointment has been detrimental to that responsibility.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>There have been a number of cases in which the receiver and manager has been in post for several years, incurring costs to the charity concerned running into hundreds and thousands of pounds or, on occasions, more than &#163;1 million. The amendment will serve to help the new commission management in its attempts to restrict the use of receivers and managers for the more serious cases, in which they are still bound to be required. Bluntly, the commission is likely to be more careful when incurring receiver and manager costs if it has to find them out of its own pocket rather than that of the charity. I note that, in the Charities Act 1993, the costs of the receivers and managers are to be paid out of the income of the charity. I suspect in some cases that the charity may well have had to delve into its capital, and I wonder whether that is entirely legal. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="51018-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend has brought to our attention an important point. It has obviously caused a lot of concern in the sector; witness the postbag that those of us involved in the Bill have received.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I have some concerns about the way in which the amendment is phrased and the background to it. My concerns are twofold. The first is the read-across from the private corporate sector, where a company that goes into administration or receivership has to pay the costs of that receiver or administrator, and there is no charge to the Department of Trade and Industry. Moving the payment from the company that is in difficulty&#151;or the charity, as in my noble friend&#039;s example&#151;to the taxpayer seems to raise a difficult issue. The reason is that, if we are not careful, we end up with what might in effect be a subsidy for bad behaviour. If a charity is so badly run that a receiver or manager is appointed, why should the taxpayer, who is after all the funder of the Charity Commission, pick up the bill? A possible subtext is that there is a small, probably marginal, incentive for trustees to behave well, in that, if they behave badly and an administrator or receiver is appointed, there will be a penalty attached to their bad behaviour. Those are my two problems with what my noble friend has put before us this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>On the other hand, there is no doubt that there is an obligation on the receiver and manager to operate efficiently and on the Charity Commission to ensure <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_687"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 687</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that it is operating efficiently. My noble friend has given some examples of cases where the administrator, receiver or manager has been in the post for several years, where the sums involved have been very large. That is an important issue that needs to be addressed, although I am not sure that the way that my noble friend suggests is the right one. It is, the Minister will know, a frequent complaint about the behaviour of receivers and managers in the private sector that they are cavalier with their time and therefore cavalier with the funds of the company that they are managing or administering. Redress is not easy to obtain, because a company in administration or receivership has no capacity to fight the administrator or manager, because it is obviously on the back foot.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>My noble friend has raised an important issue about how the Charity Commission is going to behave and the way in which future managers and receivers should behave to ensure that they are efficient and timely in their work. I look forward to hearing how the Government believe that that important balance will be struck.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="51018-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I largely agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbots, has just said. There are a few cases where the Association of Charitable Trusts has pursued this with great tenacity. I hope that the Minister will encourage us in the belief that the Charity Commission might be more wary of what goes on after managers and receivers have been appointed because there are some bad cases.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>In an extreme case, where there has been a breach of trust by one of the trustees of the charity, the costs of the manager or receiver would&#151;in theory, at any rate&#151;be recoverable against the trustees that, by their breach of trust, have given rise to the appointment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="51018-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, we have spent a long time discussing the appointment of interim managers during the passage of the Bill. It has been time usefully spent.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>In practice, of course, the appointment of an interim manager is usually a last resort, when it is essential temporarily to secure the assets of a charity where there has been serious maladministration, misconduct or&#151;perhaps worse&#151;where the assets are clearly at risk. That is not a desirable position.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>An interim manager can be appointed by the commission only after the opening of a formal enquiry and after evidence of misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of the charity is obtained or in the event that it is necessary or desirable to protect the charity&#039;s property. The Government continue to believe that, in most circumstances, it is appropriate for interim managers to be remunerated from the income of the charities concerned. Such appointments are made only after careful consideration of all other possible options and generally after a tender exercise to ensure both value for money and that the right appointment is made to deal with the circumstances that have arisen. Unfortunately, the need for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_688"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 688</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

appointments arises in circumstances where the problems are often complex and the trustees are either unwilling or unable to put the matters right themselves.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Charities run their own affairs and, we would all agree, must be responsible for the consequences of their decisions and actions, including the consequences of mismanagement. We believe that in most cases it should not fall to public funds to pay the costs of an interim manager appointed to a charity as a result of the decisions and actions of the trustees of that charity. I invite noble Lords to agree with that basic principle.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Interim manager appointments are rare: only two were appointed in 2004&#150;05. We accept that the costs associated with the appointment can be high, but they must be considered alongside the value of the charity assets that are secured&#151;almost &#163;20 million for the seven cases that concluded in 2004&#150;05. The commission has a statutory responsibility to supervise all receiver and manager appointments, which it discharges in all cases.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The new powers to give directions to be conferred on the commission under Clauses 20 and 21 of the Bill may lead to a reduction in such appointments, as they will provide an alternative and simpler route to dealing with some of the concerns that give rise to appointments now. One of the points that has been made is about the high cost of disbursements and other professional fees incurred by interim managers. There is an argument that such professional advice would be necessary for the charity to restore itself to a sound financial footing in any event, regardless of whether it was being administered by the original trustees or by an interim manager appointed to it. The commission in supervising the appointment will clearly wish to keep those costs, as it does other matters, under careful review.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>We also agree that there may be some circumstances where it would be more appropriate for the interim manager to be remunerated out of public funds. An example might be where serious issues have arisen in the administration of the charity but the charity concerned is small and would not have the resources to pay the costs of an interim manager. It is perhaps with those circumstances that the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, is most concerned. Nevertheless, if the commission decides that it is in the public interest and the best interests of the charity to appoint an interim manager, it may appoint one at public expense. It is only right that there is a clear understanding that nothing in the existing legislation would preclude the use of public resources to pay the costs of an interim manager where appropriate. However, our view remains that those should be exceptional cases and that the norm would be for interim managers to be paid out of the charity&#039;s resources under the supervision of the commission.
</p>

<a name="51018-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>There is no reason why public resources cannot be used to pay for interim managers where it is right for them to do so. We understand entirely the point about the size and capacity of charities to fund the costs and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_689"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 689</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expenses of the interim manager and any disbursements that they may have to make. Given the flexibility that is already in the law, I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, that it might be more appropriate to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="51018-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken on the amendment. My noble friend said that the drafting could probably be improved. My drafting can always be improved; I have no objection whatever to that.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I am not attempting to produce a subsidy for bad behaviour. There are occasions when obviously the trustees have misbehaved and the funding of an interim manager should come out of their personal pockets rather than those of the charity. I have no objection to that, but sometimes an interim manager needs to be appointed because the trustees and managers have mismanaged out of pure lack of expertise. They have been doing the best they can, but they have not succeeded because they do not have the training or the management skills to deal with it.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that on occasions the interim manager has been remunerated out of public funds. I should be grateful if he would write to me with some examples, because I know of none. My noble friend said that it was wrong for the taxpayer to pay in commercial cases because of a manager who has been put in to wind up a company.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>There is a difference between taxation and donation. Taxation is money paid to the state for the state to do its work. Donation is money paid to a charity for the charity to use for charitable purposes, and by law those donations can be used only for those charitable purposes. Theoretically, if a charity has enough to fulfil those purposes and wants to use it for another charitable purpose, it should offer that money back to the donor. I have never yet come across a Treasury offering money back to a taxpayer because it feels it has enough. I wish that day would come.

   &quot;SALE OF FUNCTIONAL PROPERTY

<br>
   After section 36 of the 1993 Act insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;36A   SALE OF FUNCTIONAL PROPERTY


<br>
(1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 36(2), no land or buildings forming part of the functional assets of a charity shall without an order of the court or the Charity Commission be mortgaged or charged for the repayment of money borrowed, nor in the case of land or buildings in England or Wales be sold leased or otherwise disposed of save in accordance with the provisions of this section.


<br>
(2)   For the purposes of this section, &quot;the functional assets of a charity&quot; shall mean all such assets as are or have within the preceding 4 years been used or occupied for the purposes of an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_690"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 690</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

undertaking conducted by the charity in the pursuit of any primary purpose of the charity (but not including property used or occupied in the course of profitable investment for the benefit of or in the course of the management and administration of the charity).


<br>
(3)   Subsection (1) above shall not apply to any mortgage or charge for the purposes of securing borrowings or any sale lease exchange or other dealing with land or buildings which the trustees duly certify to be in their opinion required for or expedient in the interests of the better functioning or development of the undertaking of the charity in relation to which the land or buildings shall have been used or occupied, and in relation to any such transaction so certified the provisions of section 36 shall apply accordingly.


<br>
(4)   Any person dealing with the trustees of a charity in good faith and acting without actual notice of any impropriety in the giving of any such certificate as is referred to in subsection (3) hereof shall be entitled to rely on the giving of such certificate as conclusive evidence that the certificate has been properly given but save as aforesaid a certificate given in breach of the duty of the trustees shall have no effect.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_76"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 64 has been suggested by the Independent Schools Council, the body which represents about 1,300 independent schools, almost all of them charities, with over 500,000 pupils. The amendment is not unconnected with your Lordship&#039;s deliberation of the previous amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, concerning trustees who are not terribly expert, and, indeed, it is not unconnected with your Lordships&#039; deliberations last week on the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market, concerning schools with charitable status which fail to satisfy the public benefit requirements. Its intention is to buttress these charities against sales of their buildings or lands at below full value by improving the bargaining power of voluntary, unpaid, charitable trustees when faced with a predatory approach from a much tougher commercial purchaser.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Earlier in Report stage, I made reference to the new breed of purely profit-making commercial providers of education. These operators will not be giving bursaries, providing help to the maintained sector, opening premises to state schools or doing any of the other public-benefit activities which charities will undertake. These commercial companies are currently looking for opportunities to buy out existing premises. Pressure from such commercial purchasers may be greater if some independent charitable schools&#151;a small minority, I trust&#151;find they are unable to stay in business because they cannot demonstrate public benefit.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Many schools, but also hospitals and retirement homes, carry out their activities on land or in buildings with considerable development value. There are astute commercial operators, backed by private equity funds, who can muster property development expertise to acquire those assets. Such purchasers can run circles around less commercially astute charities whose volunteer trustees may well have no expertise in property development or commercial negotiation. There is a requirement on the charity to sell for full value, but this can be met by a single letter from a local surveyor saying that the price seems right. The problem is that the trustees of schools will often wish to sell the school as a going concern, but the underlying <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_691"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 691</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reality is that the value of the premises may be much higher if some or all the assets are stripped out and land is developed.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>There are special problems where trustees of a school feel unable to continue but nevertheless hope that the school can continue. In general, their negotiations must be conducted in the utmost secrecy because knowledge that a school is for sale can precipitate the withdrawal of pupils, further impair the school&#039;s financial viability and depress its value as a going concern. In those circumstances, a well funded commercial purchaser can strike a less-than-equitable bargain with trustees who are unable to test the open-market value. The certificate from a surveyor or valuer can state that the sale price is the best value obtainable, but negotiations and conditions of secrecy with a charity in financial distress can lead trustees to accept an unequal bargain.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>This amendment would redress that inequality of bargaining power in favour of the trustees. It would help them to attain full value for the assets that they sell by making it necessary, in limited but important circumstances, to obtain the Charity Commission&#039;s sanction for the proposed sale. That requirement would not apply if the trustees were simply moving their operations from one building to another or selling land or buildings held for investment purposes. It would apply where trustees were bringing to an end or substantially reducing the charitable undertaking carried on in those buildings or on that land. So whether in the case of a school or a retirement home, trustees could move premises without the Charity Commission&#039;s permission, unless they were significantly downsizing, but they would always need the commission&#039;s approval if selling the premises and discontinuing the activity; for example, ceasing to run a school.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I am told of a real example where the development value of a school was between &#163;16 million and &#163;20 million but the offer for purchase, on the basis that the school would carry on as a going concern, was between &#163;2 million and &#163;3 million. In that case, the purchaser was also negotiating for a commitment from the trustees to use part of the proceeds of sale to fund bursaries in the newly commercial school. That sounds very much like having one&#039;s cake and eating it. After the commercial operator had purchased the charitable assets for a knock-down price it would then benefit from part of the amount that it had paid when it came back in the form of bursaries, which gave that school a competitive advantage in the local market.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I understand that that process then makes neighbouring schools more vulnerable to predatory purchasers. The endgame could well be a number of purchasers in the local market, a merger of schools and the sale of surplus land, with a development gain accruing not for charitable purposes but to the private-equity investor. I can see that over a generation there could be considerable loss to the total charitable estate. The perverse outcome is that schools, which as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_692"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 692</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

charities must demonstrate public benefit, get replaced by profit-making schools that turn their back on the local community and have no charitable aim.
</p>

<a name="51018-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>The concern of the amendment, therefore, is the protection of charity assets in an increasingly tough financial environment. The guiding principle is that, if there is a fundamental change in a charity&#039;s activities which involves selling land or buildings, the Charity Commission should check that the sale is properly handled in the best interests of charity. Where there is the possibility of development gain further down the line, for example, the commission should check that the proper amount of that gain will accrue to the charitable estate rather than to the commercial purchaser. With the expert input from those appointed by the commission wherever that seems appropriate, the imbalance in skills between an ailing charitable body and a well funded commercial purchaser can be redressed. The dangers here are real already, but the position becomes more urgent if there are any cases where the Bill&#039;s public-benefit requirement means that more sales by charitable trustees become necessary. Putting the protection of the amendment in place seems a wise plan. I beg to move.

<a name="51018-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Best, for having raised this important issue. It is one that deserves proper consideration. Along with many other noble Lords, I received the briefing from the Independent Schools Council on which some of the arguments and background to this amendment rest. But while I understand the argument and the strength of the argument, I am by no means convinced that this approach is the right way to tackle the problem the noble Lord raises and which needs to be addressed. I say that for three reasons.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The first reason is simply that a trustee is a trustee is a trustee, and a trustee must take full responsibility for the operation of the organisation of which he or she is a trustee. To introduce a category of transactions for which trustees are not fully responsible, in that they have to seek Charity Commission advice, is undesirable. We run the risk of having a two-tier type of trusteeship. That is the wrong approach to follow.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The second part is the argument advanced by the noble Lord about inequality of arms. On one side are the well resourced, experienced people of the acquiring non-charitable company and on the other are the inexperienced trustees of a failing institution. That is a poor reason for introducing this change in our primary legislation. The fact is that trustees need to inform themselves. In this connection, it is interesting that I have just become a trustee of a charitable foundation. The Charity Commission sent me a most extraordinarily helpful set of documents. I will not quote from them <i>in extenso</i> but there are a couple of paragraphs that show that even if you are the least experienced babe in the woods as far as trustees are concerned, if you just read what the Charity Commission tells you, you will get round the point that the noble Lord made.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_693"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 693</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51018-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I shall quote two paragraphs of the letter addressed &quot;Dear New Trustee&quot;:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;You might find it helpful to make an induction plan identifying and prioritising what you need to do to familiarise yourself with your new role.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a> You do not need to be a financial or legal expert to run your charity, but you will need to consider carefully when to take specialist advice. While risk of personal liability is small, you are more likely to be at risk if your charity suffers a loss because you didn&#039;t take specialist advice when you should have done&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>With this comes an easy-to-read welcome from the Charity Commission. There are a couple of pages but the part that is worth quoting is as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;Your liability as a charity trustee: In principle, you may be personally liable if your charity loses money as a result of a mistake you have made. However, this is unlikely to happen if you have: acted reasonably; worked within the governing document; and taken proper and appropriate professional advice where you don&#039;t know enough to make a decision, or where you are required to by law&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Within the guidance that people receive that is not complicated or difficult to understand. There is every reason to believe that trustees can and should familiarise themselves with their wider and broader responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The third and more practicable concern I have about the noble Lord&#039;s amendment is that introducing the Charity Commission to the circumstances envisaged in the amendment could make things worse. A failing charity, like a failing company, is always in a weak position and it is ingenuous to suppose that automatic involvement with the Charity Commission will somehow in reality strengthen the position of the weaker company. It takes us into a whole series of other legal and corporate legal concepts, in particular the issue of trading while insolvent. Let us consider the example the noble Lord has given of a school that is no longer able to trade effectively and is therefore being forced to accept an offer from an outside organisation. The fact is that it will not be a question of waiting for a week or two while the Charity Commission decides, but a question of whether the directors or trustees can order the weekly milk, because they will be liable for that if they continue to trade knowing that they will not be able to meet that debt as it falls due.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>So there is a real danger that we will introduce ossification to the process. Indeed, we might increase the risk of inexperienced trustees being exposed to trading while insolvent claims, which are a very serious breach of company law. In my experience in the corporate sector, speed is of the essence where companies and indeed charities begin to fail. Failure compounds extraordinarily quickly and is catastrophically steep at the end. I feel that the Charity Commission will not be able to facilitate and help that process.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>My final point concerns the law of unintended consequences. We raise here a particular set of circumstances. I accept what the noble Lord has said about the dangers, but if we were to put that into the primary legislation that we are discussing today, we will be stuck with it for 14 or 15 years until the next charity Bill comes along. I am not quite clear whether <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_694"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 694</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the thread that the noble Lord introduces, with the very best of intentions, might not take us in a way that is undesirable.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>So while I accept that there is an issue, I would hope that it can be addressed by a degree of self-regulation by organisations such as the Independent Schools Council writing to their members offering them a helpline and advice, and telling them of the dangers that they may find themselves in if they begin to fail. In those circumstances, it is much better to have this sort of flexibility rather than the inflexibility of primary legislation which carries with it complications and consequences that today we cannot possibly hope to see through.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="51018-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that I received the briefing to which everyone is referring. I hope that that is not because I pursued an amendment with regard to public interest that was not favoured by the Independent Schools Council. Indeed, it cannot be, because the noble Lord, Lord Best, had his name to the same amendment.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I should like to make two quick points. First, surely, in the example that the noble Lord, Lord Best, gave, there would be an action for negligence against the surveyor. The difference between the value he certified the property as bearing and the real value as realised shortly after the acquisition by the predatory buyer was so enormous that there must have been negligence.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Secondly, granted that I have had to try to understand this new section from the lips of the noble Lord, Lord Best, without any background information, it seems that the check to sales of this sort which the noble Lord, Lord Best, seeks to insert in the Bill simply is not there. Unless I have misread it, all that the trustees have to do in the event of a sale of functional land is to certify that in their opinion it is expedient for the charity to make the sale. There is an implicit opinion for every sale that trustees ever make. They do not make sales unless they think that it is expedient to make the sale. I do not see how there is a remedy here to the very real problem that the noble Lord, Lord Best, identified when he opened his argument in support of the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="51018-08_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Caithness: </b>   My Lords, in defence of surveyors, I would merely point out to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, that in the instance that the noble Lord, Lord Best, gave, there might well have been a substantial difference between a valuation and a purchase price. That is not necessarily the surveyor getting the price wrong. It is the decision of the owners, whether they be trustees or a private individual, under the circumstances in which they will sell. If there was a potential for huge development and, therefore, the valuer valued it on that basis, but the trustees or owners decided to sell it for another use that did not release that potential for development, of course there would be a different price.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>But my point of concern with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Best, is that it would negate what trustees ought to be doing in the first place. Under the amendment, trustees would be able to hide behind the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_695"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 695</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Charity Commission. Surely that is not the position we want trustees to be in. Trustees for a particular charity should be competent to run it and, where necessary, should bring in expertise. If a charity is failing or not fulfilling its original purpose, the trustees are obliged to bring on board another trustee who knows about the problem or to bring in at an early stage expert advice. To hand it over to the Charity Commission would be, in my view, a retrograde step.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="51018-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, I have some sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Best, has said. But as will become clear in the next few minutes, a different solution from his is preferable. Like other noble Lords who have contributed to this short debate, while we agree that this is something of a problem, the solution constructed in the proposed new clause is not one that finds our support. We too think that it may bring into play the operation of the law of unintended consequences. I am also very much drawn to the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, on the importance of relying on the good sense of the trustees and making them face up to their responsibilities. That is very important. To offer the option of hiding behind the Charity Commission by asking it to intervene in situations of this kind is probably unwise.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I agree with the principle put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Best, that there should be safeguards preventing charity trustees disposing of their property at an undervalue. Indeed there is a general principle of law that charity trustees must obtain the best terms reasonably achievable in the circumstances when they dispose of any of their assets, except where the disposal furthers a charitable purpose. That point is understood.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Before 1992, there was a requirement in charity law that trustees had to obtain the Charity Commission&#039;s consent by order before disposing of any land that had at any time, not just in the previous few years, been occupied for the purposes of the charity. That requirement was repealed as unduly bureaucratic and over-regulatory and replaced by the present arrangements set out in Part V of the Charities Act 1993. Under those arrangements, charity trustees do not need to obtain a Charity Commission order for the sale of their property if they follow a prescribed procedure. That procedure requires trustees to obtain a written report on the proposed disposal from a qualified surveyor acting exclusively for the charity to market the property in the way recommended by that surveyor&#151;unless he recommends that it should not be marketed&#151;and to satisfy themselves that the terms of the disposal are the best reasonably obtainable; which is the important principle. Regulations made by the Home Secretary prescribe the information that the surveyor must include in his report to the trustees.
</p>

<a name="51018-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Where we part company with the noble Lord, Lord Best, is over his belief that the best safeguard against disposals at an undervalue is to give back to the Charity Commission the role of inspecting the terms of the transaction. In my view, that role is best left in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_696"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 696</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

hands of an expert in the valuation and sale of property, which a qualified surveyor is, but the Commission&#151;with due respect&#151;is not. However, we are willing to contemplate a review of the Charities (Qualified Surveyors&#039; Reports) Regulations 1992. These regulations set out what matters the surveyor must cover in his report to trustees on any projected disposal of land. Our review of these regulations, which we would begin after the Bill has been enacted, would ensure that a surveyor was required to alert trustees to any factors, such as development potential or ransom value, which charity trustees should take into account when agreeing the terms of a disposal. Our review of the regulations will involve full consultation with schools and other landowning charities&#151;obviously we would want to take on board the views of the profession itself.

<a name="51018-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, when the Government come to look at the regulations, would they be prepared to give attention to the introduction of clawbacks of the future value? Too often, the regulations talk about what happens at the present moment, but, clearly, one can get value down the road. Therefore, some form of clawback would be helpful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="51018-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, that might best be expedited through some reference to sell-on clauses and so forth. It is a sensible suggestion and no doubt those are the sorts of issues that the consultation will need to address. I am grateful to the noble Lord for that intervention.
</p>

<a name="51018-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Best, for raising this issue because I recognise its importance. Other noble Lords who contributed to this discussion also recognise that. We cannot agree with the noble Lord&#039;s solution&#151;if solution indeed it be. However, perhaps by reviewing the regulations and taking on board a broader range of views on the way in which those regulations have operated in the past, we can find a way that deals with an important part of the issue identified by the noble Lord. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="51018-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Best: </b>   My Lords, I am very grateful to noble Lords for expressing their views on this matter and for all the good advice that has come from this exchange. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, did not get the excellent briefing that I prepared for him. I recall that correspondence is not always opened in his office when it is expected to be opened, but when he comes to read it I know that he will find it entirely convincing.
</p>

<a name="51018-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>It may well be that the problem that I identified is best handled by enhanced regulation through the Charity Commission, particularly covering the important point that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, seized on&#151;that value can accrue later and not at the moment of sale. Development value comes after the acquisition of the school as a going concern when either part of that school or another school which, in the process of a number of acquisitions now becomes <br>&nbsp;<br>

redundant, can be redeveloped. That is the point one needs to capture. If regulation through the Charity Commission can do that it would be more than helpful. Indeed, perhaps better advice, more advice and a helpline, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, through the Independent Schools Council could heighten awareness of the issue and help people avoid the problem. Such measures would support the less astute trustees of charitable independent schools in the face of powerful pressures from purchasers who have very different motives from those of charities. I thank your Lordships. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, for that positive, encouraging and helpful response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51018-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Paragraph 1 of new Schedule 5A to the 1993 Act, as inserted by Schedule 6 to the Bill, supplies the meaning of a &quot;subsidiary undertaking&quot; for the purposes of the new group accounting provisions. If the requirement to prepare group accounts applies, a parent charity must prepare accounts covering itself and its subsidiaries as a group. The definition of a subsidiary undertaking is important because it determines, for each parent charity, which other entities must be accounted for in the group accounts.
</p>

<a name="51018-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 1 lists entities which are not to fall within the definition of a subsidiary undertaking. One such entity is any institution to which a direction under Section 96(5) of the 1993 Act applies for the purposes of the group accounting provisions. Section 96(5) allows the Charity Commission to determine that an institution established for any special purposes or in connection with a charity shall be treated as either forming part of that charity for accounting purposes or as forming a distinct charity. If the commission has already determined that a particular institution forms a distinct charity for accounting purposes, it does not make sense for the Bill to exclude that institution from the definition of subsidiary undertaking. However, at present the Bill does make such provision.

These are minor, technical amendments to that provision and their purpose is twofold, as I shall now briefly explain.

</p>

<a name="51018-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>First, we have discovered that the Bill as drafted does not cover all those who report on a charity&#039;s accounts. Logically, the commission&#039;s power should extend to all those who report on charities&#039; accounts, including group accounts, and these amendments ensure that it does. Secondly, the amendments also extend the court&#039;s existing power to grant relief to an auditor or independent examiner of an unincorporated charity appointed under the current Section 43 of the Charities Act 1993. The amendments give the court the power to relieve from liability all those who report on the accounts of an unincorporated charity, including the group accounts of an unincorporated charity. I hope that noble Lords will agree that this is a sensible and logical group of amendments that tidy up the existing powers in the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I am grateful to the Hospital Broadcasting Association for bringing to our attention this and a number of other issues on which we have made amendments. One receives a lot of correspondence on these matters which is most helpful. It is important that the address of the principal office of a CIO is known to the public. Those who have dealings with any corporate body need to be assured that they will have no problems communicating with it. For that reason, the Bill as currently drafted would require the address of the principal office to appear on the face of the CIO&#039;s constitution. But the consequence of that is that any change to that address would need a constitutional amendment. The procedure for constitutional amendments, set out in paragraph 14 of new Schedule 5B, rightly contains a number of safeguards. However, representations have been made to the effect that those safeguards are unnecessary and that accordingly the amendment procedure is over-burdensome when a CIO is simply changing the address of its principal office. We agree that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_699"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 699</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

procedure set out in paragraph 14 is burdensome for the process of simply changing the address of a principal office.

</p>

<a name="51018-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>The effect of the amendments now tabled will be that the address of the principal office need not appear in a    CIO&#039;s constitution. Therefore, a constitutional amendment will not be necessary to change the address. The need to publicise the address of the principal office can be achieved in other ways. It can appear in the Charity Commission&#039;s register entry for the CIO, any change being effected only when it has been notified to and recorded by the commission. It could be made a requirement that the address of the CIO&#039;s principal office should appear in its correspondence. These are matters to be considered when framing the regulations to be made under Schedule 7. However, since the application of some of the CIO provisions will depend on whether the principal office is located in England or in Wales, we think that the country of location should still appear on the face of the CIO&#039;s constitution. The national location of that office should be capable of change only by the normal constitutional amendment procedure.
</p>

<a name="51018-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The second part of these amendments has the effect that all changes to a CIO&#039;s constitution will take effect only on registration by the commission. I hope that the House will agree that this is a sensible set of amendments designed to reduce burdens on charities. I beg to move.

Perhaps I should explain to the House that this affects a provision in the Bill relating to the conversion of charitable companies and charitable industrial and provident societies into charitable incorporated organisations, or CIOs. Broadly, the subparagraph, which my amendment seeks to amend, states that converting from a charitable company, or registered society as it is called, into a CIO does not let debtors off the hook, or rather&#151;I beg your Lordships&#039; pardon&#151;does not prejudice creditors. That is the point. Although the Act provides an automatic transfer of the assets of the charitable company or the registered society to the CIO, you do not leave behind the poor old creditors.

Since the process of conversion will not interrupt the legal personality of the entity, liabilities will clearly not be affected, but this subsection is designed to put the matter beyond doubt. In particular, it is designed to highlight that, although a CIO is not a company, it will still be liable for liabilities incurred by the charitable company as a company such as a penalty incurred for late submission of accounts.
</p>

<a name="51018-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>This would still be the position were subsection (9) not in the Bill because, as I have mentioned, a CIO is the same legal entity as the charitable company or registered society which converted to it.
</p>

<a name="51018-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising the issue. I trust that that explanation will suffice. On the subject of conversions to CIOs, perhaps I may advise your Lordships&#039; House that we intend to bring forward an amendment at Third Reading to provide for power to make regulations to enable the direct conversion of a <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="51018-10_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I confess that I did not understand the justification given by the Minister unless it were to state that the subsection applies only to a very narrow class of liabilities: he mentioned a fine for the late filing of accounts. I thought that the provision was designed to sweep into the CIO the liabilities of the charitable company or registered society converting into the CIO. If the Minister is right in his interpretation, I accept that my amendment is redundant. However, I believe that the wording of subsection (9) does not encourage the ordinary reader to think that it is defined as narrowly as he states.
</p>

<a name="51018-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I suggest that I withdraw the amendment and that we pursue the matter outside the Chamber. If necessary an amendment can be brought back at the final stage of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51018-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The Bill envisages that the transfer of the undertaking of one CIO to another will require validation by the Charity Commission. This is to ensure that the purposes for the furtherance of which the property of the transferor CIO is held, and the rights of those dealing with that CIO, are not inappropriately modified by the transfer. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, tabled an amendment, in order to ensure that this validation process was completed within six months of its initiation.

<a name="51018-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>We accepted that the interests of the charities involved could be prejudiced if the validation process takes too long, and agreed to give further consideration to the matter. However, I did explain that the period of six months may be insufficient for proper consideration to be given by the commission in complex cases.
</p>

<a name="51018-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The effect of the amendment we have now tabled will be, if the commission has not notified the transferor CIO that it has either validated or refused to validate the transfer within six months from its receipt of the copy resolutions of the transferor and the transferee CIOs relating to the transfer, that the transfer is treated as automatically validated once that period has ended.
</p>

<a name="51018-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>If the commission exercises its discretion to require public notice of the transfer resolution, the six month period only starts on the date when the public notice is given.
</p>

<a name="51018-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>If the commission wants to extend the six month period, it can do so for a period of up to six months by notice to the transferor CIO, giving the reasons why the extension is considered necessary.
</p>

<a name="51018-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>We think that this strikes a fair balance between effective regulation, and acceptance of the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that an uncertain and/or over-lengthy validation process may put at risk the success of the transfer and the success of the organisation.

<a name="51018-10_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for bringing forward the amendments. I express one hope. Six months is considered to be a long period, not a short period&#151;six months is a huge period in corporate life. To have a state of suspended animation as a matter of course for six months would be very unhelpful to the development of the sector. The danger of having the words &quot;six months&quot; in the Bill is that what is supposed to be a maximum becomes standard fare. Will the Minister clarify how long the period may be extended thereafter? As I understand it, it could be extended for another six months, giving a maximum of 12 months. Or can we go on having six-month period after six-month period? It was not clear from what the Minister said. I am grateful for the broad thrust, but I have concerns about the detail.

to transfer all property.

The noble Lord is right: I did say in Committee that we saw a lot of sense in the amendment and we would go away and think about it, and we did. I am sorry that we have not been able to table an amendment for today, but we have every intention of tabling what I am sure the noble Lord will agree will be a suitable amendment at Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="51018-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>We have identified a problem with the amendment as it is drafted, for reasons I will explain. Let us imagine that there is a charity with purposes A and B, whose trustees want to use the power in the Bill to transfer all of its property. As drafted, the amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, has tabled would allow the charity to divide its property between a charity with purpose C and a charity whose purposes encompass both purposes A and B. This comes about because the transferees together can be said to have purposes wide enough to encompass the purposes of the transferor. But it would not be right to allow a charity which had only objects A and B to transfer property to a charity with a purpose outside the transferor&#039;s own trusts&#151;in this example, purpose C.

<p><a name="st_113"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to move Amendment No. 82 tabled in the name of my noble friend Lady Scotland. Clause 39 inserts a new Section 74 into the 1993 Act. In doing so it makes provision for a small unincorporated charity to transfer all of its property to one or more other charities, subject to certain requirements&#151;including the passing of a resolution.

It also has the advantage of making this section consistent with new Sections 74B(9) and 75A(10) which similarly provide for time periods to commence on the date of receipt of a resolution by the commission.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to move Amendment No. 83 and to speak to Amendment No. 84, which address Clause 42. The purpose of these two amendments is to end the confusion which currently exists about what is or is not permanent endowment. The guts of what we are seeking to achieve are in the second of these, Amendment No. 84, the amendment which leads the group and is an introductory necessity. This ordering caused some confusion among the Minister&#039;s officials but I hope that I shall now be able to clarify the intention. In short, we seek to insert a new clause into the Bill that will provide a clear and unambiguous definition of what constitutes permanent endowment. Difficulties with the present position have been brought to our attention by several law firms expert in charity law.
</p>

<a name="51018-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Section 96(3) of the Charities Act 1993 contains a definition of permanent endowment that is widely interpreted as meaning that property is permanent endowment unless, at the time of the gift of it, it is expressly stated by the donor that both the capital and the income of the donated property can be spent on the charity&#039;s purposes. Given that it would never occur to most lay people that there was a need to state that&#151;they would assume that it would be the effect&#151;much more charity property is held as permanent endowment than was ever intended by the original donors.
</p>

<a name="51018-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to turn the definition around so that, in future, property will be deemed to be permanent endowment only if, at the time of the gift, there was an express stipulation that only the income from the capital could be spent on the purposes of the charity. If that definition is adopted, it will be only where donors have deliberately intended <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_706"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 706</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that their gift should form permanent endowment that those restrictions will apply. It is extremely unsatisfactory for service-providing charities, often schools, to find that they cannot sell a piece of land with valuable planning permission to enable them to construct new buildings on land already owned by them because of that definition. In consequence, the Charity Commission requires some system of recoupment of the money spent on the basis that the buildings to be erected are &quot;wasting assets&quot;. I fear that too often the Charity Commission has, without having taken professional advice from chartered surveyors, come to the conclusion that because many of the buildings are being constructed with a view to having a lifespan of a century or more&#151;in any event, that their existence enhances the value of the land on which they have been built&#151;its requirement to recoup money spent is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="51018-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I am told that Clause 42 will not necessarily help the situation. That is because the trustee&#039;s right of freedom to deal with permanent endowment will not apply to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;land held on trusts which stipulate that it is to be used for the purposes, or any particular purposes, of the charity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Those are the words that Amendment No. 83 seeks to leave out. The proposed clause would have a number of considerable advantages. First, it would create a positive definition of permanent endowment instead of the present rather vague and odd definition. Secondly, it would clearly exclude from permanent endowment all those user-type trusts and ancient deeds in which no intention was expressed, probably because the donors and other parties had no such intentions. Thirdly, it would catch those trusts specifically set up with the intention of creating a permanent endowment in the sense that only the income can be spent on the purposes of the charity.
</p>

<a name="51018-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The Government may be concerned that, if the wishes of donors can be overridden by Parliament, that will put off future donors. That is no doubt a very good argument in respect of more modern charities or those charities where a clearer intention is expressed, but it is not satisfactory where charities have their assets brought in as permanent endowment primarily by an implication drawn by the Charity Commission over the years and now reflected in the 1993 Act. A letter that I received from Mr Michael King of Stone King, a well known firm of solicitors specialising in charity law, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;I think it is perfectly understandable that the law should seek to give effect to the wishes of past donors to charity, but why should it be assumed that such donors wanted the money or property they gave to be restricted for income (or occupation) for the rest of time?</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;What are now Clauses 39-42 of the current Bill already provide for the spending of capital in limited circumstances, extending the 1993 Act, so Parliament is prepared in principle to ignore the express wishes of donors. What I cannot understand is why Parliament should wish to continue to imply permanent endowment where there is no such express wish. As we suggested in our submission to the Scrutiny Committee, this rule comes from another age when accountability by charities was policed in a less sophisticated way.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;However, many such charities do have some land which they hold on special trusts and even more so this applies to schools and care homes. Clients are infuriated to find that selling off a small <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>I wonder whether using the word &quot;intention&quot; there does not give rise to considerable uncertainty. That would mean that it would not be enough to rely upon a deed of gift; one would need to see whether or not there was a letter to the charity, accompanying the deed of gift, saying &quot;My intention, of course, is that you should keep this for ever&quot;, or words to that effect. That would undo the purpose behind this otherwise admirable amendment.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Finally, is it the noble Lord&#039;s intention that, if passed, this amendment would be effective for past gifts? Would it have the effect of translating existing permanent endowment into non-permanently endowed assets? I would be grateful if the noble Lord could enlighten the House when I sit down. If, as he said, the law was hitherto clear as to what permanent endowment was, albeit on a negative basis, there would be many donors in the past who, on the basis of the law as it then stood, would have made gifts which they intended to be held as permanent endowment and which are held as permanent endowment but which, by reason of the amendment, would cease to be held as permanent endowment. That does not seem to me to be a satisfactory or fair state of affairs, but I put those points forward in a constructive spirit, merely designed to make the amendment shockproof.

questions. They reflect some of the concerns that we have had in looking at the proposed changes to the clause.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>As we have noted, the effect of the amendment to be inserted after Clause 42 is to create a presumption against permanent endowment. I hope that the House will indulge me while I spend a minute or two explaining what happens at the moment. It is worth noting that the Charity Commission does not operate a presumption that property is held as permanent endowment. It makes the best assessment of what restrictions apply to the property by looking at the trusts on which the property is held and, if those are not conclusive, at other available evidence.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>If that evidence indicates that particular functional land and buildings which the charity trustees want to sell is permanent endowment, then there are two different regimes, depending on the circumstances. The commission may or may not require recoupment. &quot;Recoupment&quot; is the replacement, out of income, of the capital sum that has been spent.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The first regime is this: if the proceeds of sale of land and buildings are to be applied in the purchase of other land and buildings to be used for the purposes of the charity, the commission does not require recoupment of the proceeds of sale. If, however, the proceeds of sale are to be applied wholly or partly in the provision, improvement or development of buildings, the commission would normally require recoupment. In this case, land is effectively being exchanged for buildings. The basis for the distinction between the two regimes is that land has perpetual existence and buildings do not.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I know that it is sometimes difficult for some charities, such as schools, to determine the trusts on which different parts of their land is held, because the school premises may have been put together over many years&#151;in some cases over many centuries&#151;and acquired in several different ways at different times. However, we do not think that the ordinary law of evidence should be interfered with in this way. The nature of the trusts attaching to particular property should continue to be determined in accordance with established legal principles.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Amendment No. 84 would apply to existing charities. The original founders and donors to existing charities would therefore find, if the amendment were passed, that the goal posts had been changed in that the commission would have to start presuming that all property was not permanent endowment. Even if there were some evidence, falling short of a &quot;clear and express intention&quot; by the donor&#151;that it was intended to be permanent endowment, the commission would have to presume that it was not. We argue that this cannot be right, not least because there has never been a requirement on a donor to state a &quot;clear and express intention&quot; in order to establish the donated property as permanent endowment. Once the restriction on permanent endowment is removed, it cannot be put back. In addition, the amendment does not contain any safeguards, unlike Clause 42, which gives a limited power to spend capital.

</p>

<a name="51018-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Amendment No. 83 would include land held on trusts which stipulate that it is to be used for the purposes, or any particular purpose, of the charity in the new power for unincorporated charities to spend capital in certain circumstances. As the noble Lord ably explained, this is directly related to the first amendment because it lifts the restriction on permanently endowed land to allow it to be sold and the capital proceeds of sale expended without any recoupment. Where the trusts on which land is held specifically stipulate that that land is to be used for the purposes of the charity, we do not think it right to override that stipulation and allow the capital sum the land represents to be expended. My earlier comments explaining that the commission does not presume land is permanently endowed, but that it looks at individual circumstances on a case-by-case basis, are relevant here, too.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>While I know that for some landowning charities determining which parts of their property are permanently endowed and which parts are not can be difficult, it is not impossible and the commission aims to take a constructive approach in helping, where appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The current system, whereby the commission, together with the charity, looks on a case-by-case basis at different pieces of property and makes informed judgments according to the available evidence, seems to be the best and most practical approach in the tricky kind of circumstances in which some landowning charities can find themselves. The disadvantages I have highlighted which the noble Lord&#039;s amendment would introduce are not insignificant and I am therefore not able to accept the amendment.

</p>

<a name="51018-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I want to make two comments in response. He stated that the Charity Commission makes no presumption as to endowment. That may be the case, but the law firms which have contacted us do not see it that way. Therefore, at least a couple of the firms experienced in charity law in a way that I am not believe that, in practice, the Charity Commission does not operate in the even-handed, open way the Minister&#039;s remarks suggested.


</p>

<a name="51018-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>There has been a breakdown of communication, if not worse, between some of the experts in the field and the Charity Commission. The second point was that he talked about the moving of the presumption, which is absolutely right&#151;the amendment seeks to move from half full to half empty, depending on which way one looks at it. That was right and indeed was the purpose behind the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a> The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, with his usual forensic skill tore into this on at least three counts. The first question was the purposes of the Act. The purpose was that it should apply in general charity law. I <br>&nbsp;<br>

believed that it did, but the noble Lord is of course expert and will tell me that that will not be the case. The second question was about the use of the word &quot;intention&quot;. As he has heard me say many times before, I have not had the benefit of a legal training. I was assured that the use of the word &quot;intention&quot; would not give rise to the sort of problems that he described. I turn to past gifts&#151;permanent endowment. The amendment was intended to move the issue from half full to half empty, except where specific instructions have been given and specific wishes expressed in the past, when the donation was originally made.
</p>

<a name="51018-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a> I accept that those are tricky and difficult areas. We have had some important questions from the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. The Minister laid out the Govenrment&#039;s position clearly.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>Page 46, line 20, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

&quot;(4A)   In the case of a merger involving the transfer of property of any charity that has both a permanent endowment and other property (&quot;unrestricted property&quot;), subsection (4)(a) or (b) applies in relation to any such charity as if&#151;

<br>
(a)   the reference to all of its property were a reference to all of its unrestricted property, and


<br>
(b)   the reference to its ceasing to exist were omitted.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_120"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 89, 90, 91, 92, 93 and 94. The purpose of Clause 43 is to facilitate charity mergers. It does so in two ways: it speeds up the process of transferring property from one charity involved in the merger to another; and it preserves, for the benefit of the transferee charity in the merger, gifts made to the transferor charity after that charity has ceased to exist. A gift made to a charity after it has ceased to exist is currently exposed to the possibility of being ineffective as a charitable gift.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>In its current form, Clause 43 does not apply at all to permanently endowed charities but applies only in the case of charities which cease to exist as the consequence of a merger. The intention of a person who sets up a permanently endowed charity is that the charity cannot cease to exist. We agreed during our discussions in Committee that the courts have decided that such a charity does not cease to exist simply because the arrangements for its administration have been changed.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>We resisted the amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, tabled in Committee because the merger facilitation provisions cannot be applied to property that is permanent endowment. The property is not transferred to a new charity and any gift that may be added to the endowment after the merger does not need any protection, because the charity will not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_711"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 711</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have ceased to exist. However, it is possible for a charity to have both permanent endowment and other property and we accept that the provisions of Clause 43 could have a useful application to such other property, even though the charity as a whole does not cease to exist.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The effect of the amendments will be that the merger of a charity with a permanent endowment can still be registered where all the unrestricted property of that charity will pass to the transferee charity. The provisions that speed up the transfer of property in a merger can be applied to the unrestricted property. Where, after the merger, a gift is made adding to the unrestricted property, that will automatically take effect in favour of the charity to which the unrestricted property passed on the merger.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>These provisions will not, however, affect the legal position of the charity&#039;s permanent endowment and it will not be transferred to a new charity. Any gift adding to the permanent endowment made following the merger will take effect in the usual way. In practice, we envisage that the new charity resulting from the merger and the separate charity consisting of the permanent endowment will be managed together.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The amendments also include a technical provision to ensure compatibility with the Land Registration Act 2002 where the transfer provisions apply to registered land or land which is required to be registered. That has been requested by the Land Registry to make clear that transferred land must still be registered. I beg to move.

<a name="51018-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I have only one point on the Minister&#039;s very clear explanation of this group of amendments. That is in respect of Amendment No. 85. I gave notice to his office of my question. At the end of that amendment it states that the reference to the charity ceasing to exist on this merger shall be omitted. I wanted confirmation that if that be the case&#151;namely, that because of permanent endowment it is in future to be held back by one or more of the merging charities so that it does not cease to exist&#151;any creditor of that charity whose claim was unmet could go against the permanent endowed assets retained by the rump charity, if I may call it that. It is very important that it should be clear where creditors will gain their satisfaction in the complicated arrangements that these new provisions provide.

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="51018-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his question. Charities which merge will want to make arrangements for their liabilities. If, for whatever reason, there is an unforeseen liability which cannot be met in any other way, it is possible to use funds held as permanent endowment. The noble Lord will know more than me, but my understanding is that that is permitted by Section 31 of the Trustee Act 2000. We do not see that any difficulty will arise as a result of the merger arrangements.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 86, 87 and 88 stand in my name. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, for having added his name to Amendment No. 87. I crave the indulgence of the House for what is an extremely technical set of amendments to an extremely technical set of new clauses inserted into the Charities Act 1993 by Clause 43 of the Bill. They all relate to mergers; that is, where two or more charities decide that they want to pool their resources either by creating a new charity into which they all transfer their assets or where one of them is the surviving charity and the other one or more charities transfer all their assets into it.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The provisions created by the Bill are in many ways admirable and to be desired. One aspect of the arrangements is that if the merging charities make what are called in proposed new Section 75D &quot;pre-merger vesting declarations&quot;, so long as they comply with the provisions of that clause there will be an automatic transfer of all the assets of the charities concerned&#151;what is called &quot;automatic vesting&quot;. That is a most dramatic thing to happen in English law, under which the transfer of any assets is a laborious business and that of charity assets is extremely laborious, for the obvious reason that it is in the public interest to protect charity assets.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>We and noble Lords on the Conservative Benches are anxious that those arrangements work in the way in which the Government undoubtedly intend them to. The concern that the three amendments address is that a creditor of one of the charities merging could wake up one morning and find that the assets against which his or her claim might normally be met are no longer with the charity concerned. Indeed, creditors might find that the charity against which they have a claim&#151;it may be a straightforward debt&#151;no longer exists. Between them, the amendments are designed to tighten up the merger provisions.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a> Amendment No. 86 fills a gap in the legislation. New Section 75C is all about the register of charity mergers and starts by saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;The Commission shall establish and maintain a register of charity mergers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>If you put a cold towel around your head and study the provisions, you will find that the register is voluntary; that is to say, no charity engaged in a relevant merger <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_713"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 713</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is obliged to notify the Charity Commission. That is most obvious in subsection (5) of new Section 75C, which says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;A notification under subsection (3) above may be given in respect of a relevant charity merger at any time after&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The subsection then refers to the transfer of property of the charity concerned. That in itself is misleading, because an automatic vesting is not a transfer but a vesting of property&#151;I shall return to that point.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>It is essential that we tighten up those arrangements for the benefit of creditors, bearing in mind that no charity doing a proper and honourable job will want to disadvantage creditors. The first requirement of Amendment No. 86 is that it is compulsory, not voluntary, for those involved in a relevant charity merger to notify the Charity Commission so that it can keep its register up to date. The amendment would make it compulsory to give notice,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;within 28 days of the relevant charity merger&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>rather than at some indeterminate time, which could mean a year or two later.
</p>

<a name="51018-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The other two amendments are in a separate group, so the only other thing that I need say at this juncture is that, under those arrangements, an automatic vesting of all the assets of the charities concerned can take place without notification being given to the Charity Commission. For reasons that I have briefly sketched, that seems wrong in principle and contrary to the public interest. It is a matter that ought to be rectified. I beg to move.

We discussed it at Committee stage when we dealt with this Bill, or its predecessor, before the last election. The Government were as good as to accept the need for there to be a statement of appropriate arrangements made by charities that are engaging in what is called relevant charity merger, and that is now in Clause 42(6) on page 46. Let us leave aside the issue of whether it is required to be made, but the notification, if given, must,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;include a statement that appropriate arrangements have been made with respect to the discharge of any liabilities of the transferor charity or charities&quot;.</p>

<a name="51018-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>However, there is a further lacuna in that there is no sanction on the part of any charity or charities giving such notification if the statement of arrangements that they give to the Charity Commission is not appropriate and if the statement that they make is otherwise false. I have had discussions with officials on this matter and one answer is: you have your normal remedies. You can go to the registrar of companies&#151;by this time at least the charity having ceased to exist&#151;and ask the registrar to reinstate the corporate charity, and then you can bring an action against the corporate charity that has been put back on to the register. It may have no assets but you can bring an action against it, and if you are successful you can look into the question of whether the directors have been in breach of other provisions of the Companies Act in winding it up without due allowance made for the liabilities concerned. All that is a grotesquely unreasonable and unfair set of so-called remedies with which to lumber an innocent creditor in the event that these arrangements take their course.
</p>

<a name="51018-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>My amendment, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, has added his name, seems to be abundantly fair, because it simply says that if your statement is false you cannot hide behind it, and if you have not made appropriate arrangements you cannot hide behind them. In those circumstances, instead of going round the mulberry bush you can proceed against the trustees of the corporate charity themselves personally. They then stand on the same footing as trustees of an unincorporated charity; namely, that they are jointly and severally liable for the debts concerned. On that basis, I beg to move.

Amendment No. 87 seeks to add to the general law as regards liability for the liabilities of a charity, in the circumstances where the property of that charity is being transferred to another charity in the context of a registered merger. The noble Lord has explained his amendment clearly. As we see it, it would make the charity trustees of the transferor charity jointly and severally liable for its liabilities, in addition to whoever else (if anyone) would be so liable under the general law, in any case where those trustees had failed, as part of the merger process, to make &quot;appropriate arrangements&quot; for the discharge of those liabilities. I assume that the trustees would have the usual right to an indemnity out of the charity property, but they would still have the primary liability to settle the debts, and would have a personal liability in the event that they were unable to enforce their indemnity.
</p>

<a name="51018-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>We cannot see the justification for giving creditors a potentially additional selection of people to sue, simply because the option to register the merger is exercised, and the &quot;appropriate arrangements&quot; have not been made. Charities can go out of existence for reasons other than merger, and the general law would then simply take its course as regards the enforcement of any liabilities of the charity which are left outstanding. If creditors are given rights which they would not otherwise have had to sue trustees simply because the option to register the merger is exercised, and the &quot;appropriate arrangements&quot; have not been made, registration of charity mergers will be discouraged, and the beneficial purpose of these provisions will be undermined. For those reasons, I would invite the noble Lord to withdraw his Amendment No. 87.

<a name="51018-14_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I did not move the second amendment in the group. I wonder whether it would be appropriate to leave it until we have disposed of Amendment No. 87. It would help the House if we did. I realise that it is grouped, but it is always open to us to ungroup. As neither of us has spoken to the second amendment, perhaps I may invite the Minister to simply deal with Amendment No. 87.

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 716</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Amendment No. 88, I was going to suggest, in order to expedite matters, that we were minded to give it fair consideration. We thought that the noble Lord had a point. That was my intention. Perhaps if I sit down now we can deal with Amendment No. 87&#151;I suspect that the noble Lord wants to.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="51018-14_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister. Without having moved Amendment No. 88, I accept his kind offer of discussions, so that we can bring matters forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="51018-14_spnew8"></a><b> The Earl of Caithness: </b>   My Lords, I hope that when we come to Amendment No. 88, we, too, will be entitled to know what the point is that the noble Lord has moved that has attracted the Minister so much.
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="51018-14_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Earl sure that he wants to listen to that explanation at this time of day? In any event, let us deal with Amendment No. 87. I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said, but I am also not grateful because, with respect, he did not address the argument. The point about these new merger provisions is that they do two things by the operation of law: first, to see the cessation of charities that merge; and, secondly, the automatic vesting of all their assets in the new charity. In my view, it is a nonsense to declare that this is comparable with any existing arrangements; it is not. It is also grotesquely unfair to the poor old creditor who may know nothing whatever about the merger business. Indeed, if it is not on the register of notification, he would not know in any case. He will suddenly wake up to find no charity to go up against and no assets anyhow. On that basis, I feel that I ought to test the opinion of the House.

</p>

<a name="51018-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>We believe that these amendments improve Clause 54, which makes provision for a simple process to transfer a public collection certificate between trustees of an unincorporated charity. Under the clause as drafted, the holder of a public collections certificate must be a trustee of the charity and consent to the transfer. However, it was pointed out to us during the Summer Recess that, under the clause as drafted, problems could arise where a holder of the certificate resigned or retired as a trustee and a significant period of time then elapsed before the appointment of a replacement trustee. In such a case, the holder would no longer be a trustee of the charity, and it may be difficult to obtain the consent of that holder of the certificate to transfer it to a new holder. It would also be possible for the holder of a certificate to withhold consent as a result of an unrelated dispute with the other trustees. These amendments remove such potential blockages and difficulties, while maintaining the principle that the proposed new holder must consent to the transfer. They also require the charity&#039;s trustees rather than the charity to consent to the transfer. I hope that your Lordships will accept these sensible and practical amendments. I beg to move.

Our concern is to ensure that a decision is made sufficiently in advance of the date of the proposed collection as not to frustrate the planning and organisation of the collection. The amendment will achieve that. It is a simple amendment that will allow us to prescribe in regulations the period within which a local authority must determine such an application.

<p><a name="st_153"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I move Amendment No. 102, to which is added the name of my noble friend Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover. I need to make it clear that my noble friend has been instrumental in developing the amendment. He contributed extensively and knowledgeably to the pre-legislative scrutiny committee and has been most helpful on various points concerning charitable foundations to try to encourage others to follow his example as a generous donor and, indeed, trustee. I look forward to hearing his contribution to the debate in a moment.
</p>

<a name="51018-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>It is an amendment to the numerous provisions in Schedule 7. It would make changes to Section 42 of the Charities Act 1993. That gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations prescribing the form and content of charity accounts. Section 42(1) refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;a statement of accounts complying with such requirements as to its form and contents as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State&quot;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;for any such statement to be prepared in accordance with such methods and principles as are specified or referred to in the regulations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>It is one of the key principles of the Bill that charity regulations should be appropriate and proportionate. The Government accepted that argument during earlier debates. We recognise that a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to regulation is not in the best interests of the charity sector as a whole. However, at present all charities from the simplest grant makers to the giants of the charity world are obliged to prepare their accounts in accordance with the statement of recommended practice, commonly known as the SORP. The SORP is a long and complex document. The original charity SORP, issued in 1995, contained 240 paragraphs. The SORP in 2000 contained 358 paragraphs. The SORP in 2005 contains 439 paragraphs&#151;nearly double the length of 10 years ago. That is in addition to compliance with the growing volume of regulations applicable to all UK organisations: employment, health and safety, discrimination and so forth. Surely that scale of accounting regulation is not applicable or worthwhile for all charities.
</p>

<a name="51018-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The Minister may argue that the Charity Commission will address the issue; one would hope so. However, the relevant paragraph of the annual report refers to,

<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;of Recommended Practice (SORP) for the preparation of charities&#039; annual accounts and reports. Recognised by the Accounting Standards Board, the new SORP further hones charity reporting within existing principles. It aims to help charities explain what they do, how they go about it and what they achieve, merging narrative and financial reporting into a coherent, outcome-focused package, improving their transparency and accountability&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>Leaving aside the ghastly collection of buzz words that disfigures that statement, I do not see much that leads me to believe that the new SORP will make sufficient distinction between large and small charities. We propose that the principle of appropriate and proportionate regulation should be extended to the preparation of charity accounts. That is why the amendment would give the Secretary of State powers to achieve just that. I hope that the Government will look with favour on it. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="51018-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover: </b>   My Lords, I put my name to the amendment for three reasons. First, as my noble friend Lord Hodgson said, the accounting regulations encompassed by SORP have grown and grown. They have become a serious burden to charities, especially small charities. I suggest that the only gainers of that proliferation of regulation are the accountants. In the opinion of those in the charity sector whom I have consulted, the regulations have not resulted in clearer accounts than those that existed in charities five or more years ago.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The amendment should be a real help to charities. Requiring minimum regulations commensurate with giving a true and fair view of the charity&#039;s financial position should reduce significantly the number of paragraphs in the SORP. Ending the &quot;one size fits all&quot; regulations should result in appropriate regulations that take account of charities of different size and type, and thus, I suggest, provide a more meaningful account.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>My second reason for supporting the amendment is that the current regime of SORP is a serious disincentive to some potential large benefactors considering establishing a grant-making trust as an alternative to channelling their charity giving via gift aid, which they might do. It is obviously in the interests of the charity sector that grant-making trusts be established for the long-term benefit of charities rather than the valuable gift aid, which is the immediate way to help. The shorter, simpler and more appropriate the regulations the less likely that potential benefactors will be discouraged.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a> My third reason for supporting the amendment is my belief that under the present regime the accounts of some charities are actually forced to be misleading. That is a serious allegation, and I feel that I must justify it by explaining exactly why it is the case. The existing regulations require charities to report expenditure made in one year and what is committed for the following year against the income that is received in the first year and reserves. That in itself is certainly entirely sensible. However, the definition of &quot;reserves&quot; specifically excludes capital of a grant-making charity. In the case of many endowed grant-making trusts, the charity&#039;s governance document specifically makes endowment expendable if required for grant-making.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>In logic therefore, the so-called endowment is obviously part of the reserves. I know of cases where existing regulations, SORP 2005, require such trusts to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_724"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 724</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

post a deficit of several million pounds where in practice it has an endowment of several hundred million pounds on which it can draw to make its grants. If trustees comply with the current legally enforceable practice, they will not be providing a true and fair view of the charity&#039;s financial position.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>A further example of the inappropriateness of the current SORP regime is the regulations concerning endowed trusts or foundations, which in many cases are set up solely to pursue what are defined as &quot;general charitable objects&quot;. In practice, that means that they exist to give grants to other charities. In the latest accounting regulations applying to all UK charities, those charities are required to make a more detailed statement of their activities. However, grant-giving is specifically excluded from the definition of charities. Therefore, current regulations deny trusts in that position the scope to report simply and precisely what they exist to do. There are hundreds of charities in this country giving well over &#163;2 billion together to charity every year. Surely that anomaly&#151;that extraordinary situation&#151;is in itself enough to justify the amendment, which will ensure that in future we are not limited to a single type of statement.

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="51018-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I strongly support the tenor of the amendment. We spent a lot of time earlier in the Bill&#039;s passage trying to decide by what principles the Charity Commission should undertake its general duties. The House will remember that we came up with an amendment that talked about the Charity Commission operating in a proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted way. However, none of that applies to the regulations issued by the Secretary of State under Section 42 of the Charities Act 1993, which is being amended. It seems to me for all the reasons so ably set out by the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord Sainsbury, that we need something very like this amendment. I urge the Government to be sympathetic to it, because it affects every charity of any size and causes huge headache, frustration and extra cost if the SORP regulations are disproportionate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="51018-17_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Caithness: </b>   My Lords, this was discussed at various meetings of the pre-legislative scrutiny committee. I see that there are five of us in your Lordships&#039; Chamber who sat on that committee, so if I am wrong I know that I will be taken to task immediately. Two things in particular struck us: first, the number of small charities&#151;the great proportion of charities are small&#151;and, secondly, the huge difference between a recipient charity and a donor charity. When we came to examine evidence from the Charity Commission and the Home Office, I was not sure that they had fully understood the significance of that. That is why I support my noble friend.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>What my noble friend Lord Sainsbury is of great concern. As a trustee of a heritage charity, I would much prefer to receive my money from a grant-giving charity than from gift aid because, as my noble friend said, there is a continuity there which there is not with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_725"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 725</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

gift aid. With a small charity, fund raising is slightly easier when you know that you can go to certain charities and where their interests are listed in the charity books rather than going to specific donors for gift aid. If, following the logic of what my noble friend said, the SORP regulations and other regulations that have been introduced are reducing the willingness of people who have the ability&#151;thank goodness that this country has people with the ability to create grant-giving trusts&#151;to stop them doing so would be a hugely detrimental step.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>I go back to that evidence that we received. It was not encouraging that there was sufficient flexibility in the commission and the Home Office to take account of those big differences. That is why it is so important to have something like this in the Bill and I support my noble friend&#039;s amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="51018-17_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, for moving the amendment and to other noble Lords&#151;in particular the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury&#151;for their involvement in the debate. The noble Lords speak with great experience, and few, I would wager, have the great experience that the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, has in charity matters. That said, we take a different view. Although I understand the mischief that has been traced down here, we cannot agree with the analysis that is offered, in particular with regard to the way in which the current law operates.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>There are two elements to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. One is his new paragraph (c) of subsection (2), which would allow the Home Secretary&#039;s regulations on the form and content of accounts to prescribe different forms of accounts for different sizes and types of charity. I deal with that matter quickly by saying that it is not necessary. Section 86 of the Charities Act 1993, which applies to all regulations made under the Act, already allows the Home Secretary to make different provision for different cases. Indeed, the current regulations do exactly that, by making different provision for common investment fund charities and for some housing and some educational charities. That element of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment adds nothing to what is already possible in legislation that was enacted by his party&#039;s government back in 1993, when they had the foresight to put in that flexibility.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>The other element of the amendment would, in summary, require the regulations to make only the minimum prescription needed to ensure that the accounts gave &quot;a true and fair view&quot; of the charity&#039;s financial position. That is misconceived. The amendment proposes that the Charities Act 1993 generally requires charities&#039; accounts to give a true and fair view, an expression well known and understood by those in the accountancy trade. However, the Act&#151;I am looking at the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, on the Benches opposite&#151;does not in fact do so. The concept of a true and fair view has no statutory definition.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_726"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 726</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51018-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The amendment would, in the absence of a statutory yardstick for what is a true and fair view, create an unworkable system.  Currently, the Charity Commission and charities and their auditors rely on the methods and principles set out in the statement of recommended practice on charity accounting to provide the interpretation of what true and fair means in the context of charities.  That statement is not part of the law, except to the extent that regulations under the 1993 Act import some specific provisions of it into the law. The amendment could force regulations directly to import a whole raft of further accounting standards into law, which would create problems of interpretation that SORP was designed to solve. Furthermore, the amendment would prevent the regulations requiring disclosures that were relevant to stakeholders or the public interest but were possibly not relevant to the criterion of true and fair. An example might be the disclosure of salaries of a charity&#039;s highest paid employees, in which there was a justified public interest.
</p>

<a name="51018-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>In summary, the amendment would have the opposite of the effect that the noble Lord intends. It seeks to import into the legislation the notion of true and fair in a way that could complicate matters and make the application of SORP more involved. It also seeks to import something into the legislation that is already there, which is the flexibility that the Home Secretary has to vary the form and content of the accounting rules and regulations so far as they apply to different sizes and shapes of charities. For those reasons, I continue to resist the amendment.

<a name="51018-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I invite the Minister to consider the language of, say, sale of goods legislation, which is built around certain broad concepts, of which true and fair is but another example. Is it not one of the virtues of the amendment that it does not go into yards of small print about what true and fair is, but ultimately leaves it to the decision of a court, if the matter gets that far, which of course it rarely would? I invite him to wonder whether the argument that he outlined should not be rewound and played back the other way.

 thinking to it. Anyone who has any corporate experience and has signed off accounts will be perfectly clear on what true and fair is. The phrase is in common use in commercial practice in corporate law and in the preparation of every set of accounts that I have ever signed off. The Government say that they will reject the amendment, despite what we have said about regulatory activities being proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted&#151;that accounts should be prepared to reflect the differing natures and sizes of charities.

<br>
<br>
(1)   Section 79 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 (interpretation of Part 2) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   For subsection (3)(a) substitute&#151;


<br>
&quot;(a)   any reference to a Minister included a reference to the Forestry Commissioners or to the Charity Commission;

(3)   In subsection (4) after &quot;those Commissioners&quot; insert &quot;or that Commission&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_169"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of the amendment is to preserve the position of the Charity Commission under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. Currently, the Charity Commissioners would be regarded as an office-holder under Part 2 of <br>&nbsp;<br>

that Act, which would enable the contracting out of any of their functions which come within Section 69(1) of that Act, where a Minister makes an order providing for such contracting out.
</p>

<a name="51018-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>This provision amends the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to provide that for the purposes of Part 2 of that Act any reference to a Minister includes a reference to the Charity Commission, such that any function of the commission to which Section 69 applies could be contracted out if a Minister by order so provides. However, the commission would not be able to make use of the ministerial order-making powers in Sections 69 and 70 of that Act. So the commission itself would not be able to make an order providing for the contracting out of any of its functions. 
</p>

<a name="51018-19_para2"></a>

<br>
<br>
   Any consultation initiated by the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales before the day on which section 4 of this Act comes into force is to be as effective for the purposes of section 4(4)(a) as if it had been initiated by the Commission on or after that day.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_172"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to move Amendment No. 110 standing in the name of my noble friend Lady Scotland. Under Part 1 of the Bill the new Charity Commission will have a duty to issue guidance in pursuit of its public benefit objective and a duty to carry out such public and other consultation as it considers appropriate and wise before issuing the guidance.
</p>

<a name="51018-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>Our current intention is to bring Part 1 of the Bill together with the provisions creating the new provision into force on the earliest appropriate date. As the Bill is drafted, consultation on the public benefit guidance would not in practice begin before that commencement date. This is because consultation carried out before the new commission comes into existence would not count towards discharging the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_731"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 731</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

new commission&#039;s consultation duty. The practical result of that would be a delay in issuing the public benefit guidance while a valid consultation was constructed and completed. It is clearly desirable that the period between the provisions concerning the public benefit requirement taking effect and the appearance of the commission&#039;s guidance should be as short as possible. This amendment will greatly help in that respect because it will treat any consultation carried out by the current commission before commencement as if it were consultation carried out by the new commission after commencement. I understand from the Charity Commission that it would propose to begin consultation as early as possible.
</p>

<a name="51018-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>In summary, the amendment will allow a head start to be made in the consultation required before the issue of guidance on general public benefit principles applying to all charities, so that it can be issued much sooner after commencement than would otherwise be possible. I am sure that because the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is very keen on this he will support the amendment very enthusiastically. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="51018-19_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am indeed going to support the amendment with enthusiasm so long as I have an assurance that the Government will not have their consultation before this Bill has been through the Commons. We know they have a cast-iron majority there, but I am sure that it would be polite to await the consideration at the other end.
</p>




<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="51018-19_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, my question follows to some extent what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said. I understand the practical implications of this, but there were some fairly weasel words about &quot;earliest appropriate date&quot; and &quot;as early as possible&quot;. Out there in the charity world there is interest in this matter and the timetable the Government expect to work to. Perhaps the Minister could lift the green baize curtain a little and tell us a bit about what the Government have in mind, given the normal sorts of legislative progress, regarding the &quot;earliest appropriate date&quot; for implementation and &quot;as early as possible&quot;, in terms of the commission starting the consultation. Wherever one may stand on that particular issue there is a great deal of interest in what the practical implications of this delightfully introduced Amendment No. 110 would be. So I should be grateful if the Minister could give us some guidance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="51018-19_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the thing is that weasely words have a value, and we all know that. I am not going to hover around and define them further, but basically we want this to go ahead as soon as can get on with it. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, made the point that it ought to be after the clauses have had proper consideration in another place. That is a fair point. I shall see whether I can get some idea from my officials and advisers about what the timetable is and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_732"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 732</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

then let colleagues who are enwrapped by this provision have some idea of how it looks. Perhaps that will satisfy both noble Lords.
</p>




<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="51018-19_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I am grateful for what he said. Will he give the House an assurance that the huge extra task that will be placed on the shoulders of the commission in this regard will be reflected in the available staff resources?
</p>




<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="51018-19_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord knows that I cannot go around interfering in the detailed staffing of the Charity Commission. That would be quite wrong. It is an independent organisation, as the noble Lord well knows. We have had lots of debate about that issue over the past nine months or so. I am sure that the Charity Commission will put the resource required into it because we all understand that this is a very important issue. It has been the subject of public debate. It is new and it will be a real test for those involved in charity work. I am sure that the commission will have heard what the noble Lord said and be taking very careful note of it. I think he is right to encourage it to do so.

&quot;(a)   a single Act, or

<br>
(b)   a group of two or more Acts,&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_181"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is the last group of amendments. I shall speak also to the five other amendments grouped with Amendment No. 112. All the amendments relate to a possible consolidation of charity law. A long time ago, at the beginning of the debates on the Bill, there was a heartfelt plea for consolidation&#151;it was probably made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, who seems to be putting his hand up. It was a popular cause.

</p>

<a name="51018-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>The Bill contains a power to make pre-consolidation amendments of the enactments relating to charities. However, as drafted, it allows for the possibility of only one consolidation Act. Amendments Nos. 112, 114 and 115 allow for the possibility of more than one consolidation Act. We have not decided that we would like to have more than one, and the amendments are not supposed to indicate that that is necessarily our proposed course of action. However, there is at least a possibility that more than one consolidation Act might be desirable; for example, one Act covering public charitable collections and another covering everything else. It is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_733"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 733</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

better to err on the side of caution and to allow for that possibility, ensuring that if more than one consolidation is required the Secretary of State has a power to make pre-consolidation amendments.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Amendment No. 113 is simply a drafting correction suggested by parliamentary counsel, and Amendments Nos. 113 and 116 define more precisely the enactments to which the Secretary of State could make pre-consolidation amendments. Clause 74 already defines the enactments relating to charities in general terms, but we now believe that it would be better to define more precisely which enactments we are talking about. Those two amendments achieve that objective. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_182"></a>
<a name="51018-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, it is nice to respond to the last group of amendments on Report by saying how strongly one supports them, particularly the notion of having various consolidating Acts. The noble Lord is quite right: a public collection is a good example of where a discrete Act might be of benefit to all concerned.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>My only additional point is that the new definition in Amendment No. 116 seems either long-winded or necessary. I think that it is the latter, as the definition in the Bill does not include charities in Scotland but the amendment does. Otherwise, it is a helpful group.

<a name="51018-20_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland) </b>  rose to move, That the rules laid before the House on 27 June be approved [<i>2nd report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the rules insert a new Order 116A into the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) 1980 to support proceedings in the High Court and appeal proceedings in the Court of Appeal under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. It may be helpful if I recap briefly the background to the rules.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>It remains the Government&#039;s view that it is appropriate and necessary that procedures are put in place to protect the nation against the risk of terrorism caused by individuals who are suspected of involvement in terrorist-related activity but who cannot be prosecuted through the criminal courts. However, it is also the Government&#039;s view that it is imperative that such procedures are subject to strict safeguards and consistent with the rule of law and our human rights obligations.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 provides for the making of control orders that impose obligations on individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity. The Act, as noble Lords will recall, draws a distinction between two types of control order: the derogating control order and the non-derogating control order, and there are different judicial procedures in respect of each type of control order. The purpose of this amendment to the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) 1980 is to establish rules to support control order proceedings and relevant appeal proceedings.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>Noble Lords will recall that supreme court rules are usually made by the Northern Ireland Supreme Court Rules Committee, which is the body with statutory responsibility for maintaining those rules. The committee is chaired by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Sir Brian Kerr, and is made up of representatives from the judiciary, barristers and solicitors. Due to the exceptional circumstances in which the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 was passed, it would have been impossible for the Supreme Court Rules Committee to make the relevant changes to the rules of court in the very short period of time originally available. That is why it was necessary to legislate for a special rule-making procedure under paragraph 3 of the schedule to the Prevention of Terrorism Act authorising the Lord Chancellor to make rules on the first occasion after the Act was passed, instead of the Supreme Court Rules Committee. This mirrored the approach taken in England and Wales whereby the relevant civil procedure rules were made by the Lord Chancellor as opposed to the civil procedure rules committee.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>The Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland was informed before the introduction of the Bill of the need for a special procedure to make the first set of rules. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_735"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 735</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, made the first set of rules, but the Supreme Court Rules Committee may make any subsequent rules or amendments as and when necessary. Rules made by the Supreme Court Rules Committee will be subject to the normal requirements of the Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978, including the negative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>The Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) (Amendment No. 4) 2005 introduce a new Order 116A to the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) 1980. The new rules in Order 116A are based on the general principle that the existing provisions of the Rules of the Supreme Court relating to applications and appeals in general should apply to control order proceedings and appeals subject to any necessary modifications as set out in Order 116A.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>The order is divided into five parts. Part I deals with the scope of the order, the interpretation of terms used, and necessary modification of the overriding objective of the Rules of the Supreme Court, to ensure that sensitive information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest. It has been modified for the purposes of the new order by placing a new duty on the court to ensure that information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest and by requiring the overriding objective to be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with that duty.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Part II deals with applications to the High Court relating to derogating control orders. Part III deals with leave applications, references and appeals to the High Court relating to non-derogating control orders. Part IV deals with onward appeals to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal. Part V contains general provisions that apply to all proceedings in the High Court and Court of Appeal brought under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. This includes provision in Rules 25 to 28 for closed hearings and the use of special advocates.
</p>

<a name="51018-20_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>Finally, Part V also includes provisions in Rules 30 to 32 which require the Secretary of State to disclose to the court all the material available to him and which is relevant to the matter under consideration. The Secretary of State must also disclose all such material to the other party,. except where the court permits him to withhold material on the grounds that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. If the Secretary of State withholds material from the other party without the permission of the court, the court may prevent the Secretary of State from relying on such material himself, or it may withdraw the matter from its consideration. These rules reflect the requirements of paragraph 4(3) of the schedule to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which was inserted by an amendment to the Bill to meet concerns about the need to establish a procedure for the disclosure of exculpatory material.


</p>

<a name="51018-20_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>That is an outline of the substantive provisions of the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) (Amendment No. 4) 2005.

<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="51018-21_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for introducing the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland). But once again we are in the position of having to retrospectively agree to new rules because there was not time to obtain the approval of both Houses before the Recess. The explanation, of course, is that there were post-election difficulties establishing the new membership of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. So the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor used his power to bring them in.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>That having been said, we on these Benches are able to support Part II of the schedule. Indeed, we supported the Government on this part of the Bill when it was going through Parliament. The difficulties arise in Part III on the making of non-derogating control orders. I am sure that noble Lords will remember the all-night Sitting, although there are not many of them here today. We took on the issue of the Secretary of State having the power to make control orders. We believed then, as we do now, that the decision to impose a control order should in all circumstances be a judicial one, made in accordance with due process and with the necessary safeguards and guarantees against injustice.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>It is the perception of injustice which will inflame communities and increase the danger of creating more terrorists than we can control, either by imprisonment or by these orders. We are in an almost impossible position whereby we find that we do not object to the content of the rules but find the process of dealing with the reasoning and legislation behind them completely inappropriate.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>We are hamstrung by the process in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 which enables the Secretary of State to take away someone&#039;s liberty whether or not he or she is a British citizen. We will be told, I am sure, that the use of judicial review will counteract the need to concern ourselves overmuch with that process. But that will be a matter of seeing whether the Secretary of State has undertaken his duties properly according to law. Judicial review will not address the problems of deciding cases on their merits. Perhaps the Minister is able to tell us what the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has said about the rules. Has the Police Service of Northern Ireland been consulted? How are the orders to be enforced? Is it envisaged that the police will need extra resources to enable them to carry out those orders? How will the special advocates that the noble Baroness spoke about be chosen?
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>We are still struggling with too much direct rule by feat. We all long for the Northern Ireland Assembly to be up and running as soon as possible so that the people of Northern Ireland can have their own voices heard in these matters and that they will be able to scrutinise their own legislation. Until that happy day, however, we must soldier on of course, but we had been led to believe that the Northern Ireland Office would come up with rather more substantive <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_737"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 737</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proposals for improving Northern Ireland scrutiny. While some very small improvements have been made&#151;such as giving us advance notice of draft orders which are to come before us, for which we are grateful&#151;that is not really very much help.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a> Liberal Democrats have made proposals before, one of which was using the MLAs as a prelegislative scrutiny body, pending the reconvening of devolved institutions. But Her Majesty&#039;s Government, I am afraid, pooh-poohed that. We believe that at least that was an imaginative proposal. Why can the NIO not show imagination and come up with significant improvements? It is very discouraging. I once again urge the noble Baroness to come forward, or to speak to her Northern Ireland Office colleagues, with serious and workable proposals which will show goodwill and ensure that the people of Northern Ireland see that we are scrutinising their legislation with the same depth in which we undertake any legislation in this House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="51018-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland)(Amendment No. 3) Order 2005 incorporates Order 116A into the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) 1980. The order sets out special procedures for court proceedings under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. This House has already discussed the Civil Procedure (Amendment No. 2) Rules which introduced a new Part 76 into the Civil Procedure Rules. The concerns that we expressed at the time of the debate on those rules apply equally to this order.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>We are extremely surprised at the delay in bringing the measures forward. The Prevention of Terrorism Act and the special procedures for court proceedings and appeals relating to control orders were made on 14 March 2005. Why has there been a delay of almost seven months before bringing this statutory instrument forward? How has the Act been applied to Northern Ireland in the interim?
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Then there is the matter of new Rule 2 which deals with the overriding objective. The essence of the overriding objective is that cases should be dealt with justly. That is the cornerstone of our civil procedure rules, and it is crucial to the administration of justice that that should remain the case, despite the temptation to derogate in the fight against terrorism.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I understand that the Minister in the other place has had several helpful discussions with my colleagues there; but we remain unconvinced of the need for a new Rule 2 in new Order 116A. It provides that,
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>&quot;the overriding objective . . . must be read . . . in a way which is compatible&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>with the court&#039;s duty to ensure that,
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>In effect, that gives Rule 3 precedence over the overriding objective. The reasoning behind the overriding objective not being disapplied&#151;that it is merely subject to the court&#039;s duty to ensure that information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest&#151;cannot disguise the fact that the overriding objective is capable of being overridden. Ensuring that information is not disclosed contrary to the public <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_738"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 738</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

interest can be achieved without making the overriding objective subject to the provisions in new Rule 2(1) in new Order 116A. No doubt many documents relating to other cases are withheld in the interests of national security and so on; but I would have thought it unnecessary to set the dangerous precedent of usurping the overriding objective.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>We also have concerns about new Rule 24(2)(c) which provides that no hearing would be required for an appeal where the controlled person is not represented and when he or she is,
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;outside the United Kingdom or it is impracticable to give him notice of a hearing&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>We feel that the exception to the requirement for a hearing is unnecessarily broad. Will the Government clarify the intended use of this provision? Would not an unrepresented person be the person most in need of a hearing? The proceedings will in any case be rather one-sided, with in-camera meetings, secret evidence and special advocates. Would it not be prudent to give the controlled person at the very least the reassurance of a hearing, rather than provide an excuse not to have one because it is impractical?
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Our last concern is the use of special advocates. New rule 27 lists the functions of special advocates. Will the Minister clarify whether the specific functions that are listed are exhaustive? If so, should the list be widened to permit further scope to represent the subject of the order&#039;s interests as the use of special advocates becomes increasingly refined? Will the Minister tell us about the Government&#039;s progress in reviewing the use of special advocates and striving to find a more acceptable model?
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>We remain concerned that the rules may add further injustices to the existing problems in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 regarding the infringement of civil liberties. We look to the Government to provide us with reassurances that that is not the case.
</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="51018-21_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness and to the noble Lord for their comments and I will endeavour to deal with the questions that they have raised. I will agree to disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, on the background to the issues. I also remember the all-night sitting. It was an important debate. I am grateful that, in raising some of the broader issues, the noble Baroness is not saying that what I am bringing forward today is something with which she could fundamentally disagree.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>I know that the noble Baroness is interested in the issue of enforcement. A breach of the control order would be a criminal offence to be dealt with in the same manner as any other criminal offence. I am not aware of any formal consultation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, but if the noble Baroness recalls, Section 8 of the Act obliges the Secretary of State to consult with the Chief Constable about whether there is any evidence available that could be used for the purposes of prosecuting the individual in question for a terrorism-related offence. In addition, if the Secretary of State proceeds to make a control order, he <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_739"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 739</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

must inform the chief constable that he has done so and the chief constable will then be under a duty to ensure that the conduct of the individual in question is kept under review throughout the period during which the control order has effect, with a view to bringing a prosecution for a terrorism-related offence.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>The noble Baroness also asked whether we had consulted the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Normally, as she knows, we would seek the comments of that commission, but given the exceptional and urgent manner in which the rules were made, I understand that such consultation was not possible in this particular case.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about the special advocates. She will know that the special advocates are currently drawn from the Attorney-General&#039;s panel of senior counsel. It is envisaged that that will remain the case for the foreseeable future, which I hope addresses that particular point.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised the question of the delay in the rules being brought before the House. As noble Lords will know, the rules were originally made by the Lord Chancellor in consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland on 5 April 2005, shortly after the Act received Royal Assent. The rules came into force immediately after being made, but ceased to have effect 40 days thereafter as a result of not having been approved by Parliament within the affirmative resolution period. The reason for the delay was largely because the general election intervened and, as the noble Baroness said, there was a subsequent delay in establishing the membership of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which must consider the rules before they can be considered by this House.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>However, the Lord Chancellor used his powers under paragraph 3 (6) of the Schedule to the Act to make the rules again on 26 June 2005 and it is these rules that I now move before the House, this being the earliest opportunity to do so after the Summer Recess. I understand that the Summer Recess does not count for the purposes of the 40 days, in case noble Lords&#151;as I did&#151;added the days up and found that there were too many.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The controls were continuous over the period between the first set of rules that were made by the Lord Chancellor having ceased to have effect and the present set of rules coming into operation. The first set of rules ceased to have effect when the requisite 40-day affirmative resolution period expired on 26 June 2005. The present set of rules were made on 26 of June 2005, came into operation on 27 June and, in accordance with Section 4(A) of the Interpretation Act 1978, came into force at the beginning of 27 June 2005, the previous ones having expired at 12 o&#039;clock midnight on 26 June. Consequently, there was no gap in the provision made by the first and the second set of rules.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_740"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column 740</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51018-21_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, specifically asked about the disapplication of certain parts of the principal rules. Due to the nature of these proceedings, it was considered that it was appropriate to make some modifications to the application of the principal rules. However, we believe that they are limited to what is considered to be necessary. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, Order 1, Rule 1A, the overriding objective, is amended so that it is subject to Order 116A, Rule 2(1). The overriding objective is to enable the courts to deal with cases justly, which includes, among other matters, ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing, dealing with cases in a way that is proportionate, expeditious and fair, and allotting each case an appropriate share of the court&#039;s resources.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Although proceedings under the 2005 Act should be subject to the overriding objective, such cases are based on sensitive intelligence material. Of course, it is important to ensure that information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest. Therefore, for that reason, the overriding objective has been modified for the purposes of the new order by placing on the court a duty to ensure that information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest and requiring that the overriding objective be read and given effect in a way that is compatible with that duty.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also asked me about the new Rule 24(2)(c). The intention of that rule is to prevent the court being required to hold a hearing when that would serve no purpose. However, it does not fetter the court&#039;s discretion to hold a hearing in any case in which it considers it appropriate to do so. Moreover, the exercise of that discretion will be subject to the overriding objective to deal with cases justly and, of course, in accordance with the rights protected by the Human Rights Act 1998; in particular Article 6, the right to a fair trial.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>Finally, the noble Lord asked about special advocates. It will be a matter for the Northern Ireland Supreme Court Rules Committee to make any further amendments to the rules, which will include a list of the functions of special advocates. It will make those rules in the usual way, subject to the requirements of the 1978 Act, by negative resolution procedure. Noble Lords will know that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, is involved in a review, which I gather will report at the end of this year or the beginning of next, to facilitate his observations becoming part of any further legislation that the Government may wish to take forward.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>I hope that I have answered all the questions that have been raised. Accordingly, I commend the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) (Amendment No. 4) 2005 to the House.
</p>

<a name="51018-21_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.

<a name="51018-22_spmin0"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees  (Baroness Turner of Camden): </b>  Before I put the Question that the Title be postponed, may I remind your Lordships of two points of procedure? Noble Lords will speak standing and the House is agreed that there shall be no Divisions in Grand Committee. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn. If there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting, the Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division Bells are rung and resume after 10 minutes.

<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51018-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 12, line 6, leave out &quot;to be regarded as&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>The noble Lord said: Before I discuss the first group of amendments, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Evans, for his detailed but somewhat critical letter following Second Reading on 14 June. I think that the Minister felt that some speakers in that debate raised points that had already been dealt with at our meeting with Ministers. I must tell him, although he will already know, that discussions outside the debate on the Floor of the House do not have the same standing as on-the-record comments made in <i>Hansard</i>. I therefore hope that he will forgive me if I cover what the Government and the Assembly may consider old ground, because it may be new to others who read our proceedings. We must also bear in mind that the Bill has been introduced in your Lordships&#039; House and that our comments may be helpful when it is considered by the Members of the other place. I also thank the Minister for his most recent letter and comments on the latest batch of government amendments.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Luke, are simple drafting amendments that aim at clarifying the independence of the commissioner. We have been told all along that the commissioner is to be independent, separate from political parties and, as such, he or she is to be objective and impartial. Indeed, paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 1 insists that the commissioner is a corporation sole. Why, then, did those who drafted the Bill feel it necessary to include the words, &quot;to be regarded as&quot; in sub-paragraphs (2) and (3)? If the commissioner is independent, surely the provision <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC182"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC182</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should read, &quot;The Commissioner is not the servant or agent of the Crown&quot;, and, &quot;The Commissioner&#039;s property is not the property of the Crown&quot;, not, &quot;The Commissioner is not to be regarded as the servant or agent of the Crown&quot;. That wording suggests that he is, but that we should ignore that. Perhaps it is just my grip, but in legislation I always prefer to be simple where we can. These two amendments remove the offending words &quot;to be regarded as&quot; in both cases.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Amendment No. 9, which is grouped, is also aimed at tightening the wording of the Bill. It limits the commissioner, who may appoint such other staff as he thinks necessary for assisting him in the discharge of his functions, to doing so only within limits set by regulation. I believe that I am correct to say that, at the moment, the commissioner is expected to work with a similar number of staff as the Children&#039;s Commissioner&#151;so about 30 individuals. What assessment has been made of the efficiency and effectiveness of that number of staff for the Children&#039;s Commissioner? Is that a proper figure? If the age is dropped to 50 for older people in Wales, do the Government anticipate that the commissioner will need more staff? That may occur if we follow the lines laid down in England. Apart from administrative support, what sort of staff does the Minister envisage that the commissioner will need? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51018-22_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   First, I, too, thank the Minister for the information that he provided about the Bill. It has been useful and he has, to some extent, taken notice of previous debates. As we progress with the Bill, it is clear that it has been rounded off somewhat in its scope by government amendments. I do not agree with them all, but a substantial number of them clarify the situation.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>As far as these amendments are concerned, from our point of view the rewording&#151;particularly with regard to the removal of the words &quot;to be regarded as&quot; from these parts of the schedule&#151;is acceptable. However, an interesting situation may arise later on. From what I read in the <i>Better Governance for Wales</i> White Paper, produced by the Government, the situation may alter in the future if Ministers in the Assembly become responsible agents of the Crown. That seems to be one of the proposals which will pass down if the paper that has been produced is translated into a Bill and, indeed, into an Act of Parliament. It is an interesting situation. However, as matters stand at the moment, with the settlement that was made in 1998&#150;99 after the referendum, this change of wording is certainly appropriate in the current situation.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Amendment No. 2 is similarly applicable. There is a question of course in regard to the financing by the Welsh Assembly Government of this property. This clearly will come out of the block grant which the Assembly receives. Indeed, the Assembly will fund the Office of the Commissioner for Older People in Wales. If the wording is left as it is in the Bill compared to the way in which the amendment is put, there may be financial implications. I merely put that as an observation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51018-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>As to Amendment No. 9, the wording &quot;within limits set by regulations&quot; is certainly all right as far as we are concerned; it seems to make a great deal of sense. At later stages in the Bill, I am sure that we will discuss the issue of regulations. As I understand it&#151;perhaps the Minister will confirm this&#151;the regulations are to be set by the Assembly through statutory instruments, which, of course, is secondary legislation. However, it will be interesting to know whether the Government here in Westminster will set any regulations at all. As an ardent devolutionist, I believe that they should be set by the Assembly. But we shall see how the Minister treats that suggestion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51018-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   I accept the gentle and elegant rebuke of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts. He is, of course, absolutely right that information given in a private setting is quite different from statements that are recorded in <i>Hansard</i>. I absolutely accept that.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Before I speak to the amendments I should like to say a few words in general. Once again I express my gratitude for the understanding which noble Lords on all sides of the Committee have shown on the matter of the timing of the Bill. As I explained during Second Reading, the early introduction of the Bill meant that it was not as polished or complete as we would normally expect and that the Government would therefore be bringing forward a considerable number of amendments. That is what we have done. I tabled these amendments on 14 September, and on 15 September I wrote to noble Lords with an interest in the Bill explaining in detail the amendments and our reasons for tabling them. I placed a copy of the letter in the Library and I hope that it has proved helpful in preparing for today&#039;s debate.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>As the Committee is aware, the Assembly undertook an extensive public consultation on the draft Bill earlier this year. More than 1,700 organisations and individuals were consulted, and in total 98 responses were received. These responses contained 64 recommendations on the content of the Bill. However, after careful consideration it was decided that only two of them would be accepted. These are now before the Committee as government Amendments Nos. 36 and 50. While the remaining recommendations were quite legitimate, the Assembly&#039;s view, shared by the Government, was that 27 were already provided for in the Bill and the remaining 29 conflicted with its policy intentions.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>I wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, on 13 October, setting out in detail the Government&#039;s position in response to the specific recommendations contained in the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which he chairs, which were published on 30 June. However, I have previously set out the Government&#039;s position on these two matters in my letter of 15 September; it appears in the government amendments and my response to the Select Committee on the Constitution on 30 June. Both gave an outline of the rationale for our approach on the appointment of the commissioner and on the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

examination of cases. I hope that those introductory remarks will be helpful as we spend at least two days discussing the Bill in Committee.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 9, which stand in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy and Lord Luke, concern the commissioner&#039;s operational independence. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 seek to amend paragraph (1) of Schedule 1. We believe that they inadvertently introduce an element of uncertainty about that operational independence where it is important that none should exist. Subparagraphs (2) and (3) of Schedule 1(1) provide that the commissioner is not to be regarded as an agent or servant of the Crown and that his property is not to be regarded as the property of the Crown. As the commissioner will not be a servant of the Crown, nor will his property be the property of the Crown, a statement to this effect is not necessary. However, it may be possible for the commissioner or his property to be treated as such. It is this circumstance that the provision seeks to prevent. So, in our submission, Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 would not add to the provisions in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Amendment No. 9 would enable the Assembly to make regulations limiting the number of staff that the commissioner can appoint. The Assembly considers that this would interfere with the independence of the commissioner, and the Government accept that view. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked whether 30 members of staff were enough, given the demographics in Wales. Obviously, the Assembly will be keeping a close eye on that, but at the moment we feel that the staffing levels we have suggested are correct. In any case, it would be an almost impossible task for the Assembly to pre-judge at what level any limit should be set. Furthermore, the commissioner will only be able to employ such staff as is affordable from within his overall budget, which will be agreed annually with the Welsh Assembly Government.
</p>

<a name="51018-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>An integral part of running an independent office is the assessment of what is an appropriate level of staffing to carry out the functions conferred and to fulfil an agreed programme of work. Given my explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51018-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   The noble Lord has given us the assurance that we need on the independence of the commissioner, and I am perfectly content to withdraw Amendment No. 1 and not to press Amendment No. 2. He has also asserted the importance of the independence of the commissioner with regard to staffing, the point covered by Amendment No. 9. I am sure that the noble Lord shares our concern about the tendency towards increased bureaucracy; we would not wish, as I do not think he would, to see an undue and exceptional high level of bureaucracy invading the office of the commissioner for the elderly in Wales. Having made that point, which I am sure will be looked at by the Assembly on an annual basis and before the commissioner starts his work and is in the process of engaging staff, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para0"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51018-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy </b>   moved Amendment No. 3:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>Page 12, line 12, after &quot;appointment&quot; insert &quot;and re-appointment&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 3 and 5 aim to probe the Minister with regard to the term of office of the commissioner. Like those consulted, I agree that it is necessary to find a careful balance between the term of office being of a sufficient length of time that the commissioner can build up expertise and experience and put in place a suitable agenda of work and the term of office being too long, which would result in lost opportunities if the commissioner&#039;s skills failed to match the priorities of the job. The Minister will explain that the advisory group held a public consultation on this matter and that 59 per cent of respondents opted for a four-year term, renewable once. My ideal would have been a five-year term, renewable once, so we are not so far apart. However, the Government have failed to put that measure in the Bill. Is that because they do not intend to stick to the results of the consultation? As I said, I personally believe that five years would be a better time scale; hence the use of the figure in my amendment. Could the Minister inform me whether five years was given as an option in consultation?
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Amendment No. 3 would insert the words &quot;and re-appointment&quot; into paragraph 2(a) of Schedule 1. At the moment, regulations may make provisions about the appointment of the commissioner, but not reappointment. As consultation and past examples of commissioners, chairmanships and other committee leaderships all support reappointment of short terms, such an indication should be clarified in primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Amendment No. 5 inserts the words &quot;initial five-year&quot; into paragraph (2)(b) of Schedule 1, tightening the ability of the regulations to make provisions as to the initial five-year term of office of the commissioner rather than the broader option of the term of office. Throughout the passage of the Bill we have expressed concerns with regard to the Henry VIII powers in regulations. As the Select Committee on the Constitution said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;the use of framework legislation and Henry VIII powers is to be avoided, and when necessary should be hedged with appropriate safeguards&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>I would feel a lot happier with this narrower remit of regulations with regard to the term of office and for the clarification that it brings with regard to the length of office in the Bill. We may well argue about what the length of time should be, but I hope that the Minister will agree that it is something simple that should be incorporated. If I remember correctly, we have incorporated a term of office for the Children&#039;s Commissioner, and there is no real reason why we should not do it here.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Amendment No. 4 is a simple drafting amendment. Once again the Bill team and I are at odds on a small technical matter. The amendment substitutes <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC186"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC186</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&quot;fulfilled&quot; in paragraph (2)(a) for &quot;met to qualify&quot; with regard to the conditions that the potential commissioner will need to meet to be appointed. Will the Minister explain the details of the proposed model of appointment for the older people&#039;s commissioner, especially for those who are not aware of the model being used for the children&#039;s commissioner? Will he confirm that the regulations regarding the appointment will be subject to public consultation in Wales and that the appointment will be made within the Cabinet Office&#039;s public appointments process?
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The Assembly Government&#039;s commissioner advisory group recommended that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;the appointment process should ensure that the successful candidate has a real understanding of, and empathy with, older people in Wales; and it should meaningfully involve older people in the selection&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Will the Minister explain how older people will be meaningfully involved in the selection process?
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Amendment No. 8 aims to probe exactly what &quot;gratuities&quot;, on top of the pensions, the Assembly envisages it must pay to a commissioner once he or she has ceased to hold office. The amendment removes the option to pay gratuities from paragraph (3)(2)(a) of Schedule 1. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51018-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   The question of reappointment in Amendment No. 3 is perfectly acceptable. Whether there will be a reappointment is, of course, up to the Assembly and anyway opens the door for the possibility of a reappointment. Amendment No. 4, which substitutes &quot;met to qualify&quot; for &quot;fulfilled&quot;, seems a little esoteric, but it will none the less tighten up the Bill and we do not object to that.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Regarding Amendment No. 5, I was looking around for the word &quot;first&quot;. Perhaps my copy of the Bill does not include it, but perhaps the Minister can correct me. However, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, that an initial five-year term would be a sensible period. We have no objection to that.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Obviously, regarding Amendment No. 8 and the question of gratuities, if the commissioner is to receive a decent pension, the word &quot;gratuities&quot; does not seem to be relevant. We would need a powerful explanation of what that word means to be convinced that it was acceptable. After all, most public servants receive a worthwhile pension and we see no need for the word &quot;gratuities&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51018-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   I want to comment on the Henry VIII clauses and on the report on the Bill of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Select Committee. The members of the committee concluded that they were not too concerned about the Henry VIII powers in Clauses 4(1), 6, 7(1) and 7(6). However, they did express some unease about paragraph 2 of Schedule 1, and these amendments address that paragraph. I have read the letter sent by the Minister to the chairman of the Select Committee and I am grateful to have sight of it. It is very helpful, so far as it goes. Has the Minister received a response from the Select Committee? If not, I suggest that this may be a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC187"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

matter to which we shall have to return after the Select Committee has offered a view on the letter of 13 October 2005.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51018-23_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   In responding to Amendment No. 3, I propose to speak to Amendment No. 5 before turning to Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 8, all of which, as we now know, concern the appointment and tenure of the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Amendment No. 5, proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, would provide in the Bill a requirement that the initial term of office of the commissioner is for a period of five years. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 empowers the Assembly to make regulations concerning the appointment and term of office of the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>At this point, I should refer back to the Second Reading debate on the Bill. In a reply to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, I indicated that an amendment along the lines of the one that he has subsequently brought forward, setting out a term of office in the Bill, may be acceptable to the Government. I was speaking out of turn. I was reprimanded afterwards for saying that because, of course, the decision on the length of the term should be for the Assembly and not for me as the spokesman for Wales here in the House of Lords. It is properly a matter for the Assembly to determine the appropriate term of office for the commissioner in the light of circumstances in Wales.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government&#039;s Advisory Group considered in some depth the issue of the length of the term of office of the commissioner. In its report, it concluded that it would be important for the term of office to be of sufficient length for the commissioner to be able to build up expertise and experience, which would enable him or her to put in place a considered agenda of work. The group also felt that too long a term of office might mean a loss of opportunities to ensure that the commissioner&#039;s skills and expertise continued to match the priorities of the job.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Public consultation took place on a range of options for the term of office, but there was a majority of 59 per cent in favour of a four-year term, renewable once. I understand that the Assembly Government&#039;s intention, therefore, is that that is what will be specified in the regulations.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>The other difficulty with the amendment is that it refers to an initial period of office of the commissioner. If accepted, that would prevent the Assembly making regulations about any subsequent terms of office. The clause as drafted provides for the Assembly to make regulations about the appointment of the commissioner, explicit within which is the possibility of reappointment. We argue that Amendment No. 3 is therefore unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>We have carefully considered Amendment No. 4, which seeks to provide that the appointment regulations under paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 may include any conditions to be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;met to qualify for appointment&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC188"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC188</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51018-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>rather than &quot;fulfilled for appointment&quot;. However, we have concluded that that is just another way of saying the same thing and that it does not add to the existing provision.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 8, which amends paragraph 3 of Schedule 1. It seeks to remove from the Bill a provision that obliges the Assembly to pay gratuities to an outgoing commissioner in accordance with the terms of his appointment. Noble Lords may, like me, have wondered whether this gratuity would be the equivalent of a tip left in a restaurant. However, in the Bill it is understood to cover payments, such as a retirement lump sum for early retirement through ill health.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I have already said that as an overarching principle we think the Assembly is the appropriate body to determine the commissioner&#039;s terms of appointment, including whether to provide for any such payments. We share the Assembly&#039;s view that the Bill should require it to comply with the terms that it has agreed at the time of the commissioner&#039;s appointment, and that is the purpose of including this phrase here.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I shall deal with one or two points made by noble Lords in the discussion of these amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, asked why a narrow remit could not be set in terms of what is left of secondary legislation. A matter is left to be dealt with in regulations because it is considered appropriate by the Assembly and the Government, given devolution and the Assembly&#039;s procedure for secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The noble Lord also asked by what process the appointment will be made. This is a matter for the Assembly to determine through regulations. I understand that the Assembly government intends to use a process based on that used for the appointment of the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales, and that the appointment was made in accordance with the Assembly&#039;s code of practice for public appointments. It is envisaged that regulations will specify the process by which both the Assembly and older people themselves will participate in the selection process for the post of commissioner. This may include the establishment of a sifting panel, with significant representation from older people and those who work with and for them.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>A question was also asked about what sort of gratuities we envisage the commissioner might receive. As we have already said, we do not mean tips in restaurants, but payments that may be made to the commissioner by the Assembly in addition to his or her pension. This may include any enhanced pension payments or payments into any other schemes, as may have been provided for under the terms of his appointment. Parallel provision about gratuities is made in both the Public Services Ombudsman (Wales) Act 2005 and the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales Act 2001. It is an absolutely standard provision.
</p>

<a name="51018-23_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>My noble friend Lord Prys-Davies asks whether we have received a response from the Select Committee on the Constitution. There has not yet been a response, but when we get one we will immediately pass it to <br>&nbsp;<br>

interested Members on all sides and put it in the Library. I am sure we will return to the discussion of it at the next stage of our deliberations. In the light of my explanations, I hope the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendments.

<a name="51018-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for his support on this issue of appointment and reappointment. It seems a little odd to us that we dealt with the appointment and reappointment of the Children&#039;s Commissioner quite satisfactorily, as far as we know, but, when it comes to this commissioner for the elderly, a different regime is to apply. While we understand that he is an appointee of the Assembly, and therefore it is arguable that they should control his appointment and re-appointment, all this nevertheless takes time. It will be quite a complex process, and I am sure there will be further arguments within the Assembly as to the appropriate length of time. Whether the length of time is in fact a suitable subject for consultation, and one on which you accept the result of consultation, is a moot point. All kinds of factors will feature in the appointment and reappointment.


</p>

<a name="51018-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Nevertheless, this way of dealing with the appointment and reappointment of a commissioner in primary legislation, as opposed to how dealt with the Children&#039;s Commissioner, is a harbinger of things to come, because this way of dealing with it was anticipated in the Government&#039;s White Paper <i>Better Governance for WalesI. </i>The Government&#039;s intention is clearly to give more extensive powers of that kind to the Assembly. I am not sure that the Houses of Parliament will be content with that, given all the Henry VIII clauses that it involves. Henry VIII clauses are not popular with legislators in this Parliament, and rightly so. Nevertheless, this is a major issue that will be heavily discussed in the not-too-distant future when we see the pattern of further devolution legislation.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation on the gratuities issue and I am sorry that his promise to me at Second Reading appeared to be a transgression in the eyes of others; to me, he has never transgressed and is always the perfect Minister with whom we are accustomed to dealing. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_13"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 6 inserts a new provision regarding the relevant organisations with whom the commissioner shall co-operate for the avoidance of duplication of functions. Page 12 does not give sufficient information and this amendment is to avoid duplication. We want to ensure that there is no room for awkward things to happen. We note, in particular, that the equality commissioner, for <br>&nbsp;<br>

example, is not listed in Schedule 2, although we have tabled an amendment to put that right, and we hope that there will not be any confusion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51018-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   Before addressing the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, I hope that he will forgive me if I first speak to government Amendments Nos. 100, 101, 105 and 10 in that order.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I gave notice at Second Reading that the Government intended to table amendments to clarify the commissioner&#039;s ability to work jointly with other commissioners and ombudsmen to avoid unnecessary duplication and to enable the commissioner to share information with them.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 100 and 101 are the first&#151;indeed the central&#151;amendments that we propose to address the policy intention that the commissioner should be able to work jointly with other commissioners and ombudsmen where there is an overlap in their jurisdiction and they are both &quot;investigating&quot; or &quot;considering whether to investigate&quot; a particular case. The commissioner should also be able to work collaboratively with other commissioners and ombudsmen where there is no overlap in their jurisdiction but where a case raises matters that should be the subject of investigation by both office-holders.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>I wrote to noble Lords on 15 September in some detail, explaining our reasons for introducing the amendments, and placed a copy of my letter in the Library. In view of that, I do not propose to speak at length about the amendments now. As a consequence of the amendments brought forward on joint and collaborative working, the Government have also reflected upon Clause 15, to which we propose Amendment No. 105. Its purpose is to enable the Assembly to be specific about which functions of another body should be prescribed for the purposes of Clause 15, rather than prescribing all the functions of that body. Therefore, for example, the commissioner could be prevented from issuing guidance on best practice if this were also a function of another body and that function were prescribed for the purposes of this clause. In this way, although he would be prevented from duplicating the function of issuing guidance on best practice, the commissioner could still co-operate with the other body in relation to other functions where their jurisdictions overlapped.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I turn next to Amendment No. 10. This also has arisen from the Government&#039;s amendments on joint working and collaborative working and is intended to provide the commissioner with a greater degree of flexibility in the way he carries out his remit. It enables the commissioner to delegate his functions to any person and not only to members of his staff. This would allow, for example, for the reasonable delegation of the commissioner&#039;s functions, by the commissioner, to other commissioners and ombudsmen.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Finally, with apologies, I turn to Amendments Nos. 106 and 6, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth. Amendment No. 106 seeks to list, or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC191"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC191</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&quot;prescribe&quot;, in Clause 15 four persons whose functions the commissioner is specifically prevented from duplicating. However, once a person has been prescribed, to the extent that the commissioner&#039;s functions overlap with those of the prescribed person, the commissioner would be prevented from acting in that area. For example, the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales is prescribed in this amendment and the effect would be to prevent the commissioner discharging any function that could also be discharged by the PSOW. However, it is possible that an older person in Wales could present a case that involved issues that were relevant to both the PSOW and the commissioner. In practice, identifying which functions overlap may be difficult. However, by removing the commissioner&#039;s power to act, the amendment could prevent the commissioner working with the PSOW and taking action where that would be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>We believe that the government amendments that we have proposed on joint working and collaborative working offer a preferable mechanism for dealing with potential duplication between the commissioner and the bodies listed in the amendment. Clause 15(2) will, however, still provide the Assembly with the flexibility to deal with situations where there is an overlap and it is considered appropriate to restrict the commissioner&#039;s remit.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 6, standing in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Livsey of Talgarth and Lord Roberts of Llandudno, seeks to provide for regulations that list specific organisations with whom the commissioner must co-operate to avoid any duplication of functions. Although it is not specified in the amendment, it appears to be intended that that should relate to the exercise of any of the functions of the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Although the commissioner would almost certainly want to work with other organisations and draw on their expertise in exercising his general functions and issuing guidance, we do not consider it appropriate or necessary to place a duty on him to do so. Paragraph 19 of Schedule 1 states that, subject to any directions given by the Assembly, the commissioner may do anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of his functions. The commissioner would certainly be able to use this power to co-operate with others in the course of discharging his functions, but we consider that to place him under a duty to co-operate with certain specified organisations in all circumstances would fetter his discretion and could be seen as detracting from the commissioner&#039;s independence.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>We have already brought forward amendments on joint and collaborative working that will ensure that duplication of functions with other organisations is minimised. Beyond that, we consider that it should be up to the commissioner to decide how and with whom he wishes to co-operate.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>We think that these government amendments provide a comprehensive and reasonable approach to the issue of working with other ombudsmen and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC192"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC192</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

commissioners and avoiding duplication. I hope that Members of the Committee will agree with me and I ask the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="51018-24_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   Amendment No. 6 raises a very important issue&#151;namely, how the commissioner will work with the commission currently being set up by the Equality Bill and, indeed, other organisations. There is a clear need to avoid duplication&#151;I was glad to hear the Minister stress that&#151;and to ensure efficient and effective co-operation between the commissioner and other offices.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>In areas where there is crossover, it needs to be clear who has the final say&#151;who is, effectively, top of the pile in different projects. Otherwise, we may end up with a tricky situation where different organisations suggest different courses of action. If that is the case, whose decision should the service providers adhere to? For example, with regard to the issue of old age and employment, we have already discussed the differences between the more proactive <i>Opportunity Age</i> document for England and the reactive <i>Strategy for Older People in Wales</i>. We know that both the Equality Commissioner and the Commissioner for Older People will have employment within their remits. So it is very important that the ground rules for co-operation should be clearly established.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Once again, I congratulate the Minister on addressing in his amendment the issue of great concern on these Benches during Second Reading. It is vital that the commissioner should be able to work with other commissioners and ombudsmen in circumstances where their functions overlap and meet. We hope that joined-up government at all levels will lead to the effective and efficient production of services for all, with a lack of duplication and bureaucratic red tape. We support initiatives that will enable government to be small but effective. It will be very important to clarify in joint or multi-working situations who has the final say on decisions, should there be disagreement, and I hope that the noble Lord can shed a little more light on that issue.
</p>

<a name="51018-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I would welcome clarification on Amendment No. 106 regarding who a &quot;prescribed person&quot; includes, and whether the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, is complete, or whether others associated with those officers could be considered to be prescribed individuals.

<a name="51018-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I thank the Minister for his response. In no way was I trying to sabotage Amendment No. 100, which refers specifically to,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>which is highly desirable. Amendment No. 6, which we clarify in Amendment No. 106, is concerned about the Public Services Ombudsman and the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales, which are both Welsh posts. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, has highlighted the points that I wish to make, for example, about the UK equality commissioner. I know that a campaign has been running for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC193"></a>

creation of a Welsh equality commissioner, as well as for a Scottish one. If that happened, the situation might be much clearer.
</p>

<a name="51018-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>Also, there is the question of human rights, particularly those of elderly people, which are sometimes infringed without their agreement. Such matters can be poignant and important to the older people concerned. I agree with the other points made by the Minister regarding Amendment No. 10, particularly regarding flexibility. It is clear that the commissioner will be able to do his job much more effectively as a result of that amendment. The amendments tabled by both us and the Minister improve the Bill. I remain not entirely convinced by the arguments put, particularly on equality and human rights, but at this stage I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51018-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno </b>   moved Amendment No. 7:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>Page 12, line 16, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

&quot;(   )   as to the desirability of the Commissioner speaking Welsh.&quot;

<p><a name="st_18"></a>The noble Lord said: I propose the amendment in the spirit of the Welsh Language Act. Although it is not covered entirely in that Act, I am sure that a requirement that the commissioner should be able to speak Welsh is very desirable. I have a letter from the North Gwynedd community health council, which states that it is absolutely essential that the person should be bilingual and Welsh-speaking to be able to fulfil the post.
</p>

<a name="51018-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Is this not all a matter of relationship? You must relate to the people who you are supposed to represent. Indeed, I have some suggestions here, one from Llandrindod Wells Town Council, that the commissioner might usefully and appropriately be drawn from the age group to which his or her work belongs&#151;someone who has been there, done that and perhaps knows more about it than someone who, like some of us here, has not yet reached that age.
</p>

<a name="51018-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Also the person should be able to relate to older people. When we think of the people that that person would be likely to be asked to help, many of them would be people suffering from strokes or Alzheimer&#039;s and whose first language was Welsh. As they had reached that state of frailty, the Welsh language might be the first language that they would use. So it is essential that the commissioner should be able to relate to them in the Welsh language and I hope that the Minister will respond favourably to that suggestion. The commissioner should be able to represent all people of all types in the whole of Wales.
</p>

<a name="51018-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>In passing, although there is no amendment relating to this, it has been suggested that the office might not be in Cardiff, but elsewhere&#151;possibly an office of substance in the north of Wales, with which I would heartily concur. I beg to move.


</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51018-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   As someone who had a lot to do with the Welsh Language Act 1993&#151;that seems a very long time ago&#151;I feel that I must say a word <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC194"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC194</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about this amendment. What the amendment specifically requires is that regulations should refer to the matter of the desirability of the commissioner being a Welsh speaker. It is not a matter for us to insist on but a matter for the Assembly to decide. The amendment, quite properly, expresses that it is desirable for the commissioner to speak Welsh, and I agree very much with that; but there is a considerable difference in practice between expressing a desirability of that kind and expressing a necessity. I do not believe that a lack of the particular skill in the Welsh language should necessarily debar a person from holding that office. After all, if he has sufficient linguistic ability, he could learn Welsh&#151;as so many have done in recent years, even in office; and, of course, he can always employ persons who are Welsh speakers. So I believe that the amendment is right in that it emphasises desirability as opposed to necessity and leaves the matter to the discretion of the Assembly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="51018-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   I thank the noble Lords, Lord Livsey and Lord Roberts of Llandudno, for tabling the amendment. It is important that the staff of the providers should act in a full understanding of the importance of the Welsh language, which as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, said, will be the language of choice of many of the people that the body will serve. To my mind the question is whether we want an additional provision in this Bill to achieve that desired end and, if that is necessary, what form it should take.
</p>

<a name="51018-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Reference has been made by both noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy and Lord Roberts of Llandudno, to the Welsh Language Act 1993. If I may say so kindly, both overlooked the fact that the Bill provides in paragraph 18 Schedule 1 for the commissioner to be a public body for the purposes of the Welsh Language Act 1993. That means that he will be called upon to draw up a Welsh language scheme. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, will almost certainly recall that the scheme will have to comply with statutory guidelines. That will still be binding post devolution.
</p>

<a name="51018-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Paragraph 18 of the statutory guidelines requires the language scheme to identify those posts where the ability to speak Welsh is considered essential and those where it is considered desirable to deliver a full service through the medium of Welsh. I believe that paragraph 18 of Schedule 1 goes a long way to achieve the desired end.

with the services he or she provides. As part of those measures, the commissioner will need to make provision in the general staffing of his office for meeting the absolute requirements of the Act.
</p>

<a name="51018-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The view of the Assembly&#151;and I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, agrees with this&#151;with which the Government concur, is that that is the appropriate level at which to set this requirement. Including the proposed provision in regulations, specifically in relation to the commissioner rather than to his office in general, would restrict the flexibility available when appointing the commissioner and may well affect adversely the strength of the field of candidates. The Assembly Government do not consider such a provision to be necessary in the context of the Welsh Language Act.
</p>

<a name="51018-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked what sort of person will be appointed as commissioner and whether he himself or she herself should be an older person. The Assembly Government have indicated that they would expect that the person appointed as commissioner would be able to demonstrate a real understanding of what life is like for older people and that he or she can empathise with them. It would not be appropriate, however, to restrict the field of candidates to those over a certain age. Following the coming into force of the age discrimination regulations in 2006, it could also be highly illegal. I have absolutely no intention of commenting on where the office should be sited. That is entirely a matter for my friends and colleagues in the Assembly.

<p><a name="st_25"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving government Amendment No. 11, I shall speak also to government Amendments Nos. 99 and 103, all of which concern the protection of the commissioner from defamation proceedings. I shall take Amendment No. 103 first, which provides a new clause granting protection against defamation proceedings.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the commissioner is able to exercise his powers without being constrained by fear of defamation proceedings. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC196"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC196</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The commissioner will play an important role in the safeguarding and protecting of the interests of older people. He will have wide powers to review the discharge of functions by public bodies and to review    complaint, whistle-blowing and advocacy arrangements made by those providing services. If he is able to carry out these functions effectively and to report on the discharge of these functions with candour and frankness, it is very important that he is not hampered by the fear of defamation proceedings.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>As well as the commissioner&#039;s reports, the commissioner&#039;s communications with other commissioners and ombudsmen to whom he may disclose information will be subject to absolute privilege. His communications with those involved in the examination of a case will also be subject to absolute privilege.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>New amendments to the Bill contain a number of provisions for working in co-operation with other commissioners and ombudsmen. The Assembly takes the view that if the commissioner is to be able to work effectively with these other commissioners and ombudsmen whose communications will also be absolutely protected, he will require the same level of protection.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51018-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   Will the whistle-blowers themselves be covered by the provision?

<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51018-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   I am advised that they will not.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The commissioner will also have the power to examine individual cases. This will involve having to deal with allegations as reported to him. To investigate those allegations, he will need to talk to third parties and may need to co-operate with other commissioners and ombudsmen about them. It is important that the commissioner is able to do so without the fear of defamation proceedings. Without such protection, the commissioner will find himself spending his time defending lawsuits, which would impact on the effectiveness with which he will be able to investigate cases. Absolute privilege provides a complete defence against defamation proceedings. Therefore, the amendment would place a bar on a person&#039;s right to pursue a defamation claim against the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>With regard to communications from certain persons in connection with the examination of the case, the amendment provides that they will be subject to qualified privilege. Qualified privilege provides a conditional defence. If a person listed in subsection (3) makes a defamatory statement to the commissioner in connection with the examination of the case, the person who has been defamed will be able to bring a defamation claim against that person.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>The reason that the commissioner is given an absolute privilege is that qualified privilege does not negate the chilling effect caused by concern about having to defend actions under defamation. The Assembly takes the view that, given the important role that the commissioner will play in promoting and safeguarding the interests of older persons, it is very important that the commissioner can carry out his <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC197"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

functions without fear of having to spend time and resources defending himself in lawsuits. Unlike the case of an individual, that will not leave the person aggrieved without recourse. The commissioner is a public body; will be subject to the common law of fairness; and his actions may be judicially reviewed.

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>I now turn to Amendments Nos. 99 and 11. The purpose of both the amendments is to remove unnecessary drafting and duplication from the Bill in the light of the new express provision on protection against defamation that I have just explained. Specifically, Amendment No. 99 removes from Clause 14 the provision dealing with the privilege of the reports made following the discharge of functions. When set alongside Amendment No. 103, the amendment has no effect on the level of privilege accorded to a report made by the commissioner pursuant to Clause 14, and such reports will be absolutely privileged for the purposes of the law of defamation. Amendment No. 11 makes changes along similar lines to paragraph 8 of Schedule 1, which deals with reports made to the Assembly. I beg to move.

<a name="51018-26_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   Perhaps I may briefly pursue the point I raised about whistle-blowers&#151;I hope that my noble friend did not mind my briefly interrupting him to ask him about it. Let us envisage the situation in which a whistle-blower provides information to the commissioner who then, in one form or another, reports that information publicly. At that point, does the information become privileged in the case of the whistle-blower? In other words, is the whistle-blower covered once the commissioner himself or herself reports on the information that he or she has received?
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Secondly, can my noble friend explain a little more about the nature of qualified privileges? What is the boundary between the full privilege proposed in the clause and qualified privilege?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="51018-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   May I first answer my noble friend&#039;s second point? Given the complexity of the legal term &quot;qualified privilege&quot;, I think it best if I write to my noble friend and copy the letter to everyone else here. On the protection of the whistle-blower, a complainant&#039;s communications with the commission will be subject to qualified privilege. Where the complainant is the whistle-blower, there will therefore be that limited protection. If my noble friend would like more detail on what is a very important point, I will be happy to provide him with that before the Committee meets again.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="51018-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   I am very grateful and appreciate that it would be far better to have a considered view on the matter. I am thinking of where the commissioner himself receives the information from the whistle-blower and then incorporates that information into his report. He is covered completely in making his report; surely at that stage, the whistle-blower should be, because the commissioner has accepted or taken on board the information provided by the whistle-blower.

said, although my remarks go somewhat wider. I understand the need for the inclusion of protection against defamation in the Bill. It makes sense, especially because of the need to work jointly with the other commissioners and authorities, as we have discussed. I want to highlight the fact that with rights come responsibilities and that, where possible, all cases should be treated as if defamation was not protected against. Confidentiality, sensitivity and professionalism are key to ensuring that those who go to the commissioner for help are confident in the use of his and his team&#039;s services. The noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, in his acute way, has rightly raised the position of whistle-blowers. If that protection resulted in abuse of the freedom that it allows, what steps could be taken? Would the commissioner be answerable to the Assembly or the Secretary of State? What plans are in place should the worst case scenario occur? That relates to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, but I feel that it goes rather wider when I refer to the worst-case scenario.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="51018-26_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   In response to my noble friend Lord Rowlands and the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, we need to communicate our views in this area, because an important point is being made. If I may, I should like to deal with it in correspondence between now and the second day of Committee, because without a full brief on what is an extremely important matter, I may&#151;as I did on Second Reading&#151;say some things that are slightly misleading. I should certainly not want to do that on a matter of this importance. If the noble Lords agree, I undertake to communicate with them before the next day of Committee.

<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="51018-26_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   In moving Amendment No. 12, I shall first speak to government Amendments Nos. 107 and 62, followed by Amendment No. 12, and then Amendments Nos. 113, 116, 117 and 118. These amendments are required as a result of the Government&#039;s policy, and the earlier amendments we brought, on joint working, collaborative working and information sharing. They provide reciprocal powers for other commissioners and ombudsmen, where appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Government Amendment No. 107 simply gives effect to the new Schedule 4 that details the consequential amendments arising from this Bill. The content of new Schedule 4 is provided by government Amendment No. 62, which lists those consequential amendments to be made to the Care Standards Act 2000 and the Public Services Ombudsman (Wales) Act 2005. The first consequential amendment made to Section 25 of the PSOW Act 2005 mirrors that of government Amendment No. 100, working jointly with the PSOW. That gives the PSOW reciprocal powers to work jointly with the commissioner. The amendment will ensure that if the PSOW identifies a case that could be the subject of an examination by the commissioner, he or she will be required, where he or she considers it appropriate, to inform and consult the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC199"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC199</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

commissioner about the matter. He will also be enabled to co-operate with the commissioner about the case, to undertake a joint investigation and to produce a joint report with the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>Further consequential amendments are made to Section 25 of the PSOW Act as well as Section 75 of the Care Standards Act 2000 that mirror government Amendment No. 101, working collaboratively with other ombudsmen. They give the PSOW and the Children&#039;s commissioner for Wales reciprocal powers to work collaboratively with the commissioner. This will ensure that if the PSOW or the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales is considering a case which raises a matter which could be the subject of examination by the commissioner, they will be required, where they consider it appropriate, to notify the commissioner of the connected matter. If they consider that the case also raises a matter that they   could investigate, they will be required, where they consider it appropriate, to inform and consult the commissioner about their proposals to investigate. Where both the commissioner and the PSOW or the CCW consider that they are entitled to investigate, they may co-operate with each other in their respective investigations. They will also be able to act together in the investigation of the matters raised by the case and prepare and publish a joint report containing their respective conclusions.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>Amendment No. 12 is required to reflect the policy that the Information Commissioner, as a permitted person in government Amendment No. 102, should be able to share information with the commissioner, just as the commissioner is enabled to disclose information to the Information Commissioner. The effect of the amendment is to insert the Commissioner for Older People for Wales into the relevant table within the Freedom of Information Act 2000 so that he is listed as a person to whom the Information Commissioner can disclose information.
</p>

<a name="51018-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Amendment No. 116 gives the Assembly a limited power to make consequential amendments to other legislation in the future, by order. However, any consequential amendment to the legislation of another person must be for the purposes of adding or removing that person from the list of persons with whom the commissioner may work jointly or collaboratively. The amendment also places the Assembly under a duty to obtain the prior consent of the appropriate Secretary of State or Northern Ireland department where the legislation that it wishes to amend relates to a matter which is wholly or partly the responsibility of a UK Government department or a Northern Ireland department respectively. We think this is a reasonable, thorough and fair approach to take. The amendment, however, does not extend to Scottish legislation which, under the Interpretation Act, is not included within the term &quot;enactment&quot;. Therefore, the Assembly is not enabled to make any consequential amendments to Scottish legislation and this is, we consider, an appropriate reflection of the existing constitutional framework.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>The noble Lord said: We have tabled this amendment to strengthen the Bill. Rather than using the word &quot;may&quot; in line 8, we wish to insert &quot;shall&quot;, resulting in a stronger situation, which would be highly desirable in our view. The wording of the Children Act 2004 outlines the much criticised general functions of the Children&#039;s Commissioner for England, while Wales, in that particular case, adopted a much bolder, more proactive and rights-based approach for its Children&#039;s Commissioner than did England. We believe that it is highly desirable that it adopts the same approach for the older people&#039;s commissioner, ensuring that the commissioner carries out his functions and is far more effective. The matter is very simple: we wish to give the commissioner more power. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="51018-27_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   Amendment No. 13, standing in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Livsey of Talgarth and Lord Roberts of Llandudno, would replace the commissioner&#039;s power to undertake his general functions in Clause 2(1) with a duty. The amendment would remove the discretion of the commissioner as to the exercise of his powers. That discretion is intended to ensure that the commissioner is able to discharge his functions as he considers most appropriate and in accordance with his priorities. The Assembly&#039;s view, which the Government share, is that it is not appropriate to impose a duty in the case of those general functions. We sympathise with the intent behind the amendment but our feeling, which is shared by the Assembly, is that the discretion of the commissioner, and ensuring that he continues to have that discretion as he exercises his powers, are of great importance. Therefore, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="51018-27_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I can understand where the Minister and the Assembly are coming from, but we wanted to ensure that there was no loophole in the discretion with regard to the commissioner&#039;s effectiveness, that the commissioner&#039;s duties were quite clear and that he carried them out as well as possible. We do not see a lot of room for compromise in that regard, but I have heard what the Minister said and shall withdraw the amendment for the time being. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="51018-27_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy </b>   moved Amendment No. 14:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>Page 1, line 9, after first &quot;of&quot; insert &quot;and safeguard best&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendments in this group, Amendments Nos. 14 and 19, are drafting amendments to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill, most notably with Clause 3(1) and Clause 5(1). Amendment No. 14 puts into the general functions of the commissioner the need to safeguard the best interests of the older people in Wales on top of the need <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC202"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC202</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to promote awareness of older people&#039;s interests in Clause 2(1)(a). One could argue that there is no point in promoting awareness if you are not going to safeguard those interests. The amendment emphasises the importance of safeguarding best interests and reflects the wording in the other clauses, ensuring consistency throughout the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51018-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>Amendment No. 19, which relates to Clause 2(1)(c), seeks to replace the word &quot;good&quot; with &quot;best&quot;. It is but a small amendment in the great scheme of things, but surely the commissioner is there to stand up for older people&#039;s rights and, as such, should be fighting for their best interests and the best he can get. &quot;Good&quot;, according to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, means,

If you promote, it is like pointing a finger at someone and saying, &quot;Aha, do you see the problem over there?&quot;. But if you are to safeguard, you have to do something active and very positive. That is what is needed here. It is not only being aware; it is not only promoting: it is a matter of getting there and doing something positive. We support the amendment.

<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="51018-27_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   I have had difficulties with the two standards referred to in the Bill, as have the noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy and Lord Roberts of Llandudno. The Bill refers to two standards: the standard of good practice, which is contained in Clause 2(1)(c), and the standard of best practice, which is contained in Clause 11(1) and which is the standard the guidelines will seek to achieve in practice.
</p>

<a name="51018-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Why should these two different standards be on the face of the Bill? The authorities should seek to achieve the higher standard of best practice which is to be laid down in the guidance. That is surely the standard the commissioner should encourage the providers of care to achieve.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="51018-27_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   Obviously this is a very important matter. We all want the same thing&#151;that is, the best, most excellent and most extraordinary abilities for the commissioner. However, we do not consider that the use of the word &quot;safeguarding&quot; in relation to the commissioner&#039;s general function in Clause 2 would be appropriate. The Government take the view that the amendment could be interpreted as      enabling the commissioner to take direct interventionist steps which could overlap or interfere with the statutory functions of other public bodies. Unless I completely misunderstood him, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, seemed to be suggesting that that is precisely what he wanted the commissioner to be able to do in taking positive and direct action. As I have said, we would worry that if he <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC203"></a>

took interventionist steps the commissioner could overlap or interfere with the statutory functions of other public bodies.
</p>

<a name="51018-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Where appropriate, the Bill gives the commissioner the power to take specific action to safeguard the interests of older people. For example, Clause 3 provides that the commissioner may review the functions of listed bodies for the purpose of safeguarding and promoting the interests of older people. Under Clause 5, the commissioner may also review and monitor whistle-blowing, complaints and advocacy arrangements to ascertain whether, and to what extent, they are effective in safeguarding and promoting the interests of older people.
</p>

<a name="51018-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>In drafting this clause, the Government have also considered carefully how the best interests of older people can be served. However, in our view, the incorporation of the term &quot;best&quot; would be superfluous in this context. Furthermore, while it may be simple to show that something is in the interests of older people, to show that it is in every possible respect in their &quot;best&quot; interests may not be so simple to establish. The term &quot;best&quot; is also subjective. What may be deemed as being in the best interests of some older people may not necessarily be in the best interests of other older people. Including the term in the legislation could, therefore, lead to unnecessary debate about action taken by the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51018-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Where &quot;interests&quot; are referred to in the Bill, we consider the term to be wide enough to define the commissioner&#039;s general functions and we do not think that its amplification to &quot;best interests&quot; would strengthen this definition.
</p>

<a name="51018-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Amendment No. 19 also introduces the word &quot;best&quot;. It seeks to enable the commissioner to use his general functions to encourage best practice, rather than good practice, in the treatment of older people in Wales. The Government do not believe that that would add anything to the commissioner&#039;s functions. When looking at specific practices and procedures, it may be feasible to research all alternatives and to identify best practice. However, when referring to a general matter such as the overall treatment of older people in Wales, identifying best practice may not be so straightforward and may be a subjective process.
</p>

<a name="51018-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>There may be a number of models of good practice, and identifying the best option for an older person may depend on the circumstances of that individual. The use of the term &quot;good practice&quot; is therefore intended to give the commissioner a wide remit in improving standards. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

The whole issue of safeguarding is also subjective. So, although I am content to withdraw my amendment for the time being, I give notice that this area is causing us some concern.

<a name="51018-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>We feel strongly that it is essential that direct reference is made to &quot;rights&quot;. There is no such direct reference in the Bill, which is surprising, given the human rights basis of the proposed legislation. The reference in Clause 18 to the United Nations principle is welcome, and that will be dealt with in a later amendment. Reference should be made to &quot;rights&quot; rather than &quot;interests&quot; across the board.

<a name="51018-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a> At Amendment No. 22, the question we are keen on is that of needs. I am sure the noble Lord will not be surprised to hear me say that this impinges upon the issue of free personal care, where needs are directly taken into account. Such care is needed when people <br>&nbsp;<br>

are perhaps living out the last days of their lives, and it is highly desirable that their needs are met by the best possible care.
</p>

<a name="51018-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Long-term care has been broadly divided into two areas: nursing care and personal care. The Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly recommended in 1999 that both nursing and personal care should be paid for by the state. This would be a difficult issue for the noble Lord, because it impinges upon the Treasury. Perhaps we will see some issues coming to the fore as they have in Scotland.
</p>

<a name="51018-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>We feel it is right to raise the issue of free personal care, because it meets the needs of the elderly. It is not good enough just to refer to &quot;interests&quot;. In the case of the elderly, needs are of primary importance. I beg to move.

<a name="51018-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   As the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, has explained, he has tabled a series of amendments aimed at emphasising the need for the commissioner and his office in their duties to work towards the human rights and interests of older people. The human rights of various groups in society often come up in debate in our House. In fact, in legislation such as this it is important and almost unavoidable. While I agree with the principle and the reason behind the argument, I add one caution: the Human Rights Act does not give rights to everyone in equal measure. For example, Travellers currently have rights to settle, but local people do not necessarily have rights to protest against that settlement in equal measure. Therefore, I always urge caution in the use of the term &quot;human rights&quot; because of the knock-on effects that they can have on other people&#039;s rights. I wonder whether the noble Lord has taken legal advice on this matter when he devised some of these amendments. I should be interested to hear. Of course, if the Government agree that this duty needs to be stated on the face of the Bill I shall certainly take further advice on this amendment before the next stage of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="51018-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   Amendment No. 15 inserts the word &quot;rights&quot; and I support it. The explanatory paper produced by the Wales Office and submitted to the Delegated Powers Committee states on Clause 8 that it is the intention of the Assembly that assistance will be made available in respect of those matters,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;which have a more general application or relevance to the rights and welfare of older people in Wales&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>So in the memorandum we have a reference to assistance in respect of rights. But nowhere else in the Bill, as far as I can see, is there a duty on the commissioner to promote rights. Therefore, where is the authority that enables the Assembly to assist proceedings in respect of rights? If my noble friend tells me that interests&#151;a key word in this section&#151;is wide enough to include rights, then that should be in the interpretative clause of the Bill. Can my noble friend clear up that difficulty?

noble Lord, Lord Livsey. These amendments replace references to &#039;the interests of older people in Wales&#039; in Clauses 2, 3, 5 and 18 of the Bill with the term &#039;the interests and rights of older people in Wales&#039;.

In my view, these principles are key to our consideration of the wider rights of older people.
</p>

<a name="51018-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>As to the first two sets of amendments, it seems that it is the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, to widen the commissioner&#039;s powers and remit to ensure that he is able to take action to further the rights as well as the interests of older people in Wales. It is our view that the term &quot;interests&quot; is wider than &quot;rights&quot;; it is also wider than &quot;needs&quot;. So I am beginning to wonder whether there is confusion and that we are both talking about the same thing but approaching it in a different way.

I think it would be good for me to say now that we believe that the term &quot;interests&quot; incorporates rights for the reasons I gave just before we suspended.

that the Minister can explain to us exactly what he believes constitutes discrimination. Is it personal discrimination in a community situation? We have complaints of people in hospital being ignored or neglected and of people suffering because they are unable to feed themselves. In some places cleanliness is not paramount. Such matters could be included as discrimination. We can ensure that older folk as a community do not suffer age discrimination. As the Minister said, legislation has been enacted to deal with the matter. We therefore ask to distinguish direct discrimination from indirect.

</p>

<a name="51018-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>As part of my lifelong work, I have visited nursing homes many times a week. Sometimes the staff are absolutely first class, with the nurses having been trained in the national health service, but sometimes staff are untrained. I was in one nursing home day room where a carer actually dropped a patient. It is essential to have the highest standard of training to ensure that that sort of thing does not happen. This is not just a physical thing; it is also a question of having empathy and sympathy with the patients. So many people simply want a sympathetic ear. People employed in these homes should be able to be the sort of friend older people need, especially lonely older people who may have lost all their family. I do not know whether it is possible to train a person to have a good bedside manner, but we could try. The best possible training should be provided to ensure that the folk receiving the care do so in a complete way. I beg to move.

<a name="51018-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I should like to concentrate on Amendment No. 18, which links to my Amendment No. 19 to Clause 2, exchanging the word &quot;good&quot; for &quot;best&quot; when it comes to practice. I argue that the amendment is right, and I agree with it in principle. But how can the commissioner encourage best or good practice if people are not trained to work to such targets? Is the noble Lord suggesting that the commissioner&#039;s office should do the training? I do not think that that would be right, given the limited resources and the large remit the commissioner already has under the Bill. I should have thought that the responsibility for training should remain with the organisations and individuals on which the commissioner can report. His office can provide guidance that he has consulted, but it should be the responsibility of the service providers to ensure that their staff are trained to the correct level and in the correct manner, just as it is their responsibility to ensure that these standards are upheld and, if not, that the appropriate action is taken to change that.

<a name="51018-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   Amendment No. 80, in my name, has been grouped with Amendment Nos. 17 and 18. I would prefer to degroup it; I think it could be more conveniently taken together with Amendment No. 81, also standing in my name.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="51018-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   I start by making a general point which I hope will be helpful. The term &quot;discrimination&quot; is used in the Bill to describe unfair treatment. Direct discrimination might occur when an older person is precluded from having the same access to services as others, because of specific criteria that excludes or disadvantages&#151;for example, age limit on appointments. Indirect discrimination might occur when the criteria set means that in practice it would exclude or disadvantage an older person, without directly referring to age&#151;for example a refusal to employ full or part-time staff. We intend to capture all types of discrimination against older people in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51018-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>I shall look first at Amendments Nos. 17 and 18, standing in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Livsey of Talgarth and Lord Roberts of Llandudno, before turning to Amendment No. 80 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies. Amendment No. 17 seeks to ensure that the commissioner&#039;s power to promote the elimination of discrimination against older people in Wales would include all forms of discrimination, whether direct or indirect.
</p>

<a name="51018-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>It is the Government&#039;s view, shared by the Assembly, that the reference to discrimination in Clause 2(1)(b) includes all forms of discrimination and therefore that the Bill already achieves what the noble Lord intended. The commissioner&#039;s powers in other parts of the Bill will also allow for him to tackle direct and indirect discrimination&#151;for example, through his power to review the discharge of functions of certain bodies the commissioner would be able to consider whether this had been done in such a way as to discriminate directly or indirectly against older people.
</p>

<a name="51018-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Amendment No.18 seeks to give the commissioner the ability to promote the provision of training towards good practice, both in the elimination of discrimination against older people in Wales and in the provision of opportunities for compliance with human rights. Clause 2 deals specifically with the commissioner&#039;s general functions and as such is fairly widely drawn. The amendment would serve to narrow the commissioner&#039;s broad remit and would not therefore be in keeping with this clause. Furthermore, the general functions already included in the Bill will enable the commissioner to become involved in such activities. Thus, as part of his power to promote the elimination of discrimination, the commissioner will be able to encourage training towards good practice if he considers that that is required.

<a name="51018-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I shall deal with the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, regarding training and good practice. Training for staff in care homes is covered by the care standards regulatory regime. It is inspected by the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales. There are specific national minimum standards in respect of the level and types of training required. The Care Council for Wales also has a statutory role in respect of registration and training. The commission will be able to review the discharge of such functions of both bodies.
</p>

<a name="51018-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>Amendment No. 80 extends the Assembly&#039;s regulatory-making power in Clause 9 to include regulations about the examination by the commissioner of policies that discriminate indirectly or directly against older people in Wales. I draw noble Lords&#039; attention to the fact that, for the purposes of such an examination under Clause 9, the regulations may make provision for the commissioner to be able to require the provision of information and the attendance of witnesses.
</p>

<a name="51018-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The Government share the view of the Assembly that this amendment is neither necessary nor appropriate. The commissioner will be able to use his general power in Clause 2(1)(b) of the Bill to consider whether policies discriminate against older people in Wales. He will also be able to do this using his power to review the discharge of functions of certain bodies in Clause 3. For the purposes of these functions, a specific power to require the attendance of witnesses and the provision of information will not be required as these policies will be in the public domain.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a very mixed group of amendments. I shall speak, first, to Amendment No. 20, which is a drafting amendment. It removes the word &quot;effectiveness&quot; from subsection (1)(d) in Clause 2 and replaces it with &quot;effective implementation&quot;. So, the general function of the commissioner would read,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;keep under review the adequacy and effective implementation of law affecting the interests of older people in Wales&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I feel that the general use of the word &quot;effectiveness&quot; is too vague in terms of the commissioner&#039;s proposed function to review the adequacy of the law, and that &quot;effective implementation&quot; is a more accurate description of how he can assess and check the working of law in Wales with regard to older people. I have a sneaking suspicion that it is not really his duty, but the duty of Ministers to review the adequacy of law as such. The law is no good unless, first, it is implemented and, secondly, implemented well.
</p>

<a name="51018-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>While I am on my feet, perhaps I may say a word about the two Liberal Democrat amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 25 and 26. They raise what I consider to be issues of great importance, the foremost being the duty of the commissioner to work towards the elimination of elder abuse. As we will no doubt refer to this issue later, I should like to commend to Members of the Committee who have not already read it the Select Committee report on elder abuse published in 1993. It highlighted the shocking statistic that more than half a million older people in England are being abused at any one time. Many people are unaware of the problem. I believe that the amendment will emphasise to people other than the commissioner the need to address that issue, and the office of the commissioner is set up to do just that.
</p>

<a name="51018-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The second amendment does what I think goes unsaid. I am glad that it adds a positive, rather than a negative, spin to the duties of the commissioner and his office. It is more in line with the government document <i>Opportunity Age</i> and is proactive rather than reactive, as the Welsh strategy seems to be. These functions for the commissioner may have a positive effect on older people who fall below the age range currently stated in the Bill. Ensuring fair access to services would surely ensure that access is fair for those who are 45 or 50 and over, not just those who are 60 and over, as referred to specifically in the Bill. I support these amendments and that is why I have spoken to them as well as to Amendment No. 20 standing in my name. I beg to move.

<a name="51018-30_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   I am sorry to intervene. I did not appreciate that my amendment on research has been grouped with this amendment. Neither did I understand that I had used the words &quot;effectiveness&quot; and &quot;effective implementation&quot;. Those are not my words&#151;they were the words of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy&#151;but I go along with them. The word I used was &quot;practice&quot;, and I relied on a precedent. Can my noble friend tell the Committee whether the Northern Ireland commissioner has had any difficulties with the wording of this clause? I thought that because there was a precedent the department would like to have another look at it.
</p>

<a name="51018-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>As to research, I would like to discuss it as a separate issue. In the same way, I want to discuss Amendment No. 80 as a separate issue. I merely make those few points.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="51018-30_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   I am grateful to my noble friend for making those points. I apologise if I have in any way misquoted him . I do not have the    information about the Northern Ireland commissioner, but I shall find out what the situation is and come back to him before the next committee stage on all the matters he has raised.
</p>

<a name="51018-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>The Bill already allows for the commissioner to do this in paragraph 19 of Schedule 1. The paragraph provides that the commissioner may do anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of his functions. This would include activities such as commissioning research or engaging expert advice and could be done in connection with any of the commissioner&#039;s functions, not only those in Clause 2. Including such an express provision in the Bill where no express provision is required may call into question the extent of the commissioner&#039;s power to undertake similar activities using his supplementary powers in Schedule 1.
</p>

<a name="51018-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Amendment No. 25, which has been tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, seeks to give the commissioner a general power to work towards the elimination of elder abuse among older people in Wales. The Bill already ensures that the commissioner <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC213"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC213</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is able to work towards this aim. For example, the commission will be able to promote awareness of elder abuse and bring forward measures to eliminate such abuse through his general function in Clause 2 to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;promote the provision of opportunities for, and the elimination of discrimination against, older people in Wales&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The commissioner will also have extensive powers to review the discharge of functions of key bodies and to review and monitor the operation of whistle-blowing arrangements.

<a name="51018-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   The Assembly and the Government therefore consider that adequate provision for dealing with the subject of this amendment is already made in the Bill and that the amendment would not strengthen the commissioner&#039;s powers in any way. I draw the Committee&#039;s attention to the fact that the commissioner has no criminal or civil sanctions for dealing with abuse. That is because appropriate mechanisms for dealing with cases of abuse already exist; namely, the police and the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales.
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 26, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, would include in the commissioner&#039;s general functions a power to act as a champion of older people and a power to encourage the development of fair access to services. The Government consider that adequate provision already exists in the Bill to achieve the intention of the amendment. The commissioner&#039;s existing general functions in Clause 2 and his or her supplementary powers will ensure that he is able to act as a champion for older people and encourage the development of fair access to services.
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>On fair access to services, perhaps I can deal with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, on blind older people. The points on disability that he raised are well made but generally fall within the remit of the Disability Rights Commission. Of course, many disabled people are also older people and joint working between the DRC and the commission will be absolutely essential.
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, asked about fair access to services for those who are 45, 50 or over, for example, and not just those over 60, and whether the Bill is not discriminatory in that way. We have to draw the line at some point and we have tried to do so pragmatically although we realise that there are issues of ageing for people of 45 or 50. The lower limit for the strategy for older people in Wales was set at 50 because the strategy is about encapsulating the active citizenship agenda and preparing people for retirement and older age. However, the remit and powers for the Commissioner for Older People are differently focused on people who have entered old age rather than people who are anticipating it.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>I noted carefully that the Minister talked about his ability to review and monitor the law. Both the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, and I are more concerned that he should monitor the implementation; as Amendment No. 21 has it, &quot;law and practice&quot;. I agree with that. It seems to me a new concept to me for a commissioner to provide law, review a situation and recommend to the Government that legislative provision be made so that action can be taken as a result of the passage of new legislation in a particular sphere. So be it. We have heard what the Minister has to say, and we shall consider his words carefully. For the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>

<a name="51018-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Amendment No. 24 inserts a new paragraph, and thus a general function for the commissioner, into Clause 2. This new function does exactly what it says, namely that the commissioner must:

</p>

<a name="51018-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The Explanatory Notes on the Bill raise potential human rights issues, as we have heard in earlier debates. It is believed that nothing contained in the Bill would be incompatible with the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, but Help the Aged do not believe that the commissioner&#039;s functions as stated go sufficiently far to ensure that human rights for older people, as stated in the Human Rights Act 1998, are fully protected and held. Meanwhile the Law Society argues that there is a need for the commissioner to encourage the take-up of the UN Principles on Older People, and that this should be in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>There are concerns that older people are currently not adequately protected under the present human rights and equalities legislation, particularly when they are in receipt of care services provided by the independent and private sector, where the Human Rights Act 1998 does not apply. However, care for older people is being increasingly provided outside the public sector. Older people are entering long-term care when they are at their most vulnerable, and therefore at a time of life when they need most protection.
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The Health Select Committee&#039;s second report for 2003&#150;04 makes very disturbing reading, but it is, of course, confined to England. It is titled &quot;Elder Abuse&quot; and the first paragraph of the introduction instances the dreadful case of Mrs Margaret Panting, a 78 year-old woman from Sheffield who died after suffering unbelievable cruelty while living with relatives After her death in 2001, a post-mortem found 49 injuries on her body, including cuts, probably made by a razor blade, and cigarette burns. She had moved from sheltered accommodation to her son-in-law&#039;s home. Five weeks later, she was dead.
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>I do not know of such cases in Wales, but one has to remember that, according to that report, there were half a million such cases in England and I dare say there are some in Wales. It is essential that the commissioner has powers of enforcement. The Bill&#039;s apparent lack of teeth was highlighted at Second Reading. These two amendments, in conjunction, aim to ensure the Law Society&#039;s recommendations. By enabling the commissioner to enforce the take-up of his recommendations as per his function, the amendments will go some way to addressing this issue.
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I should also be interested to hear the noble Lord&#039;s response to the call by Help the Aged for the commissioner to be able to encourage the promotion and ownership of equality and human rights among all sectors, not only public but also voluntary and private. I beg to move.

<a name="51018-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   I should like to explore the consequences of accepting Amendment No. 23, which suggests that the commissioner should have the power to enforce his recommendations. In doing so, I shall seek to illustrate the consequences of such an enforcement power.
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I have recently been taking an interest in the issue of providing physiotherapy facilities for female incontinents, very many of whom are obviously <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC216"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC216</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

elderly. The pattern of provision and service within the various health trusts shows that some provide such a physiotherapy facility while others do not. If an elderly person suffering from this horrible and debilitating illness should seek such help from her health trust but find that it was not at that stage willing to make such a provision, presumably she could seek the support and advice of the commissioner and gain his or her interest. The commissioner might then explore the clinical system provision of such an arrangement in health trusts throughout Wales. As a consequence, he or she could make a recommendation that such a facility should be provided in every health trust in Wales. I do not think that I am stretching it; that is the kind of thing that could occur, and it could have very significant budgetary implications for health authorities.
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>A similar situation could arise if a recommendation of this kind was made affecting the Assembly department that deals with health. The department could already have worked out its budget in conjunction with the Assembly committee for health; it could have worked out its priorities and might have consciously decided to provide one sort of service to elderly people and not another.

</p>

<a name="51018-31_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>If that is the case, are we saying through the amendment that the commissioner would have the power to override those decisions and enforce changes in the budgets of health authorities or the Assembly Government department? I would love him or her to do so&#151;but have I got the right angle on the amendment? If it were passed and the commission had the right to enforce the commissioner&#039;s recommendations, could he or she fundamentally affect the budget of the Assembly department or a health authority or health trust? In that case, are we saying that an appointed commissioner has the power to override the democratically taken decisions on budgetary issues that might have been made by an Assembly Government or an Assembly committee?
</p>

<a name="51018-31_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>It has been puzzling me for a while how far we shall give an appointed commissioner such a right; yes, he will be able to recommend, but will he be able to enforce such powers and such changes in budget? Perhaps we may wish to make that provision, but we should not do it without consciously understanding the consequences for the relationship between an appointed commissioner and the democratic decision-making processes that often determines such budgets. I would love and hope that the commissioner would recommend that there were total consistency in the provision for physiotherapy for elderly female incontinent people, for example. Nevertheless, I wonder whether such a power, overriding democratic decision-making, is the right one to give to an appointed commissioner.

them into account. I hope that, if he accepted the representations that he received in providing the service of the kind that I have described, he would want to take into account the budgetary consequences. However, as I understand Amendment No. 23, he could take account of them, take a decision that he wanted to support the recommendation, and then enforce it. The only question that I have is how far we are going to give the commission the power to enforce such issues. With regard to specific individuals&#039; rights in a particular circumstance, it could end up in a recommendation and the recommendation could be enforced, with considerable budgetary consequences for the various respective authorities delivering the services.
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Does one want to give the commissioner that kind of power&#151;to override the decisions of an elected body, such as an Assembly Government department, which has gone through its budget processes and has been supported by the health committee of the Assembly and by the Assembly as a whole, which then finds the commissioner saying that it must spend more money on one service as supposed to another? I raise the matter because it highlights a fundamental issue of the relationship interface between an appointed commissioner and the democratic decision-making processes of government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="51018-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, has raised a very important point of principle, and I find some of his arguments compelling. The order in which the commissioner uses his influence is an interesting question, because perhaps he should intervene at some time and have discussions before the budget is set. But that is another matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="51018-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   That would be a perfectly legitimate and proper use of his influence, but there is a world of difference between trying to influence a budget and having the right to enforce a certain recommendation that has budgetary consequences.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="51018-32_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   There is a cart before the horse scenario there. I refer to Amendment No. 24, which states that the commissioner may,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;encourage public bodies to take into account the United Nations Principles on Older People&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Clause 18 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;In considering, for the purposes of this Act, what constitutes the interests of older people in Wales, the Commissioner must have regard to the United Nations Principles for Older Persons adopted by the General Assembly&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>So the commissioner already has that ability in the Bill. All that Amendment No. 24 does is to encourage public bodies, which are listed in the Bill, to take account of the United Nations Principles on Older People. I shall read three short paragraphs from those principles. The first is:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;Appreciating the tremendous diversity in the situation of older persons, not only between countries but within countries and between individuals, which requires a variety of policy responses&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Clearly public bodies ought to take account of that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC218"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC218</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51018-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The second is:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;Convinced that in a world characterized by an increasing number and proportion of older persons, opportunities must be provided for willing and capable older persons to participate in and contribute to the ongoing activities of society&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>There is a hint of some rights there.
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>Finally,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;Mindful that the strains on family life in both developed and developing countries require support for those providing care to frail older persons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I think that there is a duty on public bodies to take account of that. Amendment No. 24 is very acceptable in that context.
<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="51018-32_time0"></a><h5>6.30 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="51018-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   The hope and expectation is that there will be a high level of compliance by providers of care with the recommendations of the commissioner. But some authorities may not be inclined to accept the recommendations&#151;perhaps for the reasons mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts. They may therefore not be prepared to respond positively. So the Minister has to tell us what would happen where the provider does not bring itself into compliance.
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>That possibility seems to have been completely ignored in the Bill. There may well need to be an appeal mechanism for a third party to decide whether the recommendations of the commissioner are reasonable and should be complied with. With the greatest respect to my noble friend Lord Rowlands, I do not accept that a decision by an elected body concludes an issue, but it is a factor that has to be taken into consideration. I believe that there is a heavy responsibility on the Government to accept that that situation may arise and the Bill ought to provide an answer to the dilemma.
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Amendment No. 24 encourages public bodies to take into account the United Nations principles. The Bill places a duty on the commissioner to have regard to the principles in considering what constitutes the interests of older people. For that, the authors are to be congratulated. But there is no other reference to the principles anywhere in the Bill. Is it not just as important that the principles should also be accorded a proper place at the operational level in the service?
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Indeed, if they are ignored by the providers of care, it seems to me&#151;this was brought out in the first amendment we have been discussing&#151;that there will be no means of ensuring compliance. So there is a great deal to be said for Amendment No. 24. It is a very important amendment and I support it.

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Lobby groups have welcomed the powers in Clause 5 that enable the commissioner to promote the development of effective and comprehensive advocacy, complaints and whistle-blowing arrangements.
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>However, as noble Lords picked up on Second Reading, lobby groups&#151;the Law Society, Help the Aged and Age Concern, to name but three&#151;have serious concerns that those powers lack teeth and that there is no means of enforcing any recommendations the commissioner may make. Indeed, that is a theme which runs throughout the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Amendment No. 47 would insert a new paragraph (d) to Clause 5(2) that would enable the commissioner to review and monitor the implementation of his or her recommendations on arrangements for advocacy, complaints and whistle-blowing. I may not have suggested the right place for the amendment but I would like to hear how the commissioner will improve the lives of older people if all that he can do is name and shame and make reports that can be ignored.
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>We all know that naming and shaming is often not enough. Today&#039;s news is often quickly forgotten. A champion such as the commissioner is intended to be can hardly defend his position unless he has real clout. So there is a very strong argument there.
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Amendment No. 85 provides a kind of fall-back position. It would amend Clause 9(6)(b) and spells out the details of a duty that I feel needs to be on the face of the Bill. Subsection (6) explains the purposes for which regulations can be made to require information to be provided to the commissioner in an examination case. Thanks to our previous debate, we now have more of an idea of what such an examination case may be.
</p>

<a name="51018-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>Subsection 6(b) specifies that it can be for,


</p>
<ul>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The amendment is very clear: the commissioner must not only discover what went wrong but be ready to suggest a solution or steps forward. He must be proactive in his approach, not just descriptive. I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that this is indeed the way in which the commissioner will work. It has been argued that the name and shame option is a powerful tool but, again, I agree with those who say that it lacks the real teeth that lobby groups would like. As such, I argue that if it is the route by which the commissioner will go, it should be stated somehow in the Bill in plain English, as the amendment proposes.

<a name="51018-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   I propose to speak to Amendments Nos. 23, 47 and 85, and then turn to Amendment No. 24.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 23 would be to allow for the commissioner to be given in regulations a free-standing power to enforce any recommendations he might choose to make in connection with his general <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC220"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC220</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

functions. Compliance with these recommendations would then be obligatory under the terms of this amendment.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Amendment No. 47 seeks to provide the commissioner with the power to review and monitor arrangements for the implementation of recommendations made by the commissioner regarding arrangements for advocacy, whistle-blowing and complaints. If a review of arrangements were to reveal problems, the commissioner could use his existing power to draw these to the attention of the bodies concerned and to revisit these arrangements at a later date to determine whether any improvements had been made. Where the body falls within Schedule 2, the commissioner also has wide powers to review the discharge of that body&#039;s functions, including any failure to discharge a function.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Amendment No. 85 would widen the purposes for which the commissioner could be given the power to compel others to provide him with information, an explanation or assistance. This amendment would add to the existing purposes that of determining what action should be taken, and by whom, where a recommendation made by the commissioner has not been acted upon.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The Government share the view of the Assembly that it is not appropriate for a commissioner to have the type of enforcement powers intended by these amendments. It is not intended that the commissioner should be a quasi-judicial enforcement body. This Bill follows the model of other commissioners and acknowledges that there are already in existence regulatory bodies, such as the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales, which are empowered to enforce statutory standards and regulations.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The Government align themselves with the Assembly on this matter. It is necessary to make a distinction between recommendations, compliance with which may be monitored, and a power to set down requirements that may be enforced. The Assembly will be able to introduce regulations that may make provision for the making by the commissioner of reports following the discharge of his functions, and about the making of recommendations. As with all other commissioner and ombudsman legislation, compliance with recommendations is not obligatory. However, the regulations may make provision giving the commissioner the ability to take further action following the preparation of a report. This would include, for example, the provision of further information about measures taken in response to recommendations and the publication of responses.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>The relevant provisions are in Clauses 14 and 9. Clause 14 of the Bill provides for the making of regulations that may specify the contents of a report, the persons to whom copies of such a report must be sent and any further action that the commissioner is required or permitted to take after making a report. Under Clause 9(5), regulations may also give the commissioner the power to require information, explanations or assistance from others for the purpose <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC221"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC221</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of determining whether a recommendation made in a report following an examination has been complied with.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The commissioner will not be responsible for determination in any matter, but will instead have the expertise to make recommendations that are about ensuring the existing framework and systems take account of, and are accessible to, older people. In this way, standards will be raised without creating duplication.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 24, which stands in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy and Lord Luke, seeks to provide the commissioner with the power to encourage public bodies to take into account the United Nations Principles for Older Persons, which were adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in December 1991.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>As drafted, the Bill already provides the commissioner with the power to do this. The commissioner will have a number of general functions, including that of promoting awareness of the interests of older people in Wales. Using this power, the commissioner may seek to encourage greater awareness and regard for the UN principles. Indeed, as I have said, Clause 18 places a duty on the commissioner so that, in considering what constitutes the interests of older people in Wales, he must have regard to the UN principles.

<a name="51018-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Noble Lords asked a number of questions that I will attempt to answer. If my comments are not clear or full enough, I undertake to write to noble Lords before the next Committee sitting.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, asked about the UN principles. The Explanatory Notes state accurately that the Bill is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but the noble Lord wondered whether, to ensure protection, they should not be on the face of the Bill. The Bill requires the commissioner to have regard to the UN principles. He is consequently required to promote the human rights agenda as part of that process. There is no intention to give the commissioner a direct role in enforcing human rights conventions. In our view, this would be an inappropriate new power out of keeping with his existing role. In the UK, the human rights convention has been enforced through the Human Rights Act, and the Commission for Equality and Human Rights, when it is established, will take the lead in enforcement of human rights legislation. We do not believe that this is an appropriate role for the commissioner.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, also asked what the commissioner could do to prevent, or act in, cases of extreme cruelty or abuse and whether he needed enforcement powers to do this. We feel that the commissioner may have a role in reviewing and monitoring the arrangements that a local authority has made for complaints procedures&#151;for example, the commissioner will be able to consider whether they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC222"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC222</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reflect UN principles such as independence, partition, care, self-fulfilment and dignity&#151;but he will not be an enforcement agent.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, in an interesting speech&#151;which I will wish, as will officials, to read carefully before next week&#151;asked what the commissioner could do to help an elderly person who was in severe ill-health and received poor service from his trust. In a number of cases, of course, there would be a financial implication, and we do not intend that the commissioner should be a quasi-judicial enforcement body. The commissioner&#039;s powers in the Bill are in keeping with the framework of enforcement powers that already exist between other commissioners, ombudsmen and the courts. The commissioner will not be responsible for determination in any matter. Instead, he will have the expertise to make recommendations that ensure that the existing frameworks and systems appropriately take account of, and are accessible to, older people. In that way, we strongly believe that we will raise standards without creating duplication with other bodies.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>On the question of enforcement, the commissioner cannot enforce his recommendations; he cannot require that they are acted upon. He will have the ability to undertake a general view of whether best practice guidance was being implemented, using his powers in Clause 3 to review the discharge of functions of the Assembly and of any Schedule 2 body. If the commissioner found that the relevant guidance was not being adhered to he could include that matter in a report following the review. More widely, the commissioner will also be able to draw attention to non-compliance with best practice through the making and publication of reports.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, made the interesting point that the commissioner must have regard for the UN principles and should encourage other public bodies to do the same. The commissioner can promote the Clause 2 interests of older people and can, by promoting Clause 2, encourage that.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>My noble friend Lord Prys-Davies asked what would happen if a public body failed to heed a recommendation of the commissioner. What sort of appeal recommendations are there? The commissioner could assess the measures taken by a body in response to a recommendation to see whether it has been complied with. Regulations may also set out a procedure to be followed where an inadequate response is provided to a recommendation, such as publication of this failure.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Where the commissioner makes a recommendation in a report following the examination of a case, Clause 9(5) specifically provides that regulations may also give the commissioner the power to require information, explanations or assistance from others for the purpose of determining whether a recommendation made in the report following the examination has been complied with.
</p>

<a name="51018-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, said&#151;and I am paraphrasing&#151;that the commissioner will have no teeth and lacks any real power to make a <br>&nbsp;<br>

difference to the lives of older people in Wales. It is not our intention&#151;and it never has been&#151;that the commissioner should be, as I said before, a quasi-judicial enforcement body. The powers are in keeping with the powers that other commissioners, ombudsmen and courts have, and that is it.

<a name="51018-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   Will my noble friend confirm that the Children&#039;s Commissioner does not have such important powers either? If so, does anyone really think that the Children&#039;s Commissioner does not have teeth?
</p>

<a name="51018-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   Presumably my noble friend means the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales..

<a name="51018-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   Yes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="51018-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   The Welsh Children&#039;s Commissioner does not have these powers either.
</p>

<a name="51018-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>This has been an interesting and quite lengthy discussion on a varied number of amendments. We will all wish to read carefully what has been said, but in the meantime, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="51018-34_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   This group of amendments gets to the nub of the Bill, which has now clearly emerged. The commissioner does not have any power to enforce; he is not, as has been made absolutely clear, an enforcement agency. All he can really do is encourage those with responsibilities, such as local authorities, and he can also name and shame them if they defy his recommendations.
</p>

<a name="51018-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>Is that enough? It has been said that the Children&#039;s Commissioner does not have enforcement powers either. In the last photograph I saw of the Children&#039;s Commissioner, he was looking very glum because there was nothing he could do about the <i>E.coli </i>outbreak which affected so many children in south Wales. To quote him roughly, he said in the <i>Western Mail</i> that it was shameful that we could not make sure that our children were safely fed.
</p>

<a name="51018-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Those who are familiar with the <i>E.coli </i>outbreak in south Wales would certainly agree that something pretty dreadful went wrong to result in the poisoning of so many schoolchildren. But we do not want to see the Commissioner for Older People faced in future with some ghastly situation that he could do nothing about. I am sure that I reflect the feelings of many of the agencies to which I referred earlier, such as Help the Aged and Age Concern. We are familiar with that kind of situation in Wales, where disasters&#151;or near disasters&#151;happen to local services sectors and nobody is there to take responsibility.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="51018-34_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   Whether the powerful statutory agencies to deal with food safety have failed to discharge their duties would obviously be the subject <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC224"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC224</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of an inquiry. But was it not the lack of teeth and power of the statutory agencies that sadly failed the children suffering from <i>E.coli</i>?
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="51018-34_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   I agree with the noble Lord. Yes, of course there are such agencies. It is when they fail that someone like the Children&#039;s Commissioner, who has a specific responsibility for the welfare of children in Wales, feels very aggrieved. All I am saying is that a similar situation could occur in the event that a dreadful situation took place in Wales involving elderly people, and the Commissioner for Older People could protest that there was nothing that he could do about it.
</p>

<a name="51018-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>We must consider the matter further and give as much consideration as we can to those bodies that have been involved in the production of the Bill. They make the point very strongly that what they find wrong with the Bill is that there are no enforcement powers in the hands of the commissioner. However, for the time being I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51018-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>

<a name="51018-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>[<i>Amendments Nos. 24 to 26 not moved.</i>]
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="51018-34_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth </b>   moved Amendment No. 27:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>Page 1, line 15, leave out subsection (2).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment seeks to remove the subsection that refers to the functions of the commissioner. The subsection states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;The powers conferred by subsection (1) are exercisable only in relation to fields in which the Assembly has functions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>We are very concerned about that issue because many of us have been involved in a great deal of casework. We have worked closely with the Citizens Advice Bureaux and know that many of the functions that bother elderly people come from Westminster departments. The situation to which I am drawing attention impinges on the devolution settlement. Clearly, the Bill must work within the framework of that settlement and powers can be exercised only in relation to devolved powers.

</p>

<a name="51018-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>However, the point I have just been making is that, as far as old people are concerned, it does not conveniently disaggregate into devolved and non-devolved matters. This is particularly true of financial problems experienced by older people. Clause 2(3) includes the power to make representations to the Assembly about matters relating to the interests of older people in Wales. This includes representations on non-devolved matters and considerable thought needs to be given to how this process will work, although perhaps not on the face of the Bill. It will be detrimental to the work of the commission if, as some argue is the case with the Children&#039;s Commissioner for Wales, representations made to the UK Government via the Secretary of State/Assembly are effectively ignored.

</p>

<a name="51018-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>A power to make direct representations to the Westminster Government would be the ideal. Age Concern Cymru has concerns about the situation. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;We see it as very important that the commissioner can comment on all matters affecting older people, including, when appropriate, non-devolved matters. We are, however, concerned about the lack of an obligation for government to respond to such comments and a mechanism through which, firstly, a response to the representations made by the commissioner would be made by the National Assembly for Wales, and, secondly, communication will be made with the Westminster Government and the response given to the issues raised&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>These are important issues that are exercising the mind of Age Concern Cymru.
</p>

<a name="51018-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 give the commissioner more power in areas about which elderly people have great concerns. For example, those of us who have done a lot of case work know that the issue of pensions creates a great number of problems for elderly people. For older people who still work, employment can sometimes be an issue. There has been a tendency, particularly by the present government, to means-test benefits that go through Inland Revenue lines. This has been done because there has been an erosion in the value of state pensions. A huge number of issues are outwith, as the Scots would say, the purview of the Assembly but none the less are matters of great moment and affect people greatly. I hope the Minister will give some indication about how, with the Bill in its present state, the commissioner could take up these matters with the Westminster Government. We feel that our Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 would assist the commissioner in serving the elderly in Wales better.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="51018-34_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   I shall follow my noble friend with some figures from the CAB. In its last report, it stated that 88,777 questions were put to it regarding benefits. The commissioner could not deal with them because benefits are not in his remit. There were 6,442 questions regarding tax, but the commissioner could not deal with them, as we shall hear later. The Law Society made the mistaken assumption that the commissioner&#039;s role is not limited to areas where the Assembly has functions, but in fact it is. On non-devolved matters such as pensions, taxation, police, prisons and benefits, the commissioner will not be able to act. The Cardiff Community Health Council mentioned the requirements of war pensioners, but the commissioner will not be able to act. The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy stated that there should be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;consideration on any matter, devolved or non-devolved, which may relate to older people&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I can go on. The Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society stated that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;to limit the bodies susceptible to review or investigation to those wherein the NAW has a function...is to severely hinder the real effective support and protection of older people&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51018-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>There are many similar comments. Following my noble friend, we need the remit of the commissioner to be revisited by the Government to enable these sorts of problems&#151;the major problems of older people&#151;to be open to investigation by the commissioner.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC226"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC226</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51018-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Some time ago, we agreed that we would amalgamate the three ombudsmen in Wales into one ombudsman and we have done so. The argument for that was that, because people now know where to go, a one-stop shop, single ombudsman who could investigate in all directions saved confusion. If there are two sources of remit, one very limited and the other the ombudsman, then people, especially old or frail people, are not going to know where they can go for investigation into the problems that concern them.
</p>

<a name="51018-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>One could make similar arguments that unless the commissioner has the power to look at United Kingdom responsibilities as well as Welsh Assembly responsibilities, he is doing the job with one hand tied behind his back. We must extend this. Later on this year, we are going to have, we hope, a Government of Wales Bill. If it is anything like the White Paper, the responsibilities of the Welsh Assembly will be increased. They could be. The Minister looks a little surprised; I do not know what is in the Bill, but I have read the White Paper. If we have that extension, then surely we could take a step in that direction by widening the remit of the commissioner to functions other than those devolved to the National Assembly for Wales. I support the amendment.

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="51018-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   I shall start by making a general point. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, wishes to revisit the devolution settlement rather than the role of the commissioner. He talks about the new Bill, which will be coming later this year or next year, on the governance of Wales, and he may be right when he says that the Assembly will acquire new powers which may have an impact on the Bill. But we are looking at this Bill and its provision in the light of the devolution settlement as it exists now. A cynic might say that this is an attempt to push the boundary a little further in the wrong direction.
</p>

<a name="51018-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>We cannot accept these amendments at the moment. As the two noble Lords know full well, non-devolved functions are the responsibility of the UK Government and not, at the moment, the Assembly. Consequently, it would not be appropriate for a commissioner established by the National Assembly and for Wales to exercise his general functions under Clause 2 in relation to non-devolved matters.
</p>

<a name="51018-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Under the Government of Wales Act, specific provision exists for the making of representations by the Assembly about any matter affecting Wales. The commissioner legislation has been drafted having close regard to the devolution settlement and, in our view, the proper constitutional route for representations within this settlement should be via the Assembly, as the elected body with democratic responsibility for the people of Wales.
</p>

<a name="51018-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Now here is a bit of good news. There has recently been an exchange of letters on this very subject between the Minister of the Wales Office and the Minister for Health and Social Services in the Assembly. That correspondence seeks to establish the   principles that will underpin the process of making, and responding to, representations concerning non-devolved matters. It has been copied <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC227"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column GC227</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to me on the basis that it can be made available to your Lordships, and I have arranged for copies to be placed in the Library. It is there now, so at 7.30 pm noble Lords can rush out and read it. In essence, it covers the manner in which representations will be dealt with, rather than seeking to guarantee particular outcomes which would not be possible or appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51018-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>It is for the Government to determine functions that are not devolved to Wales. The Bill has been brought forward as a government Bill but it reflects Assembly wishes so far as possible within the overall context of central government policy and the constitutional settlement. On that slightly pompous note, I shall sit down and ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="51018-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Prys-Davies: </b>   Did I hear the Minister say that this Government wish to respect the wishes of the Assembly so far as possible? Can he enlighten us? Is the Assembly opposed to these two amendments?
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="51018-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   Again, first, that question is encouraging me to say something that is not within my power to say. Secondly&#151;here, I stand to be corrected at a later date&#151;my impression is that the Bill has the complete support of the Assembly. Obviously, the Bill started in Wales and we are now looking at the British Government&#039;s response to it, which is very encouraging. In the light of all the discussions that we always have in the House of Lords about Assembly matters, there is a very strong feeling that we are supporting the Assembly in this endeavour and we are right behind this Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Bill. Although I am not answering my noble friend&#039;s question directly, I suspect that the Assembly would agree with the position I have taken in responding to the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="51018-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   Indeed, I suggest that it may be the best way to proceed because that is the nature of the devolution settlement. I would resist the concept of &quot;devolution creep&quot;, which I think is being promoted here. We should have a very clear distinction with regard to roles and accountability. UK government departments have their own line of accountability. They are answerable not only to Ministers but to Select Committees and to ombudsmen nationally in a whole host of ways. I believe that if the commissioner deals with matters in the non-devolved area, it is right and proper that such representations are made through the Assembly Government. I do not think that we should in any way undermine the important, and strong, relationship that has developed between the Assembly and Westminster Governments and those channels. That is the essence of the system for devolved settlement that we have created. I do not think that we should in any way try to bypass or undermine that; otherwise, there will be a confusion of accountability, which is very bad for democracy.

Lord Prys-Davies, said, there is no doubt that the Assembly is in a Catch-22 situation. No doubt many Members of the Assembly would like to accept the kind of proposals that we are putting forward in these amendments but they are unable to do so.
</p>

<a name="51018-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I said exactly the same as the Minister when I moved the amendment&#151;that is, that the devolution settlement was specific to the powers that had been devolved to Wales. None the less, there are huge problems for the elderly which have to be resolved. I do not want to rock the elderly boat too much so that the elderly are seasick as a result of this discussion; on the other hand, I sense that the Minister may have information that he cannot fully divulge, although he has given us quite a lot concerning the process of consultation between the Assembly and Westminster.

<p><a name="st_103"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is in response to concerns raised in the pre-Second Reading meeting arranged by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, to discuss the Bill. The amendment inserts the words &quot;and monitor&quot; into subsection 1 of Clause 3, thus allowing the commissioner to review and monitor the discharge and functions of the Assembly or of a person mentioned in Schedule 2. This small amendment will help to clarify the confusion that was present in the pre-Second Reading meeting and ensure the ability to check up on ongoing programmes and services, rather <br>&nbsp;<br>

than simply to review them, which suggests looking at the programme only after it has come to a certain point in its development. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="51018-35_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   The Government agree with the spirit of the amendment standing in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, and the noble Lord, Lord Luke, but we believe it is unnecessary. The term &quot;review&quot; is inclusive of monitoring activity. Therefore, use of the term in Clause 3 enables the commissioner to review and monitor the discharge of functions of a person listed in Clause 3. So we agree with the noble Lords that the commissioner should be enabled to monitor the discharge of functions by a person listed in Clause 3, but in our view we do not need this amendment to achieve that. I hope the noble Lord is reassured in the light of that explanation and will be willing to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="51018-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   As indeed am I. My noble friend asks why the term &quot;monitor&quot; is not used in Clause 3 but is used in Clause 5. The term &quot;review&quot;, as I said with regard to Clause 3, is inclusive of monitoring activity. Use of that term therefore enables the commissioner to review and monitor the discharge of functions by a person listed.


</p>

<a name="51018-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The terms &quot;review&quot; and &quot;monitor&quot; are used independently of each other in Clause 5 because the commissioner&#039;s functions include not only the reviewing of advocacy, complaints and whistle-blowing arrangements made by persons listed, but also the monitoring of the operation of those arrangements. So it is not only the arrangements themselves that he will be able to look at but also the operation of those arrangements. This is to ensure that the arrangements that are put in place are adhered to in practice.

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="51018-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   Were it not for the fact that I hope to be the dinner bell of this Committee, we could go on arguing about this amendment for a considerable time. The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies is right to draw a comparison between Clause 3(1), where a review occurs on its own&#151;and where we seek to insert &quot;and monitor&quot;&#151;and Clause 5(1), where the commissioner may indeed review and monitor. So once again we are pleading for some consistency in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51018-36_para1"></a>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>The noble Lord said: The principle is already clearly with us.

I await the Minister&#039;s response. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="51018-36_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   The intention of the amendment is to place a requirement on the face of the Bill for the commissioner to publish a report following the discharge of his powers in Clause 3. The commissioner should be able to make such reports where he or she considers it appropriate, and this will be provided for in regulations to be made pursuant to Clause 14 of the Bill. Clause 14 provides for regulations enabling the commissioner to make and publish a report following the discharge of any of his functions, except that of making a representation to the Assembly about non-devolved matters.
</p>

<a name="51018-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>It is intended that the regulations made pursuant to Clause 14 will specify the contents of the report, the persons to whom copies should be sent and any further action which the commissioner is required or permitted to take after making a report. The Assembly&#039;s view, with which the Government agree, is that it might not always be necessary or appropriate for the commissioner to produce a report following the discharge of a function. Consequently it is intended that the regulations will give the commissioner discretion in this matter.
</p>

<a name="51018-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>It would be contrary, therefore, to Clause 14, which allows for the making of all reports following the discharge of functions to be dealt with by way of regulations, to place a requirement on the face of the Bill that, in respect of Clause 3 only, the commissioner must make a report following the discharge of his functions under that clause.
</p>

<a name="51018-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I hope that my explanation satisfies the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, and I ask him to withdraw his amendment.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment on which I hope to hang a debate on how one measures whether a function has been discharged. For example, if the function of the Assembly is to promote good relations and methods of good practice, what criteria can the commissioner use to decide if the function has been discharged? When a function under the Bill is based on values and/or morals, qualitative and not quantitative targets, how can it be measured? The whole process is very subjective. Whose views will be used when the Assembly or the commissioner decides how and what &quot;good&quot; entails and whether it has been achieved? If there are different views on whether the function has failed or been successfully discharged, will the question be subject to scrutiny by a committee in the Assembly or elsewhere? Can the noble Lord explain whether the commissioner will always have the last word? If qualitative functions are set and the results are left to subjective debate with no final decision, is there any value in the commissioner being able to review and monitor such functions? These points need further clarification.
</p>

<a name="51018-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>Amendment No. 35 is another drafting amendment which would remove the words &quot;made arrangements&quot; from Clause 3(2) and replace it with &quot;contracted&quot;. This is a simple but very important change. The use of &quot;contracted&quot; tightens up the clause, allowing it to cover work that has been formally contracted out. Can the noble Lord clarify whether the clause includes formally contracted work and, if so, who would be held to account&#151;the main contractor, who was designated to take on the responsibility, the independent provider to whom it has been subcontracted, or yet another party? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="51018-36_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   Amendments Nos. 33 and 35 concern restricting the commissioner&#039;s Clause 3 powers to review the discharge of functions. Amendment No. 33 would call into question the commissioner&#039;s power to review and report upon a failure by the Assembly to act, especially given Clause 3(1)(d) which explicitly allows for the review of a Schedule 2 body&#039;s failure to act.
</p>

<a name="51018-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The Government do not wish to restrict the commissioner&#039;s power in this way. We believe that it is entirely appropriate that the commissioner is able to review the effect on older people in Wales of the discharge of functions by the Assembly. Therefore, it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC232"></a>

is also appropriate that he is able to review the effect on older people in Wales of the Assembly&#039;s failure to carry out any of its functions.
</p>

<a name="51018-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>We believe that it would be proper for the commissioner to be able to review the effect on older people if the Assembly failed, for example, to bring forward legislation or to issue statutory guidance. However, the effect of Amendment No. 33 would be that the commissioner may only be able to review the effect on older people in Wales where the Assembly has actually discharged, or proposed to discharge, a function.

</p>

<a name="51018-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 35 would be to restrict the commissioner&#039;s ability to review the functions of independent providers. The restriction would allow the commissioner to review only those functions of an independent provider that relate to a service provided pursuant to a legal contract. It would not allow him the flexibility to review the functions of a person who may perhaps be providing services by some more informal arrangements, as the current wording allows. It is our view that the legal status of the arrangement is not the important factor, but rather that an arrangement exists and therefore that a person is exercising a function that should be reviewed.
</p>

<a name="51018-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>If this amendment were accepted, it would also mean that the commissioner had the burden of establishing whether a legally binding contract did or did not exist. That might involve unnecessary legal arguments about this point. I hope that, after hearing this explanation, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>In his Written Ministerial Statement of 7 December 2004, my predecessor announced our intention to appoint the first chaplains to the Armed Forces from the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faith communities.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public&#039;s understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects, or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.

<a name="51018-38_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Northern Ireland: Smoking Controls</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="51018-38_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Shaun Woodward) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>This Statement sets out my intention to introduce comprehensive measures to protect all workers and the public from the dangers of passive smoking and second-hand smoke in workplaces and in all enclosed public places in Northern Ireland including all pubs and all bars.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>On 28 June I announced my intention to introduce partial controls throughout Northern Ireland on where people smoke. I also indicated that, over the coming months, I would decide whether to go further and extend controls on where people smoke in all workplaces.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>To help inform my decision I made fact-finding visits to Dublin and New York where controls had already been introduced to assess the benefits to public health and the impact of controls on businesses, especially the hospitality industry.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>The messages from both visits were similar. Both impressed upon me the improvements that have been made to the protection of public health for the general public and employees by controlling where people smoke.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>The department had already carried out a major consultation exercise between December 2004 and March 2005. This elicited 70,823 responses to questions about strengthening existing controls on tobacco use: 91.18 per cent of respondents expressed support for comprehensive controls similar to those already in place in the Republic of Ireland. These controls will also be introduced in Scotland next year.

</p>

<a name="51018-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>Trade Unions (with one exception) in Northern Ireland all supported the move to prohibit people from smoking in all workplaces and all enclosed public spaces. In addition organisations such as the Health and Social Services Boards, the BMA, local councils and the voluntary sector have made strong representations to the department for a complete ban on smoking in all public places and workplaces to protect public health.

<p><a name="wms_st_8"></a>
<a name="51018-38_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions Reform (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>I am pleased to announce that on 9 September 2005, the Department for Work and Pensions published a consultation document containing draft Occupational Pensions Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2006.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a>The draft regulations introduce a requirement that annual benefit information for non money-purchase benefits is provided automatically. This proposal was originally included in the June 2003 Command Paper <i>Simplicity, security and choice: Working and Saving for Retirement</i> (Cm 5835).
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a>The draft regulations also establish a new approach to disclosure, replacing the rigid timescales of the current disclosure regime with a simple requirement that information be furnished within a reasonable period. These changes reflect recommendations made by Alan Pickering in his report, <i>A simpler way to better pensions</i> published in July 2002. The Pensions Regulator is also simultaneously consulting on a corresponding code of practice regarding views on what constitutes a reasonable period.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a>These regulations will ensure that scheme members get important automatic information about their non-money purchase pensions, assisting them to make informed choices about the adequacy of their overall retirement provision.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a>The consultation period is 9 September 2005 to 2 December 2005. A summary of responses, including the next steps, will be published by 17 February 2006.

<p><a name="wms_st_9"></a>
<a name="51018-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>National Health Service spending is rising from &#163;33 billion in 1997-98 to over &#163;90 billion in 2007-08. This increased investment, together with reform and dedicated work by NHS staff, is transforming our hospitals, with reduced waiting times and lists, improved accident and emergency services and more up-to-date buildings and equipment.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>Ninety per cent of people&#039;s contact with the NHS is in primary care and the challenge now is to improve primary and community services. It is better for patients and taxpayers if long-term conditions like <br>&nbsp;<br>

diabetes and heart disease and care for our ageing population&#151;the big challenges facing the NHS in the 21st century&#151;are dealt with in the local community, rather than in hospitals.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a>The focus of services needs to shift more towards prevention, moving more services&#151;like diagnostics, minor operations and other treatments&#151;out of hospital wherever it is safe and effective to do so, and ensuring all communities get the services they need. We need to continue to reduce administrative costs, releasing further resources for frontline care.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>This needs stronger primary care trusts to design, plan and develop better services for patients, to work more closely with local government, and more effectively to hold hospitals and general practitioners (GPs) to account. GPs should also play a more effective role in developing better services for patients and be more accountable to their local communities for spending taxpayers&#039; money. That is why the Government are rolling out &quot;practice-based commissioning&quot;, which will ensure that GPs help deliver better local services for patients. It will also deliver better value for money as GPs help patients avoid going into hospital unnecessarily, and spend the money they save on improving community services, including preventative measures.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>To take this agenda forward in a planned way, with manageable timescales, <i>Commissioning a Patient-led NHS</i> was published on 28 July. Its purpose was to streamline strategic health authorities, strengthen primary care trusts and engage GPs with practice-based commissioning&#151;all in the cause of improving services to patients. Rather than impose change from the centre, we asked SHAs to submit local proposals for consultation to the department by 15 October. We asked them to work with local people and stakeholders, including honourable and right honourable Members. The proposals have now been received, and are being analysed against the criteria set out by the NHS Chief Executive (Sir Nigel Crisp) on 28 July:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>securing high-quality, safe services for patients;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>improving health and reducing inequalities;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>improving public involvement;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>improving co-ordination with social services through greater &quot;co-terminosity&quot; of PCT and local government boundaries; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>effective use of resources.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51018-38_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a>On 26 August, the department sent a letter to all SHA chief executives stressing that proposals should consider the context of local health needs, and that different solutions from different SHAs would be encouraged, as long as they were justifiable against the above criteria. He also stressed the need to engage local stakeholders and partner organisations from the outset.
</p>

<a name="51018-38_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a>An external panel representing key interests has been established to advise Ministers on whether the proposals meet the criteria. The panel is chaired by <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51018-38_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>Changes to SHAs will precede changes to PCTs and any changes to the latter will not commence before April 2006.

Any such changes will build on the results of the forthcoming White Paper on community health and social care services, based on the current listening exercise, <i>Your Health,</i> <i>Your Care, Your Say. </i>Staff will be fully involved in deciding new arrangements and identifying which services will be best for patients. Any staff transferring to a new employer will, of course, be entitled to appropriate legal protection of their terms and conditions of employment.

<p><a name="wms_st_10"></a>
<a name="51018-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Alistair Darling) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS52"></a>

<b>18 Oct 2005 : Column WS52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p><a name="wms_st_11"></a><i>The Future of Rail</i> White Paper (Command Paper 6233), published in July 2004, announced our intention to consider how rail passenger franchises could be best aligned with Network Rail&#039;s regional and route structure.


</p>

<a name="51018-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>On 19 October 2004 I announced that, following expiry of the current Central Trains franchise, the existing services would be distributed among other train operators in the region. This change is designed to improve the efficiency and performance of the railways, achieving savings through economies of scale and improving service to customers. Since then, much work has been done, in consultation with the rail industry, to determine the most appropriate way of achieving these objectives.
</p>

<a name="51018-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>I am today announcing the new structure of rail franchises which will be implemented. The structure incorporates market-based groups of services with an operational focus, which are better aligned to Network Rail&#039;s routes in order to encourage joint working between track and train. Three new franchises will replace four existing franchises.
</p>

<a name="51018-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a>East Midlands will operate services to and from London St Pancras together with regional and local services in the East Midlands.
</p>

<a name="51018-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a>West Midlands will operate the West Coast Main Line outer suburban services to and from London Euston (currently operated by Silverlink County) together with regional and local services in the West Midlands.
</p>

<a name="51018-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a>A new cross-country franchise will be created. The existing franchise, operated by Virgin Rail Group under temporary arrangements with DfT Rail, will now be re-let in autumn 2007.
</p>

<a name="51018-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a>The expiry dates of the current Central Trains and Silverlink franchises will be extended to autumn 2007. This allows time for the development of detailed specifications for the new franchises and for full competitive procurement to take place.
</p>

<a name="51018-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a>There will be an option to transfer the Liverpool to Nottingham service to the TransPennine Express franchise if this demonstrates better value for money. There will also be an option to transfer the services to and from Birmingham Snow Hill to Chiltern Railways, if this, too, can demonstrate better value for money.
</p>

<a name="51018-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a>Detailed discussions are taking place regarding the possible transfer to Transport for London of the London inner-suburban services operated by Silverlink Metro.
</p>

<a name="51018-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a>I shall keep the House informed of further developments as we continue to implement the proposals set out in the White Paper.

The UK Government believe, for example, that more can be done to cut the cost of the CAP and to ensure that it fosters an agricultural sector that is more competitive, sustainable and innovative in responding to challenges such as globalisation and climate change. We have not tabled detailed reform proposals. What we have asked for is a proper debate on the future of the EU budget, including the CAP, and we have seen public contributions from politicians, political commentators, economists and of course farmers across Europe.

<a name="51018w01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Following the Lyons report, <i>Towards Better Management of Public Sector Assets</i>, published in December 2004, the Government have set an objective of the disposal of &#163;30 billion of assets by 2010. As announced in the Budget 2005, the Government are putting in place a framework for taking forward better asset management across the whole of the public sector. This will ensure the most effective management of renewed public sector infrastructure and, where they are no longer necessary for business planning, include the disposal of assets.

<a name="51018w01_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>It is for individual departments, local government and public bodies to determine their own disposal plans as part of their normal business planning and in line with delivery of their public service priorities. Details of individual plans are not held centrally. Disposal plans may also be commercially confidential, where disclosure could adversely affect the potential value of the public sector asset disposals.

My right honourable friend the Prime Minister advised the House of Commons on 20 June that, under the current circumstances, the treaty could not proceed. Consequently, the Government do not intend to proceed any further with the EU Bill&#039;s parliamentary process as things stand. The Government have made clear that the constitutional treaty will be ratified in the UK only after a referendum.

The total number of return flights flown over this period was 138. In the event of prolonged delays every realistic course of action will be considered in order to minimise disruption to personnel both deploying to and returning from Iraq.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_22"></a>Whether they have made any representations to the African Union about reports that union personnel are abetting commercial prostitution inside internal displacement camps in Darfur, in particular in the Kamla camp.   [HL1562]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_22"></a>
<a name="51018w03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The Status of Mission Agreement (SOMA) for AU deployment to Darfur states that the chairman of the mission shall take all steps to ensure the maintenance of discipline and good order among members of the mission, and we have made clear that we expect the AU troops to conduct themselves to the highest standards. We have stressed the importance of AU personnel (observers and force protection) following DPKO minimum requirements about peacekeepers and HIV/AIDS prevention.
