We made this clear through UK and EU statements during discussions at the Human Rights Council, but the HRC could not agree to this. However, there was agreement that existing special rapporteurs will present a report on the human rights situation in DRC by the HRC&#146;s March 2009 session.</p>

Does not this failure give those states responsible for serious human rights violations a veto on the council&#146;s ability to fulfil its mandate? At the meeting of the contact group to be held next week, will the UK join others in pressing for the appointment of an additional senior special adviser on human rights to monitor the human rights obligations of the Goma agreement?</p>

Other countries that have resisted a special rapporteur have nevertheless had one imposed on them by the council, so we hope very much that the principle about which he is concerned is not conceded. Moreover, the special rapporteurs on violence against women and the independence of the judiciary have produced excellent reports on the situation in DRC, particularly in the east, so we think that the framework of strong reporting remains intact. I shall certainly look into the Goma issue.</p>

The mining interests have over many years taken different sides in the factional fighting in the country. Now that there is a democratically elected Government for the DRC, we hope that they can regularise their relations with the mining industry, put them on a much more transparent footing and break the curse that these resources have previously placed on the country&#146;s development.</p>

In the circumstances, is it not essential that there should be an effective monitoring mechanism for Article 3 of the Goma agreement of 23 January, which compels these groups to abide by humanitarian and human rights law? Therefore, can the Government undertake to press at the contact group meeting next week for the proposal mentioned by the right reverend Prelate, which has the approval not only of the 63 Congolese human rights NGOs but also that of several countries?</p>

I know not only from President Kabila but also from discussions with the UN special representative and others that there is a common understanding that human rights in the eastern Congo are the single most important threat for the democratic stabilisation of that country. There is a common desire to address this and we will certainly look into using the Goma process, and Article 3, as a means of doing that.</p>

However, dreadful though it is, there is a bigger level of abuse in the Congo&#151;or, for that matter, in Darfur&#151;than in Zimbabwe. That in no way excuses the situation in Zimbabwe.

Is he aware that the Government cannot lose on this issue because they are fighting disabled people who are not able to fight for themselves? It is a very easy victory for the Government. On the other hand, the Government cannot win in this situation because when they refuse payments to disabled people that is noted, not only by disabled people, but also by the general public. The public tend to judge disabled people&#146;s reactions and are disconcerted by what is happening. Does my noble friend agree that the best thing now is for the Government to change their tack and make certain that the allowance is given to disabled people&#151;because without it, they are suffering quite considerably?</p>

That is why they have been targeted. He will know that 60 per cent of those receiving DLA or attendance allowance are aged 60 or over and automatically receive winter fuel payments in any event. Notwithstanding the rising cost of energy, which has presented a real challenge, a severely disabled person can get more than &#163;150 per week extra in benefit, including the disability premium and income support. We are concerned about the impact of high fuel prices on vulnerable people and have been encouraging energy suppliers to adopt initiatives to reduce the impact of price rises on the most vulnerable.</p>

The proposition was that we should target winter fuel payments to disabled people and I have explained why, in our view, that is not an appropriate basis for targeting that resource. Warm Front, which the Government are supporting, has, through energy-efficiency measures, helped more than 1.6 million households benefit from advice and the installation of central heating. People in receipt of qualifying disability benefits can be eligible for grants of up to &#163;2,700, or &#163;4,000 where oil heating is recommended. We spent &#163;2 billion on winter fuel payments in 2007-8 and, since 2000, &#163;20 billion has been spent on fuel poverty benefits and programmes to tackle fuel poverty.</p>

We said in Budget 2008 that we would like to see the amount that energy suppliers spend on social programmes increase to at least &#163;150 million and I think that six major energy suppliers have signed up to that. As the noble Lord has indicated, there are issues about providing information to support identification of vulnerable households. That is not without its difficulties, because of data protection and other sorts of issues, but it is being actively addressed and we hope to be able to move forward on that quite soon.</p>

This Government have done a good deal to make sure that people have been removed from child poverty, pensioner poverty and fuel poverty. It is undoubtedly a continuing challenge, particularly with the current fuel increases. However, just in the Budget last year a further &#163;50 in winter fuel payments was announced for people aged between 60 and 79, and &#163;100 for people aged 80 and over. Those were increases of 25 and 33 per cent respectively, which is one way of helping people in poverty. It is a constant challenge, but I believe that we, as a Government, have a good record in tackling poverty right across the piece.</p>

For example, around 8 per cent of the average electricity bill consists of the renewables obligation; there are also the increased taxes on oil that have been allowed.

The pirates off the coast of Somalia are becoming ever bolder, frequently attacking in excess of 100 miles out from the coast.

Although such incidents have fortunately decreased in other parts of the world, they are becoming a more difficult problem on the coast of Africa that he mentioned. The Royal Navy has an obligation under international law to help if it is in a position to offer assistance. If it is in the vicinity, it has powers of capture, should that be appropriate, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>

As it is very rare for an instance of piracy to involve nationals from only one nation, you have to take into account the ownership of the ship, the personnel on board and the territory into which they may be going.

Is the Minister satisfied that the first plane with aid from the UK is, as I understand it, leaving only today?

The second concern was about the level of charges and who would set them. There is the charge applicable for maintaining the track, and then there is the cap, which is the extra charge that can be put on to help defray the capital cost, which the Government have guaranteed. I hope that my noble friend will be able to give me assurances on both these issues.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_926"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 926</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08051345000100"></a>The first one is the cost of maintenance. Allowing the new infrastructure manager to maintain the track, without any form of regulation, is a dangerous path to go down. Railtrack was regulated and it failed. The Office of Rail Regulation has had to put strong pressure on Network Rail to cut its costs by 31 per cent in the past five years, and the regulator will probably have to do much the same in the next five years. To say that these companies would reduce their costs just because of market pressure, without any regulation, is a dangerous road to go down. I hope that my noble friend can give me some comfort on that.</p>

<a name="80513-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08051345000101"></a>The second issue is the cap that is allowed to help defray the capital cost. Those who invest in the rolling stock and, maybe, the terminals to operate on this line will need some comfort that the cap will not be changed every year. The Government may wish to retain control of setting this cap effectively, but, for example, there may be a change of Government in two years&#146; time&#151;which is highly unlikely, but one has to look at options. The incoming Government might think that the Channel Tunnel rail link was a waste of time and they might have severe financial crises on their hands, such that they would have to increase the charges. That would not be very good for the companies which invested in new rolling stock to run on this line on the basis of the comfort that they had from the initial charge level.</p>

<a name="80513-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08051345000102"></a>The level of charges as regards both issues should be set by the Office of Rail Regulation. However, if the Government insist upon keeping control of the cap element, I hope that my noble friend can give me some comfort that the cap cannot be changed suddenly by another Government or a change of policy of a particular Government, on a whim, which would destroy investor confidence.</p>

<a name="80513-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08051345000103"></a>Finally, there is the question of access. We all hope that the line will be extremely successful in encouraging many more passengers to use not only Eurostar, but, I hope, new services that will come here. Whether those are run by French railways, SNCF, by Deutche Bahn, the German railways, or by a UK company which buys new trains to run on the line, it is important that there is sufficient capacity and that it is reserved not only for Eurostar because it was there first. The open access regime should be managed independently, I hope by the Office of Rail Regulation, to give everyone a fair chance to run trains in competition&#151;which is I am sure what the Government want.</p>

<a name="80513-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08051345000104"></a>I thank officials and Ministers for all the time that they have spent discussing this. I very much hope that my noble friend will be able to give me some comfort and that, finally, we can reach an acceptable compromise.</p>

I also received a letter yesterday from the Minister in this House and I hope that in his reply he will reiterate some of the points he made. Some of my concerns were perhaps helped by the letter, which described a framework that puts a cap on excess charges and, in particular, sets out a clear supervisory role for the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>

<a name="80513-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08051345000107"></a>These debates have been important and, I repeat, they were for the benefit of rail users and taxpayers. We all want to maximise any sale receipts&#151;and I hope that some of them will be reinvested&#151;for the benefit of the rail network, which we have talked about in several of our debates. I support this amendment and hope that the Minister will alleviate some of those concerns, as he did in the letter he sent to me yesterday.</p>

The idea that the Government should be involved in regulating is not very sensible when you have appointed an independent regulator. So I entirely agree with what has been said by the noble Lords, Lord Bradshaw and Lord Berkeley. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that nobody knows more about railways than the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, who speaks regularly on the subject.

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08051345000112"></a>If the Government make the right decisions on this amendment and indeed on the Bill, this is the chance for the United Kingdom to play a full part in the development of the future European high-speed rail network. One thing does lead to another, particularly with trains and railway lines. There is a lot involved in this and a lot at stake. This amendment would be very helpful indeed and I hope that the Minister will give it a positive response.</p>

<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="08051345000113"></a><a name="80513-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80513-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051345000383"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, when we embarked on this piece of legislation, I remarked to friends and colleagues that I thought that it was an uncontroversial little Bill that might bring some light to the shade. It might help us further to develop the excellence of high-speed travel and help us with the disposal of the asset, which is the core of what the Bill is about&#151;we may generate some useful and valuable funds for the continued investment and expansion of our rail system. However, I realised shortly after we embarked on the Bill that it would be a fraction more controversial than I imagined. Here we are at Third Reading and the controversy has continued apace.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08051345000114"></a>I think that all noble Lords who have spoken this afternoon and on other occasions have done so with the best interests of the rail network at heart. It is to the great credit of our House that so many noble Lords take such a profound interest in the growth, development and expansion of the rail network, which as we know is increasingly successful and doing extremely well. I hope that the comments that I make this afternoon will help. I am grateful to all those noble Lords who have spent time with me, reading correspondence that I have originated, who have seen the Minister, my honourable friend Tom Harris, or who have spent time with the diligent officials, who have put a lot of thought into how we approach this issue.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08051345000115"></a>It may be worth remarking at the outset that when in the mid-1990s&#151;1996, I think&#151;the original legislation went through relating to the development of the financial arrangements for the Channel Tunnel and the rail link in particular, the system of regulation that was put in place by, I think, Brian Mawhinney, now the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, was so uncontroversial as to provoke no comment from him and no debate at all on the issue. Clearly, things have moved on and noble Lords, and perhaps some Members in another place, take a slightly different view. Therefore, I was surprised that the question of who regulated in the early phase of the new arrangements was so controversial.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08051345000116"></a>There has been a lot of debate and it has been very welcome, but for the rest of this afternoon&#146;s discussion on this matter I shall endeavour to keep my comments to points that have been raised. I shall try to provide more explanation than we may have done in the past and I shall deal with some of the issues that I know still concern some noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08051345000117"></a>As I explained at the outset, this is an enabling Bill that clears the way for the restructuring of London and Continental Railways and the eventual sale of its component businesses, notably High Speed 1. The proceeds from that sale will be used to offset the investment made by taxpayers in underwriting the cost of constructing the new high-speed line.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_929"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 929</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80513-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08051345000118"></a>Despite the heat of the debate, I believe that more unites us than divides us in this House, particularly in relation to the objectives of this enterprise. Those objectives are summarised thus: to maximise value for money for the taxpayer from any sale; to encourage the greatest use of the line; to secure its efficiency of operation; and to do so in a way that provides a level playing field for all operators and not just the incumbents. That final point is important. The Government do not want to see artificial barriers to entry, whether they are barriers of price, access or safety. The Government agree that, as far as possible, the operation of this line should be subject to the normal regulatory supervision. They also agree that the best value for taxpayers is likely to be secured by maximising stability and certainty for bidders, commensurate with the transfer of risks and incentives that we wish to achieve.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08051345000119"></a>The amendments would do that by replicating on the new line the regulatory arrangements that apply to the national network. The Government well understand the thrust of the amendments but believe that they are unnecessary. In practice, the difference between us is as follows. The Government wish to retain the right to set the cap on the maximum access, price or investment recovery charge that can be levied for access to the High Speed 1 railway. They intend to set the cap prior to the sale of High Speed 1 and it would not then be changed without the express agreement of the owners of High Speed 1 and the Secretary of State. The amendments would transfer the whole responsibility for setting the charging framework to the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08051345000120"></a>There are three reasons why the Government wish to retain the single element of control. First, the price of access to High Speed 1 is a critical element of the sale process&#151;it is a significant determinant of the value of the railway. The Government carry the financial risk for this and they have a duty to taxpayers to maximise value from the asset that they have underwritten. The Office of Rail Regulation does not have such a duty and we would not wish to be drawn down the path of giving new duties to the ORR&#151;that is what the amendment would achieve&#151;to ensure that an independent regulator arrives at the answer that we all want.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08051345000121"></a>Secondly, in this context we do not believe that the ORR would offer additional certainty to bidders for High Speed 1. The timing is uncertain, the range of possible outcomes, all of which might be equally valid in regulatory terms, are similarly uncertain and any revisiting of the charges, such as by periodic review every five years, is entirely outwith the bidders&#146; control.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08051345000122"></a>Thirdly and finally, this railway is different from the national network. A traditional regulatory approach would seek to prejudge the value of the asset, fix prices against that and, consequently, determine volumes. In practice, the risk of each of these determinations would return to the Government. However, in the case of High Speed 1, the Government do not believe that such an approach is necessary; indeed, we believe that it would be unnecessarily constraining and produce an artificial expression of value. Instead, by establishing  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_930"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 930</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a cap on charges that is designed to be attractive to competition on the line, the market can then assess the value of the asset in the debt that it is prepared to raise against such future revenue and the operator can be given the incentives to chase business in order to maximise its returns against that value.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08051345000123"></a>Having said why we do not want to take that final step of handing price setting to the ORR, I shall explain what the Government want to do instead and how, within this, we nevertheless want to limit the boundaries of difference and maximise the normal regulatory approach. The Government will establish a charging framework. The principal purpose of such a framework is the standard one for all such documents: to ensure that the tariffs and procedures for determining access by the infrastructure owner are compliant with the relevant regulations. This charging framework will set a cap on the maximum charge that can be levied. There will be no minimum charge. The cap will also be contractualised within the concession agreement entered into with the successful bidder for High Speed 1.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08051345000124"></a>The purpose of the cap is to prevent artificial pricing barriers to entry&#151;an issue that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, was concerned about&#151;and to protect the position of the domestic franchise operator, which is, after all, a largely captive customer. The purpose of doing this as a cap without a floor or fixed price is to enable the infrastructure owner to set rates that are level but competitive for different markets as it seeks to chase business and maximise usage and to enable it to respond positively to changes in the market, whether fluctuations in demand or fluctuations in operators&#146; cost bases. In other words, the infrastructure owner is able on risk to chase volume and price in an open and competitive market, while operators are protected by the cap itself.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08051345000125"></a>The purpose of also putting the price in the concession contract is to give bidders certainty and to obtain best value for the taxpayer, both at the point of initial sale and thereafter. That is the point that unifies us all. Thereafter, with the charging framework established and the cap set, the Government&#146;s special interest ends. We will want normal regulatory processes to apply.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08051345000126"></a>What do I mean by that? I mean principally two things. The regulator should have the supervisory function, under the EU rail directives, to ensure that the infrastructure operator discharges its business in compliance with the network statement and the requirement of directives, particularly ensuring that the pricing of access is entirely fair and non-discriminatory for all operators that share similar markets. I know that the issue of non-discrimination is of particular concern to the noble Lords, Lord Bradshaw and Lord Berkeley. I think that we have answered that point.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08051345000127"></a>The regulator should also determine that the relevant documents and provisions&#151;that is, the network statement arrangements for the allocation of access and supporting contracts&#151;are compliant with the directives. The formal means of doing so is through its appellate functions. We do not see cause for delay in the introduction of  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_931"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 931</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these regulatory interests. They start and the Government bow out, if you will, at the moment when the new structures go live.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08051345000128"></a>I hope that we are largely there, but perhaps I may give a few more necessary safeguards and reassurances to the House. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, asked what reassurance could be given that the cap or charging framework would not be changed at the whim of the Government. That is a fair question. A principal assurance is to fix it also in the concession, providing contractual certainty for bidders. That is an important point. The Government would not then, in normal circumstances, expect to revisit this cap over the period of the concession.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08051345000129"></a>We must, however, allow for two possible exceptions. First, the charging framework may, from time to time, need updating to reflect any change in the governing directives. I am sure that all noble Lords will accept that point. Secondly, if the market for the line proves even more buoyant than we have forecast, as some analysts suggest, and therefore is able to make a greater contribution to the costs of construction, we should not artificially suppress that. In such circumstances, it will be open to the infrastructure operator to seek from the Government agreement to raising the cap&#151;a not unreasonable position. The Government would seek in turn to see that a share of that additional value returned to the taxpayer. That would also take into account the approaches under the directive for responding to congested infrastructure&#151;that is, when demand at the first established price outstrips supply.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08051345000130"></a>I emphasise again that the cap is a one-way constraint. If the infrastructure owner needs, as it is likely to, to set lower prices for some markets to attract business or to reduce prices should market conditions change, it is free to do so, provided that it does so on a fair and non-discriminatory basis in accordance with European regulations. Noble Lords will note that the regulator will have supervisory and appellate functions but will want reassurance that the key documents&#151;the charging framework, the network statement and the access contracts&#151;are compliant in the first instance. The Government want that, too. Without it, we introduce an immediate and unnecessary regulatory risk to the sale, which would undoubtedly reduce value. What is the point of publishing a network statement on Monday if it is only to be overturned by the regulator on appeal on Tuesday?</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08051345000131"></a>We will of course subject those documents to the scrutiny of our professional advisers and&#151;perhaps more reassuringly from a neutral standpoint&#151;our approach will be subject to the scrutiny of the European Commission, whose approval of the necessary state aid is essential to the progress of the project; the Commission is unlikely to grant such approval until it is satisfied as to our compliance with the relevant directives. Thereafter, we will consult fully and publicly, including on the charging framework. That consultation process will include the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08051345000132"></a>I must be careful. We could not, nor would we want to, have that consultation process fetter any discretion on the regulator in any subsequent appeals. Nevertheless, the Government want both the input and the advice of the Commission and the ORR to ensure that the  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_932"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 932</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>charging framework is properly compliant. The regulator also has an interest in ensuring that the documents over which it will subsequently have an appellate duty, including the network statement and access arrangements, are not flawed in a way likely to precipitate unavoidable appeal. The process for consultation on the relevant documents is therefore a practical one whose effectiveness is formally underpinned by the independent scrutiny of the regulator, with its powers to overturn on appeal, and of the Commission.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08051345000133"></a>Finally, I need to say something about the efficiency of operating costs on the line. We have not fully touched on this, in part because the range of potential outcomes does not itself hang on primary legislation. At this stage, I can go no further than to provide a clear statement of the Government&#146;s principles and intent and ask the House to accept these assurances, which may be given expression through secondary legislation, through the application of existing primary legislation, such as the 1993 Act, or by commercial and contractual agreement.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08051345000134"></a>In trying to maximise returns and in so far as the market is competitive, the infrastructure operator faces an incentive to reduce operating costs to make prices more attractive and to increase demand while maintaining its margin&#151;an issue about which my noble friend Lord Berkeley was particularly exercised. In the Government&#146;s view, such incentives are, to borrow an economic phrase, necessary but not sufficient. We have seen before how such incentives do not always work out in practice; we cannot rely entirely on the dynamics of the market for the whole period of the concession. Operators will be concerned at a risk that a future infrastructure owner regards these costs as a straight pass through to operators. In any case, there is also an efficiency requirement within the directives.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08051345000135"></a>The first statement is therefore one of clear principle. The Government believe that it is separately and additionally necessary to place incentives on the infrastructure owner continuously to improve the efficiency of operation and we want that to be reflected in the relevant subcontracts. The more open issue at this stage is how to deliver this. We must reflect that in the statement of principle that follows. The Government do not see themselves as the first and best regulatory option. The Government believe that the arbitration of what constitutes reasonable efficiency in the event of dispute is the natural territory of economic regulators. I cannot go further at this stage, as any such role is not currently or actively exercised by the Office of Rail Regulation. The route to future change may be administrative, regulatory or by contractual agreement.</p>

<a name="80513-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08051345000136"></a>The objective of effective efficiency pressures is one that we share. It is the Government&#146;s intention that the efficiency of operation of High Speed 1 and the contract supporting any third-party operation and maintenance of the line should be subject to independent scrutiny. Subject of course to further discussion with the Office of Rail Regulation and the need to recognise or agree change to any existing contractual rights, it is the Government&#146;s preferred outcome that this scrutiny should be undertaken by the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>

I think that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, understands my intent. We will explore in good faith how this might be achieved without recourse to primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08051345000138"></a>I hope that noble Lords will forgive the length and the detail of this speech. I have no intention to bore the House much further, although I am sure that noble Lords will be interested. I hope that they will recognise the shared nature of our objectives, the reasons that the Government have given for the limited differences in approach&#151;and they are limited&#151;to this sale and operation and particularly the commitments given to tightly circumscribe the extent and the timing of the Government&#146;s special interests here and to establish the operation of the railway thereafter on a normal regulatory footing subject to the supervision and the appellate scrutiny of the Office of Rail Regulation, as should happen. I hope that with that lengthy explanation noble Lords will feel confident not to press their amendments.</p>

I was also chairman of the committee that looked at the father to the Bill, on the Channel Tunnel. Both were hybrid Bills. I merely wish to inform the Minister that I feel inclined to support the amendment as proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. As the Minister recognises that regulation is required, he might defer to the views that have already been expressed by this House in putting forward what I consider to be reasonable recommendations.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;With your permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement on how I propose to deal this year with the consequences of the withdrawal of the 10p rate of income tax.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In the Budget last year, my right honourable friend introduced just two rates of tax, with the basic rate cut from 22p to 20p&#151;the lowest rate for 75 years. At the same time, allowances for pensioners over the age of 65 were increased, and recognising that as the tax credit system became more developed and more generous we were better able to target resources on low-income households, we increased the working tax credit and the child tax credit as well as child benefit. As the result of these changes, more than 16 million households have gained, and 600,000 more pensioners will pay no income tax at all. Because of the changes announced in 2007 and in this year&#146;s Budget, 500,000 children will be lifted out of poverty&#151;a record that no other Government have ever matched.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In my letter to the Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee three weeks ago, I said I would set out our proposals to help those who lost out as a result of the withdrawal of the 10p starting rate of tax for the longer term in the Pre-Budget Report later this year. As I said in my letter, my focus would be on changes to offset the average loss of &#163;120 per household and that whatever conclusions we came to, the changes would be backdated to the start of this financial year. But I also said that I would not wait unnecessarily until November before setting out how we intend to proceed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I said that I would look at the administrative practicalities of other options that some right honourable and honourable Members have suggested, including a one-off rebate or compensatory payment as well as changes to the tax credit system to allow the average losses to be offset. Having looked at this further, I believe that a rebate scheme would be complex and expensive to administer. It would also take time to set up, and changes to the eligibility for tax credits could not be introduced this year.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80513-0004.htm"/>


<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;However, I can bring forward a proposal for this year that will offset the average loss and which will provide financial support more fairly, quickly and efficiently than any one-off rebate scheme, provided that we legislate for it now in this year&#146;s Finance Bill. For that reason, I am proposing to  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_935"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 935</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bring forward one measure from the Pre-Budget Report now. I want to help families on low and middle incomes as soon as possible. But my proposal for this year will not only help those on low incomes who lost out but also does more to help all basic-rate taxpaying families at a time when oil and food prices have been rising in every part of the world.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;So, at a cost of &#163;2.7 billion, I will increase the individual personal tax allowance by &#163;600 to &#163;6,035 for this financial year, benefiting all basic-rate taxpayers under 65. This will mean that 22 million people on low and middle incomes will gain an additional &#163;120 this year, and 4.2 million households will receive as much, or more than, they originally lost. The remaining 1.1 million households will see their loss at least halved. In other words, 80 per cent of households are fully compensated, with the remaining 20 per cent compensated by at least half. In addition, 600,000 people on low incomes will be taken out of tax altogether.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;People aged between 60 and 64 whose average loss was &#163;100 will also receive the advantage of the increased personal allowance worth up to &#163;120. They will also receive the additional &#163;50 winter fuel payment for this year, which I announced in the Budget.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The increased personal allowance will apply to all income for this tax year and so will be backdated to 6 April. As a result, from September, basic rate taxpayers will see a one-off increase in their monthly income of &#163;60 and then an increase of &#163;10 per month for the rest of the financial year</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Higher rate taxpayers were largely unaffected by the reforms announced last year so it is fair to focus this additional support on basic rate taxpayers only. However, as the &#163;600 increased personal allowance applies not just to basic rate taxpayers but also to those paying tax at a higher rate, I am therefore reducing the threshold at which an individual starts to pay tax at the higher rate by &#163;600. The net effect of these changes is that the tax liability of everyone who currently pays tax at 40 per cent will be unaffected by the increase in the personal allowance. Those brought into the higher rate will gain by up to &#163;120 this year. I propose to legislate for these changes in this year&#146;s Finance Bill so that taxpayers will get the benefit from September.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Raising the personal allowance is simpler than other solutions. It retains the benefit of a simpler tax system and allows basic rate taxpayers to see the benefits as soon as possible, and for the whole of this financial year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;My proposal will also provide additional support for individuals and families for this year, including those on middle incomes who have currently benefited from other reforms announced in 2007. We are providing this support at a time when they are facing additional costs. I have brought forward this measure from the Pre-Budget Report in order to ensure that people get the benefit as soon as possible. I shall set out proposals for next year and beyond at that time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;As I made clear at the time of the Budget, it is right and sensible to allow borrowing to rise and investment to be maintained as the economy slows.  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_936"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 936</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Debt is lower than in the past, and low by international standards. Our fiscal policy, like our monetary policy, is designed to support stability in these uncertain economic times, generated by the turbulence in world financial markets and global commodity price inflation. I am able to finance this proposal through borrowing this year, ensuring that we do not take money out of the economy at this time. I will, of course, set out my fiscal projections and decisions in the Pre-Budget Report as usual, consistent with the fiscal rules and in line with the requirements of the code for fiscal stability. For future years, our aim is to continue the same level of support for those on lower incomes and I shall bring forward proposals to do that at the Pre-Budget Report.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The change that I am announcing today represents the fairest and most effective way to help all those affected as a result of the changes proposed last year. In addition, this family tax cut provides support this year for those on middle incomes at a time where they face increased bills, so supporting the economy. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

He will know, as the rest of the House does, that I lay no claim to being the greatest expert on finance in this House, but I think we can all see that the television correspondent who said last night that the tax change was one of the most spectacular political blunders of modern times was, if anything, making an understatement.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08051345000149"></a>All of us who were out campaigning in the recent local elections know that the astonishing meltdown in the Labour vote has been related directly to the sense of shock and injustice across the country that a Labour Government could have set out to target the poor. When I look across the Chamber and see those stalwart servants of a great party who have given a lifetime to the Labour movement, I know not one of them gave their service for that.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08051345000150"></a>What is worse is that the cut in low take-home pay has kicked in at the very time when household budgets are being pole axed by rises in fuel and food prices. They face new taxes on their meals, their cars, their quiet pint or their glass of wine. Even their dustbins are now to be taxed almost daily. It comes in when inflation has jumped by the largest amount for six years, and it comes in when even the Housing Minister has let slip that house prices will fall by up to 10 per cent this year and, as she puts it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08051345000280"></a>&#147;We can&#146;t know how bad it will get&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051345000266"></a>People are hurting. Ordinary families are fearful, and that is why this decision has hit homes so hard. They feel that the Government simply do not understand.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08051345000151"></a>I have some sympathy for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Like everyone else, he knows where the blame for this fiasco lies. It lies with a Prime Minister who knew, when he announced the abolition of the 10p rate as Chancellor, that his plot to unseat Mr Blair had succeeded. It lies with a Prime Minister who thought, when he announced it, that he would have  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_937"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 937</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>had a general election before it came into effect, only he lacked the courage and decisiveness to call that election and now those problems are rebounding on him. We should not make the Chancellor of the Exchequer, still less the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, the fall guy for that, but we can all imagine what the noble Lord really has to say in private when he is on the train home north with his Back-Bench colleagues, although I am sure he puts it in better language than the Cabinet vocabulary revealed in Mr Prescott&#146;s memoirs.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08051345000152"></a>The Government should apologise profusely to the 5.3 million families who have been hit by Mr Brown&#146;s policy. My colleagues in another place will look carefully at the details of today&#146;s announcement. We and 5.3 million families have learnt to wait for the small print with the Prime Minister before coming to any final conclusions. But we welcome this anyhow for all those hard-pressed families, although we are far from clear whether they have been compensated adequately. Can the noble Lord confirm that all 5.3 million families who have lost out will be fully compensated? Can he confirm that all compensation will be backdated, and does he accept that the discredited system of tax credits, which so many people of all ages fail to claim and which in many cases is incorrectly calculated, is no long-term solution to social need?</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08051345000153"></a>We are now seeing an era of record spending, record taxation, record borrowing, constant fiddling with the tax system and massive over-regulation collapsing in chaos and confusion. Confidence in the country is collapsing, confidence in the Prime Minister is collapsing, and the unedifying and distasteful succession of tawdry memoirs from the Downing Street court reveal a Government riven by hatred, jealousy and petty rivalry. Thank goodness that we are spared that in this place. It is a picture of a Government obsessed with internal battles for power and out of touch with the real worries of the public. That is why the whole fiasco of the 10p tax rate has been so damaging: lack of touch, lack of feel, lack of vision, and a Government who no longer know how to lead or to listen. This belated bungling lurch of a U-turn offers no hope for the future of our country or for those millions of struggling families caught up in the mess that the Prime Minister himself has created.</p>

It would have been even more satisfactory if we had had sight of it in advance. Dealing with Statements on tax changes completely on the hoof is extremely difficult, particularly as over the years this Government have become a dab hand at couching Statements in terms that require a little reading before they can be fully understood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08051345000155"></a>It is a great pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. His outrage on behalf of the poor is a wonder to behold. I am privileged to have been here to listen to it. I have not heard it from those Benches in the past, and unless I have missed something, I heard nothing today about what the Conservatives would have done, how they would pay for this, or any vestige of a policy whatever. That substantiates what seem to  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_938"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 938</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>me to be completely vacuous claims to have at the heart of their philosophy those hard-pressed families to whom the noble Lord referred so movingly.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08051345000156"></a>As a result of what the Government have done and the Chancellor&#146;s announcement today, 20 per cent of those who would have lost out from the abolition of the 10p tax rate will still lose out. Our suggestion would have ensured that no one lost out. A calculation would have been made in terms of the combined effect of the lowering of the basic rate and the abolition of the 10p rate on each individual&#146;s tax liability and an individual tax rebate made to compensate those individuals. We asked tax practitioners about the feasibility of this. We understand that the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group was, in any event, about to propose it. That method seems to fulfil what the Chancellor said that he was going to do; namely, to ensure that no one would be worse off. As I say, unless I am mistaken, 20 per cent of those who would have been worse off&#151;more than a million families&#151;will still be worse off as a result of the Chancellor&#146;s Statement today. Can the noble Lord confirm that 20 per cent of families will still be worse off as a result of what the Government have said today?</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08051345000157"></a>The second leg of this equation is how one pays for the &#163;2.7 billion of extra expenditure that this change will cause. The Conservatives have no suggestion to make. The Government are clawing back some of the cost by reducing the tax threshold on higher rate taxpayers but I think the noble Lord said that, to the extent that there was a shortfall, the Government would finance it by borrowing in this financial year. Given the state of the public finances, any further borrowing at this stage is most unwise. We would have urged the Government to consider&#151;although I suspect that our urging will not force the Chancellor to change his mind&#151;deferring the benefit of the reduction in the basic rate&#151;the 2p cut&#151;for those on very high incomes, say, over &#163;100,000 a year, for one year. So, in this year at least, there would have been no additional cost to the Exchequer from this change. There is a precedent for such a move. The former wild left-wing Chancellor, Roy Jenkins, made such a levy for one year only during his period as Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08051345000158"></a>This is a sorry Statement by a sorry Government. To listen to it without hearing any of the background, one would have thought that it was a great idea long in gestation and that it will help to save poorer families from undue tax burdens. However, we know that this has been occasioned by a Back-Bench rebellion that has had a very slow fuse but a final major explosive effect. The timing of today&#146;s Statement is entirely related to the holding of the Crewe by-election next week. It is a shoddy Statement by an increasingly shoddy Government. We can join the Conservatives in only one respect&#151;in denouncing the process which has led to it being made today.</p>

The Government have taken 600,000 children out of poverty. Who on earth was in power when those children were in poverty, if it was not the Administration of the other side? We are only halfway to our target, such is the depth of poverty in this country.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08051345000160"></a>We have always maintained, as we do with this Statement, that we will continue to concentrate our resources on the less well off in society and to eradicate poverty. The Opposition are present only when there is some issue with regard to taxation that they can address for short-term political advantage. They never at any stage participated constructively in the debate about what was to be done about the situation in which the country found itself, nor have we had any indication today of an alternative strategy for dealing with this issue.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08051345000161"></a>The Government, however, have made it clear through the Statement that we intend to fulfil the objectives we had all along. First, we want to make the taxation system as simple and straightforward as possible, hence the clear reduction from 22 per cent to the settled standard rate of 20 per cent. Secondly, we want to address those groups of people who are identified as having lost out through the abolition of the 10p position. We have done that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08051345000162"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, has the merit of suggesting alternative strategies. His position is one in which no relief would be given to hard-pressed taxpayers this year, by definition; when he says that every individual case should have been analysed, calibrated and calculated, he is enjoining a full budgetary process. It would take the time of another Budget, and relief for hard-pressed families would have to wait upon that development. The Government have recognised the great public concern about the position and taken action that produces the quickest possible remedies for this position.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08051345000163"></a>I confirm to the noble Lord that 80 per cent of taxpayers will be compensated in full. We always said that we were about compensation for the average of the loss, for the simple reason that any other approach would require a degree of calculation that would incur significant delay. In order that we are able to act quickly we have to make broad judgments and take a broad decision about the question of the tax threshold, which, as the noble Lord will recognise, we have done. We are making it clear that the other 20 per cent will be compensated at least to half of what they have lost, so there is compensation for those people too, but there will be full compensation for 80 per cent of those who lost out.</p>

We are all concerned about that; we recognise the global forces that are at work. We can recall that when oil prices went up to considerably less than they are today, the other side was in government and reaping the benefits of those increased prices without there being much of an onslaught on the issue of poverty, despite the resources it enjoyed. Now that Britain is no longer a major producer of oil&#151;I am not discounting North Sea oil, but we all recognise that the energy

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08051345000165"></a>So we will not take any lessons from the other side on the politics of this position. I respect that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, does not specialise in economics, and he made the best fist he could of the general political situation, but the country will judge whether the Government have acted effectively and judiciously. I have not the slightest doubt that the country will recognise that the Government are taking massive steps to remedy a problem which had occurred and which is now largely tackled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08051345000167"></a>What astonishes me is that the abolition of the reduced rate band was not being done for the first time. In my 1980 Budget I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08051345000281"></a>&#147;The case for the lower rate band was never at all clear ... Its disappearance will simplify and shorten the PAYE tables and reduce the administrative burden on employers and on the Inland Revenue&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051345000267"></a>Some 1,300 Inland Revenue jobs were removed as a result of that simplification, so it was an entirely justifiable thing to do. But the way in which this Government have set about doing it is not by any straw of the imagination justifiable. In that Budget I said:</p>
<ul><a name="08051345000286"></a>&#147;I intend to remove the lower rate band of taxation&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051345000268"></a>which was then running</p>
<ul><a name="08051345000287"></a>&#147;at 25 per cent. on the first &#163;750 of ... income&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051345000269"></a>At the same time, I decided,</p>
<ul><a name="08051345000288"></a>&#147;to increase the main income tax allowances by 18 per cent. or so&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08051345000270"></a>in other words, to raise the threshold&#151;but</p>
<ul><a name="08051345000289"></a>&#147;not to raise the higher-rate thresholds fully in line with inflation&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051345000271"></a>in order to avoid giving undue benefits to people at the higher end of the scale.</p>

<a name="80513-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08051345000168"></a>I summed it up in these terms:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08051345000282"></a>&#147;This combination will protect the position of the very poorest taxpayers whilst ensuring that basic rate taxpayers receive some, though not complete, protection from the rise in prices&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 26/3/1980; cols. 1475-76.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051345000272"></a>In other words, the exercise was fully thought through and effectively conducted. The chaos we have been facing in the months since the current Prime Minister introduced these changes last year is a wholly self-inflicted wound caused by lack of competence and a failure even to study the precedent that we had set for them 27 years earlier.</p>

It was a quick and immediate method of bringing advantages to them. However, this tax rate should no longer play its part in our strategy for remedying poverty. That is why we have abolished it and why we now have compensation in place for those who lose out from its abolition.</p>

I personally think that the introduction of the lower rate by the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, was a great mistake and that the Government were right to abolish the 10p rate. However, will the Minister convey to his colleagues that the best way to approach this is not to pursue tactical advantage but to keep the tax system simple and raise the thresholds, which they should have done in the first place, and not to go for a gimmick?</p>

But I regret that it was done in this way in response to a Back-Bencher in another place who had a reputation for being a brilliant young man when, with respect, it should be recognised that he did not know a damned thing about taxation or anything else to do with these matters. However, for the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, to refer to higher food and oil prices as if they were all the fault of this or any other Government in this country or anywhere else is nonsense, and he must know it.</p>

But they may have great hopes of landing jobs, and when they do on a permanent basis then they will fit within the category of those we are able to compensate. As the House will appreciate, part of the difficulty in dealing with several of these groups is that they are very hard to identify. The only way of doing it comprehensively is the way that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, identified. That is a massive task and it would not meet the requirements of early action that the Government have deemed necessary.</p>

However, the right thing to do was to raise the threshold to the level at which the 10p band operated. The effect of this change means that people on quite low incomes of &#163;8,000 a year will pay twice as much in tax as they were paying before. Their marginal rate of tax has doubled. The Minister blithely says that it deals with 80 per cent, but what about the 20 per cent on low incomes?

However, the Government do not rely only on the tax system to achieve fairness for the less well-off; we have other forms of benefits and allowances to ensure that we tackle the deep-rooted levels of poverty that we inherited.

Of course we will look in the maturity of time at the development of the next Budget to address precisely that issue. We recognise the unfairness of it and the groups that have been identified. The problem is that it is easier to define the groups as a broad category but much more difficult to target the resources that must be directed to them.

It is not to be a burden on taxpayers. The other side has gone rather quiet about the recent developments with Northern Rock. That may well be because the strategy that it is pursuing is putting it fully within the framework of eventually reaching the target of being able to repay to the Bank of England that which it owes. The &#163;2.7 billion is a significant sum; no one underestimates that factor. Of course, if we are about redistributing resources and dealing with those more deserving sections of the population, costs are involved.

Amendment No. 14 is also in the group. Taken together, they are an attempt by myself and my noble friend to ask the House to consider what might happen if the hope and expectation that has been driving the policy changes in the Bill do not come to fruition and the situation does not improve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08051345000198"></a>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 would make conditional the abolition of Section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991, which requires all parents with care who are claiming benefit to claim child support at the same time. The lifting of the Section 6 requirement would be subjected to a review after three years, in 2011. That review would be laid before Parliament and would have to establish, in respect of parents with care on benefit, whether their position in relation to the adequacy of the child maintenance they were receiving had improved, deteriorated or remained the same. If their position had demonstrably deteriorated after a three-year period, the obligation to use the statutory maintenance system as a condition of receiving income support or income-related jobseeker&#146;s allowance would be reinstated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08051345000199"></a>The Minister is aware of the provenance of the amendment. Some of us following the proceedings of the Bill have become increasingly worried about how the abolition of Section 6 will work. The amendment is set against the background of a department that rightly will concentrate over the next few years on child poverty. One of the two indicators by which the department will measure progress is the number of children benefiting from child maintenance. This is a key factor in the Government&#146;s policy, as well as a concern to Members of this House.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08051345000200"></a>I start by shading in some numbers that we are talking about. I refer the House to the <I>Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary Statistics: March 2008</I>. Table 13.1 deals with the percentage of cases where the parents with care on income support or jobseeker&#146;s allowance have a positive maintenance income. The figures are revealing. The overall agency figures for the latest date available, May 2007, show that there were 441,000 assessed cases, of which only 156,000, or 36 per cent, had a positive maintenance outcome and received benefit. Footnote 2 on that table is instructive. The first sentence states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08051345000284"></a>&#147;The Child Support Agency&#146;s PSA target was to &#145;double the proportion of parents with care on Income Support or Income-Based Jobseeker's Allowance who receive maintenance for their children to 60 per cent by March 2006&#146; &#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051345000273"></a>I repeat,</p>
<ul><a name="08051345000290"></a>&#147;60 per cent by March 2006&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051345000274"></a>That table, produced in March 2008, indicates that in May 2007 that figure was 36 per cent. There is a long way to go.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08051345000201"></a>Obviously, some of the changes that the Government are making will help, such as the proposal to increase the disregard for maintenance to &#163;40 per week in 2010. I hope that that helps. The Government are bringing in a new information and support service for parents with care and I hope that that helps, too&#151;I am sure that it will. However, there is a risk&#151;I put it no higher than that&#151;that the maintenance available to parents with care on benefit after Section 6 is abolished might actually get worse.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08051345000202"></a>We also need to look at the numbers of people who are eligible to receive child maintenance in Britain. We know from the Government&#146;s own figures published by the department in December 2006, <I>A New System of Child Maintenance</I>, Cm 6979, that around 2.5 million parents were eligible to receive child maintenance in the UK. We know that 49 per cent have no child maintenance arrangements at all, 19 per cent use the Child Support Agency and 23 per cent have private arrangements. That is the current breakdown as assessed by the Government.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08051345000203"></a>The department carried out some research on those not using the Child Support Agency. The recently published study by Kazimirski and Ireland, <I>Survey of Relationship Breakdown and Child Maintenance</I>, interim DWP report No. 468, interestingly shows that of those eligible parents not using the Child Support Agency around a fifth, 22 per cent, said they preferred not to receive any child maintenance. More than a quarter, 29 per cent, said that they did not know where the non-resident parent was and a third said that, as far as they were concerned, the non-resident parent either  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_947"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 947</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could not afford to pay or would not pay any maintenance. These are difficult statistics and a lot of work has to be done. The information and support service that the Government are bringing forward has a huge job to do in trying to turn some of these figures around.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08051345000204"></a>On the other side of that issue, we know from departmental research that a third of parents with care on benefit have said that they feel confident or very confident that voluntary arrangements will work for them. That is good news and we hope that that figure will increase, but it is very important that the Government keep an eye on private maintenance arrangements made by those on benefit and monitor how satisfactory they are&#151;not just in terms of the amount but the frequency and adequacy of the help that is provided to the children that the arrangements are designed to support.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08051345000205"></a>This amendment proposes that a report should be laid before Parliament in 2011. By that time the new commission will have had a chance to put its house in order and get some idea of how effective its new powers are. The amendment also seeks to establish the amounts being paid and with what regularity in order to enable the House, in three years&#146; time, to make a comparison with how the voluntary system that we are going into can be compared and contrasted with the statutory system that we are coming out of. In the event that fewer parents with care on benefit are receiving child maintenance compared with the position now, or that the average amount of child maintenance received per child is not increased over the next three years, there is arguably a case for reinstating the automatic use of the statutory maintenance system where parents with care claim income-related benefits.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08051345000206"></a>This is not a perfect solution. There are a lot of ways&#151;this is the only one I could think of&#151;of trying to put in some kind of review process, some kind of sunset clause, some sort of compulsion on the Government to ensure that they are watching very carefully what is happening under the new system so that it is not the poorer families who suffer most should things not go according to plan. I beg to move. </p>

I have an unavoidable commitment which means I have to leave at 5 pm. My timing has been slightly thrown by the Statement. I wanted to speak to this amendment because there is much that is good in this Bill. My noble friend in particular, and officials more generally, are entirely right to congratulate themselves&#151;I certainly wish to do so&#151;on delivering from Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury what my noble friend&#146;s predecessors singularly failed to do; a decent maintenance disregard for new cases and a smaller but still welcome version for existing cases. All of that is terrific. If it works, more money will go to poorer children. That is what we are concerned about and we come to this issue with good will.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08051345000208"></a>The good effects of this on child poverty will be undermined by the new voluntarism, which remains unsafe. Why do we think that because many non-resident parents resist paying when it is a statutory duty, they are more likely to pay when it is voluntary&#151;and to that extent, discretionary, and to that extent, optional?  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_948"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 948</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Let me put it bluntly. I fear that the wish of the commission to reduce its caseload will collude with the wish of NRPs to pay less&#151;if at all&#151;and the wish of parents with children to avoid hassle with their ex-partner and to take what is on offer. It is a win-win for everybody except for the one group that matters, which is children. Essentially, the Government are relying on the greater generosity of the disregard to encourage lone parents into pressing for maintenance within a voluntary system. I am not sure whether, in policy or psychological terms, that is sound.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08051345000209"></a>We had similar arguments many years ago about good cause. I was then urged by voluntary organisations to have generous exemptions for good causes such as violence. I now think, on reflection, that those voluntary organisations were wrong and I was wrong. All that did was promote bullying by some NRPs and threats of violence encouraged by some dreadful father&#146;s groups&#151;I will not call them fathers&#146; groups; they were men&#146;s groups&#151;to avoid the parents with children naming them and the Child Support Agency pursuing them.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08051345000210"></a>Of course, the best option is for the full sum to be paid reliably and voluntarily. If one can remove Section 6 and ensure nonetheless that that happens, that would be wonderful. I do not think that that will be the case. New fathers, particularly new fathers who are coming out of casual relationships where the parent with care tends to be on benefit, as opposed to divorced fathers who tend to have a long-standing commitment to their children, have to be educated into their financial responsibilities. For many of them it will be a grudging process. In fact their own mothers, the paternal grandmothers, may be the key to all of this. We seem to be so concerned to overcome the distinction between families on benefit and the families that are not and to establish a form of level playing field that we lose sight of what really matters, which is to ensure that mothers with care on benefit who have the greatest difficulty getting the maintenance that they are due will actually get it in future.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08051345000211"></a>My noble friend is relying on the information and advice service, but I hope that he is right to do so. I congratulate him on making it as robust as it seems to be but I fear that, over the years and under pressure, it will be one of the things within the DWP to go, in the same way that similar services have unfortunately withered.</p>

<a name="80513-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08051345000212"></a>I believe that voluntarism should be a reward for steady payment from the NRP, not a risk that we appear to be taking on behalf of poor children. As my noble friend will know, I favour placing everyone on a statutory system and if, after one year, payment flows regularly, as a reward one can move on to voluntarism. That would mean that the lone parent would know what she was entitled to; there would be a year of experience in the pattern of payments; the direct debits and so on would be established; there would be an expectation of receiving the payment and taking it for granted; and the NRP would be likely to be co-operative in the hope of getting and retaining voluntary status. The lone parent would know that she could freely return to a statutory scheme when she was psychologically willing to do so. In other words, we would have conditional voluntarism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08051345000213"></a>Ultimately, despite all the very good&#151;indeed, wonderful&#151;things that the Bill does for children, I am not persuaded that we have sufficiently built out the risk of going for pure voluntarism. I am not enthusiastic about the amendment because I do not think that it goes far enough, but it is better than nothing at all in the sense that it seeks to track whether money is flowing to children and whether the fears expressed today are warranted as regards the future. I hope that our fears are not validated, but how will we know?</p>

It would make the abolition of Section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991&#151;which, as he said, requires all parents with care claiming income support or income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance also to claim child support&#151;conditional. The lifting of the Section 6 requirement would, according to the amendment, be subject to a review after three years. This review would be laid before Parliament to establish, in respect of parents with care on benefit, whether their overall position in relation to the receipt of adequate child maintenance had improved, deteriorated or, as the noble Lord said, remained the same.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08051345000215"></a>I have difficulty with the amendment because I think that it enforces too rigid requirements on parents. Although the Government have an obligation to protect vulnerable citizens&#151;indeed, someone said to me the other day that they are almost a replacement parent in some social security/DWP circumstances&#151;we must not let their parental roles transform the country into a nanny state. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, may point out that there is a risk that when the legal obligation to seek statutory child maintenance is abolished for all parents, the number of parents with care on benefit who receive child maintenance may actually decrease from the already low figure of 156,000. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, made the same point.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08051345000216"></a>I think we should recognise that the provision for child maintenance has not gone&#151;the parent has simply been given the choice whether to use CMEC. I can only assume that the responsible and sensible parent will, indeed, claim. For the Government to keep an eye on the private maintenance arrangements&#151;of which, as I said, I am not nearly as suspicious as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis&#151;made by those on benefit, as the amendment demands, there must be a voluntary register. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, did not take in that in Committee the Minister said repeatedly that no such register will exist, although I sincerely regret that and do not think that the Minister shone his usual thoughtful light on this subject.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08051345000217"></a>The basic problem, which was almost identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is that the Minister&#151;wrongly, I believe&#151;is adamant that there should be no register of voluntary maintenance arrangements. Therefore, how will it be possible for the Secretary of State to prepare the report proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, in new subsection (2) of his amendment? I remain of the opinion that there should be a way of creating such a register but, even with the  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_950"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 950</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>length of time that the Bill has taken to get to this stage&#151;we are squeezing against a particularly nasty wire in another place, as the Minister recognises only too well&#151;I have been unable, with the limited resources at my disposal, to find a way to achieve it. Only the Government, with their army of officials, can do that and, regrettably, not only did they not, but they will not do it. I am sure that my great party, in government, will indeed succeed in this. I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, that this subject remains on the agenda, but I am afraid a little patience is required.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08051345000218"></a>Further, if this Bill is to succeed, we must invest trust in its proposals. If CMEC is to encourage a voluntary sector of child maintenance payments as an alternative to statutory child maintenance payments, the Government must wholeheartedly stand behind their commitment and not temper voluntary arrangements with surreptitious control. This amendment could endanger the anticipated parental enthusiasm and commitment to the new arrangements as a result of state diktat, which, in part, is why the CSA failed. The result would surely be the worst of both scenarios. Until we have a voluntary register, I am afraid the issue is dead.</p>

It has been short but we have a shared vision that we want this to work, particularly for vulnerable parents and children. Clearly, we take different views on some key issues. Removing compulsion by repealing Sections 6 and 46 of the Child Support Act 1991 is the first step in moving to a new system of child maintenance. Compulsion was originally introduced as a means of recovering benefit expenditure and overturns any arrangements that may already be in place, even where these are working perfectly well. Forcing parents to use the state system in this way can result in conflict between parents. We know from our research that many parents would prefer to make their own child maintenance arrangements. As we have discussed extensively, both in Committee and last week, the information and support service will be made available to help parents make their own arrangements and the right decision. Those who do not want to use the statutory maintenance scheme will no longer be required to do so. Parents with care applying for benefit will have their details referred to the information and support service by Jobcentre Plus. If they choose to use the service, all the options available to them will be explained. Parents will be free to make a voluntary arrangement or an application to the statutory maintenance scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08051345000220"></a>Amendment No. 14 would mean that the repeal of Section 6 and Section 46 of the Child Support Act 1991 would only have permanent effect if, three years from commencement, the Secretary of State demonstrated in a report to Parliament that the new arrangements for child maintenance were successful. The measure of success would be whether more parents with care on benefit were receiving child maintenance, and whether the average amount of maintenance pay had increased. I sympathise with the noble Lord&#146;s view that we should monitor the effect of the changes in the approach to  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_951"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 951</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>child maintenance, and we will do so. There is already a requirement on the commission to report annually on how it is meeting its strategic objectives, its current performance against objectives and targets, and how efficiently and effectively it is exercising its different functions. We have discussed that.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08051345000221"></a>My noble friend Lady Hollis expressed the concern that the information and support service will be squeezed out in due course and that the commission will look to reduce its caseload. This will be very much directed by the targets and framework that the sponsoring department, the DWP, puts in place. It is up to us to make sure that, if that were in the mind of the commission, it does not, and is not allowed to do it. That is clearly the intent. To go further than this, as the proposed amendment suggests, fails to recognise that it takes time to implement such fundamental change for child maintenance, and for the full extent of the benefits to be realised and recognised. We have set out a staged plan for the implementation of the changes within the Bill, which we believe will cumulatively deliver significant benefits for parents and children, but these changes are not due to be fully concluded until 2013. Indeed, the new basis of assessment will not operate until 2010, so to set a decision point within three years of the first change would be to create an artificial assessment. The full range of change planned would not have had time to be implemented and bed in, nor would the benefits have been able fully to feed through.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08051345000222"></a>I believe that the amendment springs from concern that some parents may feel pushed and pressurised into agreeing voluntary arrangements whereas, in fact, they might be better off staying in the statutory scheme; or that if people leave the statutory maintenance scheme we will have no way of knowing what has happened to them or whether an effective arrangement is in place. We take the view that those concerns, although understandable, are unfounded. The commission&#146;s objectives are drafted in a manner that requires it to maximise effective arrangements for all children who live apart from one or both of their parents. If we accepted the amendment, movement to the new system might be further delayed, as we could not be clear what system parents would be moving into.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08051345000223"></a>All parents, regardless of their benefit status, should have the option, supported by the commission where necessary, to decide what are the best maintenance arrangements for them, and, most importantly, their children. Forcing them back into the statutory maintenance system would take that choice away from them.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08051345000224"></a>Amendment No. 13 proposes that Clause 15 be removed altogether. I suspect that this amendment is to enable any further discussion that noble Lords may want to have on the subject, but removing Clause 15 would prevent the repeal of Sections 6 and 46, and leave parents with care on benefit with no real choice as to how they arrange maintenance for their children. Providing parents with choice and promoting parental responsibility is a key part of the changes that we are making to the child maintenance system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08051345000226"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised issues about the register of private agreements. The White Paper made clear that there were arguments both for and against a register and that the commission needed to take a view on whether to have one, with the concept of having a pilot. So we have not ruled it out; it is something on which we wish the commission to reflect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08051345000229"></a>I recap on the information and support service, which I know we have been through extensively, but is important. The existing system has only limited effect for the financially or personally vulnerable. The current system of compulsion targets only PWCs claiming income support or income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance. For those on low incomes but working, there are no focused services; using the Child Support Agency is purely voluntary. Those who feel vulnerable but are not on benefit get little support and even when on benefits, of those who feel personally vulnerable&#151;I understand the point made by my noble friend Lady Hollis&#151;and who apply to the CSA, only 32 per cent of benefit-claiming PWCs receive maintenance. Basing an assessment of vulnerability on receipt of benefits is not a practical option. Being on benefits is not intended to be a fixed state&#151;even more so with the Government's emphasis on helping parents into work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08051345000241"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 16 and 17. The current formula for the payment of child maintenance provides for a reduction in child maintenance if the non-resident parent has overnight contact. The amount payable is decreased by one-seventh for one night a week, by two-sevenths for two nights a week, by three-sevenths for three nights and by half for four nights or more. For each night, therefore, that a child stays with a non-resident parent&#151;worked out, incidentally, by an average over a 12-month period&#151;child maintenance liability is reduced by one-seventh. In practice, this means that, unlike under the rules that applied in the family courts, there is a strong financial link between the amount of contact and the amount of maintenance paid. Having greater shared care means reduced child maintenance liability for the non-resident parent on the one hand and less child maintenance for the parent with care on the other. Predictably, this can lead to disputes over contact arrangements, particularly where there is already conflict and mistrust between parents.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08051345000242"></a>I seek in these amendments to ask the Minister whether he believes that the Bill addresses the real issue, because I do not think that it does. For me, the real issue is that these provisions encourage parents to associate the level of child maintenance payments with the amount of staying contact&#151;for want of a  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_954"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 954</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>better expression&#151;that a child has with the other parent. The parents are placed in immediate financial conflict with each other, with the parent with care tempted to minimise overnight contact so as to maximise their maintenance payments and the non-resident parent seeking to maximise contact so as to minimise the child support maintenance payments. As such, there is a complete manipulation of what should be considered the natural contact arrangements between a parent and a child.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08051345000243"></a>I am told that contact applications at court are often less about what contact should or should not take place and more about the impact on either parent of child maintenance payment responsibilities. The courts have always strongly and quite rightly discouraged the association of child maintenance payments with contact. The present shared care provisions completely undermine this principle and encourage both mothers and fathers to connect these two issues. It is inconsistent to state that a parent&#146;s obligation to maintain a child is not dependent on whether they have contact and then to provide in legislation, as we are, a provision that encourages parents to limit the amount of the contact that a non-resident parent has with a child in order to maintain a certain level of financial support.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08051345000244"></a>It is the children who are caught in this financial conflict between their parents and often their future relationship with a parent is detrimentally affected due to the argument over child support payments, which the legislation so inextricably links to contact. The current and proposed shared care provisions allow the parents to be motivated by financial, not welfare, considerations, which is not conducive for the family unit&#151;a dispersed family unit certainly, but still a family unit of a sort. This detrimental impact on the family and the child outweighs any so-called benefits provided to either the parent with care or to the non-resident parent and, unless there is significant shared care, it should not impact on maintenance payments.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08051345000245"></a>On this basis, I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s response to the suggestion of raising the shared care threshold, which would reduce the current financial conflict caused between the parents and children and allow the parents to deal with co-parenting without having to consider financial incentives for one or either parent. I beg to move.</p>

I should say up front that I disagree with his analysis. We have always been clear about not linking contact with maintenance. It would be wrong to link those inextricably. Shared care arrangements do not do that. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no inextricable link, which is right, the opportunity to have some financial adjustment to recognise the cost that a non-resident parent might incur in having contact with their children is reasonable.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08051345000247"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendment is more to do with the new arrangements in the Bill for the administration of shared care decisions. Currently it is often difficult for agency staff to decide cases where care is shared because the level of care undertaken by the non-resident  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_955"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 955</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parent is disputed, or because evidence provided by the parents is of poor quality or conflicting. There are also many cases in which parents have only recently separated and have yet to decide on care arrangements for the children, so paragraphs 6 to 8 are intended to improve the administration of such cases. We know that as many as a fifth of cases on the 2003 scheme have an adjustment for shared care, so these issues affect a significant proportion of the case load. It is a significant issue.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08051345000248"></a>Paragraphs 6 and 7 are intended to allow the commission to look forward as well as backwards in deciding what shared care reduction will be appropriate. This means, for example, that if both parents agree about the level of shared care that is expected, the commission can easily make an assessment based on that agreement. This will usually be administratively more straightforward for the commission than the current position, which requires the agency to obtain and assess hard evidence about the level of shared care in the past period, which is often as long as a year.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08051345000249"></a>Paragraph 8 will provide regulations that allow the commission to make a maintenance calculation on the basis of an assumption as to the level of shared care. This will apply only when parents agree to share care but have not yet agreed on its frequency and there is no current or past pattern of care on which the decision can be based.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08051345000250"></a>The detailed rules will be set out in affirmative regulations, so there will be an opportunity for further debate on this subject and for the commission to consider them. However, our current intention is that the assumption will be that care is shared for an average of one night a week, which is the level required to prompt the lowest reduction in maintenance&#151;a seventh. That is the most common level of reduction allowed for shared care and the assumption will remain in place for a period of up to six months. If, during or at the end of the six-month period, an agreement on the frequency of care has been reached, that will be used as the basis for an ongoing adjustment to the maintenance calculation. If no agreement has been reached at the end of the six-month period, evidence of shared care from that six-month period will be used.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08051345000251"></a>If Amendments Nos. 15 to 17 were accepted, the improvements provided by these provisions would be lost. It would also mean that recognition of shared care in certain cases could potentially be prevented until the first annual review of the case. We are fully aware that shared care is a contentious issue that attracts strong views. However, the consultation on the White Paper revealed no consensus among stakeholders for any change. Therefore, our current intention is that the shared care rules should remain largely unchanged. However, we will continue to examine the rules regarding cases of equal shared care and we wish to involve the commission in deciding the best way of proceeding.</p>

<a name="80513-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08051345000252"></a>Perhaps I may emphasise to the noble Lord that we had a lot of discussion with stakeholders about what the appropriate approach to shared care should be. Some stakeholders who represented parents with care said that there should be no adjustment, whereas  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_956"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 956</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other parents said that there should be much more significant adjustments. In the end, we determined fundamentally just to carry forward the provisions that have broadly operated since 2003. Equal care will be kept under review, in particular, although I think that it is a small percentage of the total case load and it is quite possible that, in these cases, voluntary agreements are entered into in any event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08051345000253"></a>These matters can be dealt with by regulation in due course, but the particular changes that we are making are administrative to make it easier to enter into shared care arrangements. The current broad arrangement for shared care is not unreasonable. Because there was no compelling evidence or submissions that took us in a different direction, that is where we ended up. However, I hang on to the point that I started with, which is that we do not wish to preserve in the Bill or as part of the arrangements the linking of maintenance and contact. Nevertheless, we need to recognise that contact involves costs and there should be a reasonable reflection of that. I hope that that will satisfy the noble Lord and he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However, he has not argued against my basic thought. It is inconsistent to state that a parent&#146;s obligation to maintain a child is not dependent on whether they have contact and then to produce a provision that encourages parents to limit the amount of contact a non-resident parent has with a child in order to maintain a certain level of financial support. There is a basic inconsistency. I should perhaps have said that this is a probing amendment; I take the chiding that he gave me earlier on the placing of an amendment in the Bill, but it was a hook on which to hang my thoughts and statements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08051345000255"></a>There is a question that ought to be answered at some point. It is not appropriate to answer it today, but it would be helpful if the Minister could write me one of his compendious letters on the subject before the next stage of the Bill. Under the current regime, I understand that there is the one-night trigger point, which starts from the very beginning of the maintenance assessment. He said that, if agreement is subsequently achieved, the changes will be made in consultation with the stakeholders. I think that I remember his words correctly, but he can check his notes. If that is so, there must be some record somewhere of how often that has been achieved. I would like to know the answer to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08051345000257"></a>A number of issues arise. We are carrying forward the one-seventh, two-seventh etc formula because it is the adjustment that would be made to maintenance arrangements. The administrative arrangements are about trying to determine whether we are talking about one, two or three nights a week. To date we have done that simply by looking back over what has  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_957"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 957</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>happened in practice, generally over a period of a year, and sometimes over a more representative period. However, it is sometimes the subject of quite a lot of dispute, certainly when someone is close to the thresholds. The administrative arrangements seek to bypass some of those arguments at an early stage. The adoption of the one-seventh approach is our current thinking in circumstances where both parents agree that there is to be shared care but have not established a pattern or settled on what it will be. We want to reflect something in the assessment right from the start and the sensible way to achieve that is with the one-seventh calculation. It is the most common adjustment made when shared care is undertaken as part of an arrangement.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08051345000258"></a>On ongoing arrangements with stakeholders, as we have discussed, they have and will continue to have a wide range of views. There is an issue particularly about equal care and whether any adjustment should be made for it. That is something that the commission would particularly like to focus on at an early stage and keep under review, rather than some of the other issues around the formula.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08051345000259"></a>I hope that that has helped the noble Lord. I acknowledge that, if there are financial adjustments as a consequence of maintenance arrangements, they might drive behaviour one way or the other, but it could equally be argued that making some adjustments to maintenance in order to recognise part of the impact of costs will encourage non-resident parents, so it could cut both ways. I do not think that we have a huge amount of evidence, but I will write to the noble Lord. I do not think that these arrangements are particularly driving behaviours of any kind, although they are certainly drivers of disputes that arise at the margins of the threshold. We are trying to cut some of those down and possibly&#151;this is part of the current thinking&#151;to have fixed-term arrangements for shared care just as we have for the basic assessment. However, if it would help the noble Lord, I would be happy to try to encapsulate this in a note to him and, I hope, to clarify these points.</p>

That would be a useful piece of research. He may not be able to do it in the first instance and, indeed, the CSA may not currently have the figures, but I think that CMEC ought to gather them, because I see this as a problem.

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08051356000004"></a>As noble Lords know, the purport of the Bill is that between 2010 and 2013 there will come a date for all parents with an existing child support case when liability for child maintenance under the existing assessment or calculation will end. On that date, depending on the choices they make, they will either move to the third child support scheme which we are proposing in the Bill, move to their own voluntary agreed arrangements or opt for a continuation of their current arrangements under the new cash transfer service. So much is known; so far, so good.

The amendment proposes that, alongside that full and final statement, the commission should in each case prepare a personal debt recovery and debt management plan in respect of any child maintenance arrears, which it should then proceed to apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08051356000005"></a>If the amendment were accepted it would allow the drafting of regulations that would in turn provide a warning for future debt recovery action which would be of use to non-resident parents. It would also give parents with care the confidence that they would have a clear timetable for the steps that the commission  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_959"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 959</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposes to take to implement the recovery and debt management strategy adopted in each and every case and indeed the intervals when the commission will report to the parent with care on the outcome of those steps.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08051356000006"></a>I do not think it too severe to say that debt collection has not previously been a high priority in the Child Support Agency&#146;s list of things to do. The result is that debts have been allowed to build up over long periods. We know that because we had long discussions about it in Grand Committee. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission will inherit about &#163;3.7 billion in formal child support debt. However, we are realistic enough to recognise that only a proportion of that, some &#163;1.5 billion, is regarded as effectively collectable.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08051356000007"></a>Between 2008 and 2010 the new commission will have had two years to get to grips with its new enforcement powers, which will be useful and we hope will produce a new regime that will be more effective at reducing and writing off debts in the circumstances that will obtain in future. So by 2010 the commission should be in a position to know what debts can or cannot realistically be recovered. At that point it should impart that information on a case-by-case basis to the parents with care. That will enable parents to know precisely where they stand and when their CSA liability ceases. Arguably, at that point, the commission owes it to parents with care to tell them exactly what they can realistically expect it to recover in future.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08051356000008"></a>I said earlier that the Child Support Agency&#146;s rate of debt collection was barely keeping pace with the rate at which new debts and arrears were accruing. It would help to understand some of the background to this amendment if the Minister could answer the following point, if not today then by note at some future date. I noticed a Parliamentary Question from Mr Danny Alexander, dated 19 February 2008, which said that at the end of November 2007 the Child Support Agency had 1,056,500 cases with remaining outstanding debt. An estimated 53 per cent of that total debt is due to the Secretary of State and 47 per cent to parents with care. On Report the Minister helpfully said that, at the last count, internal CSA figures show that arrears grew at about &#163;10 million a month during 2007-08. If I am reading those figures right, that means that, given the &#163;126 million collected in arrears during that same year that we know about, the CSA may just be beginning to eat into the historic debt mountain. If that is the case, it would be good to know that.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08051356000009"></a>The House will know that the operational improvement plan was set to collect &#163;213 million in historic debt by 2009, &#163;100 million of it via private debt collectors. That is probably an optimistic figure in retrospect, but it would be good to know, if not tonight then some time between now and Report, how the operational improvement plan was faring with regard to its target.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08051356000010"></a>The amendment is practical and does not involve any great principle. The Minister may say that it is all going to be done anyway, but having it in the Bill would give parents with care some confidence; it would certainly do that for me. We will listen with interest to what the Minister says in response. I beg to move.</p>

On that date, depending on the choices made, their case will either be transferred to the new third child support scheme, detailed in Schedule 4, or be moved to their own voluntarily agreed one, or they will have opted for a continuation of their current arrangements under a new cash transfer service. I suspect that the last of these three options will be the least chosen&#151;in fact, I would be surprised if it were chosen at all&#151;but obviously the Minister must give them that option in the legislation. That date will differ depending on when their particular case is dealt with by the commission.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08051356000012"></a>The Minister will recognise these words, taken from the three-year business plan of the Department for Work and Pensions for the period 2008-11:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08051356000184"></a>&#147;The launch of the Commission will help to transform our system of child maintenance by enabling and encouraging more parents to reach their own child-maintenance arrangements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051356000176"></a>It is therefore important that the Bill contains no hidden administrative disincentives. Against a background where child maintenance arrears continue to grow at the rate of, I believe, &#163;16 million a month, an enormous sum, the current Child Support Agency has made little headway in collecting accumulated child maintenance arrears, even with the improvement plan. With the transfer of existing cases to the new commission for maintenance and enforcement, we remain concerned that insufficient priority will be given to the recovery of the &#163;1.5 billion of child support regarded by the agency itself as collectable. Hundreds of thousands of parents raising children on their own still need the maintenance they are owed. Hundreds of thousands of parents bringing up children alone are owed considerable sums of maintenance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08051356000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, mentioned that under the improvement plan the agency has in the past year successfully increased its collection of arrears by &#163;35 million, from &#163;91 million to &#163;126 million. The Minister may be able to update my figures, we shall see. However, this, alas, is not even keeping pace with debt growth. I suspect it was on that sort of basis that Amendment No. 19 states that on,</p>
<ul><a name="08051356000258"></a>&#147;the date when ... liability under&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08051356000177"></a>the existing scheme &#147;has ceased to accrue&#148;, both parents should receive a full and final statement from the commission showing,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08051356000014"></a>Alongside that, the amendment proposes that the commission should,</p>

<p><a name="08051356000180"></a>for any child maintenance arrears, which it should then supply. I think that it is only reasonable to ask the Minister whether the arrangements currently in place are either appropriate or sufficient to collect debt. If

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="08051356000015"></a><a name="80513-0007.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80513-0007.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08051356000271"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, for this amendment and his interest in the transfer arrangements. The movement of cases will be one of the most significant challenges for the commission and it is important that this process is carried out efficiently and supports existing clients as much as possible. This amendment would mean that the commission would have to provide each parent with a statement at the point of transfer and each statement would have a breakdown of any debt and who that was owed to. Any outstanding debt would then be subject to an arranged debt recovery plan.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08051356000016"></a>Although the Bill provides an outline of the process, it will be for the commission to develop the detailed plan that the Secretary of State will need to approve before the transfer process begins. In that plan, we will expect the commission to set out details of how existing clients will be supported through the process. As noble Lords may be aware, I have tabled an amendment to give Parliament the opportunity to debate the regulations in the first instance.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08051356000017"></a>To provide details in the Bill at this early stage in the process may restrict the commission and would not necessarily provide the best outcome for the parents and children concerned, although I would be surprised if the thrust of what the noble Lord proposes should not be encompassed within that. At the time of the transfer to new arrangements, which will undoubtedly be a busy time, the commission will know best how it wants to deploy its resources to meet client needs. Therefore, I suggest that it would not be prudent to commit the commission to such detail at this stage.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08051356000018"></a>I shall try now to deal with the questions raised by noble Lords. The agency&#146;s debt is now the cumulative total of its 15 years of operation, and since 100 per cent compliance is impossible to achieve, arrears will continue to accrue. The agency&#146;s efforts are therefore aimed at slowing the rate of growth of debt. The agency has been successful at reducing the rate of growth from around &#163;20 million per month during 2005-06 to around &#163;16 million per month during 2006-07. I think that those are the figures I gave last week. Other agency figures show that it has decreased again to around &#163;10 million per month during 2007-08. On that basis it would be &#163;120 million during the course of a year, which is less than the arrears that are being collected. So I think that the noble Lord&#146;s proposition would be right; there is some eating into the backlog.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08051356000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked whether the arrangements in place for collecting debt were appropriate. Clearly, there is a challenging legacy. Part of that debt comes from interim maintenance assessments, which in a sense are assessments that are not necessarily based on fact but were made at the time when further details were not forthcoming from the non-resident parent. All of those will have to be sorted out, with discussions and negotiations around them, which is  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_962"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 962</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>why we have some of the provisions in the Bill. We also have in the Bill extensive compliance powers and the ability to collect on a more rigorous basis than we have in the past. We will be debating one of those powers in the next group of amendments. I believe that that suite of arrangements is appropriate but it will be a significant challenge. As for the priority given to it, that will be very much up to the framework and targets imposed on the commission by the sponsoring department and the Secretary of State. I know that there has been concern that rigour will not be applied to collecting old arrears of debt, but that is certainly not the intent. We need to ensure that that is not the outcome.</p>

<a name="80513-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08051356000020"></a>I hope that that has helped noble Lords and that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, will be able to withdraw the amendment. There will be a chance to look in detail at the transfer arrangements under affirmative regulations closer to the time once the commission has developed its plans in some detail.</p>

The amendment was drawn in terms of the basic essential requirements that any parent with care could expect in the situation that they will find themselves in after 2010. Anything less than that would be contrary to natural justice. I am absolutely certain that the new commission is not looking for things to do. I am trying to make things as easy for it as possible. But there are some basic requirements. The Minister said that these kinds of services, positions and statements will be carefully considered and arranged between the Secretary of State of the day and the commission at the time. I hope the House is saying to the Minister that any less than that would be inadequate. However, he has given me some reassurance which I am prepared to take at face value.

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08051356000028"></a>We discussed this issue in Committee, when the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, who I see is in his place, raised an amendment. I appreciate that the Committee posed legitimate questions in terms of the importance  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_963"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 963</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the individual of holding a passport and the fact that such decisions are usually made by judicial determination. However, I was struck by the similarities rather than the differences in our positions. There seems to be wide agreement that the surrender of a passport, or in some cases the travel element of an ID card, would be a useful tool to gain compliance from some non-resident parents. That is our key objective, as it will contribute to reducing child poverty and ensuring that parents support their children.</p>

<a name="80513-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08051356000029"></a>I therefore acknowledge your Lordships&#146; concerns relating to that provision and accept that the prevailing view at present is that the decision should be made by the courts. Having listened to noble Lords&#146; concerns I am content to introduce these amendments, which will mean that the commission has to apply to the court in order to disqualify the non-resident parent for holding or obtaining a travel authorisation, rather than being able to take the action administratively.</p>

<a name="80513-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08051356000030"></a>However, I hope that we can all continue generally to reflect on which decisions need to be made by the courts and which could be made more effectively administratively. To that end, I reserve the right to come back to the House in some future legislation to look again at this decision. I beg to move.</p>

Supporting government amendments is not something in which I am particularly practised, even after all these years, but in this case I am delighted that the Minister has had the good sense to see that such measures are essential if the Bill is to represent sound practice, which is what we all want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08051356000032"></a>The amendments revise the provision in the Bill that provides for CMEC administratively to disqualify a non-resident parent from holding or obtaining a travel authorisation should that person wilfully refuse, or culpably neglect, to pay child maintenance. This is an aspect of the Bill that these Benches, both here and in the other place, have strongly opposed from the start. I commend the Minister for listening not only to the Opposition but to the learned ruling of your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution, chaired by my noble friend Lord Goodlad, who championed a series of amendments to this effect throughout the Bill&#146;s passage.</p>

However, I considered it lunacy to give CMEC a power that is properly held only by the courts. The Bill may have contravened Section 1(1) of the Immigration Act 1971, which confers a right on British citizens to come and go from the United Kingdom,</p>

I may have been less than fulsome in my praise of the Minister when he moved Amendment No. 9 late on Wednesday night after a difficult day in your Lordships&#146; House. The amendment was tabled in response to an amendment that I moved in Grand Committee&#151;it was part of a large group of amendments&#151;which concerned what should go in the annual report.

Your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution deliberated carefully about the matter. As we discussed in Grand Committee, we were not convinced that the Bill&#146;s policy, which we strongly support, of having an administrative decision followed by a right of appeal with suspensory effect would meet the policy goal of avoiding a drawn-out court process, as opposed to a straightforward power for CMEC to seek an order from a magistrates&#146; court. The amendments to which the Minister spoke today seek to reflect what we recommended. I note that he reserves the right to come back with future legislation and, of course, no Parliament can bind its successors. We will scrutinise any proposals that come forward pursuant to that intention with the same rigour but, in the mean time, I am extremely grateful and support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08051356000078"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I will also speak to the other amendments in this group. These are minor and technical amendments to ensure consistency between the provisions in relation to commitment to prison, curfew orders and disqualification from driving. On the hearing of an application for a committal, curfew or disqualification from driving order, the court may order the liable person to be searched. Any money found on that person may be used as payment towards the relevant amount of maintenance arrears. The amendments allow the excess to be returned to the &#147;person searched&#148; rather than, as currently drafted, the &#147;liable person&#148;. This will, in effect, be the same person, but the amendments will ensure consistency with the curfew provisions. That will mean that in future courts will not try to read into the inconsistency something that is not there. On that basis, I urge noble Lords to agree to the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08051356000088"></a>To address those concerns, I have brought forward this amendment.

It will also mean that, where some of the arrears can be retained by the commission and the amount that is offered in settlement or which is proposed to be transferred is less than the amount that is owed to the person with care&#151;or the child in Scotland&#151;their consent will be required before the commission can exercise its powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08051356000102"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is a probing amendment to discover from the Minister more details about the disclosure of parents&#146; information to credit agencies. The commission is given powers to supply qualifying information to a credit reference agency. Will the Minister say exactly what qualifying information this could be? Will he also give me an idea of a credit reference agency that may need such qualifying information?</p>

<a name="80513-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08051356000103"></a>This clause makes me anxious that a parent&#146;s failure to pay their child maintenance payments will entail damage to their credit rating. Of course we must pursue those who do not stand up to their responsibilities in maintaining their child or children, but must we disable those who are struggling to pay on low, or perhaps absent, income? A poor credit rating creates a series of financial disadvantages. Those with a poor credit rating can find themselves able to get only high-interest loans. Their ability to get contracts for direct debit is hugely decreased and they are unable to get credit cards. It can be difficult to reverse such a credit judgment.</p>

<a name="80513-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08051356000104"></a>Is this really the right way for CMEC to gather a financial handle on those who default on their payments? The proportion of non-resident parents who, once assessed to pay, do so has barely risen in the past year, despite this being a special focus of attention by the CSA during 2007-08. In March 2007, child maintenance was being paid in 65 per cent of cases. This had risen to 67 per cent by March 2008. That means that a third of non-resident parents with maintenance liability are still failing to pay anything at all. This is clearly unacceptable. Does the Minister not agree that, given such figures, to financially hound and wound the defaulting non-resident parent making future payments would not be a beneficial strategy? Will he assure me that the financial information of the parent is private and its only status as qualifying information is within the remit of child maintenance? I beg to move.</p>

If this is a probing amendment, it might be worth running with it. However, I have difficulty in supporting the concept that, when all other systems of pursuit have been exhausted, non-resident parents who can pay but will not pay should not be hit by every means known to man.</p>

<a name="80513-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08051356000106"></a>I speak from my previous experience as a Member of the other House. The noble Baroness is right to be cautious about this. If we started using this kind of power as a first resort and in a casual way, her concerns would be absolutely fulfilled. She is right to raise these matters. However, when push comes to shove, there are some parents who make a point of giving the statutory maintenance authorities the runaround. In such circumstances, wasting their credit rating is a threat that is probably more appropriate and acute in making them see sense and shape up to their responsibilities than almost anything else&#151;that and selling their houses.</p>

<a name="80513-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08051356000107"></a>In the past, the CSA has been too slow in using some of the powers that have been available to it. The commission that we are setting up has more entrenched

That is right and proper. Although the concerns raised by the noble Baroness about misuse of this power may be well founded, I cannot for the life of me see that it is wrong. With some assurances that it will be reserved for really hard cases, where all other eventualities have been tried, I cannot see that it is wrong for people&#146;s credit ratings to be attacked positively if that is the only way of getting them to shape up to their financial responsibilities. I would encourage CMEC to do that, but only in circumstances where there are few other alternatives and all the other methods available to them have been exhausted.</p>

Clause 40 has not yet been the subject of debate within your Lordships&#146; House or in the other place. To clarify, we intend that the commission should have the ability to disclose information about non-resident parents to credit reference agencies for the purpose of linking payments of child maintenance with ability to obtain credit. Where ability to obtain credit is affected&#151;either favourably or adversely&#151;this may result in a tangible impact on the non-resident parent&#146;s lifestyle and thereby create a powerful incentive to make child maintenance payments. We intend that the information will be shared with credit reference agencies by way of electronic data transfer. Any sharing of data will, of course, comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and Cabinet Office guidelines, in particular the <I>Manual of Protective Security</I>.</p>

<a name="80513-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08051356000109"></a>Disclosure may take place either where the non-resident parent gives his or her consent&#151;presumably where it would have a favourable impact on the credit reference&#151;or where a liability order is in force. Financial services companies considering applications for credit or other services will, after carrying out a credit check with a credit reference agency, have the opportunity to take the maintenance liability into account.</p>

<a name="80513-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08051356000110"></a>In January, we published an evaluation which explored the value of child support information in predicting credit behaviour. The indications are that making child maintenance payment information available to financial services companies that are assessing a person&#146;s financial standing would mean that compliance with a child maintenance liability could lead to an improved overall credit rating. Conversely, non-compliance could have a negative impact on credit worthiness; so it should. Further research will be carried out prior to this provision being implemented. Subject to the results of that further research and consultation, disclosure of information about non-resident parents to credit reference agencies will be a significant addition to the commission&#146;s compliance and enforcement tools. It will provide non-resident parents with a real incentive to meet their maintenance liabilities.</p>

<a name="80513-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08051356000111"></a>I acknowledge that the disclosure of information held by the public sector to outside bodies is a sensitive issue, and individuals have a right to expect that their information is processed fairly and accurately. I firmly believe that disclosure of information about non-resident parents to credit reference agencies is justified in this context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08051356000112"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked whether, where the liability order is imposed, details about non-resident parents will be disclosed to credit reference agencies automatically. The answer is no. The commission would have to consider whether in any individual case the sharing of information is justified. In part, that goes to address the point made by the noble Baroness that in any case where the disclosure could not be so justified, the commission, as a public authority, would be under an obligation to exercise its discretion so as not to share the information.</p>

<a name="80513-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08051356000113"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked about people being denied access to mainstream credit as a result of the policy and asked whether that would not effectively add to social exclusion. Payment of child maintenance is both a legal and moral obligation and the amount payable by each non-resident parent is based on his or her income. Individuals are responsible for managing their own finances and should ensure that they take payments of child maintenance into account when considering their day to day living expenses and any subsequent application for credit. The key point is that in securing child maintenance payments from the non-resident parent, the commission is guarding against future social exclusion by increasing the income of vulnerable children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08051356000114"></a>Under current arrangements, where a liability order is in place, information is registered with Registry Trust, which is held electronically. The problem is that, as a practical matter, that has not been helpful to the credit reference agencies in helping to assess individuals&#146; credit ratings, because it does not give sufficient information. That there has been something disclosed in some public way would not in itself be new when there is a liability order in place. As I said, it would only otherwise be disclosed if there was the consent of the non-resident parent to disclose it. I hope that has allayed the fears. We need to proceed cautiously with this and further research needs to be undertaken. We see it as quite a powerful additional tool in the armoury of enforcement that the commission will need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08051356000120"></a>Clause 44 brings Schedule 6 into effect. The Explanatory Notes on Schedule 6 tell us that paragraph 1 stipulates that information held in relation to child support functions will,</p>

I absolutely concur with the route that she is taking. Taking out Schedule 6 is a pretty blunt instrument, because it would mean that we could not even share data with HMRC, which is not particularly sensible. The mood in which the noble Baroness introduced the amendment was more of concern about how it is done and about some of the mechanics and safeguards that are necessary. She is quite right to be worried about that as recent child support details have gone awry and gone missing in rather grand form. I hope that the Minister can say whether the Government and the department have looked again at all their compliance and data protection requirements. To remove Schedule 6 would be a step too far.</p>

As Members of Parliament we are able to have direct access to Ministers and hold them to account. That is not necessarily going to be the case in these new circumstances where these important bits of data and information containing the most personal details about some of our families throughout the United Kingdom will be handled in future by a Crown agency. That is a different situation. I reflect on, acknowledge and agree with the concerns raised by the noble Baroness. However, the amendment would be a step too far for me were it to be voted on in a Division and agreed to.</p>

In turn, the commission is also able to supply information to those government departments to enable them to carry out certain specified functions for which they are responsible. Our plans to support information sharing between the commission, DWP and HMRC will improve administration of the child maintenance calculation regime, by providing the commission with easy access to relevant gross income data.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08051356000126"></a>The problems of the current system have been well documented. By not having to ask non-resident parents for income data in the majority of cases, and by being able to rely on already available income data as provided by HMRC, we will improve the efficiency of the assessment process and provide a better service to parents.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08051356000127"></a>Removing Clause 44 and Schedule 6 would mean that the commission would have to request income information from the non-resident parent. That would undermine the case for basing liabilities on gross weekly income. It would also carry the risk that current delays in calculating maintenance and getting money to children would be repeated in the future scheme. Obtaining income data from HMRC will also provide vital support to the proposed system of fixed-term awards, helping to ensure that maintenance calculations are kept accurate, up to date and easy to administer.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08051356000128"></a>We cannot overstate the necessity of a simple and efficient calculation system for the smooth running of the child maintenance service. We estimate that the commission will be able to obtain data for about 90 per cent of all non-resident parents by combining information available through the gateways. This includes the self-employed, who have proved particularly difficult to assess in the past. We are currently investigating the most effective way to transfer data. Although ultimately this will be a decision for the commission, we will start work as early as possible to ensure that the IT is efficient, functional and, above all, secure. The information the commission will receive will not be substantially different from the information currently used by the Child Support Agency to make maintenance calculations. The Data Protection Act 1998 will apply to this information, which will be processed in accordance with the Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08051356000129"></a>Section 50 of the Child Support Act 1991 will be extended. A person will be committing a criminal offence if they inappropriately disclose information obtained as a result of working for, or on behalf of, the commission. We will publicise the planned use of HMRC data so that non-resident parents, and parents with care, are fully aware that gross income data will be used to make maintenance calculations, and also provide parents with as much information as possible about their claim. We will build in safeguards to ensure that inappropriate or excessive information is not accessible by commission staff and to ensure that all persons with care, and non-resident parents, are aware of the appeals process operated by, and the legal obligations of, the commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08051356000146"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is very rare for a member of the Opposition to move an amendment to a schedule that is solely concerned with minor and consequential amendments. At first blush, it would seem that this is a technical amendment. However, it seeks to make a very important point. It replaces the phrase &#147;one year&#148; with &#147;four years&#148; in cases where a court order for maintenance and financial settlement following a divorce may be overturned by CMEC. Its purpose is to create consistency between the objectives of the commission and its likely operation in the light of the experience that we have had of the CSA.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08051356000147"></a>I will summarise the background to the amendment. CMEC&#146;s main objective will be to maximise the number of effective maintenance arrangements for children of parents who live apart. Subsidiary objectives include encouraging parents to make and keep voluntary arrangements for the support of their children. Perhaps it would be useful to point out that this subsidiary objective is a change from the original objective, which was to incorporate, stage by stage, all financial arrangements within the auspices of the Child Support Agency. This necessitates taking careful stock of the structures of the original Act. I contend that such retention from Section 4(10)(aa) of the Child Support Act 1991, in its current form, will undermine these objectives.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08051356000148"></a>The amendment seeks to close a loophole that is used by those who seek to reduce maintenance payments to children. Currently, parents may agree financial arrangements for children and have them made by court order. However, that obligation will end 14 months later if either parent wishes to take advantage of the &#147;one-year rule&#148; by making an application to the Child Support Agency. The solicitors&#146; association group Resolution relayed a story that neatly summed up the disadvantage of what we might call, for convenience, &#147;the 12-month rule&#148;. One of Resolution&#146;s lawyers recently acted on behalf of a wife. She was in part-time employment with a local bank. There were two young children. The husband ran a popular veterinary surgery in the local area. The parties had a good standard of living during their marriage. The husband met someone else and the marriage came to an end. The wife and husband negotiated a good settlement, largely between themselves, but also with assistance from legal representatives.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08051356000149"></a>One of the stumbling blocks was maintenance. The husband reinvested a lot of the profits back into the company, but also recognised that the wife needed money for the children. It was therefore agreed that he would pay a larger amount of child maintenance.   


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_978"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 978</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They did the sums, using the 20 per cent net income figure, minus deductions for overnight stays, and the result was to agree a significantly higher figure than this. The husband also agreed to contribute to childcare costs. Had Resolution gone through the CSA or used its formula, the wife would not have been able to continue living where she was. She was made aware by Resolution lawyers that the husband could change his mind after 12 months, but she was still content. However, as predicted, after 12 months the husband is no longer sticking to the agreement. The wife has now met someone else and the husband fails to see why he should contribute to the household pot. The wife does not want to go through the Child Support Agency, having heard the horror stories. She therefore accepts a reduced amount that is causing her what was put to me as &#147;no end of financial difficulties&#148;. This is the loophole of child maintenance arrangements that is exploited by paying parents who apply to terminate higher court awards and have them replaced with lower agency calculations. This is what I would like to put an end to through my amendment.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08051356000150"></a>Generally, agency decision-making proceeds slowly, particularly in complex cases, and there is likely to be a delay of many months, during which there is no obligation to pay at all, resulting in a hiatus of payments for the child. As such, the current system permits the unscrupulous to settle their court case on one level of obligation, knowing that after one year they can endeavour to surprise the other parent by a reduction in payment. That is patently contrary to the interests of the child and is at odds with government aspirations to reduce child poverty.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08051356000151"></a>The new system should seek to stop such behaviour and create safer, longer-term arrangements for the support of children. The current rules prevent parents making reliable settlements of other claims between themselves. When parents divorce, they may divide pensions, assets, contents of the home, maybe even the home itself, and they may make decisions about the occupation of the home or spousal, rather than child, maintenance. They do so usually by balancing ability to pay and need. To be able to do that, they must predict what award will be made by the CSA or, in due course, CMEC. Unfair settlements can result where one side opts to have a second bite of the cherry by relitigating support for the child through exploiting the one-year rule. Parents may reach agreement as to the level of payments that should be made. However, most parents will still want a binding obligation to pay. That can be offered by obtaining a confirmatory court order by agreement.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08051356000152"></a>Retention of the one-year rule undermines Parliament&#146;s objective for the new commission by making that arrangement vulnerable to termination after 12 months. Merely sanctioning compliance with the threat of an award by CMEC of an uncertain amount is inadequate. Further, it will increase the demands made upon CMEC, thus undermining the meeting of its objective of encouraging parents to reach their own agreements without recourse to the commission.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08051356000153"></a>My amendment recognises that circumstances change. Many families find that after four years it is time to reconsider whether the level of maintenance is appropriate.  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_979"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 979</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Families may then want to take advantage of the CMEC scheme if they are not otherwise able to reach agreement. My amendment has other significant benefits that I doubt the Minister can refute. By abolishing the 12-month rule, families are enabled to retain greater control of how they address their financial issues. That will reduce conflict on financial questions; conflict is the feature that is most likely to bring damage to children experiencing the separation of their parents.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08051356000154"></a>Another consequence is that the amendment will protect mediation agreements that otherwise risk being undermined by the CMEC jurisdiction. Lastly, the amendment will avoid the potential ping-pong of cases between the CSA and the court. Where the CSA assessment is followed by a court order, there is a risk that the CSA will return to request a review, following manipulation or a change in the formula&#146;s variables. Such a change will either undermine the intention of the court order or lead to a variation of the spousal maintenance order. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08051356000156"></a>However, a long time ago I was a consistorial solicitor in a family practice in Roxburghshire. In my experience, there is a world of difference between the law that applies to families with assets and incomes on both sides and the arrangements that need to be made sensibly for people on income-support-based JSA. My worry is that if we agreed to the amendment as drafted, you would lock out for four years some of the parents on benefit who entered agreements. That is difficult to contemplate, because the new CMEC&#151;fingers crossed&#151;will, I hope, sort itself out and become an efficient child maintenance collection system, which people will have recourse to with confidence.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08051356000157"></a>The trouble is that you cannot pick and choose. You cannot amend the law to depend on the current net value and worth of the members of the household to whom it applies. Therefore, you have to be careful about how you do this. I just wanted to enter that caveat. I absolutely understand the case that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, made, and I understand that according to evidence there have been dire results for the people affected. But over the piece I am more confident perhaps than I have been that the new commission will set a new benchmark and that the courts will operate a new system in the shadow of CMEC. That will become much more a default situation to which people will be able to respond. I hope that that will help some of the families to which the noble Lord rightly pointed.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08051356000158"></a>My real reason for getting to my feet on this amendment&#151;and I acknowledge the fact that the noble Lord has ingeniously found a way of raising this important question on the schedule&#151;is that there is still a feeling that there is a problem in Scotland, where  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_980"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 980</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there are peculiar court procedures, with Books of Council and Session and registered maintenance agreements that are enforceable at first instance, because they are registered in the Books of Council and Session. I know that the Minister and his advisers looked at this&#151;some time ago, I suspect. I had hoped and assumed that the problem had been sorted, but I am told that civil practitioners in Scotland still face difficulties. They would certainly endorse the proposal by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, to move to a four-year period, because it would give them more scope and room for manoeuvre. I would feel a lot happier if the Minister or some of his advisers would talk to the appropriate committee members from the Law Society of Scotland, who are serious people. They are the professionals who, day after day, deal with the problems to which the noble Lord alluded.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08051356000159"></a>Arrangements that have bad effects on families last for a long time. My special plea to the Minister is that some last-minute conversations could perhaps be had with members of the Law Society of Scotland&#146;s expert committee on these matters to see whether there can be some ring-fencing of the arrangements made in the civil courts in Scotland. The last thing that we want is to have some mad nationalists running around saying that this mad Parliament in Westminster is interfering with our age-old, tried and tested systems of civil litigation in divorce and consistorial cases. That would serve none of our interests.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08051356000160"></a>My main point on this important amendment is to ask the Minister to look carefully again at this and perhaps agree to see representatives&#151;or get some of his advisers to see representatives&#151;who could argue the case regarding the peculiar circumstances of Scotland more adequately than me.</p>

The amendment would prevent those parents from applying for a period of four years. The existing 12-month rule applies when parents have a maintenance order or registered minute of agreement made on or after 3 March 2003. That rule has two main purposes.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08051356000162"></a>First, when agreement between parents breaks down it provides a swift and readily available route into the commission so that children are not left for considerable periods with either no maintenance or inadequate arrangements. Secondly, it encourages agreements that contain levels of child maintenance broadly consistent with the amount calculated under the statutory scheme and discourages agreements that divide property and assets between adults, leaving children without regular ongoing payments of child maintenance.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08051356000163"></a>I want to make it clear that the commission does not wish to intervene or disturb court orders that are working well. It is parents themselves who must decide whether or not their children&#146;s interests are best served by the provision of a consent order, or by a maintenance calculation made by the commission,  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_981"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 981</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or by some other route. We do not wish to restrict any effective and agreed maintenance arrangements, in whatever form, to a year, four years or to any other period of time.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08051356000164"></a>The 12-month rule cannot of itself act to set aside a court order and substitute a statutory maintenance calculation. Only the action of one or both parents can do that. Our hope is that parents with effective court orders will not need to turn to the commission for a calculation under the statutory scheme. The agreements will continue and benefit the children for so long as both parents want them to.</p>

<a name="80513-0010.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08051356000165"></a>During the progress of this Bill, Ministers have listened to a number of differing, detailed arguments on the 12-month rule, both here and in another place. Some amendments have been tabled which propose to remove the 12-month rule altogether; others to extend it to a longer period. The debate throughout has been constructive, but on the issue of extending the 12-month rule I remain unconvinced. Primarily, I am not persuaded because this issue has not been raised&#151;as far as I am aware&#151;by clients of the CSA themselves. Generally, when parents who use the CSA&#151;or want to use the CSA&#151;are unhappy about its delivery, Ministers, and indeed MPs, are quick to hear about it.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08051356000166"></a>I have recently been provided, by the good offices of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and his colleagues in another place, with 15 items of correspondence from family lawyers&#151;and I guess this is the correspondence shared with the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood&#151;giving examples of cases where they believe the 12-month rule may not have helped their clients. However, bearing in mind that some 20,000 consent orders are made each year, this is not a great body of evidence and we would need significantly fuller information before we overturn something that appears to be working well and in the best interests of children.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08051356000167"></a>We want to encourage agreed, effective maintenance arrangements which provide ongoing support for children. As long as parents are happy that their arrangements are providing adequate maintenance for their children, they can continue. We consider that a 12-month period strikes the balance between giving court orders a chance to bed in and providing a means to resolve difficulties quickly and keep payments flowing. If things do go wrong, parents need the choice of a readily available route into the commission. My opinion is that a period of four years is too long to deprive parents of that choice. Parents and children should not be left, for considerable periods, locked into the court system when maintenance may or may not be paid or maintenance arrangements for children may no longer be adequate or working. Parents should have the ability to resolve these issues, gain access to the commission and get payments flowing quickly.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08051356000168"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, outlined an interesting example of what had happened. First, he assured us that the parties entering into that agreement were well aware of the 12-month rule and what the commission&#146;s arrangements would offer. I suppose the point is that if the non-resident parent wanted a lower level of maintenance to flow, it was always their right to enter the commission and get that from the calculation.  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_982"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 982</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I understand that some of the 15 cases that are presented to us are about information flows. We have amended the Bill to enable information provided in court to be shared and, I hope, have removed that impediment.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08051356000169"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about arrangements in Scotland and issues that are seemingly still unresolved there. I am unsighted on that. Rather than try and scramble through my notes, I will talk to officials and perhaps we should discuss that further. It is not an issue, as far as I am aware, that seems to be raging and a major problem. If it is, these things often show themselves, particularly with legislation entering its final stages. The 12-month rule gives time for agreements to bed in and allows swift intervention by the commission to keep maintenance flowing to children, and therefore puts parents with court orders on the same footing as any other separated parents. On that basis&#151;although I am sure he will not be entirely happy&#151;I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment</p>

Despite his conciliatory words, I am still extremely disturbed by the evidence that has been put to me, although I accept that it is not a vast body of evidence as the noble Lord said. I ask that the Minister takes up the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, but, please, do not confine the investigation to Scotland. This Bill covers England as well and the Law Society in England is just as reputable a body as the Law Society in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08051356000171"></a>The noble Lord, in his objection to the case that I elucidated about the mother, left out a germane series of facts in his refutation of it. The reason the husband is no longer sticking to the agreement is, as I said, that the wife has now met someone else and the ex-husband fails to see why he should be contributing to the household pot. This would not happen under CMEC because he would be forced to continue to contribute to the pot.</p>

I thought he said that because of circumstances, relationships had changed and the non-resident parent had decided he did not want to contribute any more. If he had to wait four years for the PWC to get access to the commission, it seems to me a very disagreeable outcome. I did not pick up the points about the efficiency of the commission, which we could debate endlessly. They will improve, given what is in this Bill. That ability, when circumstances change, for one party or the other to be able to go to the commission seems to me vital. The noble Lord has just illustrated that point.</p>

There was a world before the CSA.

There is no earthly reason why an inconvenienced parent should not go back to court for this operation, which I think is the answer to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. I will continue to ponder on the amendment and I reserve the right to come back to it at the next stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The key legislation is the Licensing Act 2003, which gives licensing authorities a wide range of powers to tackle alcohol-related crime, nuisance and disorder, including violent crime and underage sales, if they can be attributed to individual premises. These powers include the modification, suspension or revocation of licences on review.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08051368000015"></a>However, although a wide range of legal powers is available to the police and local authorities, it is not always possible to make a clear link between the crime and disorder happening in and around one or more licensed premises with the premises themselves. The alcohol-related crime and disorder in the public space may be the cumulative result of people drinking in a number of on-trade licensed premises or by purchasing alcohol in one or more off-licences when, for example, they are already intoxicated. In such cases, the provisions in the Licensing Act may be insufficient to ensure that these premises act in a collectively responsible manner. There will almost certainly be a need for additional enforcement activity. As such, as a measure of last resort, alcohol disorder zones have been designed to enable local authorities, in partnership with the police, to tackle high levels of alcohol-related crime and disorder within a defined zone by requiring licence holders in that zone to pay for additional police and local authority enforcement services. If licensed premises are part of the problem, we argue that it is only right that they should be part of the solution.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08051368000016"></a>To be fair, I am not saying that all licensed premises are part of the problem&#151;far from it. Many trade very responsibly: they do not sell to kids; they do not sell to drunks; they do not have silly promotions that are designed to get people so drunk that they do not know what day of the week it is; and they ensure that at closing time dispersal is managed in a calm and efficient way, and that glasses are properly tidied up so that they do not become lethal weapons.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08051368000017"></a>However, we also know that this simply does not apply to all pubs, clubs, off-licences and supermarkets. Far too many sell to under-18s and to people who are already drunk. Far too many do not trade in a responsible way and, as a result of their &#147;it&#146;s not my problem&#148; approach, they collectively make the spaces in some towns and cities unpleasant places to be in the evenings and at night.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08051368000018"></a>We argue that, once all other options have been exhausted, alcohol disorder zones should be considered to ensure that licensed premises collectively behave in a responsible way. Critics of ADZs will say that they are unnecessarily bureaucratic, but they have been designed to ensure that licensed premises are given an opportunity to change before any charges are imposed on them.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08051368000019"></a>To ask a fair question, how will they work in practice? There are three key stages to an alcohol disorder zone: proposing to designate an area as an ADZ; the action plan stage; and, finally, the designation and operation of a full ADZ. If, following the proposal stage, where a local authority consults on whether to have an ADZ in the first place, the local authority decides to move ahead, it will then publish a voluntary

The action plan will set out a combination of measures that should prevent alcohol-related crime and disorder taking place in that specified public space.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08051368000020"></a>The action plan will involve the local authority, police and licence holders by setting out what is to be expected from each of them. For example, the police may agree temporarily to put on additional police during the early hours and licensed premises will be expected to sign up to an approved accreditation or award scheme, such as &#147;Best Bar None&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08051368000021"></a>Under the action plan, the affected licensed premises will be given a chance to make the necessary changes and, if they do, there may be no need for the local authority to take any further action. However, in cases where there has been insufficient implementation of the voluntary action plan on the part of licensed premises, the local authority may designate that locality as an ADZ. Designation allows local authorities to levy compulsory charges on certain licence holders for above-normal levels of enforcement activity by that authority and the police, such as frequent visits by police officers or police community support officers to licensed premises or additional activity by trading standards officers.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08051368000022"></a>I want to be absolutely clear that a local authority should consider designating a locality as an ADZ only after all other measures available to that authority, and to the police, to tackle high levels of alcohol-related nuisance or disorder have been tried and have failed to solve the problem. ADZs are not intended to be used like any other tool; they are very much a measure of last resort. In any event, the ADZ must be reviewed every three months to ensure that it is still required.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08051368000023"></a>It is not known at this stage exactly how many ADZs will be designated in the first year. The regulatory impact assessment estimates that 30 areas will start the ADZ process in the first year, but it could be that all or none move towards full designation. This will depend entirely on the success and take-up of the voluntary action plan.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08051368000024"></a>I now want to address some of the specific issues that have been raised in relation to ADZs. The first is the charging mechanism. The first step for the local authority in calculating charges that will apply to licensed premises is to work out the total cost of administering and enforcing an ADZ. This will be the total of the costs to the local authority of imposing, collecting and recovering charges, and reviewing the ADZ, plus the costs of additional policing and local authority services. Local authorities should aim to keep the costs of administering charges and reviewing ADZs as low as possible. We expect these costs to be recovered over the first three months of ADZ charges and for the level of charges to be reduced after this time.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08051368000025"></a>Having worked out the total cost of administering and enforcing the ADZ, the second stage in calculating charges is to spread the total cost of an ADZ among individual licence holders, who are not exempt, in accordance with Regulation 16. This is done by local authorities using the national ADZ charging formula  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_986"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 986</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that allows for local flexibility. The formula comprises two indicators: first, the premises&#146; rateable value as a proxy for capacity; and, secondly, the hours of opening during the ADZ service period. All licensed premises will be scored against both indicators. The formula sets out that individual premises&#146; total scores are calculated by either multiplying or adding together their scores under each of the two indicators. The local authority may give more or less weight to either of the two indicators. The total score that the premises receives will determine the charge that it has to pay. To make this as easy as possible for local authorities, the accompanying guidance gives a worked example to take them through it step by step.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08051368000026"></a>Some have asked whether supermarkets will be exempt from the charging mechanism. The short answer is no. If the availability of alcohol is one of the main reasons why people visit a supermarket during an ADZ service period, then it is right that it is liable to pay a charge.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08051368000027"></a>Although earlier versions of the regulations allowed for a 100 per cent discount, we were advised that this was ultra vires, as the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 does not allow for an exemption and a 100 per cent discount amounts to an exemption. As such, it was thought necessary to amend the regulations. However, when calculating the charge for premises that are open only for a short amount of time during the ADZ periods, it is possible that they will receive a large reduction in their charge. If premises are open for a short amount of time during the hours in which the ADZ period is operating, its score for hours of opening during the service period will be low. If a local authority multiplies the premises&#146; rateable value score, whatever that may be, by this low score, the total score or charge to be paid will also be much lower than that of identical premises that are open throughout the ADZ service period. In this way, premises that are open only for a short time during the ADZ service period will pay a much lower charge.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08051368000028"></a>To conclude, as I have said, the alcohol disorder zones represent a solution to the current problem of it not being possible to get collective change from a number of licensed premises in any given location. They are designed as a measure of last resort. Even then, it is to be hoped that licensed premises will avoid incurring compulsory charges by choosing to comply with the voluntary action plan. Where they do not, it is right that a tougher approach should be taken, and that those responsible for contributing to crime and disorder pay for the services of those who have to deal with it. I commend the regulations to the House. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08051368000031"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this House, in its wisdom, established a Merits Committee to look at the merits of statutory instruments. The Minister will be aware of what the Merits Committee has said in the case of these regulations. It has found them wanting, even given that they have been laid previously and withdrawn, and that this is at least the second time that they have been laid. Does the Minister not think that, when the Merits Committee, with all the legal experience of the noble and learned Lords who sit on it&#151;not least the experience of the chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, who has long experience, as I know the Minister has, of local government&#151;says that the regulations are unduly bureaucratic, and possibly therefore unworkable, that the Government should withdraw the regulations and think again? It does the Government no good to bring in regulations that bring them into disrepute in this way.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08051368000032"></a>Although I am going to address the substance of the regulations now, it is the comments of the Merits Committee that bear particular scrutiny. What is the point of your Lordships&#146; House having a Merits Committee? It has come up with the strong comment that the ADZ system will be unduly bureaucratic and be,</p>
<ul><a name="08051368000082"></a>&#147;without a clear idea of how it fits with the other items in local authorities&#146; toolkit for combating alcohol- fuelled disorder&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051368000033"></a>In other words, it is worse than useless. I do not know what the Merits Committee could say more strongly to make the Government rethink the regulations, which they have got wrong. I urge the Minister to exercise his ministerial discretion. I realise that civil servants have been asked to draw up the regulations and that it was in the Labour Party&#146;s manifesto that this would be done. Having made an effort to draw them up, they still have not come up with the goods. The Minister needs to bear that in mind and have another go at them. That is what I am asking him to consider this evening.</p>

<a name="80513-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08051368000034"></a>Now I will address the substance of these regulations. We on these Benches would not dispute that there is a problem with alcohol-related disorder in town and city centres. Indeed, the British Crime Survey shows that alcohol was involved in 46 per cent of violent crime incidents. The Home Office&#146;s own figures show increases in violent crime between 3 am and 6 am since the introduction of the Licensing Act. Hospital A&amp;E admissions have doubled since 1997 and A&amp;E admissions of those aged under 18 for alcohol-related conditions have increased by more than 2,000 in the past 10 years. I will not go on quoting figures; there are enough there to show that there is a significant problem. We are certainly not disputing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08051368000035"></a>We also contend that local authorities and businesses have taken considerable steps forward. There are 62 business improvement districts around the country. That is very important. That is the community coming together. Those are businesses recognising their responsibilities to the social life of their area, and working with local authorities to improve it. I wonder  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_988"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 988</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>how much discussion the Government had with them before drawing up these regulations. Then there are several local schemes, of which I am sure the Minister is aware, ranging from the Community Alcohol Partnership in St Neotts, Cambridgeshire, to one that I am aware of in Somerset, called Operation Joined-up. I discussed alcohol-related incidents with Councillor Mochnacz, the county councillor concerned with community safety issues. The one thing that he would have liked the Government to do is bring in a power to enable local authorities to require the use of shatterproof glass if it was thought necessary. That was echoed by the police, who were also at my meeting with Councillor Mochnacz. They said that the single thing that would reduce the bad effects of alcohol would be the introduction of either safety glass or a complete alternative to glass. That was a very positive suggestion, on which the Minister could act. I should be grateful for his comments on that.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08051368000036"></a>The ADZs have attracted criticism across the board, from industry, the police, the LGA, LACORS and, not least, as I mentioned, the Merits Committee itself. Why? Because if they are bureaucratic, it is unlikely that anyone will use them. As the Minister said, they are a tool of last resort, but if they are this bureaucratic, is it likely that local authorities will make such a rod for their own backs, and one that will take so much time? To give an example of where they are bureaucratic, the Minister quoted the charging mechanism. The charging mechanism assesses premises by rateable value and hours of opening during the service period. The Minister said that rateable value was a proxy for capacity. That is impossible to measure. A big pub, perhaps with bedrooms and serving suppers, would have a high rateable value as big premises, but the amount of alcohol consumed and the amount of disorder to come from that pub might be minimal, compared to a smaller, rather &#147;shacky&#148; type of nightclub, selling alcohol to kids already loaded up with vodka before they go in. It might be vodka purchased 20 miles away. I do not believe that this charging mechanism will be able to withstand all the appeals that will be brought as soon as the first ADZ is established.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08051368000037"></a>The Minister also made a comment about supermarkets. Noble Lords will understand that a supermarket will have a defence. Somebody will go in for 12 cans of Special Brew and one bottle of vodka, but, thinking about it, they also buy a pint of milk and a newspaper. They can claim, quite rightly, that they were going to have a coffee before they went out drinking, so it was the pint of milk that drew them into the supermarket. The supermarket can carry out a few surveys like that and quickly say that it should be exempt. There are all sorts of problems with the charging mechanism, as highlighted by everybody else who has been through these regulations.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08051368000038"></a>Then there is all the police time that will be taken up by this, when the community would rather that police officers were out on the beat, talking to youngsters and discouraging violent behaviour in the first place in that way, which we know a police presence can do. We do not feel that the charging system reflects the whole idea behind the zones. The Minister should also explain how they will be a proper differentiation between

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08051368000039"></a>I know from talking to owners of wine bars, for example, that some are incredibly responsible and go to enormous lengths to ensure that their staff are trained not to serve alcohol to customers whom they feel are over the limit. In town centres where there is joined-up working, they have systems whereby they warn one another about groups of people going around who should be refused that evening because they are, it is felt, over the limit.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08051368000040"></a>The other option that the Government had was to ensure better enforcement of existing laws. There is an explanation of how ADZs will fit alongside other measures, but I bring the Minister back to the fact that the Merits Committee, having examined it, felt that it was not clear how they would fit with the other items in the local authorities&#146; toolkit. I remind the Minister that the police already have sufficient powers covering all sorts of issues concerning alcohol and violence. They can even confiscate alcohol under a designated public places order, with a variety of punishments depending on the nature of the disorder: fines, temporary closure or review of the premises licence.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08051368000041"></a>As the Minister will know, responsibility comes back to the local authority as the licensing authority. This is my last point: the licensing authority&#151;the local authority in its guise as a licensing authority&#151;must take numerous issues into account. It does so responsibly with a lot of local input, but I believe that, under the regulations and the Licensing Act guidance, it is illegal for local authorities to promote a voluntary code or scheme against the practices that encourage binge drinking. Only the industry can commence such a scheme. I would like the Minister to say whether I am correct about that, as it seems surprising. Local authorities would like to have that power, which would tie in with their licensing authority powers.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08051368000042"></a>We believe that, although the effort being made through ADZs to control violence that comes from heavy drinking and alcohol-related abuse in town centres is worthy, the regulations fail, for all the reasons that I have given. I urge the Minister to withdraw the regulations and let his department have another go at them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08051368000045"></a>None of us is under any illusion about the seriousness of the problem of alcohol-related disorder, but the history of the regulations, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned, has been a mess. The Merits Committee in its report makes some unusually trenchant criticisms. We welcome the Government&#146;s decision to reconsider the regulations, but we still feel that they have not gone far enough. The plans for the ADZs are still amiss and bear all the signs of not having been thought through properly. They are impractical and grossly complicated. The consultation period was too short. Serious reservations have been expressed by the Local Government Association and ACPO.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08051368000046"></a>Attention has been drawn by both speakers to the problems with the supermarkets. We remain deeply sceptical about the effectiveness of the provision. Those bodies are very well advised and I am extremely concerned that they may escape the full rigour of the ADZs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08051368000047"></a>I urge the Government to think again. If we are unsuccessful, we shall watch the progress of the regulations carefully. My party remains committed to more control by local councils of licensing, more visible policing on the streets and a firmer approach to those who cause disorder having drunk to excess. I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

The noble Baroness gave us a full flavour of her concerns. That is fair enough; it is why we have these debates. I know that there was a similarly robust response to the moving of the regulations in another place, and rightly so.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08051368000049"></a>We had a good debate on this when we passed the original legislation, which I quite enjoyed shepherding through the House. We then had a constructive engagement about ADZs, although I think that both parties opposite expressed some concerns. I am sure that I reflected at the time that we had to try to get the practicalities right.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08051368000050"></a>In fairness, the Merits Committee has, as it always does, done the House a service by highlighting some issues and concerns. We should be grateful to it for its comments, although noble Lords will gather from what I am about to say in response that we do not entirely agree with its conclusions.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08051368000051"></a>I ought to comment on the fact that the regulations were initially delayed and brought back after some drafting amendments. That was because there was some misdrafting and we wanted to get this absolutely right. In fairness, that raises the question whether we have the mechanism absolutely right. We think that we have, but if in the light of experience what is, after all, a new and groundbreaking policy is found to be wanting in some regards, we are flexible enough to come back to amend the regulations so that they work better. We do not anticipate that, but I say that because we have that degree of flexibility.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08051368000052"></a>On whether the regulations are unduly bureaucratic, in the terms of the Merits Committee report, the worry is understandable. It comes from the tiered approach that we have created, where you have first the proposition, then the action plan and then the full ADZ. In a sense, that approach is designed to remove  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_991"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column 991</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bureaucracy, because if you do not need the action plan because remedial measures and steps have been taken by responsible businesses in the area, you do not have to proceed any further. If a local authority has an above-normal alcohol problem and sets out the steps that it plans to take, it is surely a good thing if those steps lead to a reduction in the problem without having to go to the full-blown ADZ process.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08051368000053"></a>The noble Baroness gave some examples of good practice around the country where local authorities and police forces have worked well together with partnerships to determine how to tackle local alcohol problems and what actions best work to resolve them. In many of these cases, the licensed trade takes positive steps to help to address the issues of concern. That is what we are asking local authorities to do. Police forces working with them in partnership will also be asked to do this. There should not, therefore, be any additional bureaucracy in that process.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08051368000054"></a>In the first instance, I think that only a few areas&#151;perhaps half a dozen or so&#151;will take up the full range of ADZ powers, having gone through the initial stages. That is because, as I have said several times, ADZs are a measure of last resort. The tools and powers available to the police will have worked, or the threat of an ADZ will have pushed those problem premises into taking action in their own self-interest. We will be more than happy to be flexible over these issues and we will probably want to report back to Parliament in 12 months or so on how the regulations work and on the operation of the ADZs.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08051368000055"></a>The noble Baroness referred to other elements of our toolkit. It is true to say that we have a wide-ranging kitbag at our disposal and local authorities are making good use of it. About 60 are already using different elements of the measures that are available in the Licensing Act 2003 and in other places to try to improve the management of premises and the general performance both of licensed premises and of localities.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08051368000056"></a>I take the point about business improvement districts having a potential impact. There is evidence that bids in city-centre areas can be useful in tackling issues such as this. However, one has to remember that a bid is an entirely voluntary process. The difference between a bid and the ADZ approach is that, if neither the voluntary approach nor the action plan has worked, there is a measure of last resort to force the issue and to make sure that measures are taken to tackle the problem. That is the big difference. Ultimately an ADZ can make licensed premises comply, whereas bids may be something the local authority considers as part of an action plan; they cannot be a substitute for making premises act in a collectively responsible manner.</p>

I have in mind St James&#146;s Street in Brighton, which has all of those things. It occasionally has a problem with disorder which is related to the consumption of alcohol in that part of the city. You would be hard pressed to say which pub or club is the cause of the problem. The licensing authority has the flexibility to isolate a particular premises and to deal with it in a particular way. As the noble Baroness will readily admit, these powers can work well.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08051368000059"></a>I want to move to a few of the other points that the noble Baroness made. She made reference to shatter-proof glass and safety glass. It is sensible for pubs to have access to those and it may well be that a pub or club that has a particular problem makes use of them. It makes great sense. The noble Baroness&#146;s discussions with a Councillor Mochnacz alerted her to that particular issue. One would want to encourage best practice in licensed premises.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08051368000060"></a>I thought that the rateable value point was relevant but only in so far as we understand it as one part of the formula. We also have to understand that the local authority has some flexibility through the discounting scheme. That should enable the charges to be more finely tuned. We accept that the charging mechanism may at first instance be seen as complex but that reflects the way in which different areas work, the way they have different types of licensed premises and the way those premises might contribute in different ways to a larger problem.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08051368000061"></a>A charging mechanism that simply took the cost of enforcing and administering an ADZ and divided that amount by the number of licensed premises could disproportionately affect some premises, particularly restaurants, but not others, such as nightclubs. If the licensed premises with an ADZ were all the same type&#151;pubs, for example&#151;then a local authority might consider it sensible simply to divide the costs more evenly, in which case it would be very straightforward indeed. The key point is that, without the flexibility that we have included in the regulations, local authorities would not be able to make sensible decisions about what amounts to charge particular premises.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08051368000062"></a>We have a clear idea of how the ADZ benefits operate as a method of combating alcohol-fuelled disorder and we think that it is right to say that local authorities and the police have those powers to deal with alcohol-related problems. The Licensing Act 2003 is a key tool in the local authority&#146;s arsenal. If it is used well, it can reduce many of the problems associated with problem premises. However, the Act is about targeting specific premises. It does not allow local authorities to take action against premises when the problems occur in the public space between a number of licensed premises. It is that gap that the legislation aims to fill.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08051368000063"></a>There are avenues of complaint for licence holders who are concerned about the application of the charges. All local authorities have a formal system of redress for complainants and local authorities should incorporate provision for addressing licence holders&#146; complaints about ADZs into those complaints procedures. There

They also have the facility to apply for judicial review.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08051368000064"></a>These measures are sensible and practical. I take the point that for some they may at first blush feel a bit unwieldy. When they are seen to work in practice, however, areas that have a problem with alcohol disorder on the streets caused by an accumulation of different sorts of licensed premises will see a longer term benefit.</p>

<a name="80513-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08051368000065"></a>I have heard what the noble Lords have said this evening. We will keep this policy area under review. We would be foolish if we did not as we want to make these things work and work well for the communities that might be affected by them. For those reasons, I hope the House will support the regulations.</p>

On the broader point of the debate, I think this House will look very carefully, as it should, at the way the Government react to the reports of the Merits Committee on secondary legislation. The Minister will know that both opposition Benches have been very cautious about the amount of secondary legislation coming through. They are very nervous that more and more is being devised as secondary legislation by the Government. That is the very reason for the Merits Committee. When secondary legislation is not satisfactory&#151;bearing in mind that we cannot amend it; we can only vote it through or not&#151;it behoves the Government to take account of the comments of the very committee that we set up to look at this.</p>

<p><a name="08051344000007"></a>Clause 1 agreed to.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000008"></a>Schedule 1 [<I>The Homes and Communities Agency</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="08051344000009"></a><a name="80513-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051344000069"></a>Earl Cathcart</b> moved Amendment No. 1:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051344000060"></a> Schedule 1, page 148, line 5, leave out sub-paragraph (1)</p>
</ul>
<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000010"></a>The noble Earl said:<I></I>I remind the Committee of my declarations of interest at Second Reading. The amendment would remove paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 1. That may be a little drastic, but I assure the Committee that it is a probing amendment aimed at provoking discussion on the composition of the board of the HCA.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000011"></a>The Government have set the HCA the target of contributing to the delivery of 3 million new homes by 2020. That represents a building rate of 250,000 homes per annum, of which 70,000 homes per annum will be social, affordable housing. It is an ambitious task&#151;some would say that it is overoptimistic, even unachievable. I know that there was much debate in the other place about whether these targets would be met. I do not want to go down that road: we are where we are. During the past 11 years, in the period of a property boom, only 145,000 new homes per year were built on average.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000012"></a>Many noble Lords commented at Second Reading that those in the building industry will not build any new homes because they cannot sell those they have already built. For them, this makes sound commercial sense. The credit crunch has knocked out demand for the purchase of property. The prospects for new build are bleak, at least for the next two or three years. Even today, chartered surveyors have announced that the housing market has not looked so negative for 30 years.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000013"></a>So the HCA has a huge problem. But it should look at this not as a problem but as a challenge. If there is no demand for open-market housing, where is there demand? There is undoubtedly demand for affordable social housing. Eleven years ago, 1 million people were on the waiting list. Last year, the figure had risen to 1.7 million, and it continues to rise. Those who face repossession of their homes&#151;an estimated 45,000 people this year and goodness knows how many next&#151;will need rehousing. And now first-time buyers cannot get a mortgage. Last  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC264"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>year, there were only 300,000 first-time buyers, representing the lowest number for many years&#151;I have heard that it may be 25 years, but that may be an exaggeration.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000014"></a>At Second Reading, I suggested that the figure for applicants on the waiting list may be closer to 2 million, but even that may be a low estimate. Last Friday, when I visited my dentist, the receptionist was talking to a lady about how her son, who was divorced, had had to move into her spare room with his son. The other lady said that her daughter and child were sleeping on her sofa. I could not resist asking, &#147;Are they on the waiting list?&#148;. They both said, &#147;No, they need housing now, not in 10 years&#146; time. What&#146;s the point?&#148;. There must be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people like that. So my estimate of 2 million on the waiting list may be far too low.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000015"></a>The demand for social housing is there and the challenge for the HCA is how to supply and satisfy that demand. Many landlords and councils up and down the country have devised schemes to develop social housing, but they often come up against barriers to delivery. Perhaps I can cite one or two examples. My neighbour in Norfolk wanted to convert redundant farm buildings into five social housing units, but permission was denied as they were just outside the village boundary. There are barriers preventing councils which transferred their housing stock to housing associations providing further meaningful social housing&#151;I think there is a limit of only 50. Seventy-five per cent of the proceeds from buy-to-let are removed by the Government, thus starving councils of the means to build more social housing. There are many other barriers&#151;I have merely highlighted two or three.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000016"></a>I make no apologies for labouring the current state of the market, but it is vital that the board of the HCA continually undertakes this soul-searching about where to concentrate its endeavours. This brings me to the composition of the HCA board. Board members will need to think outside the box, to be flexible, to look at all the options and, above all, at the market conditions prevailing at the time. How will they deliver and what rules need changing to ensure delivery? It is not about words, promises and targets; it is about delivery. To build houses one obviously needs landowners&#151;private, council or developers&#151;housebuilders, planning permission and, above all, money.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000017"></a>I do not wish to be prescriptive on the face of the Bill about the composition of the board, but I would like to throw in a few ideas. There needs to be representation on the board from those organisations which operate at the coal face. Should there be representation from the local government associations as owners of land, providers, or would-be providers, of social housing and in relation to planning issues? What about the Home Builders Federation in relation to owners of land and builders of these new houses? What about the Country Landowners&#146; Association which represents private landowners? If the initial concentration of effort is to be on social housing, what about the National Housing Federation or ALMOs?  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC265"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC265</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Other Members of the Committee may have other suggestions: for example, on regeneration, creating communities and sustainable development. I would also like to see a champion for rural housing represented on the board. All too often rural housing has been an afterthought and it needs someone on the board to fight its corner.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000018"></a>The composition of the board needs to reflect the challenges and demands in the market at any given time. As market conditions and demand change, so too should the composition of the board to reflect those changes. That can be done by adding to the board at a later date. As the Bill stands, the board will be made up of members,</p>
<ul><a name="08051344000063"></a>&#147;as the Secretary of State may from time to time appoint&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051344000054"></a>That immediately raises a flag in my mind. The challenges will not be met through yes men, nodding approval to any Government&#146;s whim. The board must have broad and balanced representation from those organisations involved in front-line delivery. It needs members who can identify the problems and unlock the doors.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000019"></a>I look forward to hearing the thoughts of the Minister&#146;s and other noble Lords on the composition of the HCA. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051344000020"></a><a name="80513-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051344000070"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Amendment No. 2, which is tabled in my name, is in this group. It is perhaps not as high minded as the amendment tabled by the noble Earl as I am talking about expertise rather than souls. However, our purpose is the same as the noble Earl&#146;s: to probe what the Government have in mind about the size of the board and, more importantly, who they will look to with what expertise to make up the board, its committees and sub-committees. In her letter to Members, the Minister mentioned the opportunities for particular expertise to be brought in to the different committees. My amendment refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08051344000064"></a>&#147;the desirability of experience of housing provision of all types&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051344000055"></a>By that, I mean the different sectors, not bedsit to mansion, but public and private, the different types of public housing&#151;rented, shared ownership and so on&#151;and the experience of regeneration.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000021"></a>What prompted this amendment was that although the agency is to be a new body&#151;a number of noble Lords have referred to the importance of it not being simply a continuation of the previous bodies&#151;there might nevertheless be a temptation to appoint members who have experience of housing associations as distinct from other forms of provision. This is a probing amendment to ask the Government what they have in mind and is not so drastic as to take out altogether the possibility of board members.</p>

<p><a name="08051344000056"></a>In this Committee, we are setting out to put some flesh on the bones of a noble and worthwhile exercise. It is always dangerous to start at a certain date and say that is when something happened because these things evolve, but after a period of time, the

Amendment No. 2 is perfectly sensible; as I see it, it seeks assurances from the Minister about the broad brush that will be applied to ensure that the HCA reflects housing experience. It would be unthinkable and unforgivable if it did not. Last week, with some noble Lords who are in this Committee, I attended a meeting at which we heard the prospective chief executive. He left behind a document that stated, among other things, that the objectives of the HCA are:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051344000061"></a>&#147;To improve the supply and quality of housing ... To secure the regeneration of land or infrastructure ... To support in other ways the creation, regeneration or development of communities in England or their continued well-being&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051344000057"></a>No one can object to those. The fourth major objective is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051344000062"></a>&#147;To contribute to the achievement of sustainable development&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051344000058"></a>I would hope that Members of this Committee are as one in subscribing to those objectives. I can well understand noble Lords wanting assurances from the Minister and her colleagues that the intention is to put flesh on the bones of those ideas in personnel and strategy to achieve those objectives. I hope that these are genuine probing amendments to get assurances from the Minister rather than a way of beginning the debate on this stage of the Bill by trying to chop off the head of the HCA, which is the kernel of the strategy, because otherwise we are in for a rough time. </p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000023"></a>I have every confidence that the Minister has come to this Committee with answers to questions that have been raised, but I hope that the thrust of what we are going to do over the next period is to try to achieve the objectives of the HCA, which we heard about from the prospective chief last week.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000025"></a>An interesting set of issues is raised by this amendment and I would like to respond to the noble Earl's points from the perspective of someone who, for six years, chaired English Partnerships&#151;one of the bodies that is coming together to form the Homes and Communities Agency. Some of the points that have been raised have been extremely interesting, because the composition of such boards and the way in which you get that expertise from non-executive directors and, critically, the leadership and tone that such a board sets, not only for the organisation, but on behalf of the Secretary of State throughout the whole sector, is really important. I welcome the opportunity for us to debate these points.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000026"></a>I was very fortunate over the course of the six years to have a range of expertise at the disposal of the English Partnerships board because successive Secretaries of State made interesting appointments. It is undoubtedly the case that in the kind of agency that we are talking about here, with an annual investment budget of &#163;4 billion and a wide range of powers, you need a really high calibre board and people who know  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC267"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what they are talking about. I welcome the noble Baroness's suggestion about a range of people who understand housing in all its aspects.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000027"></a>However, I part company with the noble Earl on the idea that you should have representatives on the board. Having representation in that sense on a board directly cuts across the governance that non-executive directors undertake on behalf of the body and could involve those people in a conflict of interest or, as a minimum, make it awkward for them to carry out their functions. Are they there on behalf of an organisation or to exercise really good supervision and governance over a substantial budget? But I agree with the noble Earl and the noble Baroness that it is important to have the right mix of expertise on that board&#151;expertise that comes from people with experience in the voluntary housing sector, the funding of real estate and in corporate governance. As I said earlier, I was fortunate to have board members of the very highest quality. It is important to raise these issues and to encourage the Secretary of State to think widely in terms of making these appointments.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000028"></a>Finally, on the substantive point about whether this is the right corporate governance structure, it is massively helpful to have an NDPB structure because you have the ability to be clearly directed and guided by Ministers, but you have significant freedom to act, particularly around creating commercial joint ventures and other corporate entities that are important to carry out the work that we envisage this organisation undertaking. We need to have the widest possible, highest calibre expertise available to that agency if it is to carry out its job effectively.</p>

The noble Baroness says that members of the board should not be highly representative, but that can confuse a board.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000030"></a>In following the 1993 Act, &#147;not less than six&#148; does not follow English Partnerships or the Housing Corporation. I think that English Partnerships has 12 board members: one could think of them as two, but I suspect that, because of the group approach, it is more realistic to think of them as having been managed and governed as one. The Housing Corporation has, I think, 14 board members. I cannot think that six board members would ever be appropriate. It seems to be very loose drafting. Why does nothing in the Bill represent reality about the structure and number of members of the board?</p>

I am extremely grateful not just to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, who outlined why we need the HCA&#151;although, last year, we built 200,000 homes, so we are doing much better&#151;but also for the range of expertise around this Committee, so we will have some excellent debates. I was extremely glad to hear  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC268"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Earl say that this is a probing amendment. Having read it, I thought that this Committee would get off to a pretty ropey start if I had to defend the existence of the HCA. Clearly, it has raised many questions around the Committee&#151;for example, why is it an NDPB rather than, say, an executive agency? The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, asked about the size of the board. The balance and composition of the board has also been raised.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000032"></a>My noble friend Lady Ford, put much more powerfully than I can why it is an NDPB. As she said, we need the balance of an independent, flexible and powerful agency, which at the same time gives the responsible Minister a degree of control over its activities. Although we do not have a national housing policy, we certainly have a policy for housing the nation, and the responsibility of the Department for Communities and Local Government lies in setting those high objectives, values and targets. In the same way as we have created English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation, which have served us so well, we will create the HCA as an NDPB as well.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000033"></a>The agency is challenged by its task, which is why it needs to be as robust as possible. As I said at Second Reading, we have a budget of billions of pounds and its task is to be the best possible delivery partner. Again, I was grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, for emphasising the word &#147;delivering&#148;. Whereas policy and strategy sit with Ministers, this board will bring together for the first time all the partners, investment, land and housing, regeneration, decent homes, and growth areas. It will have at its disposal an enormous range of expertise and the power to bring people and partners together for the first time in a new way, which not least determines that the Secretary of State should make the appointments to the board. As my noble friend Lady Ford said, we need to have a credible and strong board with a strong voice. We need to respect Cabinet Office guidance that in situations such as this, the responsible Minister appoints the board.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000034"></a>Amendment No. 2 refers to qualifications and experience. I take the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, on the need to have expertise which reflects front-line experience; flexibility, so that as things change we may be able to modify the board; and balance, which goes beyond individual expertise. Combined, those factors will give us a broad range of expertise to address all these different interests. Indeed, paragraph 1(3)(a) of Schedule 1 provides that the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the board appointee is suitably qualified and experienced in matters pertaining to the activities of the HCA.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000035"></a>The board will provide strategic leadership and be the voice&#151;the public front&#151;of the agency. It will be the guardian of delivery and will champion the various elements of the work. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, is therefore right to ask whether six people will be enough. It is a minimum number. The fact that there are 12 members on the board of EP and the Housing Corporation&#151;double the minimum number&#151;reflects the fact that the figure can be increased. It is important that the Secretary of State has the ability to ensure that the board of the agency is sufficiently staffed. As I have said, there is a standard power to appoint board members and there  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC269"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are inbuilt accountability arrangements through the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointment guidelines when making appointments. In practice, therefore, we expect the membership to be greater than the minimum number of six in order for the HCA to be led as we want it to be.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000036"></a>On the question of balance, as raised in Amendment No. 2, it is important that the Secretary of State is free to make appointments which will ensure that the scope of the HCA&#146;s work is representative. I take the point entirely&#151;it was very well made&#151;that we are looking not for representation but for people who have credibility and experience and can rise to the task with which they will be faced. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that, again, the priority of ensuring a balance and variety of relevant expertise on the board will continue to be governed by the OCPA guidance and will remain at the discretion of the Secretary of State. That flexibility is necessary because of a need, potentially, for modifications in some situations as time goes on. We are looking for demonstrated capacity.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000037"></a>The Secretary of State is making progress with the appointment of board members. I hope to be able to update noble Lords as we go through that process to make sure that they are fully informed as and when we can make public announcements about it. That will be during the course of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>

I realise that I did not refer to local authorities when I spoke originally. They would rightly come down on me if I left them out. Furthermore, paragraph 1(3)(a), to which the Minister referred, contains the phrase, &#147;has shown some capacity&#148;. I asked my noble friend Lord Greaves whether he understood what that meant and he thought that it might be about capacity-building&#151;but I do not think that it is. Experience must be different from capacity, because otherwise one would not have the two phrases. Does that mean some sort of achievement? I do not quite understand what capacity is. Surely, it cannot mean personal capacity to go out with a JCB. I hesitated when I first read the schedule and thought that it was pushing it a bit to try to take the whole of this paragraph apart, but I have been unable to resist temptation at this point.</p>

I should tell the noble Lord, Lord Graham, that I do not think that any side of the House does not want to see the housing targets succeed. We all want that; what we are debating is how we best achieve it. I do not think that anybody is going to argue that there is no need for it, and I think that my remarks indicated that.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051344000049"></a>I was interested and relieved that the Minister talked about the balance, flexibility and expertise that need to be on this board. I understand the point of not having representation from the bodies at the coal face, as there may be conflicts of interest. However, because they know what the problems are and what the barriers are to achieving our goals, it will be vital that, when they come to the board and say that they have a problem and cannot do something because of X, Y or Z, the board should listen and work out how to overcome those barriers, rather than just saying that it is too difficult. If we are going to achieve the targets as we are trying to do, when there are barriers we must look at ways of getting round them. Therefore, if we are not to have representation from those at the coal face it is vital that the board listens and reacts when problems are raised.</p>

<p><a name="08051344000050"></a>I was slightly disappointed that the Minister did not say anything about my champion for rural areas. However, I am sure that the issue will come up again. This is a slightly different picture from the bigger picture, or the other picture, in the urban areas. There

There will be an amendment later on under which we will be able to explore it, but I am not in favour of a single champion for rural areas. I would hope that the board will achieve that by having a genuine mix of experience, so rural areas will not need a separate champion because they will be championed by the board. The noble Earl is quite right&#151;there are very different issues and challenges in those areas, but some of them are not that different now. One could take market towns, for example, and some of the other issues that we are looking at with regard to urban extensions. The rural areas must be spoken up for and their interests promoted, but that must be seen as seamless with the work of the HCA.</p>

<p><a name="08051367000002"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 1A, I will also speak to the other amendments in this group, because they are all intended to promote good design in social housing.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000003"></a>I am grateful to the Royal Institute of British Architects for its stimulus and assistance in formulating these amendments and declare my interest as an honorary fellow of the RIBA. I am also grateful for the encouragement from Members on all sides of the Committee for holding this debate on design at an early stage of Committee proceedings and I am most grateful to noble Lords, again from all sides of the Committee, who added their names to the amendments that I have tabled. That is a reflection that all of us recognise that design is important. I do not think that it is a party-political issue. That was evident in the debates that we held at Second Reading and on architecture and planning on 27 March.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000004"></a>Amendment No. 1A, which would amend Schedule 1, would require the Secretary of State to appoint to the board of the Homes and Communities Agency a person with experience of and capacity in design. I suppose that the distinction between experience and capacity is between experience and ability&#151;both seem desirable. Amendments Nos. 29 and 32 would amend the objects of the HCA to include the improvement of design quality in new housing. Amendment No. 47 to Clause 5 would require the HCA to use its powers to provide housing and land to contribute,</p>
<ul><a name="08051367000024"></a>&#147;to high quality design in the built environment&#148;.</ul>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000005"></a>Amendment No. 95 to Clause 39 would enable the Secretary of State to require the HCA to supply information drawn from post-occupancy analysis to help make it normal practice that design should be evaluated by asking the residents of these homes what their experience of the design has been. Amendment No. 97 to Clause 49 would enable the Secretary of State to require the HCA to provide that applications for housing provided by it or facilitated by it should be submitted to design review in the planning process.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000006"></a>We have debated the importance of design very fully in our recent debates and I will not repeat the arguments that I put forward. Noble Lords from all sides of the Chamber were eloquent about the damage caused by poor design and the importance of good design to quality of life and value for money. Nobody was more eloquent in contributing to those debates on this matter than my noble friend the Minister. It has also been profoundly encouraging that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the right honourable Hazel Blears, gave a speech at CABE recently in which she powerfully articulated the importance of good design, insisting that new homes should be &#147;not brutal, but beautiful&#148;, as she put it.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000007"></a>The Government intend that 3 million new homes should be built in this country by 2020. Already, we have planning policy statements 1 and 3 and many other statements of different status from Ministers, making it clear that they expect good and indeed very good design to be the norm in new housing development. They are fully aware how crucial it is that we do not repeat the errors made in previous decades&#151;that we do not create a new generation of slums for the future&#151;in our haste to achieve this ambitious home-building programme. The Government have already stipulated that lifetime home standards should be achieved in publicly funded housing by 2011 and it is their aspiration that this should be achieved in all new housing by 2013. They have also stipulated that new homes should be carbon-neutral by 2016. So they have already made important commitments in those aspects of design.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000008"></a>If the quest for good design is motherhood and apple pie, my noble friend may reasonably ask, why do we need to legislate? If we were to include these amendments in the Bill, would they be workable? She is also entitled to ask whether they would achieve anything worth while. Needless to say, it is my view that we should legislate to reinforce our drive towards good design.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000009"></a>There can only be benefit in using this legislation to reinforce the values and guidance that have been expressed in the planning policy statements. There will otherwise be a wide gulf between the aspirations of Ministers in Whitehall and practice and decision-making on the ground. Of course it is not appropriate for central government to specify particular designs or to interfere everywhere in the detail of decision-making, but I believe that it is right that we should require in legislation that appropriate people are in place and that procedures are followed that will conduce to good design. These amendments would ensure that there would be people in key positions in relation to social housing and regeneration who had serious knowledge of and  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC273"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>commitment to design; that in its methods of working and decision-taking the Homes and Communities Agency, which will be under many conflicting pressures, should constantly bear in mind the importance of design; that the minds of independent, knowledgeable, public-spirited people would be brought to bear through design review, making for best practice and for the continuous raising of standards; and that the views of the people who will have lived in these homes should be properly taken into account by the HCA and social housing providers so that they should continuously be learning and improving the quality of provision. These amendments are reasonable, workable and down to earth.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000010"></a>I have no reason to suppose that the HCA would not welcome a strengthening of its arm through this legislation. Those of us who had the privilege of meeting Sir Bob Kerslake, at the meeting that the Minister so helpfully organised for us last week, heard him expressing himself imaginatively and constructively in relation to design. There is no doubt that the predecessor organisations&#151;the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships&#151;have in recent years and, in the case of English Partnerships, when my noble friend Lady Ford was chairing the organisation, committed themselves to better design. However, they may well have encountered resistance because housing providers find themselves under many conflicting pressures. Therefore, it is important that the HCA should be enabled through this legalisation to insist rather than simply exhort that there should be high design quality. Unless we legislate, there is no guarantee that these things will happen.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000011"></a>My noble friend may possibly take the view that my amendments are too vaguely worded or might lay the HCA or other providers open to judicial review. If that should be the case, I hope that she will be able to improve the drafting. I contend that by introducing the expression &#147;design quality&#148; I have made the definition of the objects of the HCA rather more specific than the Government have in the unqualified use of the word &#147;quality&#148;. It could be argued that &#147;sustainability&#148; is a fairly loose term, and other terms that we are familiar with in legislation&#151;&#147;equality&#148;, to take an example from a different field&#151;are generalised terms but we know what we are talking about. Design in this context is a term of art. It is code, if you like, but it is very well understood in its purport by professionals in the fields of architecture, planning, housebuilding, traffic engineering and landscape design, and a considerable quantity of documentation has been promulgated by DCLG and CABE defining the principles of good design, producing illustrations of how those principles are to be applied, proposing best practice and establishing expectations of the relevant professions.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000012"></a>The Government cannot do it all by themselves. They have relatively few levers with which to promote good design. The ability and motivation of professionals will probably be more important than anything else. I wish that the professions in question&#151;the architects, surveyors, planners and engineers&#151;would agree a foundation design curriculum common to the formation of these different professions before they diverge into their specialisms. As it is, each professional institute

It is true that efforts are being made to build in interdisciplinarity, and I am encouraged that there is a pilot model for a curriculum on urban design, which has been funded by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, with the RTPI, the RIBA, the Landscape Institute, the IDA and the Prince&#146;s Fund, as well as the Academy for Sustainable Communities coming together, with the University of Strathclyde taking the lead academically. But that work is intended to design post-qualification studies.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000013"></a>It would be enormously helpful if we could have a common curriculum for these various professionals as they learn their trade, their art and their profession, so that they would understand each other better and more of them would have a more highly developed awareness of the nature of good design and its importance. The fruits of that, if it were to happen, would be as important as anything that the Government could do&#151;although, of course, the Government could continue to play a useful part. The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and HEFCE could continue to incentivise and encourage that kind of work.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000014"></a>Meanwhile, we here in Parliament must do what we can. This important legislative opportunity is a prime occasion for us to add to the levers available. I commend the amendments to the Committee and I beg to move.</p>

Its object already includes to improve the supply and quality of housing in England and to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. It cannot achieve these without enabling good design to be paramount, but we do not have as yet that design culture in all planning authorities and among all housing developers which can achieve the objectives. We have now excellent obligations with regard to sustainability and we need to have a parallel obligation on those concerned to pay attention to design standards and take them seriously.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051367000016"></a>These amendments flesh out significant comments made in recent authoritative reviews. Kate Barker pleaded for higher priority for design and for enabling design review panels to function widely, adding that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051367000025"></a>&#147;the costs of poor design are high&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051367000018"></a>and that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051367000026"></a>&#147;good design attracts people, investment and activity to places&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051367000019"></a>She added, echoing my noble friend Lord Howarth of Newport, that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051367000027"></a>&#147;what constitutes good design is well documented&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08051367000020"></a>in both government and CABE standards.</p>

<p><a name="08051367000017"></a>The Calcutt review called for a nationwide system of design review. My noble friend the Minister, no less authoritative, said in her speech at the end of Second Reading:</p>

To have to do some things in Leicestershire and different things in Yorkshire is not helpful. Above all, they will help the very many people who will live in new and rehabilitated houses, who deserve proper consideration of the best means to give them homes of beauty, accessible to transport, schools, clinics, places to meet or worship, in communities which are inhospitable to crime and can thrive and prosper sustainably. These amendments will protect and enhance the &#147;dowry&#148;, to use the RIBA's phrase, of the best practice of the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships, and I am sure my noble friend will find them an asset.</p>

<p><a name="08051374000001"></a><a name="80513-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08051374000024"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the Committee&#146;s debate on these amendments. I have put my name to a couple of amendments tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, because I believe that this is an extremely important issue. As was made very clear in the debate that he led at Second Reading&#151;the noble Baroness will recall that there was a considerable amount of interest in these issues&#151;a number of us are anxious that it is critical to include from the outset an emphasis on design quality in the Bill. That is not least because of considerable concerns about sustainability, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, has just referred. Unless high quality designers are involved in the next generation of housing, we are in danger again of creating inbuilt obsolescence in the housing stock of this country, which is extremely damaging not only in the short term, but also in the longer term.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000002"></a>From my experience of working with and for architects, I know how attitudes have changed even in the professions in recent years. In the 1960s, you built for then and now, and if it had to be replaced within the lifetime even of those architects, that was acceptable. Given the concerns that there are about the extent to which energy is used wastefully not only in obsolete buildings, but also in the regeneration, removal and replacement of obsolete buildings, we cannot do that any longer. It is not carbon-neutral. Construction techniques are extremely expensive in terms of energy and in other ways.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000003"></a>The Minister may recall that at Second Reading I referred to my work on the &#147;long life, loose fit, low energy&#148; project when I was working for the Royal Institute of British Architects. It has now come of age, as many Members of the Committee on both sides will agree. That is why it is critical that, in laying down the parameters and the criteria by which we expect the agency to operate, there is emphasis on design quality in the Bill. Designers today are concerned about long life, loose fit and low energy. It is extremely important to have that written firmly in the Bill. Sustainable development is in the Bill and it has a very high priority in the Explanatory Notes, but unless it is explicit that we recognise that design quality is a realistic expectation, we are missing a very important opportunity. I am delighted to support the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, who has been the pioneer in these matters.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC276"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC276</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and has put back later amendments for which I was better prepared. My name is down to support an amendment to leave out &#147;and&#148; in an obscure part of the proceedings. I support all the amendments which contribute to raising the profile of design.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000005"></a>The question is the extent to which the Homes and Communities Agency could use powers, if provided through this legislation, effectively to change the design of all the homes that will be built. I am sure that that starts at the point the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, has started it; that is, on the board of the new agency, which takes us back one small step to the discussion of membership of the board. I should declare a past interest: I was the chief executive of what is now called the National Housing Federation&#151;the former National Federation of Housing Associations&#151;for many years, including the years when the Housing Corporation first came into its new form in 1973 ready for the 1974 Act and thereafter.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000006"></a>I was consulted regularly on the membership of the board in relation to those people who might be said to represent in a loose way the housing associations. I wonder whether here, in relation to the suggestions made by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, it is not a matter of compelling in legislation a list of organisations to be represented, but of an amendment to require consultation with a number of organisations whose interests should be represented. If that were the case, one of those organisations could well be the RIBA. This would ensure that someone selected&#151;or suggested, if consultation there was&#151;through the networks would champion a design perspective on the board. I declare an interest as an honorary fellow of the RIBA.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000007"></a>Such a mechanism would ensure consultation. For 15 years I was consulted on a regular basis by whoever might be there from the housing association world, which was helpful, but it was never enshrined in legislation. One had to make all kinds of difficult judgments such as whether the position should be for a non-executive board member without a financial interest or for one of the great chief executives with a passion to be there. What kind of a person should it be? A consultative process in the Bill&#151;which any sensible chair of the new organisation would go for&#151;might bolster the HCA&#146;s input on this side.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000008"></a>As to the ways in which a power, let alone a duty, given to the HCA to take account of design might operate, an obligation in the Bill for the agency to take these matters on board could be a highly effective mechanism. Wherever, at its simplest level, it is making a grant, or wherever it is passing over money, the HCA would be able to specify the design qualities that must be taken into account. For example&#151;we shall probably discuss this later&#151;with the lifetime homes&#146; accessibility standards, which are so important, the HCA could insist that, in return for a grant, the full lifetime homes&#146; requirements are rolled out now, without waiting for the mechanisms that have been put in place to achieve the Government&#146;s expectations for lifetime homes&#151;in 2010 for housing associations and 2013 for builders. The HCA could get on with this through the mechanism of the grants if it had an obligation for design.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC277"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000009"></a>The HCA will also have control of land. Because of EP&#146;s way of working, it can insist that on land that has been assembled, acquired, reclaimed or remediated through its own powers, design factors should be taken into account in the development that follows.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000010"></a>The HCA could also use the mechanism of Section 106 agreements. These require site developers to incorporate various matters in their projects and so, when the HCA is involved in a scheme which has a Section 106 agreement requiring affordable housing to be built alongside the housing for sale, it could insist on the same standards across the piece of the development. Design falls under different headings, which we will explore&#151;sustainability may be encapsulated already in some of the other issues&#151;but this is a foot in the door. The HCA could say to housebuilders, &#147;You have an agreement to provide 50 per cent affordable housing within your development as a whole; the rest may be for sale. We are insisting that, as we have some lien in this, 100 per cent of these homes satisfy the design criteria which we think is right for the development&#148;. Affordable housing as well as other homes should meet the same standards. Why should the people who buy have lower standards than the people who come in through the social housing route?</p>

<a name="80513-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000011"></a>These amendments are for real. There are opportunities for the HCA to have some muscle in influencing directly the way in which a good proportion of the 3 million homes of tomorrow work their way through the pipeline.</p>

<p><a name="08051374000012"></a><a name="80513-gc0002.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0002.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08051374000026"></a>Baroness Ford:</b> I associate myself with the spirit of the amendment. It has been enormously important in the past couple of years that England Partnerships was given encouragement by the then Secretary of State and the then Deputy Prime Minister to put design on the map. When we changed our evaluation criteria some three years ago&#151;after six years I keep saying &#147;we&#148;; I forget I am not there any more&#151;to look at quality and design alongside the financial bid for land, it made a huge difference to the way in which housebuilders approached projects. It is important that we try to do whatever we can through the Bill to strengthen the HCA&#146;s arm.</p>

<p><a name="08051374000013"></a>However, I counsel caution on two suggestions made by my noble friend Lord Howarth. I am slightly concerned about representation of a senior or eminent architect on the board. I used to have regular unarmed combat with my noble friend Lord Rogers on that; he upbraided me mightily on a number of occasions about our not having an eminent architect on the board&#151;I hesitate to say &#147;such as himself&#148;; I am sure that there was no intention on his part that it would be him. Given the breadth of projects in which the HCA will be involved, it would be extremely difficult to find a single architect whose expertise spanned residential, mixed-use, urban, and rural developments. It is inevitable that one would have architectural experience and a champion on that board, but would that then excuse

Instead of representation, we had a panel of eminent, experienced architects on whom the board and executives were able to draw for advice on individual, significant projects. I imagine that the new organisation might want to continue that practice, which might be preferable to having a single architect on the board.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80513-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000014"></a>I am concerned also about review panels. There is a practical and time issue around that. That is the job of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, not of the new agency. However, the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships have done a significant job in moving space standards, when the private housebuilders did not want to do that. Where the agency invests public money, it must continue to insist on the highest standards. Anything that we can give the agency by way of robust assistance in the Bill is welcome, but retaining the board&#146;s flexibility would be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="08051374000015"></a><a name="80513-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051374000027"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I adopt the noble Baroness&#146;s phrase and say that I associate these Benches with the spirit of the amendment; I agree with pretty much everything that she said, including on board membership. I think that those who have their name to the amendments are saying that a focus on quality should be mainstreamed throughout the organisation. It is not enough to make it one person&#146;s job or to confine it to the board. It is rather more important that those in an executive capacity have an understanding of, and experience&#151;or training if necessary&#151;in, the issue. The noble Lord, Lord Best, rightly pointed out that it is about the powers of the agency&#151;there is no good in fine words, unless there is the power to say, &#147;It must not be that and it must be better&#148;.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000016"></a>Sustainability covers quality, if only for the rather simple reason that a building of quality is one which lasts. I shall not prolong this debate, as I suspect that this may not be the only occasion when we focus on this issue in our proceedings. However, I say also that I share some personal reservations&#151;I have no idea what party policy is&#151;about design review panels, which I mentioned in the debate introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, not so long ago. It is entirely proper that design is raised in the Bill, and it is a delight to see such an interest being shown in it.</p>

<p><a name="08051374000017"></a><a name="80513-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051374000028"></a>Lord Mawson:</b> I, too, welcome the amendment. Since I entered your Lordships&#146; House I have been very encouraged by the concern about quality of design. I was very encouraged by the debate, which I could not attend but which I read, in which the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, spoke, on the quality of design. One can see that there is real concern. However, to a large degree, across the country, we do not have design quality. Design quality is a practical matter. In east London, our experience has been that when you build quality buildings, the social environment begins to change as does the way in which people relate to that environment. My view is that we are the environments in which we live. If we create certain kinds of environments we will create certain kinds of  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC279"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>public behaviour; if we create other forms of environments we can create public behaviour which is unhelpful.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000018"></a>Design matters, and it has very serious financial implications. My experience over the years of building and trying to create quality design, is that it is important to have individuals in the process who care, long term, about the buildings. Trying to bring buildings and design together takes a long time and the process is quite complicated. You need someone who cares about the process, who gets out of bed on a Monday morning and worries about it and about the types of buildings that are being built. When I have looked at different developments around the country, I have discovered that generally the buildings that look the best have an individual behind them who worries and cares about them.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000019"></a>The aspiration is there but how do turn it into practice on the ground? There is great concern that that is not happening at the moment. I am involved in a development, in east London, for a very difficult group of estates. We have been through 50 different designs, at a cost of more than &#163;3 million, but still not a brick has been laid. We need to think very carefully about the practical consequences of what the Bill imposes.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000020"></a>I support the amendment. We and the agency need to think carefully about quality, not just quantity. I was very encouraged by my conversation yesterday, which was enabled by the Minister, with Sir Bob Kerslake. He is concerned about these matters and we need to create the kind of legislation that strengthens his hand and enables him to get a grip on this issue. For me, it is about quality before quantity. I support what my noble friend Lord Best says about enabling levers.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051374000021"></a>Developments need an individual who cares about them. If we are to spend all this money, it has to be about place-making. As we know, in the history of society, place-making is usually about an individual or a small group of people taking hold of a place over time and making something happen.</p>

<p><a name="08051374000022"></a><a name="80513-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08051374000029"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I am reminded that several years ago I was taken by a group of 10 year-olds&#151;primary schoolchildren&#151;to see round their housing estate and I was shown their homes in a series of tower blocks, which were in the process of demolition. I reflected on what it does for a child&#146;s self-esteem if their home is condemned as unworthy of sustainability. With that in mind, we must design our homes for the future in a better way&#151;homes of which we can all be proud and which will last a long while.</p>

My direction is much more to try to get planning and design decisions made as locally as we can. However, while we have this approach from this Government, let us make sure that design gets in properly. Yes, it is difficult and, yes, it is very hard to define exactly what you mean; but, as the noble Lord, Lord Howarth,

It is perhaps not that easy, however. Last week, I received a pamphlet from the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, hymning the idea of high densities in the form of town squares and giving seven examples of them. Six of them were extremely ugly and had won prizes. So it comes down to the difficulties of centralising design in one person sitting on one body. If that person is not the right person, you can get a promulgation of ugliness such as, say, the South Bank, which has taken a long time to get over.</p>

<p><a name="08051380000002"></a>I want to see variety, so I am a supporter of design-review panels, which are voluntary and diffuse&#151;they are all over the place. We will get a variety of answers and we will get Leicestershire and Yorkshire doing different things, for example, which is entirely as it should be. But, most importantly, we will have a body of expertise available for local councillors and others who have to take decisions at local levels and will give them the courage to take design into account in a way that is difficult now, if you are being asked to pit your views against that of someone employed by the developer.</p>

<p><a name="08051380000003"></a>It is sad. Every time I go home along the Thames I look at what has been done with those serried ranks of condominiums, which, if they had an architect did not have a very good architect. As a pleasurable experience, it ranks at about two out of 10&#151;and all that because of the river, rather than the surrounding buildings. It is enormously important that we give a higher priority to design. The fact that we may get that wrong at some times does not matter. What matters is that we get it right more often than we do now.</p>

My contribution will be highly idiosyncratic. I do not know what the Minister is going to say: she may say that the qualifications in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment and the amendments of those who supported him are unnecessary. It is the sort of phrase that I have heard from Ministers before, and I dare say that I have uttered it myself. Therefore, I want to add another argument.</p>

<p><a name="08051380000005"></a>One virtue of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, is that it acts as a form of amulet against the oscillation in the quality of Ministers in departments responsible for these matters. That is in no sense a reflection on the present Minister, but I have been in Parliament for 30 years and there have been Ministers responsible for the affairs of the relevant departments who were extraordinarily interested in architecture and could be relied on to make extremely good decisions and others who had no interest in architecture whatever. One virtue of the amendment is that it is a protection against the latter.</p>

<p><a name="08051380000006"></a>I shall be straightforwardly personal. My late noble kinsman was Minister for Housing and Local Government. He was vilified for two decisions on buildings that he let through&#151;one on grounds of bulk and one on grounds of height. On the other hand, he was widely praised for preventing a building  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC281"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from destroying the view of St Paul&#146;s from a whole series of different angles, including the Whitestone Pond on Hampstead Heath. There is another building on Knightsbridge which everyone wanted to destroy; it was a listed building, but even the inspector wanted to demolish it. He alone insisted that it was retained, and everybody associated with Imperial College now takes the view that his decision was the right one. Some Ministers will have an interest and some will not&#151;and fortunately his batting average was about even.</p>

On the way out I met the architect civil servant who advised me when I was a Minister and who may well have advised the noble Lord, Lord Howarth. I was the eighth Minister whom he had advised. Our conversation went back to what was then a derelict tower block in Bethnal Green, whose design, to the credit of the local authority, had been entrusted to Denys Lasdun. It was for local authority use and, by the time it came to us, it was, in effect, gutted and in an appalling state. English Heritage wished to list it and everyone else wished to demolish it. The local authority could do nothing with it. The tenants did not wish to live in it. Efforts to put the building into other hands had failed because of the scale of the work that needed to be done. It was reasonably shortly after the creation of what was then the Department of National Heritage, which broke down the Chinese walls that had previously existed in the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, which meant that two departments were making two sets of decisions. The new department made the decision about listing and the old department made the decision about listed building consent or demolition.</p>

<p><a name="08051380000008"></a>We had a meeting lasting three hours to discuss what should be done about it. We knew that we would be extremely unpopular if we listed the building, because we would be transferring it to the other department to make the unpopular decision among architects that the building should be demolished. But we also knew the quality of the Secretary of State to whom we would be transferring it. Since we had the new system where two departments could make the decisions, we took the decision to list it and, if that department still wanted to demolish it, it would have had to have gone to the other department.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000009"></a>I tell that story in support of the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, because it is a moral story. The decision was taken by the other Secretary of State to resist the efforts to demolish the building. A highly imaginative developer came along. It is now an icon building, which people fight to get into. That is a demonstration that quality will out.</p>

I should declare an interest as a member of Pendle Borough Council, which is a housing authority, a planning authority and all the rest of it. I should also apologise for not taking part at Second Reading. The fact that I could not do so is linked to the fact that I am still a member of Pendle Borough Council. I was otherwise occupied electioneering at the time and managed to scrape back where all my colleagues were falling around me. Such is life and such is politics.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000011"></a>The last time I remember a head of steam building up in the House of Lords on design issues was when we were discussing the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill in 2004. Exactly the same sort of head of steam built up, the same arguments were put forward, and the legislation was amended as a result. I very much hope that the same thing will happen and that the Government will negotiate a sensible form of wording to reflect the clearly widespread view that design should be incorporated in the Bill, as happened in that previous legislation.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000012"></a>As a member of a local planning committee&#151;at the other end of the system completely&#151;it has been extremely valuable that local authorities and local planning committees can now consider design overtly as part of the decision-making process. Applications can be changed and can be rejected on grounds of design. Following the changes to that 2004 legislation, and the way in which it was fed through planning policy statements and so on, it is now an important part of the planning process. Some planning officers still say, &#147;Well, I am sorry, I have not done any qualifications in design and I cannot give any advice to the committee&#148;, and some councillors say, &#147;Well, we have no qualifications, but we are going to do what we think is right&#148;. That is what democracy is about, although it is not always easy to defend on appeal. The fact that it is now built into the system at the local level that the noble Lord was talking about is important and valuable, as it is, in a different way, in the area of social housing, regeneration and so on that the HCA is going to be involved in. It is not a panacea because what gets built and how it gets built is inevitably a matter of negotiation and compromise and it is always a question of balancing ideals against practicalities, particularly those of cost. We cannot click our fingers and get brilliant design everywhere, even if we could all agree what brilliant design is, which does not necessarily happen. Nevertheless, putting it there and putting it in the equation, the negotiations and the compromises is important and I wish this amendment well.</p>

They remain on the record. Having got that out of the way, I hope the Committee will not mind if I explain the rather devious technical device that we are using to have this debate. It is a measure of the importance that all sides of the Committee place on this issue that this procedure was agreed. The manuscript amendment that we are formally discussing, Amendment No. 1A, was agreed by all sides because the noble Lord and the  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC283"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, were likely to have a clash of dates with the second day in Committee next week and it was arguable whether we would get to the rest of the group of these amendments today in time for them to be properly discussed. It was in order to avoid that embarrassment that we are having this debate. I am quite sure that the noble Baroness gave her agreement as speedily as I did. It is a measure of the significance of this subject.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000014"></a>I am grateful to my noble friends Lord Brooke and Lord Lucas for reminding the Committee that design is a matter of taste. Not only are there the complexities of Ministers coming and going, but tastes, fashions and, heaven help us, planning committees come and go, and one needs to have some comment to make on the planning system. One can have the most wonderful architects but in the end planning committees say what will and will not be built. We have all heard criticisms of inappropriate designs for houses and estates. Fortunately, we are long past the words of a song that was around in my youth about little boxes made of ticky-tacky that all looked just the same. I am sure some Members of the Committee will remember that song.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000015"></a>However, the other side of this debate is that we need to remember that for many people any house is better than no house. We have already had some reiteration of the housing numbers. When I started in local government, we were building 360,000 houses a year with all the services that were required. It was a remarkable achievement. It was post war, and there was war damage to recover from and all the rest of it. But, if there was bad design, it was because of the urgent requirement to produce more houses. We have been through that phase and many of those houses have now gone, but some of them remain.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000016"></a>I should probably declare another interest&#151;or confess, perhaps, to an aspect of my life which is a little odd. I have never lived in a house less than 350 years old. Two houses I have lived in have had parts which go back 500 years. That is an immense tribute to the quality of the design of those days. One of those houses depended entirely on prefabrication; it could be built in only one way from one specific post. It is not that they were grand houses; they were timber-framed farmhouses. Plenty of cottages built in a similar period remain in the countryside. The buildings are a tribute to the durability of the materials and the skill of the people who put them up. Whether we achieve that again today remains to be seen; realistically, I think probably not. However, I would like to think that there will be buildings we put up today which will still be here in 500 years time. That is what this debate, among other things, is all about.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000017"></a>We should remember that the quality of architecture now has a great deal to do with the word &#147;utility&#148;. As has been said by others, we need our buildings to be energy and space efficient. They need to be adaptable for a number of purposes; for example, to enable a young married couple to move in, to bring up their children&#151;I was going to say to kick their children out, but they will leave of their own accord&#151;and then to grow old gracefully in. That needs a great deal of thinking about.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000018"></a>I come back to the point that I mentioned when I began. We need to recognise the planning responsibility as well as the architectural and design responsibilities. We have heard about inappropriately designed estates on the edge of old communities that look like sore thumbs. Planning committees will have approved such estates. They did not have to approve them. I once had to lecture to a degree course in planning; I was not asked back again. That was mainly because they were teaching planning as a precise science&#151;which it might be&#151;but I reminded them that the serious planning decisions were all taken by democratically-elected members and that, however precise their science was, they would have to learn to put up with a bit of democracy in their planning.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000019"></a>In what we are doing with the Bill&#151;we will come back to this later&#151;there is a need to remind members in local government that they are there to do a job, that they are expected to do it and that they do not deserve to remain in local government if they do not do it. Most people in local government do the job, but very often they take the easy option, particularly in planning matters. You then come to the difficulty, and a different pressure on local authorities, of a lot of planning authorities taking a hard line and demanding very good design, which slows up the development process. I can see the Minister with a grin on her face and saying, &#147;Yes, we shall have to be very critical of them for that&#148;. Not for what they are doing on the principle of design but because they will not achieve the necessary volume. We have to remind ourselves all the time that we need volume.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051380000020"></a>That is all I want to say. I have drifted very much away from the significant question of design because that has been very thoroughly covered in the excellent debate we are having now. We need to remember that there are others in the process&#151;we have not mentioned builders, developers and so on&#151;and we have to get them all positively involved.</p>
<h5><a name="08051383000055"></a>5 pm</h5>

I congratulate my noble friend Lord Howarth on his opportunism and on the coalition of support that he has marshalled around the House, on the way in which he marshalled his arguments and on the way in which noble Lords spoke both to the visionary opportunity as well as&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, concluded by reminding us&#151;the practical needs that we have to address when we try to marshal support for more impetus for design.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000002"></a>I start by addressing some of the issues raised under Amendment No. 1A. However, I shall reflect briefly on what the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said about places shaping people. That is where we start from&#151;with the notion that beautiful places may not shape beautiful people, but at least they promote pro-social behaviour. Design has a value in itself, but it also has a value for what it communicates and enables other people to do in the community. Members of the Committee know that I am sympathetic to much of what they have said. If they can bear it, I shall leave my final conclusions tantalisingly to the very end.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC285"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC285</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000003"></a>On Amendment No. 1A, in relation to this notion of appointing someone to champion design, the challenge for the new agency will be in demonstrating that the skills are appropriate to what it needs. That has to be balanced. So while I am sympathetic to what my noble friend says, and I take the point of the rather alarming picture drawn by my noble friend Lady Ford of having to fight hand-to-hand with architects, I do not think that the proposal is necessary. We need to think very hard about how we put this expertise in the hands of the HCA, however, because there is certainly a role for CABE and an opportunity to develop that sort of relationship. So while I welcome the intent, I wish to give some more thought to how we might best deliver that objective.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000004"></a>I have discovered the answer to the notion of capacity. When we talk about someone with capacity on the board, it means that they have the demonstrable ability and skills rather than expertise, necessarily. So when we think about what we want on the board, that is what we mean by that.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000005"></a>I turn to the substantive amendment, Amendment No. 32. I shall skip over the amendment to which the noble Lord, Lord Best, put his name, if he does not mind, as I do not think that I can have a particularly exhaustive debate on &#147;and&#148;. But there is no doubt that we are all of one mind here; we all want to see the highest possible standards of quality and design, not only in private architecture but in the public realm, in the built environment. I shall take Amendment No. 47 at the same time and discuss the notion of the built environment.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000006"></a>We are seeking to build ambitiously and build for a new generation. We are seeking not to repeat the mistakes of the past. We must make that clear in the leadership that we show, the policies that we have in place and the way in which we use all the levers&#151;and they are limited levers. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, was right to point that out, but we have to use everything to hand.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000007"></a>During his Second Reading speech, my noble friend Lord Howarth was concerned that the instruments that make it possible for planners and local politicians to deliver better than in the past&#151;guidance, exhortation and reward&#151;are not enough to see the real improvement needed. He both raised and answered on my behalf the questions that he thought that I would put to him. I would probably come up with a few different answers, but I need to make it clear that, although I am sympathetic to his intent, there are two major considerations that we have to address, which he has already identified.</p>

<p><a name="08051383000008"></a>Is the amendment necessary to achieve the desired outcome&#151;to put design at the heart of all new development? If it is necessary, is this the best way in which to achieve those desired outcomes? I have to be persuaded that the amendment is necessary to be put in the Bill. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, that predictably I would say that. However, as he knows as a former Minister, we have to test to destruction the notion of what is necessary. Design is  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC286"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>already&#151;admittedly, not explicitly&#151;covered by the objects of the HCA, but it is underpinned by planning law.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000009"></a>The agency&#146;s objects refer already in Clause 2(1)(a) to improving the quality of housing. That is about the built environment. I ask the noble Lord what we mean by quality if we do not mean quality of design. Quality is not merely functional, but it can ensure that the home, the place, is pleasing and desirable. I argue that quality without successful design is meaningless.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000010"></a>Clause 2(1)(c) gives the HCA the object of supporting the continued well-being of communities. We have spoken this afternoon about the quality of place and place-making. The well-being of communities means that we need places that are well designed, sustainable and beautiful&#151;places which make the spirit sing. It is hard to see how well-being is served by places that are ugly, cramped and confined. We all know of past design failures where we seem to have designed in crime rather than designing it out.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000011"></a>Clause 2(1)(d) adds contributing,</p>
<ul><a name="08051383000053"></a>&#147;to the achievement of sustainable development&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08051383000049"></a>to the agency&#146;s objects. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, was right when he talked about getting away from built-in obsolescence. We shall come back to that when we talk about lifetime homes. A key element of sustainable development is good design. That is given explicit force in law by <I>Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development</I>, which states,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051383000051"></a>&#147;Good design ensures attractive usable, durable and adaptable places and is a key element in achieving sustainable development&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000012"></a>This debate has raised a degree of passion, to which I have listened carefully. I wish to do that passion justice by giving equally careful consideration to how best to address this. The second point is whether this amendment is the best way of achieving that outcome. I am unsure about that for a couple of reasons. The supply of housing, as defined in law, includes the supply of particular types of housing, so we are not simply talking about the HCA delivering numbers but about it delivering particular types of housing for the enormous diversity of people who need good homes. I cannot in good conscience say that making it clear that the HCA would not meet its object of improving quality if it did not also improve design quality is anything other than helpful. I accept that.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000013"></a>I am slightly nervous about this wording because, in a sense, the HCA would always have to seek to improve design. I think there is a point beyond which realistically one would not be searching for innovation for the sake of it. I am also not sure that putting an amendment such as this into the Bill will help the HCA focus its activities where it could be of greatest value in tackling the problem of design quality and the barriers that prevent it happening at the moment.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000014"></a>Those barriers were identified at Second Reading. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, addressed the problems and quality of the planning committee, the training and supply of planners, the lack of qualified people, and the fact that it is very difficult to get people to focus on design when they are challenged by  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC287"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a new development with all the complications that arise. We are addressing this by placing the ASC at the centre of the work of the new agency, ensuring that we have, for the first time, a mechanism for getting training and advice into local authorities in a new way. We are also empowering the HCA to provide training and advice as well as support services, such as seconding or loaning staff. That will all make a real, practical difference to how local authorities can respond. However, I am concerned whether the amendment will secure the change.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000015"></a>I am also considering how the HCA will interact with CABE, which is an enormously powerful and positive influence in this area. I am very aware, as a Minister who has a lot to do with planning inspectorates, just how seriously planning inspectors now take their design responsibilities. I have recently written to CABE on this issue. I want to discuss that role further with noble Lords and colleagues in CABE, the HCA and DCMS.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000016"></a>I ask my noble friend to give me some time in which to consider his amendment. Notwithstanding everything that I have said, these are serious arguments. There is no point putting something in the Bill if it does not produce the changes that we all want to see. I want to hear the views of other noble Lords. It has been an excellent debate and I shall bear in mind my noble friend&#146;s advice.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000017"></a>I thought that Amendment No. 95 would be about empty homes and how design failures had led us to having some 600,000 empty homes; I can see now that it is not and that my noble friend is proposing a rather interesting idea. I would probably want to talk to Bob Kerslake about how we might pursue it in the context of the Bill. There are issues around it which we need to tease out. Asking people how they find the new accommodation which is provided is very interesting. I have the privilege of meeting people in new homes, particularly in housing market renewal areas. Their joy at having space, separate bedrooms for their children and a garden is extraordinarily powerful. I know that people who have worked in the housing association sector know exactly what I mean.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000018"></a>On the final amendment, Amendment No. 97, on design review panels, I was interested to hear some of noble Lords&#146; qualifications. Having seen some design review panels in action, I agree that they are powerful instruments for improving how people are trained to look at and appreciate good quality in design. Bringing design professionals and planning officers together to review schemes in pre-application is a promising and productive approach. It will give force to the HCA&#146;s role in place-shaping that all its schemes are of the highest design quality. However, the amendment will not deliver my noble friend&#146;s desired outcome, not least because he asks for a power of direction for the Secretary of State. It is a very powerful tool, which must be very sparingly used. An example would be a Secretary of State issuing an accounts direction, directing the Housing Corporation to include certain financial information within its annual accounts. It is an inappropriate instrument for this purpose. It would be used only in limited circumstances. All that creates problems for what my noble friend seeks.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000019"></a>However, I am sympathetic towards aspirations to improve design quality. The suggestion of an enhanced role for design review panels is interesting. I would like to explore it further outside the context of a power of direction for the Secretary of State. My noble friend Lady Ford asked how we find the people. We need more skilled people in planning; we need to recruit planners from other disciplines. Time and expertise are a problem. However, given what my noble friend said, given that we want to build on the good work of English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation and given that CABE is in place, I would like to think about how we can deliver some of the outcomes that he wants to see in the context of design review panels.</p>

I repeat how grateful I am to him, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the Minister for their willingness to accommodate this debate today. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Best, for my being unable to get hold of him yesterday evening, when the tactical need arose. I am hugely grateful to everyone who has spoken in this exceptionally interesting debate. I am greatly encouraged by the positive approach taken by every single noble Lord who has spoken.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000021"></a>We all recognise how important it is, one way or another, to ensure that in this great wave of housebuilding that is going to take place&#151;and the HCA may be responsible for the construction of some 30 per cent of homes envisaged&#151;those homes are well designed, good homes. My noble friend the Minister spoke eloquently, again, about the importance of beautiful places and the shaping power that they can have. The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, spoke out of the depth of their long-standing concern and direct personal experience about the traumatic effect of bad design and poorly designed homes on the lives of people who are so unfortunate as to live in them. We know that we must do very much better.</p>
<h5><a name="08051383000056"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, opened a very interesting and exciting perspective with his suggestions that the HCA might be able to use leverage to influence the design quality of the products of the volume housebuilders and that through the operation of Section 106 and other mechanisms we might be able to ensure that the generality of homes provided outside the social sector could be somewhat better. This is a crucial problem. With the present structure of rewards and penalties, there are simply not sufficient rewards for private developers&#151;the volume housebuilders&#151;to invest in good design. If we can find ways, through the operation of the HCA, having required through this legislation the HCA to take the constructive and proactive approach to design that we have discussed, the whole urban landscape and the whole development of housing could be improved. I thought that that was a very important consideration.</p>

<p><a name="08051383000023"></a>On the reservations expressed by my noble friend Lady Ford about two aspects of my proposals, I take very seriously&#151;as the whole Committee does&#151;the difficulties that she describes, as she is exceptionally experienced in this field. However, my amendment would not require that an architect as such should be appointed to the board; it should be someone with experience and capacity in design. She may take that as being little better than a quibble. I recognise that she makes an important point: if we should find ourselves appointing someone to a board who would, even if they were not obsessive about design, feel that that was what they were there to speak to all the time and that that was their single mission, that would not be a good way to constitute a board. I agree with what I think that she is suggesting&#151;that every member of a board should have a universality of responsibilities and should play their full part in ensuring the good governance and management of the organisation.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000024"></a>My noble friend Lady Ford was right, too&#151;just as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, was right&#151;to say you have to mainstream this commitment to design as a culture. The question is how you do it. If we are to have a board of possibly 12 people, however, it is not at all unreasonable for a Secretary of State in making those appointments to ensure that one of those 12 board members has some greater knowledge and avowed commitment to promoting good design and would play a full part in that regard. But it needs to be a part of the culture and it needs to be the expectation of the whole board and the chief executive that design will be mainstreamed.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000025"></a>My noble friend also expressed some doubts about design review, saying that it could cause delays so that we get a slower pace of development. I am not persuaded by that argument because it seems to me that if we can use pre-application discussion with design review panels, we stand a better chance of ensuring that the applications for building and development that are put to planning authorities are well considered, that right from the beginning there are high standards and aspirations in what is proposed and that the wrinkles and difficulties that there may initially be in applications are ironed out so that not only will we get better quality but we could well save time through greatly reducing the number of planning appeals.</p>

My worry is that changes to the Bill would give the sense that wherever the Homes and Communities Agency subsidises development it is its responsibility to constitute those design review panels.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC290"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08051383000029"></a><a name="80513-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08051383000062"></a>Lord Howarth of Newport:</b> I do not think that anybody would envisage that the Homes and Communities Agency should set up the design review panels, but we trust that there will be an extension of the design review facility universally across the country. The department and CABE are thinking about how to extend design review beyond the regions to become available to planning authorities in major cities and perhaps at county level, so it would be there and we would not be charging the HCA with that responsibility.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000030"></a>The need to ensure that we get better quality proposals has been emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, in his anecdote about the 50 different design proposals in his part of London, none of them any good. That is borne out by CABE&#146;s <I>H</I><I>ousing </I><I>A</I><I>udit</I> which reported that no less than 29 per cent of housing developments were so bad that they should never have received planning permission. We are not getting good enough design as it is. We have clearly got to find a solution. Even if the amendments that I have tabled are not perfect, I was encouraged that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who is, as always, at the sharp end as a member of a local planning committee feels that the requirement on planning committees that they should promote good design and the resource made available to them by, for example, design review are beneficial and help him in his work. We would be going with the grain.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000031"></a>The Minister was, as always, generous, positive and constructive. I appreciate the tone of her response. I am glad that she is going to think hard about the role for CABE because the interaction between CABE and the HCA, even if it is not expressed in the Bill, is going to be important in practical terms. That is part of addressing the question of how we are to impart more pervasively the appropriate abilities and skills within the HCA. CABE has been recommending post-occupancy analysis, so I am sure that a conversation between the Minister, her advisers and CABE would cast further light on what that might be about.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000032"></a>Are the amendments in this group necessary? I take the view that exhortation has not worked historically and is unlikely to work in the present circumstances, given the pressures to cut corners, make haste and economise. I also think that while planning policy statements have legislative force, they are insufficiently strong instruments to achieve what we need. That is why I have suggested that we should use this legislation to develop procedures that would help to ensure that the whole enormous process tended to produce better results than it otherwise would.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051383000033"></a>My noble friend mentioned that she was worried that what I was proposing might lead to innovation for the sake of it&#151;endless innovation. I am not so much interested in innovation, although of course talented people and creative professions will always be innovatory. I would be at least as happy to see traditional architecture, where that was what people wanted for their own homes. We are not talking about whether architecture is contemporary, cutting edge, innovative, or all those code words to denote

<p><a name="08051383000036"></a>[<I>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</I>]</p>

<p><a name="08051387000001"></a><a name="80513-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08051387000084"></a>Baroness Hamwee</b> moved Amendment No. 3:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051387000068"></a> Schedule 1, page 148, line 13, leave out paragraph (b)</p>
</ul>
<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000002"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 3 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 4, 5, 10 and 11. This group of amendments takes us, I hope fairly briefly, to some matters of governance of the new agency, particularly the question of declarations of interests.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000003"></a>The first amendment would take out the provision that the Secretary of State must be satisfied that a prospective appointee to the board has no,</p>
<ul><a name="08051387000079"></a>&#147;financial or other interest likely to affect prejudicially the exercise of the person's functions as a member&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051387000062"></a>and seeks to probe what interests the Government have in mind. I hope the provision is not meant to exclude everyone who has experience, or indeed capacity. It cannot be; that would not make sense. However, is it not part of the Nolan approach to appointments that one does not appoint someone who has a major interest? I do not know. That is why I ask the question. The issue of interests is important but I do not know why it needs saying.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000004"></a>The Secretary of State will have to satisfy himself&#151;herself, at the moment&#151;over a range of matters regarding candidates&#146; qualifications. Are we talking about a current interest or, as is often the case in other contexts, about an interest that applied over the previous three or five years? I am also interested&#151;this takes me on to subsequent amendments&#151;in how this lies with paragraph 9 of the schedule, which also deals with interests.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000005"></a>Next in sequence is paragraph 1(4), which states that the Secretary of State may require a candidate to provide information. The Minister said on the previous set of amendments that it was necessary to test provisions to destruction. I am not convinced of the necessity for this. How much do we have to put into primary legislation? Is it necessary to state that in an appointment process the Secretary of State can ask for information from a candidate? Frankly, if a candidate did not give the information the Secretary of State would think that there was something odd and the application would probably go in the bin. That is my testing to destruction.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000006"></a>Amendment No. 5 would insert a new, slightly different paragraph. On balance&#151;or more than on  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC292"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>balance&#151;I would really not like to exclude candidates who have good qualifications for membership of this new agency.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000007"></a>The other amendments suggest that the arrangement that works in local government is really not a bad one and is better and perhaps less degrading than is suggested in the Bill. In local government, an individual member, not being fingered by his colleagues&#151;which is what is proposed here&#151;makes a declaration and, if it is prejudicial, that member will take himself out of the decision-making environment. He will actually leave the meeting, rather than being removed as is proposed in the schedule. That is the thrust of my Amendments Nos. 10 and 11.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000008"></a>It has been a shorter debate than on the previous group of amendments, but these amendments are important in a different way. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="08051387000081"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

If the HCA is to work properly, most of its members will have interests that are in some way in conflict with the work that they are doing. That is an issue that has to be faced. There is only one way in which to face it, which is to ensure that it is all completely out in the open. Provided that we are satisfied that that is what the process will provide, we will not have any difficulty. I am sure that that is the motivation behind the amendments and equally sure that it is right that the question should be asked.</p>

<p><a name="08051387000010"></a><a name="80513-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0004.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08051387000086"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> I make a slightly different point from my noble friend. I have a great deal of sympathy for what lies behind the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I wish I had a fiver for every time I sat and listened to the response of Ministers to amendments such as these; the arguments seemed to vary enormously between Bills and departments. I remember the success that Mr Kaufman secured by writing a book on how to be a Minister as soon as he finished being a Minister. It would be no bad thing if somebody were to undertake that task in the context of this part of a Bill. It would then be possible for people like the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and me to have some idea of what kind of ground rules the Government were collectively working under. The criteria being applied seem to vary from Bill to Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08051387000011"></a><a name="80513-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0004.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08051387000087"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Often the most innocuous-looking amendments reveal the greatest issues in the Committee. I am grateful for the noble Baroness&#146;s explanation. I was a bit puzzled by her amendments because Amendment No. 3, for example, seeks to remove the ability of a Secretary of State to make an informed decision on whether a potential board member&#146;s interests, financial or otherwise, would impact prejudicially on their ability to undertake the functions of a board member. That would remove a very important part of the judgment that the Secretary of State needs to make.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC293"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000012"></a>Obviously, before making an appointment it is important, for reasons that we have already rehearsed this afternoon, that the Secretary of State is in full receipt of all the information that she needs to make that judgment.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000013"></a>If, for example, the person is a landowner or member or employee of another organisation, the Secretary of State will have to consider the potential implications of those interests balanced against the activities they would be expected to carry out as a board member. As we have said earlier, we are looking for people with relevant knowledge and experience. It may be that they will have financial or other interests that are relevant to the work of the agency, but it may also be that those interests will not affect its ability to do a very good and significant job on the board. Therefore, one needs that flexibility.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000014"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the relationship with paragraph 9 of Schedule 1. We provided in that paragraph that should any particular interest held by a member impact on a particular committee or sub-committee&#146;s considerations, he or she should declare that interest to the committee. The ability of the Secretary of State to exercise discretion over those interests when making an appointment is separate from the impact that those interests may have on the functions and activities of the HCA. That is how it ties up.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000015"></a>To expand on &#147;other interests&#148;, perhaps the noble Baroness would be interested to see the text taken from the application form for the chair of the HCA for the recommended wording in the Cabinet Office guidance on making and managing public appointments. It states that he or she is required to,</p>
<ul><a name="08051387000080"></a>&#147;give details of any business or other interests or any personal connections which, if you are appointed, could be misconstrued or cause embarrassment to the Homes and Communities Agency or communities or Communities and Local Government (CLG). These could include financial interests or share ownership, active connections with a field of expertise in which the Home and Communities Agency work, membership of societies, activities, associations or employment or a partner or friend in the particular field in which the public body operates. Any potential conflicts of interest ... will not prevent you going forward to interview but may, if appropriate, be explored with you ... to identify how you would address the issue(s).&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08051387000063"></a>That is a fairly full account of what we interpret as being &#147;other interests&#148; as well as financial interests.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000016"></a>On Clause 4, the noble Baroness asked why we need this in the Bill. The amendment would remove the ability of the Secretary of State to request information from a potential appointee who could help to explain the nature of any financial or other interests that people may hold, which would restrict the ability of the Secretary of State. As I have explained, it is a perfectly legitimate request. I seem to remember that when we debated the GLA Bill last year, we had a debate on the nature of information that would be requested under different circumstances. It might have been a different point, but I seem to remember that we had a not dissimilar debate.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000017"></a>Amendment No. 5 is very closely related to Amendment No. 3. Again, it removes the ability of the Secretary of State to request information from a  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC294"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>potential appointee that could help to explain the nature of any financial or other interests that a person may hold in relation to their ability to exercise the functions of an HCA board member. That, again, would restrict the ability of the Secretary of State to make informed decisions about the suitability of potential appointments.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000018"></a>Schedule 1(1)(3)(b) requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied that an appointee has no financial or other interests. That is the correct test and we do not want to remove the responsibility from the Secretary of State for deciding the nature of the interest held and the impact that it could have. We have already spoken today about the importance and significance attached to the work of the board and its wide scope and its need to have very credible, powerful advocates and so on. This is obviously a decision that needs to rest with the Secretary of State as long as she is in full receipt of all the necessary information. When a public appointment is made, someone has to take responsibility for satisfying themselves that the appointee is suitable. We again are driven by Cabinet Office guidance, which suggests that in these circumstances it is the responsibility of the Secretary of State to exercise that discretion.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000019"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 10, I accept what it seeks to achieve, which is to be commended. It is about securing openness and accountability in public bodies, which I appreciate&#151;but, predictably, it is not necessary. Alongside this legislation there is guidance in place that sets out that all NDPBs must have a code of practice under which board members must operate. I understand that English Partnerships has such a requirement that places discretion in the hands of the chair of the committee about whether a member should remain on that committee if they have an interest. The Housing Corporation has a similar provision in its code of conduct. Therefore, it makes sense that the new agency has a similar requirement in the code of conduct that its own board members will have to adhere to.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000020"></a>I also suggest that, should a board member consider it appropriate, they could themselves seek to leave the meeting. Clearly, legislation is not required to enable them to do that. It may not just be for reasons of any interest that may be held; there may be issues such as previous involvement or certain knowledge of the issues, so it encompasses a wider spread. I know that Members of the Committee will be aware that the Committee on Standards in Public Life has set out the seven principles by which public appointees should carry out their functions, often referred to as the Nolan principles. We would expect the HCA board, as with every other public appointee, to adhere to those principles.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000021"></a>I hope that that helps to clarify concern on that particular amendment. Amendment No. 11 follows much the same procedures. It has made me think carefully about the actual proceedings in committees versus the theoretical proceedings. I understand the intent and it is to be applauded, because it would formally require any former member who has a declared interest to absent themselves from the meeting while the particular matter is under discussion. In practical terms, I believe that it is already standard procedure

With those caveats, I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

Of course, it is entirely right that there should be a code of conduct. I have no quarrel with that at all, but I find it odd that it is not necessary to say in the Bill that there should be a code of conduct or some reference in the way that I put forward, but it is necessary to say in primary legislation&#151;in a Bill of 222 pages&#151;that the Secretary of State can ask questions of the candidate when a candidate is applying for an appointment. I am sorry if I am repeating myself. Let me make it entirely clear that I do not have any argument with Cabinet Office guidelines or with the desirability of seeking information. But the Bill does not say that the Secretary of State should appoint the best person for the job. If it were to say anything about what the Secretary of State should do, it could have said that, but common sense prevailed.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000023"></a>On the point made by the Minister about the Greater London Authority, we were debating whether the Assembly could require information in connection with confirmatory hearings. The distinction is that the Assembly will not be taking the decision: it is simply seeking to put into the public arena the issues around particular appointments, which is a different issue. I heard what the Minister said. I did not expect to win on this issue, but I did feel a need to air it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Graham, said, &#147;Please remember the objectives&#148;, which was a telling point. However, I suppose that it is true to say that they have not changed much. All of the objectives in the predecessor bodies are similar to the objectives in this Bill, which will be in the Act. The biggest single change is the creation of Oftenant by splitting out the regulatory functions, but that is more a matter of how to do it than whether the objectives are different.</p>

<p><a name="08051387000028"></a>I was struck by a comment from the Minister when she talked about independence and having a strong board. That is very important.

<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC296"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Brooke who said we should remember that Secretaries of State change and Acts of Parliament go on, Governments change and Acts of Parliament go on, and the predecessor Acts have done rather well. I believe the New Towns Act was in 1981 and in 1985 there was a change&#151;and in 1993 we had the Urban Regeneration Agency. I remember that many responsibilities went to English Partnerships as a result of a manifesto commitment of 1997.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000029"></a>It is important to remember that there are degrees of continuity and that changes are made. In those circumstances, how does a board have certainty? How can it understand how it will be selected and how much of a franchise it has? It seems to me that, reading the schedule as drafted, the Secretary of State can give a member of the board any kind of terms that he decides. That seems to me too discretionary and almost arbitrary.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000030"></a>That takes me back to the numbers. I refer to my noble friend Lord Brooke, who said that it is quite good to know what the rules will be and not to be surprised by the rules because they are different in similar circumstances. As is frequently the case, I would like to see a minimum and a maximum, say, between nine and 15 on the board. I do not suppose you would want 15 and I do not suppose you would really want nine, but you certainly would not want six. After this afternoon&#146;s discussions, the idea that six people could cover the waterfront for this &#163;4 billion-a-year agency seems to be completely unrealistic.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000031"></a>On Amendment No. 6, I am not in any way tied to the wording, but, from day one, the board should understand its own position. It would know at the end of three years&#151;I prefer three years to five years&#151;that a third of its members would have to retire. The Secretary of State will either reappoint them or not. From there onwards, each year, one-third of the members of the board will retire. Everyone on the board will know that that is the way it will work. I believe that three years is quite long enough for people who had the requisite experience when they were appointed to get their feet under the table and to become major contributors. I also think that working on the basis of one-third of members retiring each year is an extremely healthy situation. Everyone will know where they are and the Secretary of State will be free to determine how the one-third is dealt with. This is a very sensible system. How that is put into the Bill is entirely a matter for the Minister.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000032"></a>Amendments Nos. 7 and 12 are probing amendments. Amendment No. 7 is a very small probe. I am perfectly clear that the chief executive of the HCA will be the accounting officer. Amendment No. 12 is more material. I need to read out a couple of things to the Committee. The English Partnerships financial statement said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051387000072"></a>&#147;The Commission and the Agency are sponsored by CLG which in turn is governed by HM Treasury&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051387000064"></a>a rather wonderful sentence, that. It went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051387000073"></a>&#147;There is regular liaison between CLG and English Partnerships to ensure that Departmental Expenditure Limits are met and to ensure that accounting treatment is consistent with HM Treasury guidance&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08051387000033"></a>Where has the Treasury gone? It is not in the Bill. There must be a reason for that. It seems unlikely that the Treasury will disappear. It seems unlikely also that it will not continue to wish to exercise the same control over the behaviour of non-departmental public bodies which it has always exercised. High-spending non-departmental public bodies in the monitoring group usually face people not only from their sponsor department but also from the Treasury. The Committee needs an explanation as to how this will happen. If you were a cantankerous chief executive of a non-departmental public body, which I was certainly judged to be many years ago, you would look at this legislation and say, &#147;I don&#146;t get letters from the Treasury. What&#146;s this about the Treasury? I only get letters from the Secretary of State, because there is no mention of the Treasury in my Act of Parliament. I have no formal link. Parliament has not decided to give me a formal link with the Treasury&#148;.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000034"></a>A full explanation of the role of the Treasury in the face of the HCA and how it will change, if at all, from the way in which matters operate today, is needed. I beg to move.</p>

A body such as this, with the resources that it will have, will turn over money at a fairly rapid rate if it is working effectively. One hopes that it will be a profitable operation, and the Treasury will definitely want to take an interest in it. I doubt that it would let the Secretary of State retain any positive balances in the department; I am quite sure that they would go back into central funds. We should have a proper explanation of the relationship with the Treasury.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000036"></a>The terms of appointment should be clear. A minimum of three years is insufficient. I rather like the idea of retiring the members in thirds but their being eligible for reappointment, which would keep them turning over but also allow for the accidents of history&#151;although they can be taken care of by other means. It would make everybody quite clear about the ground on which they were working. They would know that they would be there for three years if they were doing the job well. They would probably continue for three more years, and three more after that, if they were successful. They need that certainty. A minimum of three years is not sufficient for an appointment of the calibre of person that we hope to attract into this job.</p>

His point about the Treasury is exactly the sort of thing which might go into the publication to which I previously alluded.

They would be there for three years and then, whether they liked it or not, would be terminated or their services not renewed. Three years is a short time in the life of what I hope this body will evolve into. From a strategy point of view, we are looking at 10, 15 or 20 years at least. It is 20 years since such a major change as is envisaged in the Bill. We are looking for people to devote themselves, their lives, their careers and their prospects substantially, if not wholly, to the fulfilment of the strategic objectives of the Bill. People might argue that there are elections every three or four years and it is up to the electorate to take them off if they want to, but I am not looking at this as a resting place for politicians. The political complexion of individuals will probably be known and balanced, but we are looking for men and women who can devote themselves to the strategic objectives of the Bill for a period longer than three years. I know the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and his supporters may say that if they have done a first-class job, they can be renewed. Of course they can, but uncertainty about whether they will be renewed after three years is a heavy burden. The Minister may have something to say on that.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000039"></a>In the absence of these amendments, I remember that there is a body that recommends a finite limit to the useful life of a member of a body of this kind&#151;I think it is 10 years. If we are looking at a 10-year membership, or two periods of 5 years, that is more acceptable and agreeable. Above all, the officers of this body need to rely not just on continuity but also longevity. I would not be surprised if some people who were originally appointed were there for many years, but under this amendment, some people who are appointed would possibly be for the chop after the first year because the three-year rotation system must take place. I do not look forward to members of the body that has these imperatives looking over their shoulders every year at a major change in the membership. I look forward to what the Minister has to say. I do not like the amendment and hope that it is not acceptable to her either.</p>

<p><a name="08051387000042"></a>I hope that I can reassure my noble friend that there are standards and guidelines to ensure that the recruitment of board members is open and fair. We rely on the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, OCPA, which already has clear guidelines on the length of appointment terms for board members. A member&#146;s term of appointment will not generally last for longer than 10 years and this period may include two terms of office&#151;for example, two terms of five years. To be appointed for the second term of five years, the member would have to have received a satisfactory performance assessment, so I am sure that noble Lords will agree there is a measure of performance reporting. I have just checked with my noble friend Lady Ford who tells me that the average tenure on the board of English Partnerships was five years. It will be a matter for the Secretary of State to determine the length of appointments, but she is bound by these principles.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000043"></a>I worry that the amendments proposed by my noble friend&#151;my noble friend Lord Graham alluded to this&#151;may not be sensible in terms of good and stable government. There would be built-in inconsistency and turbulence if you had to recruit a third of the board every year. That would disable strategic leadership. I hope that the noble Viscount in particular will accept that argument and be reassured by it.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000044"></a>I turn to the noble Viscount&#146;s Amendment No. 7. He is absolutely right. The accounting officer is indeed the chief executive&#151;who will be Sir Bob Kerslake&#151;which is the normal procedure.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000045"></a>On his Amendment No. 12, it is charming to hear that the Treasury has so many friends around the Room and that noble Lords want it to be more, rather than less, visible. An explicit requirement for the Secretary of State to give HMT approval prior to issuing an accounts direction is not needed. The current financial requirements placed on public bodies stem from the Treasury&#146;s guidance, <I>Managing Public Money</I>, and the financial reporting manual. Under the requirements of this guidance, all sponsoring departments must have a framework document that sets out what the specific responsibilities of the body will be. One part of that is the accounting arrangements. The Secretary of State of the sponsoring department must issue to the body an accounts direction that has the agreement of HM Treasury. Therefore, the Secretary of State is already under a duty to consult HMT before issuing any accounts direction. The Treasury&#146;s involvement in the form of accounts that the HCA will issue is therefore implicit; it will be required before any directions issued by the Secretary of State under paragraph 12(5) of Schedule 1. I am fairly convinced, although I stand to be corrected, that this is fairly common practice in legislation, which is why we do not need the explicit approval of the Treasury to be mentioned in the Bill, but I shall be happy to hear what the noble Viscount has to say.</p>

I am not going to die in a ditch for two periods of five years as against three periods of three years. I am looking for certainty in the minds of members of the board about their circumstances because they talk to each other about their chances of being reappointed. They have those discussions. If they are to act as an independent and strong board, they need that certainty and to have as much doubt removed from their lives as possible.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000047"></a>It is absolutely fine to talk about guidelines, but I would prefer that Parliament decides on these matters. Guidelines can be changed whereas Acts of Parliament are more difficult to change. These provisions give the Executive too much power and the Secretary of State too much discretion and too much flexibility, which it would be better to reduce. I may wish to come back to this matter.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000048"></a>Just before concluding, there is another inconsistency. Sometimes the chief executive is a member of the board and sometimes not. No reason is ever given for why on this occasion we decided that the chief executive should be a member of the board and on that occasion we decided the reverse. One has a suspicion that the reasons lie in the terms of agreement with the individual, and Parliament is unsighted on that. That is not right. I happen to support the chief executive not being on the board because a fully independent set of directors on a non-departmental public body is better than mixing it up in a private sector mode with executive directors. I must choose my words carefully, but it is much easier for the Treasury to control the game if the board is unitary than if it is wholly non-executive. That comes from hard experience of having been both chairman and chief executive of more than one non-departmental public body.</p>

<p><a name="08051387000049"></a>I thank the Minister for her answer about the question on the Treasury, but the point goes rather wider. For example, in relation to a housing corporation&#146;s finances, the Housing Associations Act 1985, which is still relevant, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051387000075"></a>&#147;The Treasury may issue to the Secretary of State out of the National Loans Fund such sums as are necessary&#148;,</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051387000076"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may act under this section only with the approval of the Treasury&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051387000067"></a>The Treasury comes into the whole question of borrowings, the terms on which the borrowings are made and on repayments in one or other of the Acts. It is not only a matter of the accounting directions, which is an administrative matter about which I have no problems. I can see that it is entirely sensible to be controlled by directions issued by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury. The Minister said that it was not necessary to have that in the Bill. I think that it would be better to include it, but I would not die in a ditch about it. However, other aspects of the Treasury's involvement need to be reconsidered.</p>

Amendment No. 8 removes a provision of the schedule and replaces it with pretty much, but not quite, the exact opposite. This is another point about governance. It is not at all personal to any members of staff of the HCA who have been or may be appointed, but it is to provide that no member of staff should be a member of the board, a committee or a sub-committee. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, trailed this in his last amendment, and I entirely agree. Members of the board and members of the staff have entirely distinct roles and responsibilities in an organisation of this sort, which should not necessarily follow the model of a city corporation or a PLC. They are quite different responsibilities and it muddies the waters if the chief executive&#151;I assume that that would be the member of staff primarily at issue&#151;takes board decisions.</p>

That muddles who is taking the decisions. Political decisions as well as executive decisions will have to be taken. I am not suggesting that the chief executive and others will not contribute to the making of policy, but policy is made and the executive should carry it out. I have said enough for the Minister to respond. One could obviously have this debate in great detail and at great length, but I suspect that that would not be favourable to the Committee this evening. I beg to move.</p>

The kind of committees and sub-committees that I imagine the Homes and Communities Agency will have will not be dissimilar to the type that we had at English Partnerships. One example would be the Milton Keynes Partnership Committee, where not only were non-executive board members of English Partnerships in membership, but the chief executive was the accounting officer of the organisation, so it is not dissimilar to what is being proposed in London. The practical point is that not only was the Milton Keynes committee very time consuming and we could not always ask non-executive board members to give the amount of time or expertise that was necessary, but there were day-to-day delegations to that committee that could best be supported by full-time members of staff. The sub-committees that the agency will have are different from the kind of committees and sub-committees that one might find in a local authority&#151;they tend to be more executive in nature than concerned with policy. For those reasons, I would encourage the Minister to resist the amendment.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051387000061"></a>I have a good deal of sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about the mayor chairing that London committee. We must remember that more than half the budget of this organisation will be invested in London, so this sub-committee will be an immensely powerful body. Notwithstanding the nature of the London sub-committee, the accounting officer of the organisation will still be personally accountable to the Secretary of State and to Parliament for the use of those funds, so it is essential that the accounting officer is a member of that committee. However, I would think that the more appropriate opposite number for the mayor would be the chair of the new organisation, although it is important that the accounting officer is there. For reasons of practicality, oversight and providing the best kind of advice, we must resist an amendment that would cut the accounting officer out of sitting on these committees. We could cast the net more widely and make sure that we had the right kind of executives on the type of executive committees that this agency will principally be engaged with.</p>

The annual report and accounts of English Partnerships records the audit committee, the remuneration committee and the major projects committee&#151;I may not have the title quite right&#151;and all members of the board are entitled to attend. Another, which I suspect comes out of the new towns, is Milton Keynes, which is a joint committee and has probably been in existence for a very long time. We are talking about committees and sub-committees of the board.</p>

The Milton Keynes sub-committee is quite new. It was created only three years ago and is a full sub-committee of the English Partnerships board. Because it was a sub-committee of the board, our vice-chairman sat on that committee, but the accounting officer who had oversight of the investment programme of that sub-committee was a full member of our board.

<p><a name="08051389000004"></a><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08051389000121"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I thank the noble Baroness for that and I am entirely sympathetic to the point. Under this paragraph, the Secretary of State is plunging into the game of committees to far too great an extent. I cannot understand why the agency cannot govern its own proceedings. Of course, there is some throwback to the 1993 Act, which states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051389000110"></a>&#147;the Agency may regulate its own procedure (including quorum) and that of any committee&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051389000088"></a>But paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 17 of the 1993 Act states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051389000098"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may give directions as to the exercise by the Agency of its power under sub-paragraph (1) to regulate procedure&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051389000089"></a>which is strengthened in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Schedule 1 to the Bill. Has the Secretary of State ever given directions on how the board should proceed? Where are they recorded? No doubt, they would be in the accounts of the year concerned and not repeated every year. It would be interesting to see them.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000005"></a>I do not understand how a non-departmental public body can be expected to be independent and strong if it does not even regulate its own procedure. That is a contradiction in terms. People are appointed to be members of a board. There is a code of practice and guidelines, and you would expect it, led by its chairman, to regulate itself satisfactorily. The same thing is stated in paragraph 7:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051389000099"></a>&#147;The HCA may, subject to any directions ... decide ... its own procedure and ... the procedure of any of its committees or sub-committees&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051389000090"></a>which is a sweep up on top of all the other conditions put onto them. What sort of direction might the Secretary of State wish to issue to the HCA on its procedure?</p>

<p><a name="08051389000006"></a><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08051389000122"></a>Baroness Ford:</b> Perhaps I may help with that. By and large, these organisations have been in charge of their own procedure. I take the noble Viscount&#146;s point that the audit committee, the remuneration committee and the nominations committee were always simply comprised of non-executive directors, as you would expect in terms of good governance. Let us take the example of Milton Keynes: notwithstanding the fact that that sub-committee was to be a sub-committee of the English Partnerships board on direction or guidance or by request&#151;I cannot remember which it was at that point&#151;we were left in no doubt that the Secretary of State was very anxious that the local authority should have full representation on that body and that the business community and voluntary organisations would do likewise. I recall that the appointment of the independent chair to that sub-committee, Sir Robert Reid, notwithstanding the fact that it was a sub-committee of my board, was made by the then Deputy Prime Minister. I do not know whether that helps the noble Viscount or maybe just gives him more grist to his mill.</p>

Having listened to the description of the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, I would have thought that could have been reached by agreement. I bet it would have been reached by agreement in an ordinary exchange of views and would not have needed a direction to make it happen.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000008"></a>I am on familiar ground of my own. I am bothered about the way in which directions are creeping into all kinds of Acts of Parliament when they are not necessary. They weaken the independence of the bodies concerned because if you know that there is a power in reserve to give you directions about how you should organise your own procedure, you cannot afford to ignore it and you have to take it into account.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000009"></a>It is always possible to have a committee of the board and to have the people who know what you need to know in attendance, but you do not always have to form a committee. If in another life I was the chief executive of the HCA and not on the board, I would be very quick to give the chairman advice about how to organise his committee structure.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000010"></a><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="08051389000124"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> When I first looked at the amendments I thought they made good sense. The arguments have been developed a little further but to me it makes sense that no member of staff&#151;and that includes the chief executive&#151;should be a member of the committee or the sub-committee or on the board. For example, at a council level you do not expect the chief executive to be a member of the council. He attends all the council meetings, gives very good advice, which is valued and listened to, but he is not a member of the council. As my noble friend Lord Eccles said, he can attend sub-committees and contribute very well indeed, but he does not have to be a member of the board or the sub-committee and that is the right way round.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000011"></a><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew22"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="08051389000125"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> It has been an interesting debate and I have learnt a great deal in the process. I am not sure that I will add very much to that sum of knowledge. This will not be the first time that I shall say how grateful I am to my noble friend Lady Ford for showing how, in practice, much of what we are trying to achieve with the HCA has been successfully anticipated in English Partnerships.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000012"></a>It is important that staff members of the agency are allowed to participate fully in some committees. Reference has been made to executive committees and we spoke earlier about the importance of expertise and practical, on-the-ground knowledge. That knowledge also needs to be in committees, as appropriate. A practical example is the finance committee that currently exists for English Partnerships. I know noble Lords will agree that it is right and proper that the finance director for English Partnerships is allowed to sit and participate in that committee and take part in decisions. If the amendment were agreed to, that simply would not be possible.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000013"></a>As my noble friend Lady Ford said, the HCA will have numerous committees and sub-committees. We have a practical problem here because if we do not have expert staff supporting the work of those committees, we will have to have a much bigger  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC305"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>board. Quite simply, there will not be enough people to cover the HCA&#146;s wide range of responsibilities. We have already spoken about the Milton Keynes English Partnerships committee. I imagine it would have been a serious disability if there had not been that member of staff on EP helping to direct and shape expenditure and growth in the area covered by the partnership. I would not like to see the amendment knock that out of play. It should be remembered that the chief executive is a staff member. He also sits on the board and that is considered good practice by Cabinet Office guidance. That is another thing that would be lost under the amendment.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000014"></a>On the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, the London sub-committee will be an extremely important part of the HCA board. The noble Baroness is quite right, the chief executive will be the vice-chair of the committee and the Mayor of London will act as the chair. For all the reasons that the noble Baroness knows from her wide experience of governing London, we see the chief executive&#146;s position as absolutely essential, given the challenge posed by housing and regeneration in the city. The intention is that the committee will report to the HCA board on the scope and level of work undertaken by the agency in London, and the involvement of the chief executive will help to ensure that it meets the needs and requirements. The specific arrangements for that sub-committee are still being decided.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000015"></a>I shall turn to the final amendment in this group and pick up some of the points that the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, made. In it, the noble Baroness seeks to ensure that staff members cannot easily become full members of committee. Clause 6(4) of Schedule 1 would allow staff members to become members of a committee or sub-committee, but only with the express approval of the Secretary of State and, given what the noble Viscount has said about the role of the Secretary of State, I cannot believe that he would welcome that. It would certainly create an additional workload, and it is inappropriate for the Secretary of State to be involved at that level of detail. It does not make any sense. We, like him, expect that matters of this sort will be discussed and agreed amicably. For example, we will be discussing the role of key staff, such as the chief executive and the financial director, in the internal governance committees in the HCA and the role that staff will play. This will be managed sensibly, but the board will be accountable to the Secretary of State for the operations of the agency, with the staff being accountable to the board, subject to their overall accountability to the Secretary of State. I shall not repeat myself, but I hope that that response helps to clarify the roles we expect members and staff of the HCA to play in relation to committees and sub-committees.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000016"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, asked whether we know of any directions that have been issued in this context. My noble friend Lady Ford referred to the direction that has been required for the Milton Keynes partnership. I do not know of any others. Although the power is in the Bill, it is extremely unlikely that the Secretary of State would issue  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC306"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>directions on a matter such as committee procedures. It might be necessary in extremely rare cases, but it is very unlikely, let alone routine. The amendments would prevent the HCA playing the full role that it needs to play, bearing in mind that it will need the full support and expertise of its staff. I believe that to have staff on the right committees, as appropriate, would be an important part of its ability to respond to the challenges that face it.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000017"></a><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0006.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="08051389000126"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I remain troubled. There is no suggestion that the chief executive or other members of staff should not attend and give advice, but there is an enormous distinction between advising and being part of the decision-making process. The Minister referred to the staff being accountable to the board. That is how I still see it. I also find troubling the proposition that one has to create a committee substantially consisting of staff because the board members cannot manage to attend the number of committees, particularly when it is possible to appoint people outside the pool of board members and staff to committees and sub-committees. Perhaps we should look at the scheme of delegation for the new agency when it comes along. I do not want to try to trip up the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, but it occurred to me that in the scenario she painted there might be the possibility of a quorum being achieved by members of staff only. She is nodding. That supports my case. I will think about this further. For reasons known by those who have followed the recent sagas in London, governance arrangements are uppermost in my mind, and I would like to see this governance-proofed, if I can put it that way, before we give it our blessing. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000025"></a>That may be fine for English Partnerships and the other, what I would call, contributory bodies being subsumed into the organisation, but although one has no difficulty with the objects, the clause does not pay due respect to all the other organisations involved. Standing in isolation, if the board were to look at those objects and say, &#147;This is our function&#148;, it would not work. We know it would not work; the noble Baroness knows it would not work; and she has said so. I am the first to acknowledge that she has made it perfectly plain that if this new agency is to work well, it has to work within the planning system and in co-operation with the local authorities which deal with planning and so on.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000026"></a>The amendments in this group are simply designed to make that plain. The way in which the clause is drafted is almost cruel as it disregards the huge quantum of work that is done across the whole community, with no acknowledgement whatever.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000027"></a>I shall be a little naughty and quote from a couple of speeches which the noble Baroness made recently. She will recognise them. The Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051389000105"></a>&#147;I stress that the Government will look to involve and consult closely local authorities when the use of these clauses is being considered. Indeed, in the one example that we have so far, when English Partnerships used its similar powers in Milton Keynes, the local authority was fully involved in establishing the delivery vehicle.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051389000106"></a>&#147;With such a range of powers, noble Lords will want to be assured that we are not creating a behemoth or a juggernaut that will slow things down, impose top-down demands or frustrate other partners&#151;whether housing associations, regional development agencies or local authorities. ... The relationship between local authorities and the HCA will be critical. The agency will be no less than local government&#146;s best delivery partner, working with the grain of local ambitions and local needs, while securing the achievement of government targets&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/4/08; col. 43.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051389000092"></a>That is absolutely fine. A bit later on the same day, the Minister went on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051389000107"></a>&#147;With powers come relationships, particularly relationships with local authorities. The powers of the HCA are wide because the task is wide. I believe the objectives that we have already expanded upon in another place meet the task before us. Because the objectives are wider, the powers we are taking&#151;in relation to planning they are inherited powers&#151;will be wider, too. Let me give the sort of assurances that were given time and again in another place by Ministers that the powers that we have taken are exceptional. They will be exceptional in use and will be governed by the Secretary of State's involvement. We will be in discussion with local authorities on the very rare occasions when the HCA needs to take planning powers... I turn to relationships with local authorities, which goes to the heart of much of what the HCA will be able to achieve... The HCA sits within the planning system. Nothing that the HCA will do will be outside the planning system. Its relationships with the regions&#151;the regional spatial economic strategies, the future single regional strategies and local development plans and frameworks&#151;will be crucial... the key to success will lie in its ability actively to collaborate at regional and local levels&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/4/08; cols. 115-116.]</p>

I handed in a printed page with a heading on the top and added the name of my noble friend Lord Cathcart in script. They clearly thought that it was a slip of the pen&#151;which it was&#151;but it was deliberate.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000029"></a>There is a very important issue here. The amendment is not being proposed to change the Bill in a very substantive way, but I tabled it because it would improve the psychology of the Bill. There are in the country a lot of people who are very worried, despite all the assurances that they were given in the other place, which the Minister has repeated, that this agency has the potential to become a monster. We need to write on the Bill words that ensure that it cannot become that. This does nothing to prevent, in appropriate circumstances, the allocation of planning powers, if that is deemed necessary. But the issue of partnership and co-operation will be absolutely fundamental to success.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000030"></a>The Government&#146;s housing targets are not for social housing; they are global housing targets, with a large quantum of construction aimed deliberately at the private sector where the demand, even now, goes far ahead of the available supply&#151;and I disregard the existing situation, which exacerbates the difficulties that the housing industry faces. Demand is much greater than supply, and we have to find a way round that, which will not be done if there is a feeling that somebody could ride roughshod over the local communities who are already very heavily involved and committed to development to meet their needs. There is a third party that we have not mentioned but which is equally disregarded: the whole development industry, which is used to working in partnership with local authorities through the planning authorities. They have an intimate relationship and they work closely, so we need to make sure that that can continue.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000031"></a>This is really a psychological amendment, which I hope that the Minister will take very seriously. I have not suggested that she could just stand up and say yes to it.

<p><a name="08051389000035"></a>It is not a partnership of equals that is envisaged&#151;it cannot be, because the HCA will be the body with all the resources and all the loot. It can put that into schemes in the social housing and regeneration sectors, and into other work that it does. Local authorities in particular will need to get those resources from and through the HCA. As the HCA will in many ways have the whip hand over whether to provide the resources, it has huge influence and power already. It is clear that if the HCA wants to carry out many successful schemes, it will have do so in a way in which the local authorities co-operate and which they think is the right way forward; otherwise, in extremis, the local authorities will simply say, &#147;We&#146;re not going to do it, because we don&#146;t agree with it&#148;. There is nothing new about this: it is the way in which the Housing Corporation already works with RSLs, and English Partnerships with local authorities. The greater the co-operation and agreement, the greater is the success. There is nothing new or exceptional about it.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000036"></a>Clause 5 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051389000109"></a>&#147;The HCA may provide housing or other land&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051389000095"></a>It is a bare statement which is not qualified in any way. The clause goes on to state that it,</p>
<ul><a name="08051389000111"></a>&#147;may facilitate the provision of housing or other land&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051389000037"></a>&#147;Facilitate&#148; is a good word here; it is exactly the relationship that should apply. When it says that the HCA may provide housing or other land in an unqualified way, there is a threat that the agency will come in and use it its powers, regardless of what the local authority or local people think. So Amendment No. 46 is to qualify that.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000038"></a>Amendment No. 48 is to qualify a similar statement that the HCA may regenerate or develop land. Amendment No. 49 refers to bringing about the more effective use of land and qualifies it in the same way. Amendment No. 50 is to qualify the bald statement that he HCA may provide &#147;infrastructure&#148;. There is a nice list on the previous page of the Bill, in Clause 2, as to what infrastructure includes&#151;everything from water, electricity, gas, telecommunications, roads and other transport facilities right through to burial facilities and any other community facilities not falling within the previous list. So it is pretty well everything, really. Again, I suggest that that should be qualified.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000039"></a>Amendment No. 52 would qualify the powers to deal with land, which ranges from,</p>
<ul><a name="08051389000112"></a>&#147;acquiring, holding, improving, managing, reclaiming, repairing&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051389000096"></a>and so on, housing and other property, right through to demolishing derelict buildings. I have a few derelict buildings in my part of the world and I would be delighted if the HCA came and demolished them&#151;but I would rather that it did so after asking us

If it does that, it will get some of the wrong ones.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000040"></a>These are probing and challenging amendments, which ask exactly what the relationship between the HCA and local authorities will be. What is the extent to which the HCA may take over local authority functions and the planning functions, as well as the ones listed in the amendment&#151;as the noble Lord Dixon-Smith, said? In what circumstances do the Government expect these powers to be used? Perhaps most importantly of all, do the Government expect that these powers will be used in agreement with the local authority, as we are told happened in Milton Keynes, or to override local authority objections to what is being proposed? The obvious topical issue, where people are worried that these powers might be used in opposition to local feeling, is the whole question of the so-called eco-towns, which may or may not be imposed on communities whether or not they like them. If the Government decide to go ahead with eco-towns and the local authorities in the area do not agree with it, are these the powers that they would use or are there some other powers in the Planning Bill or elsewhere?</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000041"></a>Those are the key questions on the relationship between the HCA and local authorities. I do not think that local authorities generally object to the creation of the HCA; they are concerned that it will be a bigger and possibly more monstrous quango&#151;but one hopes that it will not. But because it is bigger, perhaps it will have more clout and local authorities will have less discretion and less say about what happens in their areas. That is the basic issue that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and I are trying to tease out. We look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000045"></a>On the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, I have an enormous amount of sympathy with the sentiment that he expressed. He said that he was trying to send a psychological message, which is absolutely right. I like that for two reasons: first, it is eminently faithful to not only the thought that went into the creation of the new agency but the extensive round of consultation that took place in the summer of 2007, when exactly that kind of stall was set out by the team that I led and we tried to describe how the new organisation would operate. The words here are exactly the words that we used at that time.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000046"></a>Secondly, I rather like it because I think it will be greatly welcomed by the board and the staff of the Homes and Communities Agency. To a man and  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC311"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>woman they would agree that that would be the way, ideally, they would want to operate with partners and local authorities. So, for those reasons, I rather like the noble Lord&#146;s choice of words.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, made some interesting points about the nature of the planning powers of the new organisation. English Partnerships had old planning powers that were residual to the New Towns Act and at any time over the past 10 years we could have chosen to use those powers in new town jurisdictions to override the local planning authority. That was not desirable philosophically, and politically we were always encouraged by successive Secretaries of State not to even contemplate it. In Milton Keynes we agreed with the local authority that it was important to use local authority planning powers rather than rely on the old English Partnerships powers under Section 7(1). All of the work that took place in Milton Keynes in that period happened through the normal Town and Country Planning Acts.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000048"></a>In contrast, I tried on a number of occasions to move along developments in Basildon, another former new town, and the local authority there, for a variety of reasons, was not sympathetic to what English Partnerships was proposing or trying to do. Theoretically, we could have used our own planning powers on those sites, but the board never dreamed of doing so. We were certainly heavily discouraged by different Secretaries of State from going down that route. In fact, occasionally people were frustrated and thought that we might get on if we did use these powers, but there was never any encouragement, explicit or implicit, to do that. I cannot imagine many, if any, circumstances in which the new agency would dictate terms to local authorities. That would be contrary to the spirit of how the agency is being set up.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000049"></a>I know he is here at present but I shall spare the blushes of the designate chief executive, Sir Bob Kerslake. I cannot think of any circumstances in which Bob would create a culture where there was anything other than a proper and genuine partnership with local authorities.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000050"></a>The only concern that I have about the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, is that in singling out local government we do not pay much attention to the fact that the Homes and Communities Agency, particularly where sub-regional infrastructure crosses the boundaries of one or more local authorities, will work absolutely in line with the decisions of the regional spatial and economic strategies. So, in that regard, it also has to pay close attention to the regional bodies as well as individual local authorities as it goes about its business. It is a small quibble, but I very much support the spirit of what the noble Lord is seeking to do and I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment. I shall leave it to my noble friend the Minister and others to comment more fully on the planning, but I would say, genuinely and sincerely, that that was never the intention of the way in which the plans for the agency were laid.</p>

But we should take seriously the concerns of the Local Government Association and the world of local government about the potential power of the HCA in relation to local government.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000052"></a>Of course, my noble friend Lady Ford, drawing from her experience as chairman of English Partnerships, has offered us important reassurance. I very much take what she said about the disposition we can confidently anticipate from Sir Bob Kerslake. Anyone who is aware of his record of service to local government, as chief executive of the London Borough of Hounslow and of Sheffield City Council, will not doubt that he is a local government man and a very good friend of local government. That offers us important reassurance.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000053"></a>None the less, the symbolism of the powers proposed in this legislation, and the symbolism and psychology of Amendment No. 13 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, are important. During my political life I have witnessed repeated assaults&#151;indeed, smash-and-grab raids&#151;by central government on local government. These have occurred under Governments of both parties. If ever the fiscal excesses of the loony left justified the extension of Treasury control that occurred in the 1970s and the 1980s, there can be no justification for them now, in economic terms, in the global economy in which we find ourselves. The old arguments that a bit more borrowing by local government would crowd out the capacity of the private sector to invest may or may not have had a grain of validity 30 years ago, but they do not have any relevance now.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000054"></a>We have chosen to constrain ourselves, in signing the treaty of Maastricht, to maintaining public borrowing within 3 per cent of GDP, and we have to take account of that constraint, but I would like to see local government spending and borrowing fairly and squarely accountable to local electors. If local electors do not like what their local authorities are doing, if they think they are running up excessively large bills and an excessively large burden of interest, it is open to them to kick them out and elect someone else. That is how our democracy ought to work.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000055"></a>The relationship between central and local government is, perhaps, in this sense a zero-sum game. We have seen central government progressively aggrandise themselves at the expense of local government. I have seen too many Ministers of both parties who built their early careers in local government&#151;and no doubt were stout defenders of the rights and the virtues of local government&#151;approach life very differently when they arrive in central government, being overweeningly dismissive of local government.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000056"></a>The Treasury has aggrandised itself over central government as well as over local government. It was always unbearable to the Treasury that it was unable to control some 25 per cent or 30 per cent of public spending. Over the years it has made sure that its control has been tightened and tightened.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000057"></a>This attrition of local government over some 30 years has been an attrition of our democratic culture. That is an extremely important matter. There has  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC313"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been a better tendency in recent years through modest devolution and restoration of powers back to local government. But what has been given has been measured out in coffee spoons, grudgingly and minimally, and expressed in the condescending language of &#147;earned autonomy&#148;. When my right honourable friend David Miliband was Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government he had a principled view that the democratic scope and dignity of local government ought to be restored. So as we examine the powers over local government proposed for the HCA, we should be sensitive to these matters and recognise that, for all its good intentions&#151;and perhaps for all the necessity for some of these powers&#151;the HCA will be an unelected body and its accountability to the people will be more remote than the accountability of local government.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000058"></a>I hope that in her comments on the burden and spirit of this and other amendments relating to the relationship between the HCA and local government, as well as in other public statements where her words may be more widely heard than words spoken in Grand Committee in the Moses Room, my noble friend will unmistakably express the sensitivity which I know she has for the understandable concerns of local government.</p>

It was of course under a different Government but memories are long.

<p><a name="08051389000062"></a>We are all experienced people who have been in local and national politics for many years. When I was the leader of the London Borough of Enfield in the 1960s, as leader of the Labour council and as chairman of housing I received a visit from two people&#151;one was Bob Mellish, the Minister for Housing, the other was Evelyn Dennington, who was chairman of the housing committee of the GLC. They set us an objective in Enfield of building 1,000 housing units&#151;an unheard of figure&#151;but this target was achieved two years after we left office. The change was in 1968 but the plans and the finance were there for completion in 1970.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000097"></a>but it is not what you do it is the way that you do it, who you do it with, who gets the credit and who picks up the bill. All these things have got to be sorted out. I have come into this Committee anxious that, at the end of the day, there should be a workable Bill. We will not agree on every aspect but, for the first time in many years, there is an attempt to get a strategy that works between central and local government. If it does not work and there is a war or a battle, no one wins.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000064"></a>The Minister and her colleagues are entitled to have ambition, incentive and inspiration, but that needs to be tempered with political reality. They need to understand that you can go only so far. We have not yet come across the nimby syndrome, but it is there about.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000065"></a>When colleagues, noble Lords on the Benches opposite and I debated the Greater London Authority Bill, we came across shocking instances of the extent to which affordable housing was being provided in some of the richest boroughs in London. The boroughs were exercising their right and took the view that, as far as they and their people were concerned, it was not their priority to build affordable houses. I hope the Minister will tell us that that is one of the priorities over the next period. There will be resistance but I hope that the record of the agency, as it grows in stature, will show to the people of an area that we are on their side and their council is not.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000066"></a>A Member of the Committee has said that if a council does not achieve what the local people desire and wrongly defines what they want, it will be thrown out. It is the same for the Government and for the authority that we are establishing. If it is seen in time&#151;the great mystery is how long we will have to demonstrate its usefulness&#151;to make sensible decisions, wield influence and have people who are respected and authorised speak on its behalf, I have great hopes for it. But I do not underestimate the damage that can be done, and no doubt will be done, in the nexus between local and central government. However, the Government are entitled to get what is set out in their pre-publicity and in the Bill, and I wish it well.</p>

I wondered when my noble friend Lord Howarth was speaking whether I had been too kind to him on his previous amendment; however, I will forgive him because he raised very important issues.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000068"></a>The noble Lord said that he wanted to make it plain in the Bill that we were very much on the side of local authorities and that we understood that everything was going to happen within the planning system. I know that he knows that it belongs within the planning system. He quoted me at some length&#151;I must have gone on for hours if that was typical&#151;and said that the Bill disregarded its context and planning powers and that, without something being expressed in it, they might be overlooked. The same goes for the nature of the partnership with local authorities.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80513-gc0008.htm"/>


<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000069"></a>I cannot agree with the noble Lord. I must build on my statements at Second Reading in regard to the spirit of partnership with local authorities in the planning system and the practicalities of what we want to achieve. There is no way that we can do any of this without partnership with local authorities and without observing the explicit and transparent rules of the planning system.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000070"></a>My noble friend spoke about housing and the challenge of meeting the housing targets. We already have a system which is responsive to what local communities need. We have planned through our existing system&#151;through the growth areas and the work of EP and much else&#151;hundreds of thousands of houses which are already in development. Our housing need and numbers are determined by the local authorities&#146; assessment. That in turn is fed through the regional strategies, the regional spatial strategies and the regional housing boards, so that everyone knows not only the current needs but also, with information from the latest ONS statistics and the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit, the future needs as well. There is no way in which the Government could impose those numbers on local authorities. They reflect the genuine nature, the demography and the aspirations of our communities. That is already a robust partnership which requires that we understand and respond to what local authorities face. That is the reality in which the HCA will work, a reality about which my noble friend Lady Ford spoke when talking of the negotiation in Basildon.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000071"></a>Nor does the Bill in any way enable the HCA to circumvent any part of the planning system. It belongs in the planning system and has to observe it. Therefore, I believe that putting into the Bill the fact that the HCA must work within the planning system is redundant because there is no way in which it will be exempt. Once we put that sort of thing into the Bill, we should answer whether we should specify all the other legal requirements to which it must adhere.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, raised the issue of designation powers in relation to eco-towns. We know that the designation powers were a very rare event indeed with English Partnerships. They were exercised  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC316"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC316</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in that instance, and they would be in other instances; for example, in the rare circumstances of a very large regeneration project which crossed local authority boundaries, where there were specific barriers and difficulties and which was very challenging in terms of regeneration. In the unlikely event that the Secretary of State designates an area and confers responsibility for preparing and maintaining all or part of the local development framework for the designated area on the HCA, there is no way in which it would work outside the planning system. It is firmly in the planning system, with all the appeals processes, with consultation and with examination in public. Planning permission will have to be applied for. There is no way in which the designation powers would be used for eco-towns but the process for eco-towns would be within the planning system.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000073"></a>More important than putting this on the face of the Bill is to ensure that the culture and the organisation of the HCA recognises the realities&#151;I know it will&#151;which are rooted in the strategic responsibility of housing authorities, in the role of regional spatial partnerships and strategies and in the knowledge that, unless partnership is true and transparent, it will simply not get off the ground in relation to any of its ambitions. We have the history and the record to prove that. For example, if you take the growth areas, we know how effective partnership working can be in delivering housing regeneration. For example, in north Northamptonshire, the local authorities of Corby, East Northants, Kettering and Wellingborough came together to form a joint planning committee. They worked together on the delivery of the core spatial strategy and the joint proposals for planning obligations. It is those sorts of partnerships that we want to cherish and encourage. That is rooted in local ambition and capacity.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000074"></a>However, the HCA lives in the real world and it has to acknowledge that the housing markets do not divide along regional lines, let alone local lines. It has to be able to make the local and regional connection&#151;that tripartite relationship which will make things coherent and manageable. It will have a more coherent regional presence; it will have a presence in government offices; it will be closer to local communities; and it will be more able to support local authorities. It will also be able to draw on the things that connect directly to communities. English Partnerships had a very fine record of being able to work with communities, particularly through the housing market renewal pathfinders. The HCA will certainly want to draw on that kind of experience and benefit from it. I do not believe that any of that can be captured, or is needed, in the Bill. That is the reality of how the HCA will work.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000075"></a>Another problem with the amendment is that there may be circumstances in which the agency does not want to work primarily or only with these groups and it would prevent it working without them. For example, if there was a specific project or task that did not interest the local authority or other agencies, the agency would not be able to work unless it could get that co-operation and there might be very good  


<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC317"></a><b>13 May 2008 : Column GC317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reasons why the local authority was not particularly interested. The amendment reduces flexibility. There is also the possibility that its wording might place the HCA under an obligation to work in partnership with every other agency already involved in work related to the pursuit of its objects, however tangential. I am appealing for flexibility and trust on the record of achievement, the well established ways of working and what the HCA will have to do in order to meet the challenge. In his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, probed further into the nature of that relationship. I have talked a bit about the role in relation to designation, and we shall have a longer debate when we come to that.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000076"></a>The agency will be the best delivery partner of local authorities. For the first time, local authorities will be able to go to one place that can: assemble land and investment; look at situations that are complex for what is possible; broker and lever arrangements, finance and investment in a way that the combination of the Housing Corporation and EP could not; bring the skills in; bring the market intelligence in; bring in all the things that enable people to have a clear picture of what is possible; and then get behind them with the resources. It will be a one-stop shop. That is a real partnership, and that is why local authorities and the Local Government Association are so positive about how the HCA will help them to provide the homes that are needed in their communities.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000077"></a>Far from being top-down, leviathan, a behemoth or any of the words that are along the lines of monster, this will be a responsive and transparent agency that will serve local government extremely well. When I look at the noble Lord&#146;s amendments that refer within the same context to different bits of the operation&#151;for example, his amendment that deals with housing targets&#151;each of them does something that will damage the flexibility of the HCA and inhibit it achieving its option. For example, if we take the target relating to housing, his amendment is damaging because there may be circumstances in which we would wish the HCA to provide housing directly or to repair and improve housing. One of those programmes is the decent homes programme, which the agency will take over. That is designed to deliver our commitment that 95 per cent of social rented stock will be made decent by the end of 2012. That is an extremely important commitment, and we have spent &#163;23 billion so far on making 1 million non-decent homes decent. That could not happen if the noble Lord&#146;s amendment were carried because it would stop the HCA acting directly. It would disable the HCA in that respect. I could go on in relation to infrastructure and regeneration because it is again very important that the HCA can act directly, but I think I have made my point. I hope that I have answered most of the questions about the implications raised by the amendment and that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw it.</p>

Given the time this evening, some of them can be put on one side because they will come out later as we go through the

To pick up the last point, my amendments are not intended to stop the HCA doing these things, but would ensure that they would be done only in exceptional circumstances and if the Secretary of State agreed. I am not talking about housing targets at all. I do not envisage&#151;perhaps this is something we can pick up later&#151;the HCA itself providing large quantities of housing and becoming a landlord. Surely, the HCA will be working either through local authorities or registered providers, as we must learn to call them in future&#151;RSLs and so forth. The last point made by the Minister was not what I intended by the amendments, which were designed to be probing. The Minister said some interesting things about the presence in the regions, but we can pick those up later on.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000079"></a>The fundamental point is the question of assurances. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, said that they had complete confidence in the Minister, the Secretary of State, Sir Bob Kerslake and everyone else involved. It may be that the Secretary of State, the Minister and Sir Bob Kerslake are all thoroughly good eggs and will agree with this, but the idea is that assurances can be given in a short-term ad hominem way and we are legislating for whoever may be in power in five or 10 years&#146; time. We need to look beyond the individuals concerned at the moment, who we may all have total faith in. Who knows who might be there in the future? Things might be different and people might have different attitudes. It is just possible&#151;I would not put it further than that&#151;that the present Government may lose the next general election and then who knows what catastrophe might descend on the country? Perhaps that will never happen&#151;who knows? Perhaps the Liberal Democrats will take over and everything will be full of roses and sunsets for ever&#151;or not; we shall see.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000080"></a>Lots of issues have been raised. The debate has been extremely useful and the Conservatives, ourselves and others may want to see a more robust amendment that does what we are looking for at a later stage, but we can discuss that later.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000081"></a><a name="80513-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80513-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051389000138"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> I shall confine myself to Amendment No. 13&#151;the one that I proposed&#151;in winding up this discussion. I am very grateful to all those who supported the sentiment of my amendment if not absolutely every word. The noble Lord, Lord Best, summed it up extremely well. Is he still here? He was hiding behind the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, so I could not see him for a moment. In one sentence he said that it would send a powerful signal to local government throughout the country if we put something like this in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80513-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051389000082"></a>In winding up, the Minister did not disappoint or indeed surprise me. She would have surprised me if she had done what I suggested and said &#147;yes&#148;. I might have had a heart attack and spared everyone a lot of further trouble if that had happened. However, she is asking for more. In a way, I was slightly sorry that she did not offer to pick up the baton and see whether she could find a form of words that achieved what everyone appeared to wish to do. We will have another shot to see if we can come up with something a little less restrictive.</p>

<p><a name="08051389000083"></a>When she argued that the agency might occasionally want to go outside what I would call the box of co-operation, it occurred to me that that might be a good thing, but there might also be good reasons why it should not, which is a very two-sided argument. We do not want to get into that at the moment.</p>

<a name="80513-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08051348000012"></a>I am today publishing a consultation document on options for revising Part G of the building regulations addressing sanitation, hot water safety and water efficiency in buildings.</p>

<a name="80513-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08051348000013"></a>This consultation follows a wide-ranging review of Part G of the building regulations and delivers on two government commitments:</p>
to introduce into the building regulations a whole-building water efficiency standard of 125 litres per person per day for new homes. We announced this water efficiency policy last July following an earlier consultation; andto review how Part G and the associated guidance address hot water safety. This follows a Statement released by my predecessor, my honourable friend for Basildon, last June on the safety of hot water systems and on the risk of scalding from hot water.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08051348000014"></a>The consultation package, which includes an impact assessment of options, seeks views on a number of changes to the regulations and supporting guidance, and invites consultees to provide us with information on other options. The main areas we are consulting on are, in summary:</p>
proposals to update and bring Part G (hygiene) and the guidance in the associated approved document into line with current standards, legislation and industry practice;the proposed inclusion of a new section on cold water services which would specify locations within the building where a supply of &#147;wholesome&#148; water is required, and which in turn makes it possible to allow the use of &#147;non-wholesome&#148; water in other locations, such as the use of captured rainwater for toilet flushing;proposals that bring into effect the Government&#146;s policy on water efficiency;

<a name="80513-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08051348000015"></a>The Government would like to support a provision that would help reduce the risk of scalding incidents from sanitary appliances, and we are aware of the support that this would have from many honourable Members and other stakeholders. However, our initial analysis of such a provision suggests that the costs of such measures are considerably out of proportion to the benefits they would deliver. Unfortunately, this means it is not currently possible for us to bring forward a definite proposal for consultation. However, as part of this consultation we are inviting more information to be provided to inform our analysis.</p>

<a name="80513-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08051348000027"></a>I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of the Ministry of Defence&#146;s spring performance report. This shows that the Armed Forces, supported by their civilian colleagues, have consistently and reliably continued to make progress towards their military strategic objectives, including a secure environment and security sector reform in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In so doing, they are also making a significant contribution towards the Government&#146;s wider conflict prevention goals, where we have made some encouraging progress.  The department is also on course to exceed the efficiency goals set in the 2004 spending review, and over the spending review period has continued to deliver against almost all of the targets for equipment acquisition, although we do not expect to have achieved the 2007-08 target for average in-year slippage in forecast in service dates.</p>

<a name="80513-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08051348000028"></a>The continuing high operational tempo means that the Armed Forces cannot simultaneously be ready for the full range of potential contingent operations provided for in planning assumptions, and we do not now expect to have met the readiness target.  And although overall activity levels have fallen, the operational tempo is also still preventing achievement of harmony guidelines in parts of the Army and the Royal Air Force.  The challenge of implementing the changes in service personnel numbers announced in the July 2004 White Paper while sustaining the high operational tempo means that we have also not made as much progress as we originally planned towards achieving manning balance across all three services, and we therefore do not now expect the Royal Navy or the Army to have achieved manning balance by April 2008.</p>

The board established that, on 12 February 2007, Hercules C130J ZH876 was on a routine operational passenger flight to conduct a roulement of troops, landing at a tactical landing zone (TLZ) in Maysaan Province, South East Iraq. As the aircraft was about to touch down, it was subjected to an improvised explosive device (IED) attack which damaged the aircraft. The captain brought the aircraft to a stop and ordered the aircraft's evacuation. All passengers and crew evacuated successfully, only slight injuries having been sustained.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08051348000035"></a>A second RAF Hercules aircraft was in the vicinity of the TLZ on another task, and offered to provide assistance. It subsequently landed to recover the crew and passengers who were due to depart on ZH876. This second aircraft sustained minor damage on landing as a result of running through some debris from ZH876. This damage was later repaired at its detachment base and the aircraft was quickly returned to service the next day.</p>

<a name="80513-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08051348000036"></a>Due to operational considerations, ZH876 was judged to be unrecoverable. Consequently, it was destroyed by coalition forces on 13 February 2007, in order to deny enemy forces any exploitation opportunities.</p>

<a name="80513-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08051348000037"></a>Following extensive investigation, the board concluded that the cause of the accident was the detonation of two arrays of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) buried along the edge of the landing strip at the TLZ. The board of inquiry commended the crew on its handling of the immediate aftermath of the explosion and the successful evacuation of the aircraft. Further, the board stated that, even if the aircraft had been fitted with explosion suppressant foam, it would not have reduced the damage sustained by the aircraft in the IED attack.</p>

The main recommendation was that TLZ search procedures must be revised prior to the

The Government's reforms under the Energy and Planning Reform Bills will also help to reinforce the clear and stable regulatory environment needed to maintain long-term investment in renewable energy in the UK. In addition, we will be consulting in the summer on further measures to enable the delivery of our renewable energy targets.</p>

At the time of purchase, it was agreed that the tenants of 1 Millbank would remain in occupation under a new sub-lease until September 2007. In fact, the tenants vacated the premises on 4 April 2007 and limited access became available in advance of formal surrender on 28 September 2007. The early surrender of the lease held in respect of 5 Little College Street did not prove possible.</p>

Under the management of the project board, intensive and intrusive surveys were undertaken within 1 Millbank to inform the development of the design work. This led to the production of the final sketch plan for the first phase of the refurbishment which was agreed by the House Committee on 5 December 2007. The Administration and Works Committee agreed the detailed design plan for the refurbishment at its meeting yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_32"></a>Further to the Written Answer by Lord Bassam of Brighton on 22 April (<I>WA 289</I>), how the value of time awarded to a car journey to a park-and-ride site on the periphery of a city and the subsequent bus journey would compare to a car journey throughout where the time taken for both journeys is the same; and whether there is a difference between work and other journeys in this respect. [HL3379]</p>

<a name="08051354000262"></a><a name="80513w0003.htm_spnew36"></a><b><a name="80513w0003.htm_spnew37"></a><a name="08051354000370"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> In valuing the time costs of two journeys of equal duration&#151;one by car all the way, and the other using park-and-ride&#151;it is recommended that a distinction be made between trips made for work and non-work purposes.</p>

<a name="80513w0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_183"></a><a name="08051354000263"></a>For non-work purposes the same equity value of time is applied to in-vehicle time for both journeys. This is &#163;5.04 per hour for commuting and &#163;4.46 per hour for other journeys. Time spent walking (when interchanging and walking to the final destination) should be valued at double these rates. Time spent waiting for the bus should be valued at two and a half times these rates. This reflects research suggesting people place a greater weight on these time savings. As a result a car journey will have a lower time cost than a park-and-ride journey of equal duration. Of course, any appraisal would need to consider all factors. Typically park-and-ride would have lower monetary costs and/or faster access times; for example, through bus priority.</p>

<a name="80513w0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_184"></a><a name="08051354000264"></a>The value of time for journeys made for work purposes should reflect the average income of relevant business travellers. In cases of staged journeys, the value of working time for the main mode should be used, where the main mode refers to the mode for the longest journey by distance. For a park-and-ride trip, that would usually mean the car driver or car passenger values of time are more appropriate than the bus passenger value.</p>

<a name="80513w0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_185"></a><a name="08051354000265"></a>In the appraisal process, changes in travel time on employer's business are valued the same whatever stage of the journey is involved; that is, there is no weighting applied to take account of the reluctance of passengers to walk to/from or wait for transport services. This is because the time spent or saved is assumed to be lost or gained in productive working time&#151;the travel activity taking up the time is therefore deemed irrelevant. A car journey for a particular group of business travellers will have the same time cost as a park-and-ride journey of equal duration.</p>
