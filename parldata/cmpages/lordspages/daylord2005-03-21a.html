<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What steps they are taking to curb the activities of companies which make unsolicited telephone calls to householders with the intention of inducing them to ring premium rate phone lines to claim non-existent prizes.

</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) has responsibility for the supervision of all premium rate services (PRS). Providers found in breach of ICSTIS&#039;s code of practice can be shut down, barred from operating and heavily fined. ICSTIS has taken action against those who have breached its code. Following a request from the DTI, Ofcom has made recommendations to further strengthen the powers of ICSTIS. These are now being implemented.
</p>

<a name="50321-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>In addition, householders are protected from such unsolicited calls through the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) scheme, which is enforced by the Information Commissioner. On a breach of ICSTIS&#039;s code, ICSTIS would act; if such unsolicited calls complied with the code, the Information Commissioner would act.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, I am sure I am not the only Member of your Lordships&#039; House <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_2"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

who has come home and found a message on the answering machine saying that I have won a car, an exotic holiday, a television or a large sum of cash and that all I need to do to claim it is to ring a premium rate telephone line. I hear what my noble friend says, but given the fact that the Trading Standards Institute says that this problem is now of epidemic proportions, does he really believe that the regulators are able to cope, because so many of these calls originate overseas and are beyond its jurisdiction? Does he believe that telephone companies should put a warning on their bills which states, &quot;If it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is&quot;?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the DTI and Ofcom are aware of the recent increase of PRS cases, which is why the DTI asked Ofcom to review the regulation of PRS. Ofcom produced its report in December 2004. Its recommendations covered increased enforcement powers for ICSTIS, increased fines for those that breach the ICSTIS code of practice, better consumer redress and better consumer information. Those recommendations have now been implemented and they will go a long way to help the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, these awful scams are carried out not only via the telephone but equally via the mail, and the numbers have grown, as we have heard, to epidemic proportions. How many successful cases have been brought under existing legislation, via ICSTIS and any other organisation with responsibility for the mail side? Do the Government expect many such cases to be brought successfully should the Gambling Bill become law?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, there have been a number of successful cases. In 2004 ICSTIS issued two fines of &#163;100,000 against companies which were found to be in breach of its code of practice concerning recorded competition phone lines. So there is a record of implementing the code. With the increased powers that should occur even more in the future.

<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the word &quot;epidemic&quot;, which two noble Lords have now used, is certainly appropriate for the sort of cause that the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, has raised? Does he also accept that we are moving into a period in which there will be an epidemic of telephone calls to voters in the next five weeks? Will he also accept that the 7 million people who have registered for the Telephone Preference Service are not expecting to be telephoned by Voter Vault, the Labour Party, or, indeed, the Liberal Democrat Party? What steps will he take to ensure that the Information Commissioner prevents that happening?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that any messages received during this period will be more accurate than those received as part of the games that we have discussed. But I agree that that is not setting a very high standard for our colleagues. The question turns on whether the Telephone Preference Service is covered. I do not know the technicalities of whether that applies to election services, but I shall find out and let the noble Lord know.
</p>

<a name="50321-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, we have had one Cross-Bench speaker and one Labour speaker, so I suggest that we have someone from the Labour Benches and then the Cross Benches.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, I have drawn my noble friend&#039;s attention to a Written Question I tabled on this on 2 March, to which I have not yet received a reply. Will he take on board the fact that the Information Commissioner&#039;s office is not user-friendly? In particular, it appears to publish no results of any monitoring, including on complaints from the public, about whether the Telephone Preference Service scheme is actually working. Is that not a failure to carry out the duty placed upon it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord told me that this question was coming. I understand that the answer will, coincidentally, be given this afternoon by my noble friend Lady Ashton of Upholland. I am told that I am not allowed to give my noble friend a sneak preview as that would go against the protocol of the House. I am afraid that he will have to wait a few more minutes for an enormously interesting answer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Neill of Bladen: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the fact that part of the technique with these telephone calls is to withhold the source? If you dial 1471 immediately after you have had such a call, you will find that the number has been withheld or is unavailable.
</p>

<a name="50321-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>I had a call from a lady on Friday who said that her name was Anastasia. I naturally refrained from asking whether she could throw light on a long-standing <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

problem. The upshot was that she offered some absurd prize. All I did was to check whether 1471 worked and there was no number. It is something that needs looking into.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I am appalled at the thought that the noble Lord is pestered by Anastasias in that way. I shall certainly see what can be done to stop this kind of situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, having received two offers of exotic holidays only this lunchtime, do the Government realise fully just what an epidemic we have on our hands? Do not the companies deserve the Grand Slam treatment that Wales gave to Ireland on Saturday?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, we realise how serious this matter is. We have already taken action in this case to make certain that further powers are given to ICSTIS to stop the epidemic, because it is extremely bad that such a cheap scam should take place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, why cannot we have a registration system for approved, premium call operators? Why cannot we prevail on BT not to pay the premium operators their share of the call costs?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, we have done it the other way round to make certain that people have the ability to stop the calls. Of course, there are many premium rate services that people greatly appreciate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="50321-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Boston of Faversham: </b>   My Lords, although it is possible successfully to stop the calls coming in if they are made in this country, can the Minister offer any help so far as calls made from overseas are concerned? It seems that it is not possible to block those calls at the moment.

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What is their response to the admission by the government of North Korea that they possess nuclear weapons and to that Government&#039;s failure to re-engage in the six-nations talks.

</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </b>  My Lords, Her Majesty&#039;s Government continue to share the deep concern of the international community about the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_5"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

development of nuclear weapons programmes by North Korea. We believe that North Korea is not justified in suspending its participation in the six-party talks. We continue to urge the North Korean regime to reconsider and, in the interest of its own people, to rejoin the talks so that a fourth round can take place soon.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister share the view expressed by Condoleezza Rice this weekend in Beijing that China will be pivotal in persuading Kim Jong-il&#039;s regime to return to the six-nation talks? Does she agree also that the threat posed to North Korea&#039;s neighbours is probably equal only to the threat posed to the rest of the world when North Korea acts as quartermaster? North Korea sold uranium hexafluoride to Pakistan that, in turn, was sold on to Libya, and, by such deeds, it endangers the security of the rest of the world by sourcing material to failed states and to terrorist organisations. Does the Minister agree that it is crucial that North Korea make the strategic choice that Condoleezza Rice called for this weekend to abandon its nuclear ambitions and return to the six-nation talks, if it is to be spared remaining as a beleaguered, dangerous and isolated pariah state?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I agree with most of that, but perhaps I may try to put it in the right context. It is obvious that China has an enormously important role to play as the host of the six-nation talks, but other nations also have their part to play. The noble Lord will know that North Korea has indicated a willingness to return to the six-party talks, but on certain conditions. Those conditions of course relate to the United States of America. I do not believe that those conditions are reasonable; I merely point out to the noble Lord that that is where the North Koreans are focused.
</p>

<a name="50321-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>As for threats, the North Koreans are indeed selling too much of the material overseas. One of the major problems with that is that an increasing part of the North Korean economy depends on those sales of nuclear material and missiles.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Cox: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that, in April 2004, Pyongyang issued at least two wartime work guidelines that covered all aspects of the conduct of a total war, and that the DPRK has since committed to a major strategic build-up, which is seriously destabilising the Korean peninsula? Would she therefore agree that there might be an urgent need for creative initiatives to engage Pyongyang in constructive regional developments that might reduce its anxieties and pre-empt its own possible intention of a pre-emptive military strike to prevent what it sees as its potential destruction?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   Yes, my Lords. Of course, that is exactly one of the issues that could be discussed were North Korea to return to the six-nation talks. Those talks were meant to cover not just the concerns of the rest of the world about North Korea&#039;s nuclear capability but the security concerns that North Korea has expressed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_6"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>It is worrying that when the North Korean Government withdrew from the six-party talks they said that they were doing so for &quot;an indefinite period&quot; and that they were taking measures,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;to bolster . . . nuclear weapons arsenal&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>and,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;to manufacture nukes for self-defence&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-02_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>against the US&#039;s &quot;hostile policy&quot;. So, it is a very difficult question. We need to re-engage with North Korea precisely to address those points.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, if, as seems all too likely, the North Koreans, who are running a horrible regime, with public executions and all sorts of other horrors, refuse to come back into the six-nation talks, and if the Chinese, despite their assurances to Condoleezza Rice, fail to use their weight to push the North Koreans, is there an alternative strategy to the effect that North Korea should be put into a kind of total economic isolation to bring it to its senses? Do the British Government support that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord was right when he spoke about the horrible nature of the North Korean regime. We discussed that in February last year in some detail.

</p>

<a name="50321-02_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>We need for the moment to concentrate on the mechanisms that have been agreed with China and the others in the six-party talks to try to get the North Koreans back into discussions. At the moment, I do not think that Her Majesty&#039;s Government will rule out any action to persuade the North Koreans that they really must come back to the talks, in the interests as much of their own people as of the peace of the region.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend recall the recent visit of two very brave North Korean women, who gave evidence to the House about the inhumane treatment of people who escape from North Korea into China? They spoke about the rigid and inflexible attitude of the Chinese Government and the enforcement of repatriation. Would the talks, if ever they take place, include references to that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, the six-party talks do not cover human rights issues. Those are being dealt with through the United Nations. My noble friend is right to refer to the visit of the defectors, and I can tell him that on 4 April two other defectors from North Korea are to pay a visit to London. My honourable friend Mr Rammell will be talking to them about their experiences. My honourable friend is also going to Geneva next week to address a meeting on North Korea together with the UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn. As I say, these issues are being addressed not through the six-party talks, but through the mechanisms of the United Nations.

<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that we should not overestimate British interests and British influence over what happens within North Korea? The most important thing is for Britain, together with her European allies, to support the six-party talks&#151;which involve those most directly affected by the deteriorating situation in North Korea&#151;but otherwise to work through the United Nations?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, but that is not because of any sense of disengagement from the six-party talks; rather it is that those who are principally concerned are the prime movers on this issue. On 11 February, one day after the suspension by the North Koreans of their participation, we issued a statement to say how much we regretted that move. Moreover, on the same day Luxembourg, as the holder of the EU Presidency, also issued a statement expressing regret at their withdrawal from the talks and urging them to return to the discussions. I think that we have a clear perspective on our role in this. It is one of strong support for the six-party talks, but we do not see ourselves as one of the prime movers. That role is taken quite rightly and properly by those who are most directly affected.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether they will hold discussions with the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia about the introduction of democratic procedures.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, we- have held discussions with the Government of Saudi Arabia about the reform process in general and the recent municipal elections in particular, including the role of women in future elections. A United Kingdom/Saudi Arabia Two Kingdoms; Facing the Challenges Ahead conference was held in London on 22 and 23 February. Last week, I visited Saudi Arabia and I agreed with His Royal Highness Prince Saud on the ways in which we would follow up that conference.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="50321-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Dykes: </b>   My Lords, I thank Her Majesty&#039;s Government for their efforts in this context. In a country where women are not allowed to drive cars, it is a bit difficult to know exactly where to start, but in view of the fact that war-torn Iraq has held elections, can they not be held elsewhere? Further, are we not proceeding logically to the reality of fully democratic national elections in Saudi Arabia? Of course these decisions belong to the Saudi Arabians themselves, but should not such elections be introduced as soon as circumstances practically allow?
</p>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

made. However, for my part I do not think that the question of driving cars is the main difficulty for women. That women cannot work on the same premises with men, that they cannot vote, and that many women feel under some constraint about how they appear in public are sources of great difficulty for them.
</p>

<a name="50321-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>No doubt the whole question of the pace of reform is one that we will continue to debate, but in order for any reform in the Middle East to be successful, it is necessary to move at the pace of the country concerned and with as much support as possible from outside. That was very much the tenor of the two-nation conference in February, when we discussed not only questions about democracy, but also questions about youth development, women and good governance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="50321-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Cox: </b>   My Lords, in the discussions on democratic procedures, were other democratic principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, such as the freedom to choose and to change your religion, also discussed, together with some aspects of the move towards symmetry? For example, was it considered whether it would ever be possible to build a church in Saudi Arabia, as Saudis are freely able to build mosques in our country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="50321-03_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, that subject was not discussed at the two-nation conference in February, although it has been discussed in the past. In February we concentrated on the ways in which we might work together with Saudi Arabia, particularly during the course of the coming year, in building up an infrastructure between us that would be of real value. For example, Saudi Arabia must face the very pressing issue of youth unemployment. We looked particularly at vocational training.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="50321-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, while I agree with the Minister about the pace of reform, does she accept that although the House of Ibn Saud has tried to make reforms it is up against the Wahabist religious establishment, which is extremely hard-line and has resisted every move, particularly on the question of a better and more proper role for women? Does she agree that the principle we should abide by in trying to assist the development of democracy in Saudi Arabia is that of <i>festina lente</i>?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="50321-03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, this is a very difficult balance to get right. Last week I made my sixth visit to Saudi Arabia. Over the course of my visits during the past six years I have been struck by how much Saudi Arabia is changing. There is a growing recognition on the part of the Saudi Government of the need for reform. A number of national forums for dialogue have been established, including on issues surrounding women and youth. Further, last October the Saudi Red Cross held its first human rights conference in Riyadh, while in March 2004 Saudi Arabia inaugurated its first human rights body. That body has 41 members, of whom 10 are women.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_9"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 9</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The balance is difficult because if one steps back too far, one cannot give sufficient support to the reformers among the Saudis and, as the noble Lord has indicated, there is some pretty formidable opposition in Saudi Arabia to the sort of reforms I have outlined. So it is a question of handling the whole issue with sensitivity and heeding what the reformers in Saudi Arabia themselves recommend about the right pace of change.

<a name="50321-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Ahmed: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that 1,400 years ago the Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon Him, worked for Khadijah, a woman entrepreneur whom he then married? Is she also aware that His daughter and other women members of His family participated fully in the life of that time? Given that democracy was established 1,400 years ago in the city of Medina, the current situation in the Middle East may have something to do with our colonial past. Is my noble friend also aware that Islam does not allow sheikhdoms and kingdoms and that any change introduced in the middle eastern Muslim world has to be slow and must fit in with the customs of the region?

<a name="50321-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is a much greater authority on Islamic history than I could ever be, and he has a deeper understanding of the Koran. However, what I will say is that today there are many women entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia, of whom several are running highly successful businesses. Many of those women would like to see some moves towards freeing up entrepreneurial life so that women can work more freely with men in the workplace and play a fuller part not only in the commercial life of the country, but also in its political life.

<a name="50321-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that certain traditions in Saudi society, such as consultation and involving the local population in decision making, are relevant to our attempt to spoon-feed the Middle East with our own notions of democracy?
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="50321-03_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I must say to the noble Earl that I object absolutely to the notion that this country is trying to spoon-feed the Middle East. During the past six or seven weeks, I have travelled very extensively all around the Middle East. Everywhere I went I said that if reform is to be embraced, it must be embraced at a pace which is suitable to the country concerned and that one size does not fit all. The position of the United Kingdom on these issues is highly appreciated in the Middle East and the approach that has been adopted by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary is well understood.

<a name="50321-03_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, NATO is the cornerstone of our collective defence. In the view of Her Majesty&#039;s Government, it is the essential forum for security consultation and co-operation between Europe and North America. NATO is adapting to the new security challenges, significantly for example in the operations undertaken in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan, and the planned training for the Iraqi security forces. But more work is needed on budgetary and structural reforms to strengthen NATO&#039;s role in strategic and political consultation and to promote co-operation among the allies.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="50321-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Blaker: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for that reply, with which I broadly agree. But has not the time come when NATO should consider more carefully what it is for and how it should operate in the future? For example, problems arise regarding whether NATO agrees with the vision of President Bush on bringing democracy to the Middle East. The noble Baroness has just spoken very eloquently about that area. Will there be consultation between all NATO members and joint decision-making, or must we accept that the pattern of the future will consist of the United States backed up by coalitions of the willing?
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="50321-03_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I hope that is not the case. A tremendous amount of discussion is going on in NATO at the moment on the future of the alliance and the way it can modernise. The alliances include Partnership for Peace, the alliances of the Mediterranean Dialogue to bring in some of the countries that are outside NATO but around the Mediterranean rim, and the Istanbul dialogue, which seeks to draw in the countries of the Gulf. On a recent visit to one of the countries of the Gulf I was asked why a particular country had been asked to join NATO but others had not. It was a misconception on the part of my interlocutor, but that gives a fairly good impression of how people view NATO. Further, individual partnership action plans operate in central Asia. The noble Lord needs to look at what dialogue is already taking place within NATO structures and to look at the challenges for the future, not the challenges of the Cold War era.

<a name="50321-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Garden: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister share the concerns that were expressed to me last week at NATO headquarters by a series of officials during briefings regarding the current state of NATO/EU relationships? Does she see any way forward in solving the problems, which are twofold: the Turkish approach to Cyprus and the Maltese approach to NATO?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="50321-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I am fairly vigilant regarding the NATO/EU relationship. This is a question to which your Lordships like returning, and it is a question, no doubt, that will arise when we next discuss the EU constitution. However, in my view, NATO is not only the cornerstone of our security but is also the only organisation that operates for collective defence in Europe. The emergence of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

EU as a force in regard to the Petersberg tasks is very much to be welcomed but it is very much a case of undertaking operations when NATO chooses not to be engaged. That is the important point.

<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="50321-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Clark of Windermere: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister accept that many of us are very heartened by her robust defence of NATO? Does she appreciate that whenever there is trouble in the world&#151;and she listed several countries in that regard&#151;the first cry is, &quot;Send in NATO&quot;? While it is important that we have the military hardware to resist any offensive action, it is equally important that we spread a climate of understanding and good will. That is precisely what NATO is doing in its partnership with more than 20 countries.

<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="50321-04_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I agree with that very strongly. The mechanisms for the partnerships in the Middle East and some of the Gulf countries are enormously important. However, in saying that it is important to remember that NATO still needs to make some real improvements in the way it takes decisions, the way it allocates its resources and in its overall efficiency. Some 323 committees operate under the NATO umbrella at the moment. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, shakes his head. I agree very strongly with that shake of the head.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="50321-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, is there not a need to extract from this tremendous amount of discussion, which the Minister says is going on, a clearer view on both sides of the Atlantic&#151;both an American and a European view&#151;on what exactly we want out of NATO, and whether it is just to be regarded as a &quot;toolbox&quot;, as some Americans describe it, or something more? Is not the right model for the future more on the lines of the Combined Joint Task Force, which seems to me a thoroughly sensible and practical arrangement between European, American and NATO forces, rather than the European security and defence policy, which is much vaguer and has vague anti-NATO tones within it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="50321-04_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I know that the noble Lord thinks that the European dimension has some anti-NATO tones to it. I have heard those anti-NATO tones; I shall not deny that they exist. However, it is our position as Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord agrees with this&#151;to defend NATO as the principal cornerstone. As I indicated, a great deal of discussion is going on, but that is structured discussion. It is not talking for its own sake. It is looking at the way that NATO can best define its role for the future. I have had the honour of substituting for my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary at a number of recent meetings and participating in those discussions myself. They are focused and they are looking at the real challenges that exist in the 21st century.

</p>

<a name="50321-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>We return to the debate&#151;the characteristics of the Lord Chancellor. This debate is essentially on one issue. Should future Lord Chancellors always, and without any possibility of an exception, be by law both lawyer and Lord?
</p>

<a name="50321-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>We have, by this Bill, transformed the role of the Lord Chancellor, created a new method of appointing judges, created a Supreme Court, and given effect to a new relationship between the judges and the Executive, with the Lord Chief Justice, and not the Lord Chancellor, becoming the head and leader of the judges in England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="50321-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>These changes are, as most people would accept, both far-reaching and overdue. The manner of their introduction should not obscure both the need for   them and the fact that they have now been the subject of the most widespread consultation, and parliamentary scrutiny and have received widespread support. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said at Second Reading:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;If it is given life, it [this Bill] will rank in importance with the great constitutional instruments of the past. We must ensure that that happens&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7/12/04; col. 759.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>In legislating for these changes, we have listened very carefully to the proposals for change made both before the Bill went through Parliament, and as the Bill went through its parliamentary stages. By far the most important part of the pre-parliamentary process was the agreeing of the concordat with the judges. They have accepted and, indeed, strongly support the new relationship between the judges and the Executive. As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice stated in his speech at The Lord Mayor&#039;s dinner for Her Majesty&#039;s Judges:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;What was previously uncertain becomes clearly defined, so both sides know what their respective rights and obligations are . . . The Concordat is universally endorsed by the judiciary as providing essential protection for the independence of the judiciary into the future&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_14"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Let us also be clear as to the Lord Chief Justice&#039;s views regarding the nature of the Minister as set out in the Concordat. He said in his evidence to the Select Committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;My firm support for the concordat reflects the fact that I see no difficulty with a Government Minister exercising any of the functions assigned to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs by the concordat. I do not consider that such a Minister requires any enhanced status or particular title to enable him or her to exercise those functions. There is benefit in that Minister being a lawyer. However, the Minister&#039;s ability to defend the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law and ensure that the courts are adequately resourced will, to an extent, depend upon his or her standing within the cabinet. This is a matter about which it is impossible to legislate, since it is in the hands of the Prime Minister of the day&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The judges also recognise fully that the new arrangements involve the leadership of the judges moving from the Lord Chancellor to the Lord Chief Justice for England and Wales. Our policy involves that shift being clear. Neither we nor the judges want two heads of the judiciary&#151;we want one, and the Bill reflects that.
</p>

<a name="50321-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Those who see the change as being no more than the acceptance of the trend that the Lord Chancellor will no longer sit as a judge, such as the noble and learned Lords, Lord Howe of Aberavon and Lord Lloyd of Berwick, have not properly understood the scale of the change which this House and another place have voted for.
</p>

<a name="50321-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>In the light of those new arrangements, it is important to identify the nature of the job that the Lord Chancellor will perform in the new arrangements. He will be the Minister in charge of a department spending in excess of &#163;3 billion on courts and legal aid. There are other things as well, but those are the two areas of biggest expenditure. Secondly, he will be the member of the executive who acts jointly either with the new Judicial Appointments Commission or the judiciary in appointing judges and in acting with them to ensure a well run justice system. Thirdly, he will be the guardian in the executive of the independence of the judiciary and, by extension, the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="50321-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Currently, the Lord Chancellor is also Speaker of this House. As this House knows, we do not think it is appropriate any longer for the Lord Chancellor to continue as Speaker. After the proceedings on the Bill are concluded, we hope that the House will find an opportunity&#151;taking into account the report of the committee chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd&#151;to debate the future of the Speakership.
</p>

<a name="50321-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The old requirement for the Lord Chancellor to be a judge sitting in the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords made it beyond doubt that the Lord Chancellor had to be a Lord and a senior lawyer. Once that practical requirement goes, the issue needs to be looked at afresh in the context of the new job. The first two requirements of the new job&#151;being a Minister and being the executive&#039;s part of the relationship with the judges&#151;probably tend in favour of someone in the other place, although not necessarily and not conclusively. There will always be scope for Cabinet Ministers beyond the Leader to sit in this House, but <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_15"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it is obvious that responsibility for large amounts of public expenditure and for delivering important services to citizens throughout the country more easily sits in the other place. Equally, to be the representative of the executive who works in partnership with the judiciary may more effectively be achieved by someone who reflects the currents within the Commons. That many of the functions must be performed in an objective, independent, non-party way does not detract from that.
</p>

<a name="50321-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The third function&#151;protecting the independence of the judges and being the guardian of the rule of law in the government&#151;is a critical role, but it needs to be properly understood. The Lord Chancellor is but part of the protection of those two important parts of our constitution. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, told the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;What protects (judicial independence) most is the tradition and the culture. I could say, and I feel quite sure we would all agree, that in over 20 years of holding judicial office none of us would ever have experienced any attempt whatever by anyone in any official position to influence any decision which any of us was about to make no matter how sensitive the case might be. The general public have no conception of the degree of fastidiousness which on the whole governments and officials show in this particular respect and sometimes go to almost unnecessary lengths to avoid anything which could even be construed as an attempt to influence the thing&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>The idea that the principle of the independence of the judiciary is not understood by those in the other place is fanciful. The idea that an ambitious politician of integrity in the Commons might not be the best person to defend the judges is wrong. Would a Tebbit, or a Merlyn-Rees, or a Whitelaw, or a Jenkins, or a Shirley Williams, or a Nigel Lawson, be inadequate champions of the judges? They would be excellent if given that job, and they could have been better than very many of the pool of lawyer Lords available at the time. I exclude from consideration, of course, all the Lord Chancellors of the time.
</p>

<a name="50321-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>You do not need to be a lawyer to know when judicial independence is being attacked. The powerful speeches made in this House attacking the undermining of the judiciary in Zimbabwe have seldom been made by the lawyers in this House. The principle of the defence of the rule of law underpins our constitution. All of us are subject to the law and equal before the law. The government of the day must obey the law, and they must not do anything that they know breaches the law. We are a parliamentary democracy; we want our laws to be made by our Parliament. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggested last week that there was a fundamental inconsistency in subscribing to the rule of law and being accountable to your constituents as a member of the other place. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;There must be a fundamental conflict between the statutory requirement of upholding the rule of law and, at the same time, the electoral requirement of doing the bidding of the majority&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15/3/05; col. 1218.]</p>

</p>

<a name="50321-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The first argument that he used for maybe having the Lord Chancellor in the other place was the responsibility for a considerable amount of public expenditure. Surely he is aware that public expenditure decisions are collective Cabinet decisions. If any one Minister has a particular responsibility it is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is always in the other place. Therefore, that argument has no merit whatever.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="50321-05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, as far as the expenditure is concerned, money is allocated to each individual Minister, and then that individual Secretary of State is responsible for the expenditure of that money., That Secretary of State will take responsibility for it, particularly if the expenditure is poor. With great respect, it is wrong to say that there is not a particular responsibility on Secretaries of State in the way that the money is spent.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I go back to the point that I was making. I quoted the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. With respect&#151;what rubbish. His view of democracy is wholly inconsistent with our constitution, and it has no basis in fact. The assumption that Members of the other place will press issues irrespective of the commitment to the rule of law is not reflected in our history. Our people want the rule of law and do not want to be ruled by lawyers. All too often, some lawyers dress up what is, in truth, a political debate as if it were a legal discussion. It is also noteworthy that those non-lawyers who have spoken in debates on this Bill have often done so in a manner that was almost apologetic for intruding on a private discussion. The rule of law is too important for its consideration to be reserved to lawyers.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, made similar attacks in debating the Prevention of Terrorism Bill. They said that had there been a Lord Chancellor of the traditional sort, the Bill would not have emerged in the form that it did. The Bill, in the form that it emerged, complied with the European Convention on Human Rights. There were legitimate issues about whether it was sufficient judicial involvement for judges to be involved before or shortly after an order was made. For the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, or the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, to suggest there was only one answer that complied with the rule of law, and that <br>&nbsp;<br>

I submit that the standard set by the European Convention on Human Rights and the standard set by the rule of law in this country are not the same thing. That is particularly true in the area of criminal law, where all our continental colleagues have inquisitorial, rather than jury, systems, and they set much lower standards about protecting the defendant than we do. I do not accept that the standards set by the European Convention on Human Rights in some areas are as high as our own rule of law standards.

<a name="50321-05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I accept that they would not always be the answer, but they are a pretty strong guide that the rule of law is not being breached.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Regarding the prevention of terrorism, the current judges rightly took the view that it was an issue that Parliament must resolve, and in respect of which they should be silent. Another example is the admission of bad character evidence. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said that our changes were &quot;contrary to the rule of law&quot;. They most certainly were not, and no one else suggested that they were. They were plainly an issue to be determined by the politicians.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to the ouster of the judicial review clauses&#151;completely failing, in the course of his account, to see the significance of the role played by the Lord Chief Justice with regard to that issue. The Lord Chief Justice held out against the clause. He made proposals about how the use of the High Court would be just as quick as a scheme that did not use it. We listened and, eventually, agreed.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Our Bill recognises the need for a new role for the Lord Chief Justice and defines what it should be. The effect of the changes already voted for by this House in the Bill has been to shift the judicial power and standing from the Lord Chancellor to the Lord Chief Justice. We should not think that a substitute for that aspect of the change is to force the Lord Chancellor into this House as a lawyer, come what may. Far from strengthening the office, it will, over time, weaken it.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>To place the Lord Chancellor in the Lords and reduce the pool from which he or she can be selected, having rightly deprived him of his judicial status, is a mistake. We should be doing all we can to entrench and strengthen the office. Allowing the holder to be from either House, allowing a strong and committed politician to hold the office, and allowing someone with a drive for change and improvement, both in the substance of our criminal law and procedure, and in the way the courts and their administration deal with cases, is a good thing and is entirely consistent with judicial independence and the rule of law. Sometimes a lawyer and a Lord will be best, but sometimes not. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_18"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

To place those constraints on the job when its holder is no longer head of the judiciary is permanently to undermine the office.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Political drive does change things. It is what has changed the way much of criminal justice is done. Justice and legal aid need both political drive and independence&#151;internally within government, to ensure that the values of our constitution are properly protected, and externally, to ensure that legitimate change occurs. Political strength should be allowed to be a factor in the decision, but it must be recognised that the independent element needs to be there as well.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The other place has listened to your Lordships&#039; concerns. It approached the views of this House in a spirit of compromise. The amendment in lieu from the other place acknowledges that experience as a Minister and a parliamentarian is desirable, as are legal skills gained through experience. It also ensures that distinguished legal academics are not excluded, and that experience of legal practice can be judged with more accuracy than a crude and arbitrary measure of years served. It allows experience to be measured by quality as well as quantity. However, it acknowledges the value of all these factors in a way that does not exclude potentially exceptional candidates for this vital office.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The other place has twice expressed its view clearly and unequivocally. It has done so after full debate, and with no dissenting voices in the government party. Indeed, in the debate last week in the other place, it was only Members of the official Opposition who dissented from the Government&#039;s compromise amendment. Even the Scottish Nationalists supported the Government. The view of the other place had the support of the Labour and Liberal Democrat Benches here. The Tories oppose as do some, but far from all, Cross-Benchers.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>This is an issue of significance. Even the Opposition&#039;s Front Bench spokesman in the other place was forced to concede in last week&#039;s debate on the Government&#039;s compromise amendment that this is an important piece of legislation, which it is desirable that we see on the statute book.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>After proper debate on these remaining issues, the views of the other place should prevail.

</p>

<a name="50321-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has made a number of remarks with which I would wish to take issue if I thought it appropriate to re-run arguments that have been run before your Lordships&#039; House on several occasions in the past months. I think, however, that your Lordships are familiar by now with the crucial ingredients of this debate, and so I can be relatively succinct.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>What we wish to do in these amendments is simply enshrine in statute what has been a constitutional convention in this country for hundreds of years&#151;that is, that the Lord Chancellor should be both a lawyer and a Member of your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Although changes have been made to the Lord Chancellor&#039;s role in the Bill, his fundamental responsibility remains the same; that is, to defend the rule of law in Cabinet against the depredations of his political colleagues. To do that, successfully, we believe that future Lord Chancellors, like past Lord Chancellors, should be both lawyers and Members of your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>They should be lawyers because, often, the threat to the rule of law is not immediately obvious in political terms. Rather, it is contained in the often arcane details of criminal evidence. Such, for example, is true about the rules of propensity, to which the noble and learned Lord referred earlier. The propensity provisions introduced two years ago by the Government are plainly a fundamental threat to the presumption of innocence, and raise the question of the rule of law&#151;a question that was never answered in Cabinet.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>In our view, there are two crucial components of the argument for retaining the Lord Chancellor in your Lordships&#039; House. The first is that, unlike in another place, there are no alternative great offices in this House to which a Lord Chancellor can aspire. Consequently, he will be a political personality yet above ambition. Secondly, he is not elected on an electoral mandate. He has no conflicting responsibilities either to his party, in the context of what it was elected to do at the previous election, or to his constituents, with regard to what they wish him to do as their local Member.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, reminded us during the previous debate, a Lord Chancellor who is both Lord and lawyer will be someone steeped in the culture of the law and the judiciary&#151;a branch of the constitution that is independent of the Executive.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>That is the kernel of the issue, is it not? Underneath the question of lawyer and Lord lies the question of the appropriate checks in our constitution on the untrammelled powers of a powerful Executive dominating another place.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>There are two checks against the legislative proposals that emerge from another place. The first is the delaying powers of your Lordships&#039; House. Your Lordships have recently had the opportunity to demonstrate how important those powers are, in relation both to the ouster clause and to the Prevention <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_20"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of Terrorism Act. Indeed, so successful have your Lordships been that one reads in the newspapers of the possibility that, in the highly unlikely event that the Government are re-elected, there could be threats to the length of delay under those powers.
</p>

<a name="50321-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The other check on the Executive is a strong, independent Lord Chancellor sitting in the Cabinet. That check is under threat in this House this afternoon. The Government have tabled an amendment in another place, which reads as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;Lord Chancellor to be qualified by experience</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;(e) other experience that the Prime Minister considers relevant&quot;.</p>

<p>

</p>

<a name="50321-05_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and many of his Liberal Democrat colleagues have said, &quot;Oh, but it&#039;s important to keep the door open for great men in another place such as Roy Jenkins&quot;. I would be the first to acknowledge that Roy Jenkins was a great man; but the provision would equally allow Mr Blunkett to become Lord Chancellor when the post next became vacant&#151;a politician who, whatever his other merits, will not go down in history as someone who defended the rule of law. One must be very careful when one names great names to recall that many other people would have been or would be highly unsuitable.

<a name="50321-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Lord&#039;s argument that every Lord Chancellor has been a pinnacle of virtue? I can name some who have certainly not attained that distinction.

<a name="50321-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I would not have advanced that argument in your Lordships&#039; House had our proposals been the law of the land; but they were not. At the time that I argued the point, two weeks ago, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor sat&#151;as he still sits&#151;in this House as Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. He is only Lord Chancellor because, owing to a slight oversight on 12 June 2003, the Government failed to realise that they could not abolish the Lord Chancellor overnight. The noble and learned Lord has made it clear that his primary responsibility is as Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. Had we had a traditional Lord Chancellor two weeks ago, I would never have advanced that argument.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I mentioned 12 June. Your Lordships will recall that that was when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, left office; and that it was also when the Prime Minister decided to abolish the office of Lord Chancellor altogether. The Prime Minister had a disagreement with the noble and learned Lord, who departed. But the Prime Minister realised that, if the conventions of the job were to be respected, the noble and learned Lord&#039;s successor was likely to conduct himself precisely like the noble and learned Lord. Therefore, the post had to go as well as the man. That is the best reason for keeping the post the same. I beg to move.

<a name="50321-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   My Lords, in due course I will move my amendment, but I believe that it will be for the convenience of the House that we address both amendments together. There will then be votes on each amendment separately, the one following immediately after the other.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>This is the fourth occasion on which we in this House have expressed our views on the future of the office of Lord Chancellor. On 13 July last year, we voted by a large majority of 240 to 208&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, does not regard that as a large majority&#151;to retain the existing office of Lord Chancellor. I emphasise &quot;office&quot;, because we did more than merely save the name &quot;Lord Chancellor&quot;, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has now properly accepted. On 7 December last year, the House confirmed what many of us thought had already been agreed&#151;that the Lord Chancellor should continue as a very senior lawyer and a Member of this House. Last week, on 15 March, we reached the same conclusion.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>One would have thought that, by now, the Government would have learnt that this was a matter on which this House felt very strongly. We are right to do so, not only because the Lord Chancellor is, one might say, part of our scene in this House, but because he has a special constitutional role to fulfil&#151;different from that of any other Minister of the Crown&#151;as protector of the rule of law and defender of the independence of the judiciary. It may be worth <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_22"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reminding ourselves that that special position is now amply confirmed in the Bill itself by Clause 1, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;This Act does not adversely affect . . . the existing constitutional principle of the rule of law, or&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>importantly&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;the Lord Chancellor&#039;s existing constitutional role in relation to that principle&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Later in the Bill, we find the new oath to be sworn by the Lord Chancellor. Clause 14(1) states that it is:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;I ... do swear that in the office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain I will respect the rule of law, defend the independence of the judiciary and discharge my duty to ensure the provision of resources&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>and so on; I need read no further. That is an oath sworn by no other Minister of the Crown. It will be sworn by the Lord Chancellor, because it is to him that it specifically relates.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>One wonders what would have been the position if the Government had not decided, as they did on that June day two years ago, to abolish peremptorily the office of Lord Chancellor&#151;a course in which they have now failed. It is difficult to believe that we should be arguing, as we are, that the Lord Chancellor should continue to be a lawyer and a Member of this House. That surely would have gone without saying.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>In his address to your Lordships this afternoon, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor referred&#151;more than once, I think&#151;to the views of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice. I remind the Lord Chancellor and other Members of the House that it was the Lord Chief Justice himself who, in this House on 7 December, said that it should be a requirement of the Bill that the Lord Chancellor be a senior lawyer. By that, I understood him to mean a requirement written into the Bill, which is what there was until the amendment in the House of Commons. That view was expressed as not only the personal view of the Lord Chief Justice; he said that he also expressed it on behalf of the Judges&#039; Council. We should pay very great heed to those views.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The Government have got a great deal of what they wanted from the Bill; indeed, they have got almost all that they wanted. They have got the possibility of creating the Supreme Court, when a building can be found. They have got the Commission for Judicial Appointments, the concordat, and much else besides. The Government are now insisting on quite unnecessary and damaging changes to the historic office of the Lord Chancellor. Yet it is suggested that the view of the other place should prevail over ours. I read the debate there, as I suspect a number of your Lordships have, and I did not find the reasons in favour of the amendment convincing. I find the new amendments-in-lieu read by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, completely vacuous. They mean nothing whatever, and would apply to every appointment made by the Prime Minister. They have nothing to do with the particular appointment about which we are concerned.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>In many cases, it would be right for this House to defer to the views of the other place, and to give them great weight as being the views of the elected Chamber. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_23"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 23</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

That point was strongly made during the passage of the counter-terrorism Bill. Members argued that Members of the House of Commons would have to answer for an explosion taking place in their constituency. They were clearly right to take that point. However, one wonders to what extent Members of the other place are currently troubled in their constituencies by whether the Lord Chancellor should be a Member of the House of Lords. It cannot be high on the agenda of things they worry about.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>By contrast, the future of the office of Lord Chancellor is peculiarly a matter within the province of this House. The fact is that the Lord Chancellor plays an important role here, as we all saw during the passage of counter-terrorism Bill. He is, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, has often told us, our &quot;second voice&quot; in the Cabinet&#151;I hope we may hear from him later in the course of this debate. The Lord Chancellor is that, but he is much more, too. It is his constitutional role, standing back from the political fray, which concerns me. To quote the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cooke of Thorndon, it is his role as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;an illustrious and universally respected lawyer who was able to speak with authority for all that the law represents&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>We all know that, for our constitution to work effectively, it depends on subtle checks and balances. One such check is the presence of a very senior Lord Chancellor in the Cabinet. Again,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;he was a kind of guarantor or watchdog of legality at the heart of the constitution&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 11/10/04; col. 38.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>We would do well to keep him there, and that is why I hope we will vote once more against the Commons amendments. I hope more fervently that we may not have to do so again.

<a name="50321-06_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, imagine drawing up a job description for the new office of Lord Chancellor. What skills are needed? First, the competence to run an important government department, with a budget of some &#163;3 billion per year, 25,000 staff, and the obligation for running the courts system in the whole of England and Wales. Secondly, the toughness to fight for the department in the annual battle with the Treasury to ensure that the DCA gets the funding that is needed for legal aid, for the courts system and for access to justice. Thirdly, the ability to work with the Commission for Judicial Appointments and with the Lord Chief Justice on the residual duties of the Lord Chancellor in judicial selection and discipline. Finally, the ability to act as the constitutional watchdog in the Cabinet.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Imagine then drawing up a shortlist of candidates for this job. What sort of person do you need? Legal qualifications are certainly an advantage, but not a necessity&#151;not even for the role of constitutional watchdog, where what is needed is not a detailed knowledge of the law, but a nose for what is constitutionally acceptable. Legal qualifications are less important than political skills, energy, independence and strength of character. These are not <br>&nbsp;<br>

necessarily features of someone at the end of their career. Sometimes someone who comes from outside the narrow ranks of the legal profession may see the big issues more clearly, and may see the wood rather than the trees, where professionals cannot. After all, we have an Attorney General as the Government&#039;s legal adviser, and the Lord Chief Justice to speak for the judiciary of England and Wales. We have no need for the Lord Chancellor to duplicate those roles.
</p>

<a name="50321-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>When drawing up the shortlist, what about membership of your Lordships&#039; House? In this context, membership of this House seems to be a matter of total irrelevance. Two restrictions, the need to be both a lawyer and also a Lord, will greatly reduce the pool of suitable candidates. What they will not do is ensure that we get a good person to do the job. I cannot say too often that any Prime Minister who wants a compliant and complacent Lord Chancellor will find one, with or without legal qualifications or membership of your Lordships&#039; House. To take a possible scenario, admittedly a highly implausible one, let us assume that a future Prime Minister wishes to repeal the Human Rights Act. That is surely a proposal that would set a proper watchdog not only barking but howling. Yet I believe that any such future Prime Minister would have no difficulty whatever in finding a Lord Chancellor with legal qualifications and membership of your Lordships&#039; House who, as a watchdog, would not utter even a growl. These restrictions cannot prevent the Prime Minister from making a bad appointment, but they can prevent him from making a good one. The effect of these restrictions is to ensure that today&#039;s job will be done by yesterday&#039;s man.

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>On the management of a budget of over &#163;3 billion a year, I have had a little experience&#151;it was a long time ago&#151;in the amount of public expenditure that would go to particular departments. The management of that money was left, as my noble and learned friend said, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_25"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 25</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the hands of the departmental Secretary of State&#151;although I tried to prevent them from spending too much on most occasions.
</p>

<a name="50321-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Speaking as an accountant, if I had to choose someone to manage &#163;3 billion or more, I would not necessarily choose an accountant because not all of them are good managers of funds. But if there was anyone I certainly would not appoint, it would be a lawyer&#151;with great respect, even to my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. That would not be my first choice. My first choice would be someone who I thought could manage a budget of &#163;3 billion or more. However, under these amendments, which the Official Opposition and some Cross-Benchers appear to want, that apparently would not be the case. The hands of any Prime Minister would be tied if the job had to be filled by a lawyer&#151;a senior lawyer, it has been said&#151;and a Member of your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="50321-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>My noble and learned friend has pointed out that substantial changes, which have generally been accepted, have been made to the Bill regarding the role of the Lord Chancellor. In those circumstances, I am bound to say that the person appointed should have suitable ability in managing those sorts of funds. That is my first point.
</p>

<a name="50321-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>My second point concerns the question of opposing the other place. On 15 March, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;We need as many checks as we can get against an over-weaning Executive&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15/3/05; col. 1241.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I very much agree with that. I am not sure that all noble and learned Lords or any other noble Lords opposite always agreed with it, but personally I agree. We must retain the right to ask the other place to think again. But how often should we, the unelected House, ask the elected House to think again? That serious question will be presented to your Lordships both now and in the future when we discuss the future powers of this House. I fear that, if we press ahead with this kind of amendment, it could result in bad decisions being taken about the powers of your Lordships&#039; House. I am concerned to ensure that the powers of your Lordships&#039; House are continued, certainly with regard to asking another place to think again, but I ask noble Lords also to think again about how often they ask the other place to do that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="50321-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   My Lords, subject to interruptions, I can assure your Lordships that I shall not detain the House for more than three minutes. I also assure noble Lords that I shall not repeat any of the observations that I made on the previous occasion.
</p>

<a name="50321-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>In a lecture entitled &quot;The Office of Lord Chancellor&quot; given a year after he retired, Lord Hailsham, who had wide parliamentary experience in both Houses, stressed how vital it was to protect the independence of the judiciary. He then said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;But surely, it will be asked, everyone supports judicial independence&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_26"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 26</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>He went on to say: &quot;Oh, do they?&quot;. He continued by reflecting on the House of Commons:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;Certainly not . . . the back-benchers in the House of Commons, who constantly revile, frequently from inconsistent standpoints, individual judges or particular decisions, or what they imagine to be judicial qualities, and daily demand that individual judges be directed or rebuked (presumably by the Executive Government) to move in this direction or that or even that they should be removed from office&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I suggest to your Lordships that that situation has in no way changed; if anything, it has got worse. The present Home Secretary and his predecessor made it quite clear that lawyers were their <i>b&#234;te noir</i>. It is clear that the present Home Secretary and his predecessor do not understand the basic fundamentals of the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="50321-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I suggest to your Lordships that it would be quite wrong for the Lord Chancellor, with his obligations&#151;I leave aside running the law courts and providing the court services&#151;to have to carry out his functions, particularly defending the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, in the hostile environment that I have just described.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="50321-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Morgan: </b>   My Lords, I want briefly to support, as I did last week, what the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has said, and I hope that your Lordships&#039; House will not insist on its amendments. It was quite different in the case of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill. Then, a very large majority against the Bill was drawn from all our Benches, including myself, and I think that it was appropriate to challenge the House of Commons on that. Last week, the Bill was passed by a majority of about 14, drawn almost entirely from the Conservatives, and I do not think that it would give the right impression to challenge them.
</p>

<a name="50321-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>The belief is that the Lord Chancellor considers the rule of law. The opposition Benches appear to believe that the rule of law can be understood and articulated only by a lawyer&#151;someone who has a professional background. I think that that is profoundly mistaken. The rule of law is a function of citizenship; it is not confined to a particular innate group of professionals.
</p>

<a name="50321-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Furthermore, the assumption seems to be that the person appointed should be an elderly lawyer&#151;someone who is near the end of his career. In other words, we are saying that it should be part of the law and custom of the constitution that the Lord Chancellor is an old man. I do not think that that is an appropriate view. It follows that, as there are very few lawyers in the House of Commons&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="50321-07_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, would the noble Lord say that 12 years in practice as a lawyer makes one an old man?
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="50321-07_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Morgan: </b>   My Lords, I am not familiar with what I am sure is the noble Lord&#039;s extremely distinguished legal background, but it has been said repeatedly in this debate that the Lord Chancellor should be someone at the end of his career. That is the point that I was addressing, and I think appropriately so.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_27"></a>

</p>

<a name="50321-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Further, it has been said that, because there are very few lawyers in the House of Commons&#151;there are virtually none on the Labour Benches&#151;the Lord Chancellor must be a Member of the House of Lords. In any case, this afternoon and last week many suggested that the House of Commons is rather a disorderly and partisan place and that the quality of debate in this House is far superior, which frequently it is. I do not see why the Lord Chancellor has to be a lawyer. It is a matter not of professional expertise but of judgment&#151;a matter of understanding and of our awareness not as lawyers but as citizens. I hope that the idea of citizenship is increasingly taking hold.
</p>

<a name="50321-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Last week, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, made a remark with which I very much agreed. He observed that the Lord Chancellor should be a lawyer by instinct. I go with that. I think that that is a very good way of putting it. But being a lawyer by instinct is not the same as being a lawyer by background, and I would draw a distinction between the two.


</p>

<a name="50321-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>I also think that, while there should be the widest choice, in many ways it would be highly appropriate to have the Lord Chancellor in the House of Commons, particularly&#151;as I said last week; I will not repeat myself&#151;in the light of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill. The judicial review in cases involving the actions of the Executive in relation to alleged terrorists should be considered in front of the elected representatives of the people rather than anything more enclosed.
<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="50321-07_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50321-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>It is extraordinarily patronising to say that people in the House of Commons are unable to produce appropriate representatives&#151;or people as appropriate as us&#151;in dealing with these matters. It is also erroneous to say that they are liable to confuse parliamentary sovereignty with the rule of law. As a historian I take my stand on the distant past: the Act of Settlement 1701 enshrined both what was then called parliamentary supremacy and an independent judiciary. It was perfectly possible to combine the two concepts and to see the House of Commons as the main body concerned with them both. I am happy to take my stand on 1701 rather than on some of the arguments that we have had this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="50321-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>I do not think that one should make broad assumptions about the qualities of people in either House of Parliament. The Lord Chancellor deals with constitutional principles, with intellectual, ideological and philosophical issues, and there is no reason why such a person should not be in the House of Commons. Indeed, such a person should be in the House of Commons; he should face the elected Members and be ensconced in what a famous little Welsh attorney called,

<a name="50321-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </b>   My Lords, I had not intended to intervene yet again on this topic, but I feel compelled to do so, driven logically by a phrase used <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_28"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 28</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, when he said that we should be careful to allow the Commons to have the casting voice on such an amendment.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>I have been thinking about what kind of amendment this is. If one looks at it in the context of the Bill as a whole, the Bill contains a substantial number of measures that have been long debated and on which there has been a large amount of agreement across the professions and across the body politic.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The establishment of a Supreme Court is a well argued case that we have examined carefully. Some of us still do not accept the necessity for it, but it is a respectable proposition. The appointment of a Judicial Appointments Commission likewise has the same quality. Those are the Bill&#039;s core measures.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>But what about this kind of amendment? Where is the intellectual analysis and careful thought that has led to the emergence of this proposition? It emerged like a flash of lightening as a result of some still undisclosed controversy in No. 10 Downing Street on 11 June two years ago. If anyone until that moment had suggested that the nation&#039;s stability and the progress of the new Labour revolution, or anything else, had depended on the sweeping away of the office of the Lord Chancellor, the world would have been astonished.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>So indeed was everyone when that puff of decision making emerged on our political stage. Everyone in the Lord Chancellor&#039;s Department was amazed and aghast. Ever since, it has fallen to the hapless but increasingly unhapless and confident noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to defend what looked at the time indefensible. He has not made a bad job of it, but it is a case for which the burden of proof rested fairly and squarely on those who had to justify the eccentricity and unexpectedness of the Prime Minister&#039;s original decision.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Everything else can be sensibly presented, but here is a provision that we seek arguments to justify. We find ourselves living in a world in which, until the moment before the announcement was made, the Government were defending robustly and confidently in this country to every committee of both Houses and to the Council of Europe the legitimacy, the importance and the crucial nature of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s unique office.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>We have come a long way since then; semi-respectable arguments have been advanced, but I have yet to see any argument that says that by making this change and throwing aside a historic office that has been of great importance in government after government we are getting any improvement. Attempts have been made. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, used it as an excuse to launch a modest attack on my profession, saying that lawyers are not particularly well qualified to manage money.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Neither are accountants, farmers, engine drivers, doctors or trade union leaders, but people from all those groups have been appointed Ministers of the Crown and for better or for worse we have struggled to do the job as well as we can, often with the benefit <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_29"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of surveyance from someone as robust and fierce as the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. We have all had to make our best of that job.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>The argument advanced on that narrow front is that this is a huge department with a budget of &#163;3.5 billion per year; it cannot possibly be managed by anyone from this House and it is ridiculous to impose it on this House. But no one uttered a squeak when the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, was appointed in this House as Minister in charge of the Department for International Development, which has a budget of &#163;3.5 billion-plus. No one said that that was a constitutional affront, so there is no substance in that case.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>We are driven back to counsels of despair, saying that on a good day it is possible to identify some remarkably outstanding political leaders, like Roy Jenkins, who is the case always cited&#151;no doubt there are others, even my noble friend Lord Lawson on a good day&#151;who might have been well qualified for the job. That case was made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, rather in the way in which one drafts an advertisement for the <i>Guardian</i> public sector pages: with all the strange preoccupations and qualifications necessary for the job, and one can make a respectable job of doing it.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>However, none of this amounts to the beginning of a case for making a decision, in order to legitimise the will of an eccentric Prime Minister, to sweep away an office that has served us well with a senior lawyer and Member of this House in the job. If one looks back at all the documentation produced since that decision was initially taken, one finds almost everyone&#151;and the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee&#151;saying that ideally the job is a job for a senior legal figure towards the end of his career.

</p>

<a name="50321-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The case for changing that has simply not been made. If this House is not entitled to stand on the proposition that it is for the Government to produce the evidence to justify the legitimisation of a Prime Ministerial whim, then this House is of no value. It is this House&#039;s function to resist such whimsical eccentricity and such constitutional vandalism.

<a name="50321-08_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Viscount and, in gratitude, I shall be very brief. My point relates to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, which was, with respect, in error. He referred to the powers of this House. The acknowledged function of this House, ever since Bryce, is to be, and to remain, the sole guardian of the constitution, as there is no constitutional court. As constituted today, that remains our acknowledged function. It is wholly distinct from the function of the other place.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>When the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor repeats, &quot;We defer to the other place. They are the elected Chamber. They have the sovereign right&quot;, he is quite right, but we have this cardinal, vital, constitutional duty to discharge. We are asked to discharge it today by delaying the enactment of Clauses 2 and 3 in the interests of the nation, because the case has not been made out. The nation is about to go to an election and it is substantially divided. It would be quite wrong for this House, if so advised, to stand by and do nothing.
</p>

<a name="50321-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, I thought that the Lord Chancellor&#039;s constitutional role in Cabinet&#151;the other linchpin to which my noble friend referred&#151;had been preserved in Clause 1. This clause reads in conflict with Clause 1. Removing the status, authority and position of the Lord Chancellor, so that he cannot discharge his functions, is another way of going back to square one and doing what the Prime Minister always intended to do, that is, in effect, to slight the office of Lord Chancellor and all its functions in so far as he could. This is a constitutional problem of vast importance that lies within the legitimate remit of this House. I shall vote to try to retain the position, pending the election.

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 31</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Lord Chancellor being a Member of this House and a lawyer has nothing to do with finding a nice little job for decayed lawyers in the fullness of their time. The point is that the role of Lord Chancellor should be set apart from other roles in government by the fact that he is at the pinnacle of his political career. Being a member of this House and a lawyer, he is not looking for promotion up the slippery slope to become Prime Minister or to hold one of the other high offices of state. He has reached his pinnacle and therefore can give his advice with freedom, without thinking that something might put up the backs of some of his colleagues and prevent him getting promotion at the next reshuffle.

<a name="50321-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Viscount. The person he has in mind would, no doubt, make a marvellous Lord Chancellor, but what compels the Prime Minister to appoint him?

</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="50321-09_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, nothing compels the Prime Minister to appoint any individual. People keep on saying that &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; might have made a wonderful Lord Chancellor, even though he was not a lawyer. We are seeking to ensure that the general run of Lord Chancellors is better than it otherwise might have been. It does not seem to be a surprising proposition to say that a man is more likely to stand up for the necessary principles if he has no hope of further promotion than if he is busily trying to ascend the slippery slope of politics. For that reason, I suggest that this issue remains as important as it was on the other occasions on which we have voted on it.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>That is surely demonstrated by the incredible impotence and irrelevance of the amendment offered to us in lieu. It merely states that the Lord Chancellor ought to be somebody who,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;appears to the Prime Minister to be qualified by experience&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>That is experience of any kind whatever. That gives us nothing. I would also have thought that&#151;in accordance with all the principles that the Government are always enunciating about legislation&#151;this is a remarkable principle to put on the face of a Bill. Saying that the Lord Chancellor, uniquely, must be somebody whom the Prime Minister thinks is qualified by experience is saying that all other Ministers can be people who he does not think are at all qualified by experience. Some of us think that point can be made against certain Ministers from either party. I would hope that before the Prime Minister makes appointments to ministerial office he would, on the whole, ask himself whether a person is qualified to do the job. To write this on the face of the Bill is not only totally impotent and irrelevant, but is also very dangerous.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I urge noble Lords to maintain the position they took in the previous votes. As noble Lords have said, this Government have almost everything they want in the Bill. They have provisions for a Supreme Court and the concordat. They are not going to lose them. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I can draw a comparison with him.

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>I am deeply hesitant about the Bill. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said that this is a significant issue that will transform the role of the Lord Chancellor. So it is. But my noble and learned friend Lord Howe of Aberavon pointed out that various parts of the Bill, such as the Supreme Court and the appointment of judges, were justifiably considered, and we lost over them. That was very generous him.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I find it quite alarming that there will be a new Supreme Court, at a cost of &#163;50 million, and that the Members of the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords will be transferred to it so that they will no longer be Members of this House and able to advise your Lordships. It was interesting that today, and on previous occasions, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor quoted the words of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice. How could he quote those words? It was because the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice has the right to be here and speak. In future, of course, he will not be here. Those are pretty staggering changes.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Now the noble and learned Lord wants to do away with, if not the office of Lord Chancellor, then its role as we know it. In so doing, he will oblige your Lordships to have a Speaker. These are very significant changes. It is all very fine for the noble and learned Lord to say that the House of Commons has considered them and that we ought to agree to them, but I take great exception to these fundamental constitutional changes.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>By this Bill, the noble and learned Lord has savaged the role of the Lord Chancellor; he has savaged the House of Lords by denying the attendance of the Law Lords in your Lordships&#039; House; and he is forcing on your Lordships&#039; House the office of a Speaker&#151;as yet untried, and largely unwelcome.

<a name="50321-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The noble and learned Lord is very competent and agreeable, and he is also a thunderingly fine advocate. But the trouble with being a very good advocate is that people do not necessarily know when the cause you are justifying is good or bad. The noble and learned Lord has the ability to put a very bad case very well.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I can only offer this bit of advice, which I may already have given to your Lordships, but as it would be impertinent&#151;indeed arrogant&#151;to think that your Lordships would remember anything that I have ever said before, I am happy to repeat it. I am referring to what the late Lord Fisher of Canterbury said, which was that there was no unreasonable argument that could not be proved reasonable by reason.

<a name="50321-09_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, I have not taken part in such debates for some time, but I feel that I ought to say something at this juncture in view of the fact that, thankfully, I have had some experience of the office.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>It is fundamental in dealing with these matters in this House that we should have respect for the views of the other place, which should be reciprocated. I was a little stunned that it was said that this House was guilty of concerted amnesia, or something of that sort. I remember very well the changes that have been made to the role of the Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>I always find the views of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, extremely interesting&#151;and, usually, influential. He said that he would not wish to give the management of a budget of &#163;3 billion to a lawyer. For the past eight years or so, our country has been managed by someone whose qualifications are that of a lawyer. He had other qualifications as well, of course.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I shall deal first with the question of whether it is desirable for the Lord Chancellor to be a lawyer&#151;in other words, whether it is a proper part of his qualifications. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has made much of the fact that there are qualified people who are bad and qualified people who are good. That is not a reason for dispensing with qualifications.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>One of the important roles of the Lord Chancellor in our Cabinet government is to see that legal advice is taken when necessary. He is not the government&#039;s legal adviser. That is plain, and a good Lord Chancellor respects that. Apart from anything else, if any difficulties arise, he does not have to shoulder the responsibility. He is responsible for legal advice being taken when required, so that the government do not land themselves in difficulties. You need to be a lawyer, otherwise, unless you are superhuman, you cannot detect whether legal advice is required. It is often obvious, but sometimes it is not. For very good constitutional reasons, the Attorney General is not a member of the Cabinet.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Discussions can produce a requirement for legal advice, which is one of the most important functions of the Lord Chancellor. It is a subsidiary to his general responsibility for maintaining the rule of law to see that the government take legal advice when necessary to ensure that their actions are lawful.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>A good example of what can happen when that position is not obtained was shown on 12 July 2003.

<a name="50321-09_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, June 2002.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="50321-09_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, it must be old age creeping in. It was June 2002.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I do not know the inner secrets of these matters, but the then Lord Chancellor was leaving office and something was to be done. Those in responsible positions in the Government thought that the office of the Lord Chancellor could be abolished overnight by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_34"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Prime Ministerial fiat. People recognise that I had a role in those matters in the past, and many people who are neither politicians nor particularly interested in politics, have wondered how that could happen. How could it come about that the head of the Executive of this country should have been so mistaken? It shows how vital it is to have at the centre of government and part of the Cabinet someone who is responsible to see that the Cabinet do not make fools of themselves by seeking to take action that is manifestly absurd in law.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>I hope that that does not happen often, but it is a pretty prominent illustration of when it did happen. To include a reference to &quot;legal expertise&quot; would be a wise insertion in the clause. I wonder what other relevant experience there could be. It is essential for a Lord Chancellor properly to give effect to his responsibilities in relation to the rule of law. I do not mean only in general terms, which anyone with sufficient judgment and quality could do. A number of such qualities have been mentioned today, and I would not wish to challenge them. But when it comes to advising in detail on the legal issues, the Lord Chancellor needs to have a legal background.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>How old he should be is a matter of judgment. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, was considerably younger than me when he took office, and the present Lord Chancellor is even younger. I am not absolutely certain about that, but I have that feeling. He certainly has all the vitality of youth.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>With regard to being a Member of this House, I think that there is an advantage in being somewhat detached from the central assize of our nation&#039;s politics. To be at the centre is a difficult place for a Lord Chancellor to carry out his functions. I have no experience of being in the other place, but I have listened to the arguments of those who were there at the time. I have a feeling, which I put to your Lordships for what it is worth, that it will be easier and more likely for the Lord Chancellor effectively to exercise his office in protecting the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law if he is away from the white heat of political debate in the slightly less political atmosphere of this House. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said that this House is changing. I have no doubt that that is so, but there is still a difference. Anyone who studies the two Houses will agree that there is a difference between and that difference is quite important.
</p>

<a name="50321-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I am glad to see that the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale, has returned to her place, which reminds me that lawyers are not necessarily founts of wisdom. They make mistakes. I can say the same of elected people. Election is not a guarantee of infallibility; neither does nomination, which applies to most noble Lords, come with a certificate of infallibility. Sometimes the experience of those who have been properly nominated in this House may be valuable in a constitutional matter, which this undoubtedly is.

<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="50321-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </b>   My Lords, after the speech of the noble and learned Lord, I can be even briefer than I intended to be. As usual, as this is such a funny place, I am hopelessly ill-prepared. Some of your Lordships might have thought I would take advantage of the very first proposal to put into constitutional law the special place of teachers of law in universities. I can assure your Lordships that I am not beguiled by that formula into putting aside everything else. I bow to the wisdom of my noble friend Lord Morgan about 1701&#151;that is not a debating point&#151;but I am more concerned with where we shall be in 2007.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I do not agree&#151;if this is what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, meant&#151;that working people do not have a feeling for what we grandly talk about as the rule of law. I think there is a feeling in what Sir Ivor Jennings used to call &quot;the man from Hoxton&quot;, which comes very close to it. I shall be corrected by <i>Hansard</i> if I am wrong, but I did not hear the phrase &quot;rule of law&quot; in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, today. He spoke of the European convention, but they are not necessarily exactly the same. That has been mentioned to your Lordships before.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>We have to simplify what we are looking for. Surely, we are looking not merely for someone who can manage millions of pounds. I have no experience of that, but if I had to do it as a Minister I would expect to be advised by people in the Cabinet&#151;the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is one of the best Chancellors of the Exchequer there has been in recent and probably not so recent times. The Prime Minister would no doubt have a word with me and the Whips would have my interests at heart if I tended to stray. I shall return to that remark. It is extraordinary that someone should say&#151;I honestly do not remember who it was&#151;that we want someone of suitable ability. I would have thought that any debating and wise Chamber would know that that was, a priori, a requirement.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>A special kind of ability is required. Everyone agrees that not everyone could be Lord Chancellor and intervene when he should on the rule of law. I believe that I am a democratic socialist because I have understood some elements of the rule of law; otherwise, I would quite likely be a very autocratic socialist indeed&#151;they exist, as the world knows to its pain.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Surely, the Lord Chancellor, call him what you will, needs, in the realities of 2006, two things to intervene in defence of the rule of law, quite apart from suitable intelligence, which I take, again, to be common ground. First, he needs spine to stand up to people against whom it is very difficult to argue a case when they know, by the word from on high, what is to be done. He needs exceptional understanding of his own need for courage. He will not be disturbed by the House of Commons.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I hear people say that the House of Commons is always criticising the judges. No one has criticised the judges on their law more than I have. I am always <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_36"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 36</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

criticising judges; that was how I acquired my chair. It is absurd to put that forward as though it were a difficulty. However, he needs spine. The people with whom he has to contend are not so much the majority of voters and electors in the constituencies, but he has to stand up to the party machine which will support those on high.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>He also needs to be able to intervene at the right moment. He needs to spot the point, if possible before anyone else. That point was effectively made by the noble and learned Lord who has just spoken. For that, one probably needs a lawyer of experience. I am not saying that others cannot spot such points, but that needs to be done quickly. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, with his experience, may be able to spot points, although I usually find I am unable to agree with accountants. That was the cause of the trouble that kept everyone up all night: people had not spotted the problems quickly enough.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Such a person requires spine plus speed. We need someone who will not be broken by conventional wisdom even from his own party Whips. He does not need to be very old but he needs to be slightly out of the political maelstrom.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Those are my reasons, although I freely admit that constitutionally my preference is to see Ministers in the House of Commons, which is the democratically elected House, whatever system of election the Liberal Democrats will one day impose on us. It is vital to have someone like that in the Cabinet.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>Those are my grounds for not wishing to agree with the amendments proposed by my comrades in the democratic House, but putting aside all those reasons, I would never, ever vote for a constitutional provision such as that contained in paragraph (e), on which I believe my noble and learned friend on the Front Bench said nothing. It reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;other experience that the Prime Minister considers relevant&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>It is only in the interests of propriety that I do not suggest all kinds of improper experience that might legally and lawfully be taken into account. That is a preposterous constitutional provision. Therefore, sadly&#151;I am sad because we must have a compromise on this&#151;I shall not vote for these provisions tonight.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="50321-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   My Lords, perhaps in one minute I can draw one matter to your Lordships&#039; attention, and particularly to the attention of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. Clause 2 of the European Union Bill, at present going through the House of Commons, deals with parliamentary approval for treaty changes, and subsection (4) thereof gives the House of Commons the duty to ask this House what its opinion is and reserves absolutely to the House of Commons alone the right to agree or not to agree to the treaty provisions.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>That is part of a sequence of changes affecting this House, of which the present amendment is one, and which goes back to before 1999, in which government after government have sought to sap the powers of Parliament and now they are concentrating on this House. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_37"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 37</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

what is needed in the Lord Chancellor is something that I believe is needed now: a nose for what is constitutionally unacceptable. This is constitutionally unacceptable. I support my noble friend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="50321-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, we have had a good debate. The critical three points are as follows. In this House we have agreed to a fundamental change in the role of the Lord Chancellor: that he is no longer the head of the judiciary. Unlike in the past, he no longer sits in the Cabinet as the person who is actively head of the judiciary appointing all the judges and disciplining those judges who require disciplining. We should recognise that this represents a fundamental change&#151;one that we, as a House, agreed to. Yet we also agree that we want the Lord Chancellor to be as strong as possible in the Government in the future, so that he discharges his ministerial functions properly and effectively, and is an effective defender of the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>In order to achieve that, I earnestly ask Members of this House to consider whether restricting the pool from which the Lord Chancellor can be chosen, and restricting him or her to this House, makes him or her a stronger or weaker voice in the Cabinet for the rule of law and independence of the judiciary. Of course, it will depend upon the individual chosen. We have all heard about the personal characteristics that may be required for that. To say that the job must always be done from the Lords and always by a lawyer, however, when that Lord and lawyer is no longer the head of the judiciary will, looking forward, inevitably undermine and weaken that great office. We all need the office to be as strong as possible from the point of view of the constitution.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>There is much to be said for the detachment that comes from being in this House. Yes, this House is a bit more detached than the other place. I would respectfully suggest to noble Lords, however, that there are Members of the other place who have spine, who are not lawyers and who understand what is meant by the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. The rule of law is a fundament of our constitution. The idea that only somebody with an arcane understanding of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said&#151;could understand whether the rule of law was being infringed is, with the greatest of respect, wrong.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>We must look at this as an important constitutional issue. We must look forward to determine whether placing the Lord Chancellor forever in the Lords, making him or her forever a lawyer&#151;because no exceptions are permitted&#151;will strengthen or weaken the importance of the role. I put it to you that it would weaken it.
</p>

<a name="50321-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, says that we have to make out the case. That is absolutely right. The noble and learned Lord is, however, completely wrong to ignore the other changes that have been made in the constitutional reform settlement that this Bill represents. In those <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_38"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 38</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

circumstances, I suggest that noble Lords consider what the effects of those changes already agreed have been to this great office.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="50321-10_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </b>   My Lords, there is an important point that neither the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor nor anyone else has commented on. Will the pension arrangements for the new Lord Chancellor be the same as they are at present? I understand they are generous and can be taken whether he retires or is sacked.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50321-11.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="50321-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, made clear, it was not just the title that remained. It was also the comfortable arrangements for pension and pay. As far as that is concerned, despite these generous arrangements&#151;which are made in order to make the resignation of the Lord Chancellor on principle an easier matter&#151;no Lord Chancellor has resigned on principle in recent times, as I said on the last occasion. Perhaps, therefore, their effect is neutral in that respect.
</p>

<a name="50321-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>My basic point is to consider the effect of the fundamental changes that have been made. We all agree that we want to strengthen the office as much as possible. The other issue is the extent to which we pay regard to what the other place has said. This Bill has been going through Parliament for 13 months. It was referred to in the Queen&#039;s Speech in 2003. It was a significant part of the Government&#039;s programme for 2003. We have given it detailed scrutiny and consideration. Of course our power is to make the other place think again. They have thought again. They have debated it on two separate occasions. It is a significant issue. It is not for us to determine those issues where we are the more powerful of the two Houses. Our job is to make the other place think again. Once we are satisfied that they have done so, then we should pay proper regard to their views.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="50321-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I shall be extremely brief. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, questioned whether it would be proper to send the Bill back. I say to the noble Lord: yes, it would be.
</p>

<a name="50321-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>First, this is a constitutional Bill. Secondly, it originated in your Lordships&#039; House, not the other place. Thirdly, as a number of your Lordships have said, the vast majority of the Bill is agreed. Huge changes are going to be made to the judicial arm of the constitution. This is, indeed, the biggest change to that branch since the Act of Settlement 1701. It has been brought about by&#151;if I may say so to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor&#151;an impressive process of successive iteration, compromise thinking, rethinking and reformulation. It is a remarkable Bill. We are only talking about one small ingredient, taking up no more than three lines though very important to constitutional fundamentals.
</p>

<a name="50321-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, questioned whether it was necessary to have a grasp of the detail of legal issues to defend the rule of law. The answer was very effectively given by the noble and learned Lord, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_39"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 39</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Mackay of Clashfern. The vast majority of rule of law issues between ourselves and the Government Benches&#151;when I say &quot;ourselves&quot;, I mean not only Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition, but also, usually, in harmony with the Liberal Democrats&#151;have concerned extremely detailed matters of criminal evidence. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor sought to lampoon me in saying that I wanted to define the rule of law as simply the interstices of the law of criminal evidence. That, with great respect, was uncharacteristically unfair of the noble and learned Lord. One cannot protect the rule of law without having a good grasp of the detail.
</p>

<a name="50321-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The office of Lord Chancellor, lawyer and Lord, has been with us for over 1,000 years. Every generation has tested those qualities and found them desirable. What is so special about this generation? We have not had the answer to that, and that is why I intend to test the opinion of the House.

<a name="50321-13_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Identity Cards Bill</h3>
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="50321-13_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="50321-13_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. Our identities are precious and need to be protected. The Identity Cards Bill establishes a clear legislative framework for an identity cards scheme that will enable everyone aged 16 and over and resident in the United Kingdom to hold a biometric identity card, linked to a national identity register.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Clause 1 establishes clear statutory purposes for the scheme so that there is no possibility of confusion as to what it is for. Clause 1(3)(a) makes it clear that the purpose of the identity cards scheme is, first, to provide people with a convenient method of proving their identity. That is exactly why most people want identity cards.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Current means of identification are simply not secure or reliable enough. This was pointed out clearly in <i>Identity Fraud: A Study</i>, published by the Cabinet Office in 2002. However good the security printing of existing documents is, there is always a risk that they can be forged. Existing documents cannot link an individual to a single, unique identity, whereas a biometric identity card scheme will allow each and every one of us to prove conclusively that we are who we say we are whenever we need to prove our identity. Anyone who has teenage children will know the importance to them of being able to prove their age. A biometric identity card will do that quickly and easily.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Photographic identity documents are increasingly required in a wide range of circumstances; for example, by low-cost airlines, even for domestic flights. That creates problems for people, often elderly people, who do not have a current passport or photo-card driving licence. Identity cards will fill the gap.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>We cannot stand still in the knowledge of the threats that we all face from identity fraud. Not only does it cost the country an estimated &#163;1.3 billion per year, but it creates real concerns for those of us at risk and real problems for the victims of fraudsters. Not surprisingly, sales of shredders have increased dramatically in recent years, as people have realised the importance of shredding personal and financial documents. A recent report published in <i>Which? </i>showed that a quarter of those questioned knew <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_47"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 47</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

someone who had had their identity taken and misused or had experienced that personally. It is no wonder that the same survey showed that more than two-thirds of us were concerned about identity fraud.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>As a guard against financial fraud, reliable proof of identity is rightly needed before a bank or building society account can be opened or a large financial transaction made. By removing the need to rely on existing documents such as passports or insecure documents such as utility bills, biometric identity cards will provide the answer.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>In accordance with standards laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, our own biometric British passports with a facial image biometric will be introduced in about a year&#039;s time. These will become a requirement for international travel. For example, the United States has already made clear that countries which do not provide their citizens with biometric passports will be excluded from its visa waiver scheme. Thus if the United Kingdom were not to introduce its own biometric passports, British citizens visiting the United States would first have to obtain a visa.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="50321-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. Is there any intention to achieve reciprocity in this respect? Do the British Government intend to make similar demands of American citizens?
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="50321-13_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the British Government have not come to a view on that, but it is important to acknowledge what the position is in relation to the international community. It is not only the Americans who have taken this view. Noble Lords will know that our other European partners are also looking at biometric data in relation to passports. We may soon face a situation where the main way in which identity will be verified will be by using biometric data. That is the reality, irrespective of what our American colleagues across the water choose to do.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>It is important to recognise that if the United Kingdom does not introduce its own biometric passports, British citizens travelling not only to the United States, but also elsewhere, may in due course find themselves in more difficulty than is necessary.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Much of the cost of introducing identity cards will need to be incurred in any case to keep our passports up to acceptable international standards. This will include the plans we have already announced for the introduction of personal interviews for all first-time passport applicants. It really does make good sense for us now to build on the existing plans for biometric passports to provide our own biometric identity card scheme. This is a sensible addition.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Some 80 per cent of adults already hold a passport. On our current plans this would allow for the issue of the first identity cards in 2008 by a new agency incorporating the United Kingdom Passport Service and working closely with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_48"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The Bill defines biometric information at Clause 43 as being data about external characteristics. These include facial biometrics, fingerprints and iris images.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="50321-13_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend give way? Does she know why DNA has been excluded?
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="50321-13_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, DNA has been excluded because it is clear that if DNA material were to be included, it would go beyond simply making this a means of identification.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I know that we are about to have a long and interesting debate, but I should very much like to open it so that we could then have that debate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="50321-13_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ludford: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is making a connection between the international requirement for biometric identifiers on passports and the ID cards that the Government wish to introduce. However, can she confirm that the ICAO standard for passports is just a digitised photograph? It does not include fingerprints or any other biometric identifiers. I think that that point needs to be made clear if the ID card is purported to be based on international passport requirements.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="50321-13_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, of course the ICAO digitised photograph requirement is one thing, but the noble Baroness will know that three methods are currently under consideration. The first is the iris image, the second relates to facial recognition and the third is fingerprints. By fashioning our scheme so that it can respond to those three different types of identification, we are better preparing ourselves for the future.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>My noble friend is right to point out that DNA is not being used. As I said, there has been much debate and concerns have been expressed about the inappropriate use of such data and whether they are truly to be used simply as a means of identification only. We think that by restricting the data to facial biometrics, fingerprints and iris images, we will draw a line that makes it crystal clear that this is for identification and no other purpose.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Biometrics are a new concept and some have asked us the obvious question: will it work? I can reassure noble Lords that the National Physical Laboratory carried out a study in 2003 and published a report which concluded that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;In principle, fingerprint or iris recognition can provide the identification performance required for unique identification over the entire UK adult population&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Not only that, but the United Kingdom Passport Service has also carried out a trial of biometric enrolment of a sample of some 10,000 individuals to test the practicalities of enrolling biometrics. This has included using a mobile enrolment unit that could travel to rural areas as well as to offshore islands.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>In addition, we are looking very carefully at the real and practical difficulties that might be faced by some groups of individuals, for example the elderly, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_49"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

housebound and those with special needs because of illness or disability. I cannot give detailed answers today on how we will deal with every one of those groups when the identity card scheme is introduced. However, I can say that officials in the identity cards programme are in contact with representatives of special interest groups, for example the Royal National Institute for the Blind, and I give a commitment that we will look sensitively at all genuine reasons for special treatment in the process of obtaining an identity card. We have recently undertaken research among race, faith, disabled and other groups to identify the special needs of particular groups in the design of the scheme. This includes people with hearing difficulties, with impaired sight and with arthritis. We will be publishing the research later this month.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>The legislation allows for this and Clause 41(4) makes clear that any regulations made under the Bill can make different provision for different cases, and can provide for exemptions and exceptions.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>The identity cards scheme is being introduced not only as a convenient way for individuals to prove their identity, it is also necessary in the wider public interest. This is the second arm of the statutory purposes as set out in Clause 1(3)(b) and (4). The public interest is defined in five ways, and I think it would be helpful if I deal with each of them in turn.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>First, we have national security. Identity cards on their own will not stop the risk of terrorism. However, we have been advised that they will help. We have also been advised that more than one third of terrorist suspects are known to have used false identities. We should be clear that identity cards will not somehow prevent suicide bombers, but they will disrupt the activities of those who aid and abet terrorism by hiding behind multiple and false identities. By making it harder or impossible to assume a false identity, or to use multiple identities, it will be much more difficult for terrorists to ply their trade, and there is no doubt that the introduction of identity cards will help the police and security services in their work.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The second part of the public interest definition is the prevention or detection of crime. I can reassure your Lordships that the police will have no new powers to demand proof of identity or to require people to produce an identity card in the street as a result of this Bill. It will be possible for the police to seek information from the national identity register to check an individual&#039;s identity with or without that individual&#039;s consent, provided that it can be justified for the prevention or detection of crime.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>In the case of biometric information, Clause 23 means that the police will have first to check their own records before seeking the provision of information from the register about a suspect&#039;s photograph or fingerprints, and Parliament will also be able to agree specific rules as provided for in Clause 23 on how information will be provided to the police or other organisations. These will include provisions such as the level in the organisation at which the request must be approved.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_50"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-13_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>We have also protected the most sensitive area of the register&#151;the records of how the card or database entry has been checked previously (paragraph 9 of Schedule 1). This information can be provided only for purposes connected with the prevention and detection of serious crime or for the existing statutory purposes of the intelligence and security agencies.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The third part of the public interest definition is the enforcement of immigration controls. Most people will be entered on the register when they apply for a designated document. Clauses 4 and 10 provide for this. It is intended to designate British passports issued to United Kingdom residents. Once designated, anyone over the age of 16 applying for a British passport will be entered on the national identity register and will be issued also with an identity card. The passport and identity card will be issued as a package and it will no longer be an option to obtain a passport on its own once it has been designated.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>In the case of foreign residents, the intention is to designate the residence documents issued to foreign nationals and for these to double as an identity card. What this means is that, once designated, anyone applying for these documents and legally resident in the United Kingdom will have had their identity verified to the highest standard and will have been issued with a biometric ID card. This will act as a major deterrent to illegal immigration as eventually everyone resident here legally will have a biometric ID card which will confirm their identity as well as their right to reside here and, if they are only a temporary resident, such as a foreign student, any limits on their stay.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The fourth part of the public interest definition is the enforcement of prohibitions on illegal working. One of the key pull factors for illegal immigrants is our healthy employment market, combined with the fact that even the most reputable of employers can find it is too easy to be hoodwinked by forged papers.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>We are stepping up our enforcement activity against illegal working. During 2004 the Immigration Service carried out 1,618 operations against illegal working. In the future, the possession of an identity card which confirms an individual&#039;s right to work in the United Kingdom will make it much easier for the vast majority of legitimate employers to ensure that they comply with the law. It will also make prosecution of unscrupulous employers simpler.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The final public interest is to secure the efficient and effective provision of public services. Clauses 15 to 17 allow Parliament to approve regulations for public services to require an identity card to be produced before an individual accesses a particular service. This is not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; provision. Parliament will have to approve individual regulations for individual services and there are obligations on the Government to consult about any proposals. However, the principle is surely right that when seeking access to a public service such as free health treatment, or applying for the payment of state benefits, an individual should be asked to produce an identity card that confirms his or her identity as a first step in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_51"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 51</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proving entitlement to the service. Of course, as we have always made clear, this will not interfere with the delivery of emergency healthcare or other services. As I have already explained, we expect that most people will obtain their ID card when they apply for a British passport or a foreign national&#039;s residence permit.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>However, the Government have been clear that the identity cards scheme which is being introduced is designed to become compulsory. We therefore need to have the debate on the principle of compulsion now. The provisions on compulsion are in Clauses 6, 7 and 9 and are about the timing of compulsion and the precise categories of people who will be required to register. It would be possible to phase in this requirement for different categories at different times and to exempt certain groups, such as, perhaps, the very elderly. The Government must publish their reasons for compulsion, they must allow both Houses of Parliament to comment on their proposition for compulsion and must take account of these comments before laying an order before both Houses. Under this so-called super-affirmative procedure both Houses must then agree to the order setting a date for compulsion.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The means of enforcing the compulsion to register are via civil financial penalties. It will not be a criminal offence to fail to register when the scheme is compulsory because we do not see the need to burden the police and the criminal courts with enforcing the scheme. We will use civil means. Clauses 34 and 35 set out the procedure for objecting to or appealing against any civil penalty that may be imposed.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>I express my gratitude to the Joint Committee on Human Rights for its contribution to the debate on the Government&#039;s proposals, and welcome both its letter to my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and its subsequent report.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>As my right honourable friend said in his reply of 8 February to the committee, which was published in its report, the Government are confident that the identity card proposals are compatible with their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The fact is that 21 of the 25 EU member states already have an identity card scheme. Apart from the United Kingdom and Ireland only Latvia and Denmark do not currently have ID cards and Latvia has already announced plans to introduce them next year (2006) and Denmark already has a Central Person Register which contains identity and address details with a unique number to identify every resident.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The committee took the view that it is not the compulsory issue of ID cards which raises convention issues, but the storage and disclosure of information on the register. The Government believe that the limitations which have been placed on the information which may be held on the register and the safeguards which regulate the information which may be disclosed from the register ensure that the interference with Article 8 is proportionate.

</p>

<a name="50321-13_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I can confirm to the House that a delegated powers memorandum on the Bill was submitted to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on 7 March of this year.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The Identity Cards Bill is a piece of enabling legislation and so it cannot be expected to include all the detailed administrative procedures for the card scheme on the face of the Bill. Although there are a large number of delegated powers&#151;some 60 in all&#151;many of the separate powers relate to the same issue, for example the application process for an ID card and the format of the card itself. Many of the precise administrative details will depend on the continuing work of designing the scheme and will need to be finalised much nearer the launch of the identity cards scheme which is currently planned for 2008. These details will also, rightly, be subject to change and amendment after the identity cards scheme is launched so as to take account of future developments.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The Government will, of course, look very carefully at the views of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on the Bill, when its report is published.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>We intend that the first biometric identity cards should be issued in 2008 and there will be further opportunities between now and then for your Lordships to look at the detailed provisions to be set out in secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The simple fact is that the possession of a clear, unequivocal and unique form of identity&#151;in the shape of a card linked to a database holding biometrics&#151;will offer clear benefits to us all. That is why 80 per cent of the public in recent surveys say that they support the introduction of ID cards.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I shall, of course, listen with great interest to the points that noble Lords have to make both on the Bill itself but also on the practical implementation of the identity cards scheme&#151;something which we have become very accustomed to hearing from the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. However, the Government are convinced that the introduction of identity cards is in the interests of the nation.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, will confirm her party&#039;s unequivocal support for the principle of identity cards&#151;which I understand is the clearly expressed view of the leader of Her Majesty&#039;s Loyal Opposition in another place.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>The current debate on identity cards began over three years ago, and we have proceeded in a measured way through consultation on the principles and, most recently, on draft legislation. We have no intention of wavering, and the Government are now determined to press ahead with the introduction of identity cards starting, on current plans, in 2008. The Bill sets out a clear legal framework for the scheme.
</p>

<a name="50321-13_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Identity cards will provide a means for everyone legally resident in this country to assert their right to be here and to help them gain access to the services to which they are justly entitled.

<a name="50321-14_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I hope that the House will excuse me if I first say how very much I am looking forward to hearing the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>I can give the Minister and the House my unequivocal support, and that of my party, for proper parliamentary scrutiny of Bills that bear within them matters of constitutional importance. We have always acknowledged that the Home Secretary inherited a difficult job from Mr Blunkett&#151;a torrent of Home Office legislation and headlining Bills that the Government must have known they would never have time to take through both Houses if they set their minds on an early election this spring. The question therefore must be&#151;why have the Government set their own Identity Cards Bill up to fail? The answer lies in Mr Blunkett. He gave the game away in interviews earlier this month when he made it clear that the Government&#039;s plan is to try to blame us on these Benches for their failure to give parliamentary time to the Bill. My Lords, that will not wash.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The Select Committee on the Constitution pointed out in its fifth report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;The constitutional significance of the Bill is that it adjusts the fundamental relationship between the individual and the State&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>Such an important Bill deserves proper consideration in this House. Like the Minister, I give my commitment that I will listen most carefully and constructively to all the points that are put on all sides of the argument.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>In the debates in another place, we set out five reasonable tests to determine whether the Bill is a proportionate and effective response to the Government&#039;s perceived need for ID cards. The Government failed to pass those five tests. They now have the opportunity to use the Committee stage in this House to persuade us that those five tests can be met. We will listen, but we know that so far the Government have failed properly to address the concerns that have come from all sides, including from those who would support the introduction of ID cards soon.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The Bill highlights the need for the Government to maintain a balance between the interests of the citizen and the role of the state. Of course it is the duty of the state to protect the lives of its citizens, but the duty to protect life must be balanced by the duty to protect our way of life. As I made clear in the debate on the Loyal Address, before 9/11 I would not have countenanced ID cards. After that, I accept that we must at least consider them. We should examine carefully any measures that might enhance the nation&#039;s security, while maintaining a proper degree of proportionality. ID cards, introduced properly and effectively, might help to do just that, so the Bill deserves detailed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_54"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 54</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consideration. Despite the best efforts of my honourable and right honourable friends in another place, they were left in the position of having to skim through some 20 clauses&#151;about half of the Bill&#151;in the last Committee session, on matters that could not then be addressed on Report. We need to be allowed time to do better.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>The noble Baroness has reminded us today that ID cards already exist to some extent in practice, as passports and driving licences, and for asylum seekers as application and registration cards. It is worth considering the introduction of a framework that encompasses them all, but it is vital that the framework should be more than a mere enabling Bill, which is the fundamental flaw of the Bill. The Minister said today that we cannot expect more, but I agree with the Constitution Committee which said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;The common thread in our suggestions is that Parliament should not leave a scheme of such significance and complexity to the Secretary of State alone to develop, bring into operation and maintain&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>In recent years, it has become both legally and technically possible to pass around government large quantities of data about British citizens. We know that. Those data, plus the national identity register, are of more importance as a threat to privacy than the card itself. The Minister made clear today that the card will play little effect in the system; we ourselves become the identity card. The debates in another place made that abundantly clear. An important part of the Bill must be to put statutory control on the use and deployment of existing data, yet time and again the Government have so far refused to improve the Bill to make it clear just how the system could operate fairly and effectively.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>The Minister has referred to some of those issues today. The first is the matter of an upper and lower age limit. Clause 2 states that people over the age of 16 would be coerced into registering. As the Minister says, this is still a work in progress as far as the Government are concerned. Clause 2 gives an enabling power to extend or reduce that age range. In Committee in another place, the Minister, Mr Browne, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;No decisions have yet been made . . . We will work out the specifics of the issue appropriately in future&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee B, 18/1/05; col. 82.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>On another basic issue, of which addresses we will all be required to register, the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;Much more work is required on the processes for issuing ID cards before we will be able to draft the regulations&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee B, 18/1/05; col. 73.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>The Bill requires us to register all our previous addresses for a period that has not yet been defined; it could be for the whole of our lives. Yet, the Minister in another place, Mr Browne, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;For most people who have lived at the same address for a reasonable period, the current address is all that will be needed&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee B, 18/1/05; col. 73.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>However, that is not what the Bill says. How will the Government discriminate between people, and between different groups of people, to determine who <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_55"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

has to give more details? And for how long&#151;for 10 years or for life? How will they decide what each of us has to do? The Government have simply tried to make the Bill too broad-brush. It is a framework, but by no means a clear one.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I turn now to the five tests that we have consistently put before the Government and required them to meet before they can reasonably expect Parliament to give consent for an enabling Bill of such constitutional importance. The first is clarity of purpose. The Government must not only make clear the specific purposes for which an ID card is required, but in particular they must make it clear which of those purposes are priorities; otherwise it will be difficult to assess them. Where no individual purpose is specified, it must be made clear that an ID card is not a requirement. One of the main objections to the 1940s wartime ID card was mission creep. At the beginning, the card had three distinct purposes; it ended up with 39.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>In the debate leading up to the Bill and during the consultation process, the Government claimed that a national ID card is needed to allow access to benefits and services; to provide proof of age; for voter registration; crime reduction and immigration purposes; to tackle terrorism, money laundering, people trafficking and ID fraud; and to provide access to public services. It is important to know which of those is a priority, since different services and purposes demand different types of card and registration.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The second test is technology and its capabilities. The Minister has updated us a little on that today. The system must be robust from start to finish; from the card to the biometric reader through the communication system and into the central computer, database and software. It must be impossible for a virus to enter the system; if it did so it would cause mayhem. It could create and conceal multiple identities, thus corrupting the system&#039;s core purpose. So far, the Government have said that such matters are work in progress. The Minister has said so today, to a certain extent, but has begun to take us forward.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The fact is that biometric technology is fallible. Fingerprints and iris scans cannot always be easily taken, and technology can be fooled. It is vital to the progress of this project that the public and authorities should be clear about the technology&#039;s weaknesses as well as its strengths. We would need to examine in Committee the Government&#039;s assessment of the current state of technology and its likely future progress on these issues. In particular, after the Minister&#039;s speech today, we will need to examine the research to which she referred, which we are told will be published next month.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The third test is the question of whether the Government can run the system. We know that this would be the most ambitious technology project the country has ever seen. We also know that this Government have a less than perfect record in overseeing large-scale projects. That is not a party pre-position. I do not envy them in running some of the major technology projects modern society seems to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_56"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 56</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expect. However, the most recent examples of failure include those of the Child Support Agency computer and the national fingerprint identification system. Both of those look like modest projects compared with the proposal to set up a national identity register of the complexity that is within the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The fourth test we considered was the cost-effectiveness of the scheme. The Minister has sought to reassure us today by saying that we will have to deal with some of those costs anyway, because of the difference in the way passports will be issued in future. We need to look at all the issues involved in costing. The introduction of the Bill saw the cost of the ID card scheme almost double overnight, from &#163;3 billion to &#163;5.5 billion. Conventional wisdom now puts the overall cost somewhere between &#163;10 billion and &#163;20 billion, by the time one takes into account all the costs associated with a national identity register and the need to have machine readers available to police, hospitals and others who may be required to check identity and create an audit trail of our lives. We will need to examine in Committee how the Government intend to control the cost, and whether the money would be better spent on trying to stop illegal immigration, terrorism and benefit fraud by other means.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The final issue is that of civil liberties. We must examine the real concerns about these. The scheme proposed in the Bill will involve the establishment of the national identity register, the use of the latest technology and the gathering of information on millions of people. That register will be the hub that allows the collation of, and access to, vast amounts of data on individuals from many government databases. Parliament must oversee the nature of the data used on the cards, and must control who has access to them.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>In an ideal world, of course, we would not need ID cards, but we recognise that it is right to examine now whether they have become necessary. It is also right, however, that we ensure that any proposals are carefully scrutinised so we can achieve the aims of the Bill at minimum cost, and with the minimum incursion on people&#039;s liberties.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>As the debate progressed in another place, it became increasingly apparent that many more organisations than we had at first thought will have access to this new database. That means that the scope for unauthorised access could be unmanageable. There is even the possibility that the data must be shared with other countries&#151;a topical example would be Ireland&#151;because of the common travel area.
</p>

<a name="50321-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Echoing the view of the Constitution Committee, Liberty&#039;s briefing states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;The bill is of constitutional importance and will permanently alter the relationship between the individual and the state&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I do not say that no national identification scheme could ever theoretically be justified. I do say, however, that any project with huge financial and constitutional implications needs to be justified clearly as a proportionate and effective response to social need. So far, the Government have not justified the method they have adopted in this skeletal enabling Bill. We will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_57"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

need to hold them to account in the remaining stages of the Bill, and I will do so in a constructive and open manner. If the Government are serious about the Bill, they will give this House that opportunity.

<a name="50321-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, I add my thanks to the Minister for introducing this Bill in your Lordships&#039; House. I also ask her to convey our thanks to the Minister of State, Des Browne, for briefing colleagues earlier in the day.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>We do not have the five tests demanded by the Opposition. To me, they are as irrelevant as those introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with regard to monetary union. It is a shame that we will not have time on our side to tease out many of the issues raised by the Minister. The reasons are simple. We are in an almost unreal situation. On the one hand, there is anticipation of a general election, and on the other, Bills are being pushed through your Lordships&#039; House that are unlikely to end up on the statute book for some time to come.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>I do not believe that scrutiny and revision, which require the Committee and Report stages of the Identity Cards Bill, will be reached&#151;so why this haste? The Government, of course, have their own reasons, which have nothing to do with the Bill being enacted. I suspect this may be another matter on the Government&#039;s agenda of &quot;tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Whatever the reasons, it is right that I should set out my party&#039;s position on this Bill. We do not believe that ID cards will work with regard to tackling terrorism&#151;although that is what David Blunkett told us in the first instance&#151;nor that they will help to tackle benefit or health fraud. It would be helpful to have some recent data to establish the Government&#039;s case on these points.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>ID cards have serious cost implications. The system is flawed, and has civil liberty implications, as pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I shall start with some of the possible assumptions made by the Government in the consultative document on <i>Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud</i>. We are told that a card scheme could be a powerful weapon in combating illegal immigration. If that is the case, why do we not sort out the chaotic immigration procedure that lets in illegal immigrants? If we had proper, managed migration, with a system of admission of those economic migrants whose services we require, and a proper method of dealing with those who are genuinely being persecuted and are seeking refuge, ID cards would become less relevant.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>ID cards cannot be forced upon people who enter this country. They are designed for those who are lawfully resident here. How ID cards could stop illegal entrants baffles the imagination. We have said we would support a system of immigration based on the United Kingdom&#039;s needs. We will support a system designed to help refugees and deal effectively with those who enter the country unlawfully. ID cards would do no such thing. To set up this aspect of policy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_58"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as an end to all illegal immigration is just not true. It will not work. It may placate tabloid newspapers, but its impact would be negligible.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>It is obvious that ID cards are unlikely to be introduced in Britain straight away. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Patricia Hewitt, has acknowledged that the process will take many years. If that is the case, why is it necessary to bring the Bill forward at the fag-end of this parliamentary term? It does not give us time to consider the framework carefully.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>According to the Government, we will not have to carry ID cards. If that is the case, how will they be effective against terrorism? Even if they were made compulsory, would they stop terrorism? Of course we acknowledge the serious threat of terrorism, but in the majority of cases that have been identified, terrorists have not used false or multiple identities. Past evidence in the UK, the United States and other countries demonstrates that terrorists are capable of carrying out atrocities without changing their identities.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>ID cards are of little relevance to those who are hell-bent on destroying themselves. We may know someone&#039;s identity, but that does not tell us what they are about to do. There is the classic case of Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber. Even if he had had an identity card, would it have given a clue about what he was going to do? Those who wish to destroy themselves do not care whether they have an identity document or not. That pattern is well established among suicide bombers.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The Government&#039;s argument is seriously flawed if they think that this is the way to stop terrorists or their activities. I do not dispute that an identity card would provide people who were lawfully resident in the UK with a means of confirming their identity to a high degree of assurance. The problem is that it stops neither terrorism nor illegal immigration. No country has found a foolproof system, and Great Britain is no exception.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The Government&#039;s other objective is to help people to gain entitlement to products and services provided by both public and private sectors, particularly those who may find it difficult to do so at present. We do not dispute that. There is benefit and health fraud, but I fail to see what that has to do with identity. A vast amount of health and benefit fraud that occurs in the United Kingdom would not stop through the availability of identity cards. Is it not the case that only 5 per cent of it involves individuals pretending to be someone whom they are not?
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The cost implication of the introduction of ID cards is still a mystery. How much would it cost? What technology have we in mind? This is a major national investment that requires intense scrutiny. It has to be evaluated on the basis of other cards and identity documents that many people possess. I acknowledge that we are simply discussing the framework at this stage, but surely the Government have in mind the ultimate cost implication. I was delighted that Des Browne actually gave some figures in the briefing note that he supplied, but they are still not complete <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_59"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

because of the large number of reading machines that will be required in all sorts of places, for which the cost would be considerable.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Last week, I met representatives of LaserCards, which I understand provides the green card technology to the US Government. In essence, three types of card have been identified. The first type securely stores information on the card itself that can be read offline. The second type requires a central database to be accessed, which is the system often used by banks. The third type is a hybrid of both systems. Will there have to be reading equipment in every post office, benefit office, hospital and doctor&#039;s practice? Who will operate the system? Who will be responsible for protection of readable data? Does the Data Protection Act apply? What guarantees are there that data will not be accessed for other purposes?
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The Government have not had much luck with computerised services established in the area of criminal justice. We will need a lot of convincing that a foolproof system that will not break down is available. Even before the questions have been answered, we have a unique situation in Wales. Under devolved powers, the National Assembly for Wales can take its own decision whether to have ID cards in relation to health provision. It says that it will not ask for ID cards, so we have an example of the first unilateral declaration of independence coming from the Labour heartland.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Let me now come to the regulatory impact assessment. There is serious concern about complex procedures, and then there are cultural problems. We have seen the impact of stop and search on our black and minority-ethnic communities. I appreciate the Minister&#039;s concern on the matter and her assurances, but she has not satisfied me that police will not ultimately have access to the relevant information if they suspect that a crime has been committed. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has produced research evidence from Europe that suggests that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;black and ethnic minority . . . nationals could be disproportionately targeted on the basis of race for identity checks by police, immigration officials or other public service officials&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Then there is the risk of conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights and other international convention law.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The other issue identified by the regulatory impact assessment is that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;only certain groups will be asked for proof of identity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>I suspect that, like the anti-terrorist legislation that caused so many problems for the Government, the provision is likely to be considered disproportionate in its use, discriminatory on foreign nationals, and adversarial in its impact on black and ethnic minority people here.

</p>

<a name="50321-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>We are certainly entitled to know the cost implication of a fully operational ID card system. So far, it is difficult because the figures keep changing. Would the Government make public the Office of Government Commerce&#039;s Gateway review documents? There cannot <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_60"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be any commercial confidentiality about them. Should we not be entitled to information that is given to commercial companies? We want to know the true cost of a system when fully operational and the financial contribution of each citizen in the UK, together with the cost of a biometric readable passport that we are obliged to produce. It is then that we can argue about what alternatives to ID cards are available to us, such as more police, more intelligence officers and more spending on secure borders. There are better ways of spending that money.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The other point that I wish to address concerns the database, on which the Home Affairs Committee commented. It identified two issues&#151;whether the Government have the capacity to run a system of ID cards, given their awful record on IT systems; and the implications for civil liberties, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. My noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury is upset that he is unable to participate in the debate, as he is speaking on the Charities Bill. He is chair of the advisory panel established by Liberty to assist with a major project on privacy and identity. That report will be available when the Bill comes to the House again before long, as I suspect that it will.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>We have reached a stage where successive legislation has eroded the delicate relationship between the individual and the state, as rightly pointed out in a number of government reports. That is also a conclusion reached by the Select Committee on the Constitution. There is so much information available on citizens of this country&#151;their shopping habits, the products they buy, and their financial standing&#151;which is a by-product of the credit card system. Then there is the passport, a document that sets out your citizenship and the rights that go with it. There is an insatiable appetite on the part of the Government to continue to obtain more information under the guise of tackling fraud, terrorism and illegal immigration.
</p>

<a name="50321-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>This morning, I read the report of the London School of Economics on the identity project. It is an assessment of the Bill and its implications, and it concluded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;All identity systems carry consequential dangers as well as potential benefits. Depending on the models used, identity systems may create a range of new and unforeseen problems. These include the failure of systems, unforeseen financial costs, increased security threats and unacceptable imposition on citizens. The success of a national identity system depends on a sensitive, cautious and co-operative approach involving all key stakeholder groups including an independent and rolling risk of assessment and a regular review of management practices. We are not confident that these conditions have been satisfied in the development of the Identity Cards Bill. The risk of failure in the current proposals is therefore magnified to the point where the scheme should be regarded as a potential danger to the public interest and to the legal rights of individuals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>There must be a time when we should call a halt. That time is now. If the purpose of this Second Reading is simply to identify for political parties those who are against this legislation, let it be so. In the coming weeks we shall continue to proclaim that we are against the Bill. I now look forward to listening to the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="50321-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Ballyedmond: </b>   My Lords, I confess that I feel like a blushing maiden this evening, on the occasion of my first speech to your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Identity cards are not new to society. They have been in use for a very long time in many countries which we consider to be normal, democratic societies. With the evolution of democracy, free society now has the conundrum of how to balance the rights and freedoms to be enjoyed by the individuals on the one hand with the collective benefits of those who comprise the state on the other. There are those who will say we are at war with terrorists and criminals. Whatever the position, we must be prepared to render impotent any attack on our democratic way of life.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>We were able to fight and win past wars with the intelligent use of might and manpower. This alone is no longer a viable means to counter the modus operandi of the subverters, which has experienced a paradigm shift, or the increased influence of political and religious fanaticism, where fear of death is removed. The suicidal protagonist believes himself glorified by his sacrifice. Organised crime, likewise, has at its service today&#039;s most sophisticated technology and the means of ready communication and movement. The political focus in modern-day Europe has shifted to the rights of the individual to such an extent that those rights in many cases must be accommodated by an unwilling state. This is evidenced by the busy schedule of the European Court of Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>This development of the focus on the individual and his rights can often cause antagonism as a grant of a right to one may be a deprivation of another. This inherent conflict is at the basis of the major issue which will confront us in the consideration of this Bill. Here we potentially open the door to allow curtailment of a freedom in the hope of preventing others from removing our greater freedom. Here we must set the scales and find the balance. It will not be easy.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>It would be wise at the outset to ensure that the appropriate safeguards, independent of the administration and operation of the powers granted, be set in place so that any abuse will be detected and dealt with, and that the controls which Parliament invests in this Bill are ensured for us all. If we have the protection that our details are not available to parties other than the proper agents of the government of a democracy in the implementation of laws which we support, and our details are utilised only for the stated purposes, what have we to fear? For my part, I am prepared to accept some curtailment of this freedom to help protect our general liberty.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>We must examine the facts as they are today. The dangerous forces which can confront us now are not tangible. They are highly organised, globalised and well- managed. They generally rely on the international, as well as the national, network for support. In a world in which freedom of movement has evolved and has been optimistically accepted as the basis for the structure of our future society, these forces effectively utilise the four ingredients necessary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_62"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for terrorism and for crime. These are: motivation, stealth, money, and a sympathetic community. I hope that the presently proposed legislation will help to identify those involved and the places where the terrorists and criminals derive their recruitment, their supplies and their shelter.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>There is also, of course, the threat of single terrorists or criminals, who are very difficult to detect. They can operate on a vast scale, utilising the advanced scientific and technological developments available. Weapons of mass destruction can be deployed with the minimum use of manpower. I do not think I am being unrealistic or alarmist in stating this. It is crucial that we do not allow the emotive and exciting subject of individual rights to obfuscate our minds when considering the issue of national and indeed collective international security. We must keep these potentially antagonistic elements in context in this debate.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>I am pleased to observe this Government&#039;s increasing attention to the detection and prevention of national and international money laundering. This Bill should also help to reduce the high level of crime that we have from credit card fraud, health and benefits fraud, and the black economy. If this can be controlled, the enormous amount of money that is presently being defrauded and being spent on the detection and prosecution of such fraud will be saved, and will become available for improvements for us all.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>The present proposal by the Government to implement the use of identity cards has been met with a mixed reaction. It seems that many people are suggesting what should not be done, rather than asking what should be done. We have our security services to thank for the fact that we are not debating this issue in the wake of an attack in the style of September 11. Indeed this is one of the benefits with which an effective security policy provides us. I do not need to remind your Lordships of the many enemies who await an opportunity to strike. I believe the most relevant element of global terrorism is stealth, and ask everyone to bear this in mind when debating this topic. It was once said that the best trick that the Devil ever played was convincing mankind that he did not exist. I am not alone in my belief that the enemy exists, and feel that, because we have not experienced an attack such as 9/11 on our own soil, we may be in danger of losing sight of the terrible impact which such an attack would have. I welcome the optimism of those who feel that this risk is not real, but I do so cautiously.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>Recent intelligence suggests that terrorists and criminals are often in co-operation and, on occasion, inextricably linked. Any reasonable and proportionate means which stifle these activities must be supported, so it is to the implementation of such a system that I now turn. The proposed Identity Cards Bill includes provision for maintaining the accuracy of a national identity register and also the provision of information from that register for verification purposes. At this time I see this as a comparatively small intrusion on our privacy, a small price to pay for maintaining our way of life and our freedom. The cost of its implementation, if that implementation is performed correctly, is I believe, entirely justifiable.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_63"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>One can scarcely sufficiently emphasise the wide implications of this Bill. I have focused thus far on terrorism and crime, but of course the better control of the hugely complex issues of immigration and asylum is also to be gained. Let us not forget that the European Union is expanding, as is its pool of people who will be legally entitled to free movement within our borders.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>The balance of which I spoke earlier must be set and maintained. The Bill, when enacted, must not be capable of being used to broaden the amount of information recorded as that would be stepping towards a certain nanny state, which would be well beyond the present purpose of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>If the Bill, with the appropriate modifications and safeguards, is implemented as intended, it should go some way to making terrorism and crime, as we presently know them, part of our history rather than our destiny. I thank noble Lords for their attention.
<a name="time_16"></a>
<a name="50321-16_time0"></a><h5></h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="50321-16_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </b>   My Lords, it gives me tremendous pleasure to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond, on his informative and thought-provoking maiden speech. The noble Lord comes to this House with an impressive history of service to his community. In addition to being chair of Norbrook Laboratories and Norbrook Holdings, he is a member of the Senate of Ireland, a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and a member of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body. That background has well equipped him for appointment to this House. The noble Lord&#039;s knowledge of his subject was very evident in his speech, and I am sure that all noble Lords who heard it will join me in looking forward to future debates in which he takes part.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>I have found that the Identity Cards Bill has created a great deal of interest and a larger postbag than usual. It is an enabling Bill and, as such, it does not spell out arrangements in detail for issuing and using identity cards. However, it does provide the framework for later secondary legislation. It gives legal authority for expenditure on setting up the identity cards scheme and the suggested fees surrounding it. Most importantly, it spells out the safeguards on the information to be used. I personally welcome the proposed legislation.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>We live in a world which is rapidly changing. People are moving from country to country in a way that could not possibly have been envisaged even a generation ago, and two generations ago it would have been totally unthinkable. I well remember my 89 year-old grandmother, who lived in a pretty isolated village in the heart of the Lincolnshire wolds, being awestruck when she knew I was working in London. She visited London once in her life to see the Crystal Palace exhibition, and of course she never dreamed of travelling abroad. Her simple world has changed forever.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>In 2003, more than 90 million people came through UK ports, including 15 million European economic area nationals and 12 million foreign nationals. Such <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_64"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 64</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

freedom of movement is both advantageous and beneficial but, as others have explained, it brings with it threats from terrorists and other organised criminals together with identity theft, which costs the economy more than &#163;1 billion per year.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>We need identity cards as part of a major effort to ensure that we know who should and who should not be able to remain legally in this country. Of course, ID cards are not a panacea for everything to do with combating terrorism, organised crime or identity theft. No one believes that. But they are a major cog in the wheels of prevention.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Biometrics may be a new concept but ID cards are not. The information that they will provide is already kept on databases of all kinds of organisations. Most of the information is not highly sensitive; it will be core information: name, date of birth, address, nationality and so on. I believe that the scheme will provide people with a simple and convenient method of proving who they are and help to sort out any queries when that is in the public interest.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>We already provide a great deal of information about ourselves to various organisations. Many of us carry what are ostensibly ID cards, and have done for years. Perhaps I can illustrate this with a short story. It is the story of a Liverpool boy, who became a 15 year-old entrant to the Royal Navy. When he joined, he was given a pay book upon which was his photograph, his name, his personal identifying number and his personal medical facts. Unlike the proposed ID cards, it was compulsory for him to carry it at all times when ashore. It was called a &quot;pay book&quot; but it was, in effect, an ID card, and indeed was later changed by the Navy to a small ID card.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>The boy became a man and, on leaving the Navy, he joined the Prison Service. There, he was issued with a warrant card, which he had to carry while on duty. In later years, this also contained his photograph to make identity absolutely accurate. Now, in retirement, he has been issued with a freedom pass for public transport. The pass contains his photograph and, to gain it, he had to prove his age, address and whether or not he had a disability. He needs to carry it whenever he wants to travel on public transport. In other words, he had to provide identification and he has to carry the ID card with him when travelling. I could go on with the illustrations but time does not permit that.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>Some noble Lords will know that I am the president of the Yeadon Air Training Corps. The cadets are a splendid group of young men and women of whom the country can be as proud as I am. Twice each year, a group of cadets visits the House of Lords and I take the opportunity to seek their views on forthcoming legislation. When a group visited last November, I asked their views on identity cards. I explained about the enabling legislation and the proposals in the Bill. My questions were greeted with puzzlement. Then one young man said, &quot;As cadets, my Lady, we already carry ID cards&quot;, and they duly produced them. His friend said, &quot;I can&#039;t see any reason to object to having ID cards, unless of course you&#039;ve done something wrong&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_65"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 65</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-16_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>So, to me, the concept of an ID card is welcome, and, as my noble friend Lady Scotland of Asthal explained, it will bring us into line with other EU countries. French and Portuguese friends tell me that they cannot see what all the fuss is about. There will of course need to be debates about what information ID cards will contain and what safeguards will be needed to guard, so far as possible, against fraud. I am confident that our debates will be as thorough as they always are in your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>I now turn to some of the briefings that I have received on the Bill from different organisations. I particularly welcome those from both sides of industry. The TUC has raised questions about Clause 31, which covers tampering with the national identity register. I know that my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall is to expand on these concerns in his speech today. Of course, those of us on this side of the House who worked in and for the trade union movement will recognise those concerns and will listen carefully to the responses of my noble friend the Minister.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>The CBI has welcomed the objectives of the Bill. It believes that they will improve security and go some way to tackling identity theft. It does, however, want information on ID cards to be kept to a minimum. It emphasises the need for accuracy and believes that the national identity scheme commissioner should report to Parliament rather than to the Secretary of State. I would welcome the Minister&#039;s comments on those points also.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>One briefing about which I am most suspicious is that from the &quot;NO 2 ID&quot; campaign, whose address is a Post Office box number in Marylebone High Street. Rarely have I received such objectionable and misleading information. It is a great pity that this group of individuals has taken time to print and circulate such information, hiding behind a PO box number. The only named person is a &quot;national co-ordinator&quot;, although what and who he is co-ordinating is not clear. I find this worrying piece of literature far more sinister than the proposals to which the authors object.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>On the other side of the coin, I read with interest the briefing from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. The JCWI is a respected national organisation with which I have worked over many years. Its main concerns are the risk of creating a general culture of suspicion towards black and ethnic minority communities; and disproportionate targeting of them for identity checks by police, immigration officials or other public service officials. Apparently, research has been carried out into what happens in EU countries, which shows that that could be the case.
</p>

<a name="50321-16_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>The JCWI also believes that there should be a stronger human rights analysis of the Identity Cards Bill, together with a substantial race equality impact assessment before it becomes law. Those are legitimate issues to raise and I would be pleased to hear my noble friend&#039;s response.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_66"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 66</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-16_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Finally, I genuinely believe that the legislation does far more to safeguard than to threaten our civil liberties. Following the deliberations in which we always engage in this House, I also believe that it will leave us in better shape than when it arrived.

<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="50321-17_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Northesk:</b>  My Lords, I begin by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond, on his informed contribution. I also thank the Minister for the customary grace and eloquence of her introduction. It is therefore with a little regret that I have to say that that is about as far as my generosity is likely to go. As many of your Lordships will be aware, I have deep-seated reservations about the Bill in terms of both principle and practicality.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Indeed, if pressed, these are matters about which I could speak at tedious length. That said, I shall try to limit my remarks to two or three central themes. Before doing so, I should, for avoidance of doubt, place my aversion towards the Bill in context. I do not in any way underestimate the potential threat from terrorism. Nor do I resile from the Government&#039;s&#151;indeed, Parliament&#039;s&#151;obligation to protect the nation&#039;s security.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Accordingly, I can accept that the Bill&#039;s key objectives are valid. Combating terrorism, cutting crime and reducing fraud and illegal working are legitimate tasks for any responsible government. Moreover, I recognise that most, if not all, of us are accustomed to carrying various forms of identity. To that extent the Government might be tempted to argue that society is fully engaged with an underlying concept of the scheme: the use of a piece of plastic as proof of our identity.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>But, as I shall seek to demonstrate, none of that guarantees that the Bill&#039;s provisions are the right way forward. Where to begin? The first essential point to be grasped is that, notwithstanding its short title, this is categorically not a Bill about identity cards. Here we are not helped in that comments from Ministers have been muddled and confused. Indeed, it is almost as though Ministers do not fully understand the character and import of the text of their own Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>With due apology to her, I have to add that the Minister&#039;s introduction has, at least in part, added to my sense of opacity, not least because of her exposition of the international dimension of biometric passports and her conflation of the centralised database under the umbrella of the ID cards scheme.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>The following further illustrate the point. At Second Reading in another place the Home Secretary insisted,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;I must [also] make it clear that we have never proposed and do not propose a scheme under which it would be compulsory to carry a card&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 20/12/04; col. 1949.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>And yet, a few minutes later, he commented:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;The whole point is that, ultimately, the scheme will be effectively compulsory&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official </i>Report, Commons, 20/12/04; col.1951.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_67"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 67</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>In the same vein, during Committee scrutiny of the Bill in another place, the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;Nobody should vote for the ID card scheme unless they understand that it is compulsory... Let us be under no illusion that the Government intend to bring in a compulsory ID scheme; there is no stealth, no dishonesty and no masking of such a proposal&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, Standing Committee B, 20/1/05; col.123.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>And yet, a few days later, he observed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;I said on Second Reading and I have already said in Committee that we do not intend to require anybody to carry a card at all times&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>In summary therefore, the Government&#039;s position is that come what may the scheme&#151;registering for and having a card&#151;will be compulsory but carrying one will not. For many the internal logic of this is farcical. The Home Secretary has justified the position by pointing out that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;It is the secure record of identity that is important, not the card itself&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 20/12/04; col. 1954.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>It may be scant consolation to the Minister, but I do at least understand the point, particularly given the inclusion within the scheme of biometrics. But the inescapable reality is that the Bill is far less about the introduction of identity cards&#151;they are an accidental by-product&#151;than about the establishment of a centralised and over-arching database containing extensive details about every individual in the land.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>Even a cursory glance at the Bill reveals that, out of a total of 45 clauses and two schedules, only five clauses are concerned directly with the cards. The crucial point is that, as identified by the Constitution Committee, it should be called the National Identity Registration and Database Bill. It does not take a genius to work out that this is an entirely different proposition from an ID cards Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The cosy assumption that the scheme will have widespread public acceptance because of the card culture of the modern age falls by the wayside. Rather, were it more widely known that we are in fact dealing with an extensive&#151;and potentially very intrusive&#151;registration system rooted in IT, public endorsement for the scheme would be likely to be rather more muted than the Government maintain.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>My second point flows naturally from this. As is well known a host of commentators and organisations&#151;Liberty, the Information Commissioner, the Constitution Committee, et al&#151;have made reference to the way in which the Government&#039;s proposals will undermine civil liberties. As the Home Affairs Select Committee investigating the draft Bill put it&#151;I choose it out of any number of commentators:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;An identity card scheme of the sort and on the scale proposed by the Government would undoubtedly represent a significant change in the relationship between the state and the individual in this country&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The JCHR substantiates this anxiety in its fifth report of the current session, saying that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;The provisions of the Bill raise a number of serious questions of human rights compatibility&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_68"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 68</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>All of this should represent a stark warning. At the very least one could have anticipated that the Government might accept that there are fundamental concerns here that need to be addressed. But in response, the Home Secretary states baldly:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;In my opinion, it is entirely false to claim that ID cards will erode our civil liberties&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 20/12/04; col. 1948.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>adding, in his written response to the JCHR:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;I do not consider that the principle of a compulsory national registration and identity cards scheme can possibly be in breach of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50321-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>In turn the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration argues that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;The whole debate has been plagued by people making grand assertions about liberty, but then walking away from them and not staying around to justify and explain what they meant&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee B, 18/1/05; col.48.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>I have no difficulty in responding to the Minister&#039;s challenge. Taken to its logical conclusion, the scheme represents the establishment of an executive system of control of the citizen, particularly in respect of the proposed audit trail.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>As the Constitution Committee has pointed out, it transfers &quot;ownership&quot; of our identities from our own hands into those of the state. To add insult to injury, some would say, it advances the proposition that we should have to pay for that dubious privilege. With the best will in the world, I cannot conceive how that can be considered as anything other than,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;a significant change in the relationship between the state and the individual&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>Evidently the Government challenge this proposition. But what matters is that Ministers, in justifying the Bill and the scheme to which it gives the spark of life, are under an obligation to make the case for why they believe this does not offend civil liberties. It is simply not good enough for them, as it were, to stamp their feet and say that they are the fountainhead of all wisdom on the matter and that therefore any critics are inescapably misguided.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>As Liberty has put it,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;It is a peculiarity of the identity card debate that those who express concerns have been required to justify their opposition rather than requiring the Government to justify their introduction&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>These matters are far too important&#151;arguably they are on a par with the furore we have recently experienced over the Prevention of Terrorism Act&#151;for their substance to be treated dismissively as an aberration emanating from woolly-minded liberals. Indeed, there is a subsidiary point here, admirably highlighted by the JCHR at paragraph 8 of its report. It states that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;It must be shown that they&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>that is to say, the interferences with Article 8 rights&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;interfere with privacy rights to the minimum degree necessary, and that their aim could not be achieved by less intrusive means&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>I do not want to get bogged down with the efficacy or fitness of the Section 19 declaration made by the Minister, but it seems to me that it remains the case that this absolute requirement has yet to be satisfied.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_69"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 69</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>This leads to my third point. As I have already said, I have no hesitation in accepting that the underlying objectives of the Bill are legitimate tasks for any responsible government. But a key question remains: to what extent will the scheme usefully address these objectives? And&#151;to borrow the phraseology of the JCHR&#151;to what extent could they,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;be achieved by less intrusive means&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Here too the Government&#039;s position is hopelessly muddled and confused. For example, as the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration, put it:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;Nobody suggests that identity cards are a panacea for or a solution to terrorism. However, they will make a significant contribution&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee B, 18/1/05; col. 53.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, said something similar in her speech.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>At least it is clear that the Government accept that ID cards are not a silver bullet. But, in reality, the faith and trust of Ministers&#151;or of the Home Office more generally&#151;in the scheme are decidedly lukewarm and insecure. Reports of disagreements in Cabinet over the issue suggest that Government support lacks conviction and is rather less robust than would be appropriate for such a far-reaching measure. This is underscored by a comment from the Identity Cards Programme Team in the Home Office that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;The scheme is not being designed to be the primary measure to tackle these problems&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>The fact that the key objectives that the Government trot out with such regularity as the Bill&#039;s major justification are not being factored in to the design process is a tacit admission that the contribution that the scheme will make to tackle these problems is, at best, marginal. Moreover it implies that dealing with them could be achieved by other more practical and proportionate means.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>Of course, this woolly approach to the IT architecture of the scheme reflects another flaw within the proposal. As my noble friend Lady Anelay inferred, its putative key objectives are multiple and divergent. They are not necessarily mutually exclusive but, so far as their resolution via IT is concerned, they compete and pull in contrary directions. For example, it is inevitable that the use of an ID card scheme to satisfy the objective of combating terrorism will require distinct IT structures from those required for, say, enhancing public service delivery. In effect, the envisaged purposes of the scheme, because they are disparate, vague and unfocused, anticipate the development of technological solutions that will inevitably end up being equally vague and unfocused. This is a classic scenario&#151;we may already be experiencing something similar with the NHS national plan for IT&#151; where costs are almost bound to explode uncontrollably. Bluntly, the business case for the scheme has yet to be made in any rational or coherent way.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_70"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 70</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Against this background, it is wholly unsurprising that no less a personage than the Prime Minister, albeit in another, more oppositional, life, was emboldened to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;Instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on compulsory ID cards . . . let the money provide thousands of extra police officers on the beat in local communities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Clearly, he once understood that there might be a more proportionate and cost-effective way of contributing to the identified key objectives. There is some irony in the fact that, presumably because of the heightened security situation as a result of 9/11, he has entirely abandoned that rational and sensible point of view as a means to inform the structure of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-17_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>I could go on. I have barely scratched the surface of the flaws and infelicities of the Bill. But I leave the last word to the excellent report from the London School of Economics that was presented to your Lordships this morning:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;There was an overwhelming view expressed by stakeholders involved in this Report that the proposals <i>are too complex, technically unsafe, overly prescriptive</i> and <i>lack a foundation of public trust and confidence</i>&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-17_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I could not agree more. However elegantly the Minister argues her case, and whatever the future of the Bill, the fact remains that, so far as I am concerned, it is irretrievably muddled and confused. Clearly, whether in this Parliament or the next, this House and, indeed, the Government, have a great deal of work to do to make some sort of sense of it, if that is possible.

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="50321-18_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Erroll:</b>  My Lords, I compliment the Minister on her patience and courtesy in handling several interruptions in her opening speech by Peers who left the Chamber shortly afterwards. I do not think that is the way to behave.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>I am speaking in this debate because I hope that the Bill will undergo a deep and philosophical rethink before it reappears after any election. I shall split my remarks into four different areas. The first is why we should have ID cars; the second is why we should have a central register and a possible alternative solution to it that might be more acceptable; the third area is problems that might arise about it; and the fourth area is the protection of the individual.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>Why have ID cards? We already have a plethora of ID cards&#151;I am wearing one right now&#151;and they will not go away because they are needed for different purposes. We will keep our parliamentary ID cards, even if new ID cards appear, as they are instantly recognisable to our security staff and a national ID card would not contain all one&#039;s permissions and security access.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>Why are the purposes for which individuals and commerce need ID cards? We need to think about that first. The first purpose is as a passport, for border control, and for trying to track a person and find out if he is a criminal or a terrorist and whether he has a record. The second purpose is for financial ID when one does not need to know who a person is. A person can be checked through a credit-checking agency to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_71"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 71</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

find out whether he is credit-worthy and whether one would be willing to do business with him. It is not necessary to know where the person lives or whether he has several different IDs. For example, I might want to present myself as the Earl of Erroll for certain purposes, because I think that it could give me an advantage. For other purposes, I may well want to be Mr Erroll because I think I shall get a better bargain. Why should I have to reveal both identities?
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The third reason for ID cards, which is often cited, is for health purposes when one needs to know about someone&#039;s allergies or diseases but not necessarily what the person is called. In fact, if a Minister was scraped off the street and it was discovered that he had a particularly nasty notifiable disease, it might be better if his identity was not known. What needs to be known is whether a person is allergic to penicillin.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The fourth reason is for authorisation, for security access&#151;such as to this building&#151;and to receive benefits. For benefits, a card would probably be issued by the local authority, because it administers those matters. The fifth reason is for electronic ID, to prove, using public key encryption or certificates, who you are over an electronic medium such as the Internet. There is no suggestion that this ID card will do that, although something could be bolted on later. There are other ways of doing that.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>There is one thing that I forgot to say about health, which is that the NHS is about to issue two ID cards. One is the &quot;spine card&quot; which will state whether a person is entitled to NHS medical services. It may or may not be linked to medical records. The other is the E111, which one will use in Europe. So why do we need a national ID card for that?
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>My second point is about a central register. It will track a person&#039;s interactions with it over his lifetime. In fact, anything that is on an individual&#039;s register as a child will probably be rolled forward on the central register when he reaches 16. Central government will have a track of when an individual has had to prove his identity to all sorts of different bodies&#151;some government, some otherwise. I thought that after five years most crimes are expunged from a person&#039;s record to give him a fresh start. I am not sure that that will be so in this case.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>A figure of 80 per cent popularity for ID cards is quoted. Someone went out and did a market survey. But that figure depends on the question. If it were, &quot;Would you be happy for a government agency to keep a central register of all inquiries made about your identity throughout your life and of who made them?&quot; the answer might be very different. Most people think that the ID card is nothing to do with a central register. They see it as &quot;flash and go&quot;, which I shall speak about in a moment.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>To get round the problem of proving identity, there is no need for a central register. There are two systems: the hierarchical central control ID system, which central government like because they are trying to control the actions of the individual; and what is known as a federated ID system, which has a biometric <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_72"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 72</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on a card with your identity, and which can be verified locally. When it is put into a machine, it can communicate with government and civilian databases on whatever it is that you are trying to do, such as proving what money is in your bank for receiving benefit. You have control over your ID in that case. When you take the card away, central government no longer know anything about you, except that benefits or whatever, have been authorised.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>That federated ID leaves control with the individual not the state. It is hugely different and is very much how local authorities are handling ID issues.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>When we consider the Government&#039;s reasons for ID cards, they all seem to be very noble aims, such as national security. But it is good intelligence that catches terrorists, not trying to track every person around the place. Most terrorists operate most of the time under perfectly valid IDs. Another reason is the prevention and detection of crime. The problem, as the police have often said, is catching criminals with enough evidence, not finding out who they are once they are caught. Everyone under 16 is excluded, but a huge amount of crime is perpetrated by them, so why are they not being included in identity card schemes?
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>Enforcement of immigration controls has been given as a reason for identity cards. They will not be much good as all immigrants get a different card. They get different papers when they come, which will not be instantly recognised by everyone else. How do you know that a card which someone in the first three months, or perhaps longer, is using will not cause problems in the system? People will think that because the immigrant does not have a UK ID card, he is not entitled to be here. He may be perfectly entitled to be here, especially during that initial three months. How will we know about the plethora of cards that will be out there?

</p>

<a name="50321-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>That applies, too, to the enforcements on prohibitions on unauthorised working or employment. The UK card does not tell us that&#151;in fact, it could be misleading. There will be others under work permits using their own perfectly officially recognised ID, which, as the Minister said, they will be keeping. They may also have a work permit entitling them to work here. People may be here on short-term contracts, or for a variety of reasons. Just the fact of a UK ID card may or may not permit them to work. If they are valid for three months, for example, there may be students who are not necessarily entitled to work, except in limited circumstances. I do not know the rules; they would need to be checked. As a small employer, I would have to go through all that stuff to check it out.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>Efficient and effective provision of public services is another reason. Local authorities deliver most of the public services and they are introducing their own management schemes. They do not need a central ID card to do that. If they were able to use the card put out by central government, it would save them huge amounts and would be useful, but they have been told that they are specifically prohibited from riding on the back of the silicon by putting their own applications on it. I do not know why that is. It could be done securely <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_73"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 73</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

technologically. Benefits fraud tends to be misrepresentation of personal circumstances, not duplicate identity. People will have to produce a national ID card, a benefits card, and so on. They will have purse-loads of cards; there will be no reduction at all.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>There will be problems. First, 13 biometrics will be recorded, comprising 10 fingerprints, two irises and a face, which will not all necessarily check out. In a local bank that has a reader, for example, what will happen if seven of the 13 biometrics match and six do not, or six match and seven do not? What about false positives and false negatives? We need to consider people&#039;s credibility and how to handle such situations. Such problems will happen on the front line on the day.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>Certain ethnic and labour groups have certain characteristics. For example, I know that someone who will be speaking later has fingerprints that are difficult to read. Mine probably are as well because I work outside round the farm and the garden from time to time. Certainly the fingerprints of builders and farmers are difficult to read. There are problems reading the fingerprints of Asian community members, which is why China dropped that test. I am told that the dark brown eyes of people of African origin cause difficulties in producing unique scans and photographs. There are therefore challenges as to whether the system will work.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>There will be problems with the technology. To verify locally, you will need to connect to the register and get the information back in time. As most of the transactions will not connect to the register there is a problem of flash and go, as I call it. You flash the card at someone who looks at the face and says, &quot;Great, that&#039;s fine&quot;. You do not need a central register for that, so it would be possible to forge the card for all those transactions. I need only a blank card with a chip in it. I can forge the rest of the card and it will pass muster. Unless it is inserted into a biometric reading device, there is no way of knowing whether it is mine.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>There are different ID cards for foreign nationals. They will be designated documents but how will we distinguish between them? The Government will not accept liability&#151;it would be a first if they did. Presumably the FSA will not accept the card on its own, as there will be liability issues in certain high-value banking transactions. We shall go through the whole rigmarole.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The address issue is another problem. The FSA for some strange reason needs to know someone&#039;s address to open a bank account, which is why a lot of people do not have bank accounts. The central register will also want an address. If it requires the same level of proof as the FSA, not many ID cards will be issued to people who do not pay utility bills because someone else in the household does; people who do not claim benefits who have no transactions with government departments; and those who do not drive. They cannot prove where they live, so they will not get ID cards. What can be done about that?
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>What about changes of address? There will be &#163;1,000 fine for not registering a change of address. I believe that special arrangements will be made for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_74"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 74</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

students, but what if someone has no fixed abode? It makes nonsense of the whole system. Criminals will just disappear. If they happen to be found, they will pay the fine. They can afford to as I expect that their proceeds of crime will be a lot more than &#163;1,000.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>We will be vulnerable to over-zealous enforcement authorities. We hear a lot from Amnesty about the problems in France and other places. If we look back at what happened in the late 1850s to the end of the century when the British were allowed to move freely throughout Europe, and the continentals were not, there was always trouble. The continentals were desperate to get rid of their ID cards and did so, following the British model. Therefore, why on earth are we throwing that away?
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>What about leaks of information? Anyone believing that everything is safe nowadays and will not be leaked must be joking.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Finally, the register will become a prime terrorist target. Can you imagine the value of infiltrating someone on to it? There have to be mechanisms to switch ID. There are witness protection programmes, transgender reassignment, and agents in the field whose true identity must be concealed. Terrorists could have perfect access to the register.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I have talked for too long, but I should say on the issue of protection that we should not assume that J Edgar Hoover&#039;s reincarnation cannot come here. The report of the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution, HL paper 82 is brief, to the point and excellent. The Minister in another place made some robust statements about Parliament keeping a firm grip on our freedoms, but we cannot embed protections in perpetuity. We have no constitutional Supreme Court to overturn legislation unfortunately, despite the latest moves of the Government.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>People say, &quot;I&#039;ve got nothing to hide&quot;, but have they never done anything that could be used against them once they into public office? The register will track you through your life, from the new register of all schoolchildren through to your grave. My Jewish friends are very concerned because it could be linked through the address to the census, which carries ethnic and religious details. Remember what happened in Holland.
</p>

<a name="50321-18_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>In conclusion, an ID card is basically an internal passport. It gives the authorities huge power to control our future movements and other things. It will irretrievably alter the balance between the citizen and the state. Millions have died defending our freedoms. Just because we are frightened of some terrorist attacks, we should not throw away those freedoms lightly.

<a name="50321-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Giddens: </b>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond, on his excellent maiden speech. He covered the ground with great precision and incisiveness. I like it because I agree with what he said. We face new risks today, and the terrorist risks that we face are in many respects quite different <br>&nbsp;<br>

from those of the past. To face them we have to look again at some of the traditional notions of human liberties on which we have operated.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Quite often new Labour is said to be a government afflicted by creeping authoritarianism, especially by libertarian critics. Such critics say that the Government are waging, as it were, a war on our rights and individual freedoms to produce a more encroaching sphere for the state. To such critics, the Identity Cards Bill is simply another stage in that process. It is more of the same, along with control orders with curfews, limitations on rowdy neighbours and so on.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>From my point of view that criticism is almost completely wrong, for two main reasons. First, liberty or freedom is not just a formal quality but it is also a substantive one. Our substantive freedoms consist of our ability to live the kind of lives we want to live and to pursue our aspirations. If I am frightened to go out of my house after dark, if I will not even cross a public park in daylight, if my life is made a misery by rowdy and aggressive neighbours, am I free? I am not. We should be concerned with substantive freedoms and they are certainly being extended. Sometimes we have to limit the formal freedoms of the few to expand the substantive freedoms of the many.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>Secondly, libertarian critics of new Labour and of Bills such as this say much about rights and liberties, but they say very little about obligations or responsibilities. One cannot create an ethical society on the basis of rights alone. Rights always presume correlating obligations, and responsibilities from our citizens&#039; rights and obligations tend to go together. Citizenship is a balance of rights and obligations. We have to ensure that we achieve the right balance.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>The Bill should be set in the wider framework of citizenship with the balance of rights and obligations that that presumes. I believe that today we are seeing massive changes. The citizenship contract between the individual and the state is evolving and has to be transformed. We need a new contract between the individual citizen and the state.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>That is because of two big sets of changes that affect all our lives. The first is that we live in a much more fluid and open society than any generation before us, especially in terms of the lifestyle options open to us. My noble friend Lady Gibson related an anecdote from her own family and I can easily offer a comparable one from my family. My parents went abroad only one day in their lives. It was a one-day trip to Ostend. Now, of course, we all take for granted the freedom that we have to travel and the forms of mobility that we enjoy. My statistics on the use of UK airports are a little different from hers. The latest data I have seen show that about 198 million people pass through UK airports every year.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>There is a vast expansion in our substantive freedoms. It is a myth to suppose that we have an increasingly omnipotent state. The frightening perspectives suggested once upon a time by George Orwell and, from another perspective, by Franz Kafka <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_76"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have proved to be wrong. Today authoritarianism is more or less in retreat everywhere. We do not live in a society that is subject to the control of an omnipotent elite or a bureaucratic, rigid form of government. On the contrary, our society is much more mobile and changing; it is, as I have described elsewhere, a runaway world. Rather than a world subject to increasing and constant surveillance, we live in a world which, to some extent, escapes our control and we have to reassert that control to some degree.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>The second set of changes concerns the penetration of information technology in our lives. Our lives are much more thoroughly penetrated by information technology than any generation before us. A noble Lord alluded to the role of credit cards in our lives. Credit cards lend themselves to fraud and to identity fraud and they can create problems for over-expansion of one&#039;s banking credit. By and large, credit cards open up a whole new world to us. The amazing thing about credit cards is that they are valid in almost all countries of the world. Our identity is part and parcel of a vastly expanding range of freedoms that they make possible.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Of course, the conjunction of the world of increasing globalisation and information technology poses threats that derive from those very changes. Allusion was made to money laundering. Some $2 trillion are estimated to be turned over every year in global markets through money laundering, illegal monetary transactions. Much of that money should, and could, be spent on the needs of citizens in the countries from which that money emanates. As regards the illegal arms trade, there are about 550 million small arms in the world at the moment. Only 3 per cent of such small arms are in the hands of states; all the others are in the hands of individuals and networks across the world. Increasingly the illegal arms trade involves high-tech weaponry, the latest tanks, the latest radar systems and, most disturbingly of all, nuclear materials and the know-how to create nuclear devices.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>Against that backdrop, it seems to me to be a basic citizenship right that a person should be able to assert and validate his or her identity. Surely this is a key part of the backdrop to this debate. Libertarians will say, as noble Lords have said in this debate, that the Government should not build up a database on all of us. Libertarians will say, as has been said in the debate, that the Government should not intrude into our personal privacy, but the Government do so already and with results that are seen by most of us to be beneficent.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>A good example is passports. A passport gives us identity; a passport makes it possible for us to travel across the world. If we lose our passport, or get into trouble in another country, we quite rightly expect the state or the Government to bail us out. If one does not have a passport, if one does not have citizenship, one of the worst situations in which one can find oneself is to be a stateless person.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>Therefore, I believe that the basic provisions of the Bill are right and proper. It is correct to say that the provisions will allow us to combat crime, especially new forms of crime and new forms of terrorism as well <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_77"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 77</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as new forms of identity fraud, more effectively than we have been able to do before. It is right to say that identity cards, in the first instance&#151;although there may be a built-in compulsory element&#151;will largely be voluntary and that there must be some form of parliamentary and national debate on the issue.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>However, I conclude by saying that one must also have some reservations. Until recently I was the director of the London School of Economics, which has been mentioned twice in the debate already. When I was the head of the LSE I used to know everything&#151;or so I thought&#151;about what was going on in the institution. Now I am a little adjunct professor, a little pimple on the side of this highly deserving but large-scale organisation, and I know nothing of what is going on. I found out about the LSE report on the identity cards debate only about two hours ago. Its name is a bit like that of a thriller: <i>The Identity Project</i>. However, it is a sober and detailed assessment of both the general backdrop to the ID cards debate and this Bill. It generally endorses the principle that ID cards will help the Government in their aims of combating terrorism, crime and identity fraud. It makes a large number of critical observations, however, on the scope of the technology, which it says is larger than has ever been attempted before, and on cost and other factors.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>No doubt the Government will and&#151;even though I speak as an ex-director of the LSE&#151;should seek to rebut these criticisms. The report is, however, very important and I hope that everyone interested in this debate, inside and outside the Chamber, will give it the attention it deserves.

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="50321-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   My Lords, I could not believe for a moment, when I started listening to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, that I was going to end up agreeing with what he said. Yet I do so absolutely. It is a very thorough, well researched and well thought out report from the LSE. I very much hope that it has a serious effect on the Government&#039;s thinking.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>I am one of the 80 per cent who would like to have a national identity card, but I want a card which is useful to me. I want something that brings me benefits, which works well for me, not just in the airy-fairy world of thinking that maybe it will stop a terrorist killing me&#151;which is a bit remote and, as I will come on to, I have my doubts about anyway&#151;but in terms of the ordinary benefits of not having a wallet full of plastic and being able to assert my identity when I wish to do so, as the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said. It is a thoroughly useful concept. It needs to be one that works, however, and it needs to work practically, efficiently and cost-effectively and must not take too much of my liberty away.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>I do not believe that the Government have got it right in this Bill, as it is now. That is why I am so glad to have listened to my noble friend Lady Anelay on the Front Bench saying that she was not going to be put off by Mr Hain&#039;s usual nauseating nastiness on the radio, and that this Bill would end its life in this House if the Government decide there is going to be an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_78"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Election in May. That is quite right. This Bill needs a lot of attention. I would like to see it reintroduced as a draft Bill with a good, long period&#151;six months, say&#151;of consideration by a Joint Committee. There are a lot of issues, as the LSE points out, to be addressed. They range from the deeply technical to the libertarian to security. There are a lot of things to be understood.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>It will also take some while to persuade the Government that in some ways they have been heading down the wrong track. We are probably all saying that this is the track we are going down, but let us go down it in the right way. It is going to be a fundamental part of our lives, and we want to get it right. We do not want the traditional NHS computer system mess-up happening to us with something which is going to be such a frequent part of our everyday lives.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>I have the greatest doubt about the centralised nature of what is proposed. Not that there should not be a central record of these things. I can see a use for it. In the end, it is practical way of producing a back-up. If I lose my card, I want to be able to recreate it. If there is no central record somewhere, or some kind of back-up, then I am going be in trouble. If there is some kind of back-up, then the security services are doubtless going to have access to it, so there might as well be a central record anyway.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>What I dislike the idea of, however, is that my getting my food from Tesco becomes dependent on the Government database, or some central database, authorising my identity at that particular moment. It will spend half its time down. I must not be subject to some single, centralised system going down. I must have the local capabilities, in the card that I have, to assert my identity.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>It looks, as it is at the moment, to be an extremely costly system in the way it is designed. The more you centralise things, the more you have to build in costs for keeping the system intact, keeping it running and for preventing unauthorised access. It is actually much more costly to run security on a centralised basis than on a distributed one.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>By not running a distributed system, you also lose a lot of capability which would be of interest to me as a user. There are things that you cannot do with a centralised system which you can do much more easily with a local system, such as having different local identities. The bus does not need to know that I have the right to shop at Tesco, or that I pay my taxes regularly, or whatever else. When I say &quot;assert my identity&quot;, I actually want to assert a lot of little identities. I want to assert my right to be on the bus, to pay my taxes or receive my child benefit, or whatever, and I want to limit the information that anybody else has access to in saying &quot;Yes, sir, you may have what you are entitled to&quot;.

</p>

<a name="50321-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>By putting all the information in the middle, we increase the opportunities for fraud enormously. It becomes a real target for someone who, as the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, said, wants to get some kind of human intelligence on what is going on there, to make use of the trapdoors&#151;which will be there for the security services&#151;to alter or create new information. It produces horrible <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_79"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 79</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consequences for a citizen who suddenly loses their identity. That may happen because it is compromised as a result of fraud, and there is no way back. I have one face, one set of fingerprints and two irises. I cannot change them. That is the point of the biometric system. If someone gets ownership of that biometric data, they have ownership of me and there is no escape. There are terrible dangers, therefore, in allowing that information out into a centralised database where it can then be compromised.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>The consequences of failing an ID check are similarly devastating. Everything stops. The Government seem to imply that the biometric systems are foolproof. They are not. They have very high failure rates. If I go and have my irises scanned, and come back a while later and I am checked again, you are looking at failure rates of the order of 20 or 30 per cent.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, says, there are many occupations, and particular nationalities, who have real problems with fingerprints. What happens to face recognition when someone swings a baseball bat at you? Your face can change out of all recognition for a couple of weeks. Will you then be in a position where you cannot get access to Government services because someone has clonked you over the nut? There are all sorts of problems with making everything so centralised.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gibson of Market Rasen, gave some interesting examples of us all carrying ID, and so we do. If the squaddie or prison officer loses his warrant card, however, there are plenty of people who will recognise him and say &quot;Come along, Jim, don&#039;t do it again. Here&#039;s another one&quot;. If I lose my House of Lords ID, people here know me and they can give me another one.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>We have got to be certain, however, about what happens to the citizen whose identity is denied by the system, or who loses their card. How do they re-establish it? This has suddenly become an extremely precious thing. It gives enormous access to that person&#039;s information. Whoever re-issues a card must be very careful that they give it to the right person. How are they going to do it? How is this going to be a practical, useable, friendly process for someone to go through? By centralising everything, we are creating something which is going to fail hard for a lot of citizens.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>If we get into a situation where people are routinely running into trouble on this&#151;where the reputation of the system for not working, for being inefficient, for refusing people their own identity becomes commonplace&#151;we shall get, as the noble Earl, Lord Errol, said, into a flash and go situation. &quot;The picture is on the card, it clearly looks like a national ID card. That&#039;s okay, away you go, sir&#151;we know that the ID checks don&#039;t really work&quot;. Then everything becomes much worse, because you assume that someone with a card that looks right is who they say they are. There is no actual proof because, if someone fails the check, they believe it is the system rather than the person that is failing.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>The effectiveness of these systems has been asserted several times by the Government. The particular thing I remember the Minister saying was that a third of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_80"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 80</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

terrorists use some kind of false identity. One might as well say that a third of terrorists use the bus network. If false identity is not easily available, they will use some other method. They use it because it is possible; if it were not possible, they would use something else. I have seen no evidence that existing ID systems prevent terrorism. We must question and examine in detail the real benefits of the system proposed by the Government to show that our approach is right.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>We must also understand the nature of the changes that will occur in the relationship between the citizen and the Government. The audit trial was mentioned. If we use the ID card in the way that will become possible&#151;as authorisation for all sorts of ordinary transactions&#151;the requirement for a complete audit trail every time it is used for authentication will result in a total biography. The noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, said that the honest citizen should not be frightened of that, but who is that honest citizen? I doubt whether even the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark would put his hand up and say that there was nothing in his life that he would not be afraid to have published on the front page of the <i>Daily Mirror </i>or to be told to someone else; and that he has never in any commercial or personal transaction done something that he regretted.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>There will be so much evidence out there that, first, should someone get access to it illegally, or, secondly, should the Government decide that they wish to disparage or deal nastily with a person, they will have so much information at their hands that it will be immensely easy. One of the things that I do not like about this Government is how they treat people who disagree with them. They can be incredibly vicious. Many noble Lords will remember what happened to the noble Lord, Lord Winston, when he dared say that the National Health Service was not perfect. They are a vicious Government but they are a perfectly ordinary Government. If we got a really nasty government that had that information available to them, I would not like to think what they would be capable of. We need to understand what is happening to the relationship between the citizen and the Government.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>What has gone wrong is that the Home Office has drafted the Bill. The Bill has been put together for the supposed advantage of the Security Service rather than of the citizen. I would like a Bill under the charge of another, people-facing department&#151;perhaps the DTI&#151;with the Home Office as a client, so that what was done was of benefit to the Home Office but was focused on producing something that we, in our everyday lives, would find useful and valuable.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The key to the acceptance of an ID card and therefore its usefulness to the Government is that it should provide facilities that we the citizens want, in a way that we find easy to deal with. We have gone far from that in the drafting of this Bill. If it is not accepted, if it is resented or ignored, it will become valueless and easier to circumvent.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>We should seek a system that can be trialled and that can grow organically. We know that we need a passport system; let us trial the biometrics on that first. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_81"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The consequence of it going wrong is merely that I have difficulty taking a holiday or that I need to get special permission to go on a business trip. If difficulties occurred in that system, it would not be catastrophic to anybody. Let us trial the biometrics in that environment and, when everyone knows that they are tickety-boo and they work every day, we can start introducing the readers into other circumstances where the consequences of things going wrong are more seriously inconvenient to us.
</p>

<a name="50321-19_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>Let us try out other ways of using these cards and find ways of putting the local authority data on to them, of using them as bank cards and loyalty cards, and replacing the great mass of plastic in my wallet with something electronically controllable and usable that is of real advantage to me as a citizen. If we do that, we will produce the information that the Government want and need, but by common consent and in a way with which people feel comfortable. That is what we should aim at. I very much hope that we as a government will do just that.

<a name="50321-20_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  My Lords, the Minister began by saying that our identities are precious and need to be protected. I would happily carry an identity card if I knew that I had ownership of it and of the data in the register to which the card relates.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>I will say from the beginning that I feel deep unease about the Identity Cards Bill. I am relieved to know that I am not alone. When the topic is discussed with acquaintances, the initial reaction is that ID cards must be a good thing. As the Minister and other speakers have said, we all carry evidence of our identity with us at some time or another; for example, passport, driving licence, bank cards and business identity cards. It would simplify matters greatly if just one card would serve all those different purposes, would it not? However, when it comes to the proposals in the Bill, it is a completely different matter. Like my noble friend Lord Errol, I wonder how many of the 80 per cent who agree with ID cards know the detail of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>The carrying of identity cards was compulsory in the UK between 1939 and 1952. Originally, those cards served three purposes. They were for conscription, rationing and national service. As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, reminded us, when a parliamentary committee looked at their use in 1950, it discovered that those three functions had become 39. In February 1952, the National Registration Act was repealed as one of the first acts of the Churchill government to &quot;free the people&quot;. In the judgment that led to the repeal, <i>Willcock</i> v <i>Muckle</i>, on 26 June 1951, Lord Goddard said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;To use Acts of Parliament passed for particular purposes during war, in times when the war is past, except that technically a state of war exists tends to turn law-abiding subjects into lawbreakers, which is a most undesirable state of affairs&quot;.</p>

justify the ID card scheme is that the UK is required to establish biometric travel documents in any event because of international agreements.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>As the noble Baroness has explained, the US Government required all visa-waiver program countries to implement, by October 2004, biometric passport programmes that satisfy International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards. The requirement for all EU citizens to be fingerprinted is not as a result of US requirements; it is EU policy and the UK is not bound by the EU specification.

<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>I draw noble Lords&#039; attention to the words &quot;can use&quot;. We have long debates in this House over the words &quot;can&quot; and &quot;must&quot;. This document, which I assume is the one on which the Government are relying for support, says &quot;can&quot;, not &quot;must&quot;. The Government have therefore gold-plated the base requirement of the ICAO by adding biometric identifiers to the list of identifying information in the Bill. Certainly there is no obligation on the UK to use fingerprint or iris biometrics. This is a form of function creep.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>The Bill leaves wide open the opportunity for further function creep. There are far too many clauses&#151;I think the noble Baroness said that there were 60&#151;and subsections which permit the Secretary of State to

<a name="50321-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>I have no doubt that, should the Bill go to Committee, these clauses will be thoroughly discussed. We cannot give arbitrary powers to the Home Secretary so freely. I have no doubt that the Minister will give the Government&#039;s usual response in these circumstances: &quot;Of course the Government have no intention of <br>&nbsp;<br>

abusing the power, and in any case it is open to either House to block the orders&quot;. These assurances are not enough, for reasons that we all know only too well.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>I make no apology for labouring the points about function creep. I have been talking only about passports. We are told that it is proposed that this &quot;voluntary&quot; ID card will be compulsory when a UK citizen applies for a passport. Already we see that this voluntary scheme will be eroded by the words in Clause 6. The Secretary of State can decide who must register and when. There is no indication of the Government&#039;s thinking on this matter in the Bill. The penalties for contravening an obligation to register are not, by any means, light.

<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>As other noble Lords have said, the London School of Economics has today published <i>The Identity Project </i>interim report. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, I have not yet had time to read the full text, but I am impressed by the rigour of the research, which has been overseen by no fewer than 14 professors from very different fields. While the authors agree that,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;However, the proposals currently being considered in Parliament are neither safe nor appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>As other noble Lords have done, I recommend that the Minister reads the report.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The House will know that I have been concerned for a long time about the quality of the data held by social services departments on their mysterious Samson database. I am appalled that the merest suspicion about a mother exhibiting the signs of the&#151;now discredited&#151;Munchausen&#039;s syndrome by proxy, can be entered into the records maintained for a child who is deemed to be &quot;at risk&quot; under the Children Act 1989. It is apparent that the person making the accusation&#151;and I say &quot;accusation&quot;, not &quot;diagnosis&quot;&#151;need not be qualified to make it, as in none of the many cases of which I have been made aware, not one single mother&#151;it is usually the mother&#151;has undergone a proper psychiatric examination.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>The effect of that is to bar accused mothers from ever working with children&#151;even from helping in a Sunday school. Even if social workers agree that the accusation is a false one, I am told by Ministers that the entry can never be expunged from the record, as it is an opinion that pertained at a particular time and is, therefore, a record of the family&#039;s history. Perhaps the Minister can tell me whether a facility for the passage of information contained in the register will be set up for children between their birth and the age of 18, as required by the Children Act 2004 and the register in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>The reason I have raised this issue at this particular time is that I note that Clause 2(5)(b) relieves the Secretary of State of the duty to correct information held on the register,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;unless . . . he considers that it is appropriate to do so&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="50321-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>That makes me deeply unhappy. Surely, natural justice should demand that if a recorded fact is inaccurate an absolute duty to correct it should be placed upon the Secretary of State. Otherwise, particularly in relation to matters concerning employment or health, an individual&#039;s life may be permanently blighted, as have been the lives of the mothers I have described.

</p>

<a name="50321-20_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>There is a great deal more that disturbs me. The need for a national identity register in the form prescribed by the Bill cannot be justified. I have heard the words of the Minister, but do Her Majesty&#039;s Government really believe that the national interest purposes listed in Clause 1(4) will be best served in this way? Will any more crime, immigration or employment infringements or benefit fraud be prevented because the perpetrators are registered and have ID cards? I believe not. We have banned small arms and have seen an increase in crime involving these weapons. Will the possession of an ID card prevent a determined criminal committing a crime? Such is the sophistication of computer hackers and forgers that they will always be, as they are now, one step ahead of us.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>I am told that the Information Commissioner has warned that we are sleepwalking into a surveillance state. As a farmer, I am aware of the various means of providing traceability for livestock. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, left out Defra. It knows all about tracing people. Why do we not have Defra draft the Bill? It also knows about farmers who get around registering their animals. One means of tracing animals is by computer readable microchips. I wonder whether noble Lords are aware that nightclubs in Spain, Holland, and now, I believe, Glasgow are offering to microchip their clients so that their bar bills can be paid directly from their bank accounts without the need for cash or credit cards. Perhaps, in the future, we will all be &quot;chipped&quot; at birth.
</p>

<a name="50321-20_para22"></a>

<a name="50321-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, first, I apologise for leaving the Chamber during one or two earlier Back-Bench speeches. Someone wanted urgently to speak to me.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>I give the Bill my basic support. Indeed, it may help simplify the myriad requests for people to prove their identity. I have two points. The first is to make a suggestion and the other is to ask my noble friend to put on the record what I think is the position on certain consequences of Clause 31.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>In her opening remarks my noble friend referred to the &quot;constructive&quot; response of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. I too pay tribute to its work and the thought it gave to its response. I should like to refer to one point where the JCWI has concerns. One consequence of the Bill&#151;indeed would it be right to say one of its purposes?&#151;will be the flushing out of people who do not legally belong here. The question arises whether some people, who have been here in this country for donkey&#039;s years&#151;I shall not define <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_85"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 85</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&quot;donkey&#039;s years&quot; for the moment, although perhaps in the Bill there should be a definition&#151;who technically should not be here, should be the subject of an amnesty. That is the thesis of part of the paper submitted by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. I should like to draw heavily on it.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>The JCWI draws attention to the specific problems arising out of attempts to define the term &quot;foreign national&quot;. First, there are those who are not British citizens but who are lawfully settled in the UK, some with the right of abode. This group will fall under the early compulsory registration scheme. They are for all purposes no different from British citizens in material respects. There is no obvious justification to compel this group to undergo compulsory registration before British citizens.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>Secondly, there are those with long residence in the UK; some have lawful residence, others do not. Thirdly, there is a group of foreign nationals who do not have a right to reside in the UK&#151;overstayers; for example, students who have completed their courses and remained without leave&#151;but who have been in the UK for a number of years. They have made their homes here. This group is largely benign, industrious, tax-paying, often undertakes lower-paid work, if necessary, has contributed in different ways to the community and has a stake-hold in society. Compulsory registration, boasting an inclusive approach could&#151;indeed the JCWI says &quot;will&quot;&#151;alienate and exclude this group further.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>Fourthly, this group has limited opportunity to regularise its position under the Immigration Rules but fears to do so because there is no guarantee that it will obtain regularisation prematurely or otherwise. Experience shows that its fears are well founded, because the Immigration Rules confer no entitlement on the group to indefinite leave to remain. Indefinite leave to remain is, at best, a matter of discretion. The conditions for indefinite leave to remain are difficult to meet. The position of this group in the UK will become untenable. To meet the problem created by the introduction of a compulsory registration scheme, the Government may, and, as I advocate, should, announce some amnesty to bring it into the inclusive scheme.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>I do not totally follow my noble friend Lord Giddens. It is not a question just of establishing someone&#039;s identity. That point was well made, in different ways, about the separate issue of whether Lloyds Bank needs to supplement what it seeks from utility bills and so on. The scheme is not to do with establishing identity, as my noble friend Lord Giddens said; it is what follows from establishing that identity; namely, that someone has no proper right to be here or &quot;no proper papers&quot;, to use a phrase that has connotations.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>It is true that some people who have not been here long will have to consider their position and spend the next three years doing so. Let us take as an example someone who has been here for 10 or 15 years. Perhaps some of us know such a person&#151;young or old, at work or retired. They may be running a successful <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_86"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 86</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

business&#151;not that those people should be in a separate category, but there is a whole range. Would it not be possible to go along in some way with the advice of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants in considering criteria for those who could be covered by an amnesty in the way that I have suggested?
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>I try to visualise the trauma that many such people, long resident here, are already going through and will continue to go through, if they cannot get an identity card. Perhaps the Minister will tell me if I am wrong, but those people will feel that they have the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. So some clarity on an amnesty would be highly desirable. I do not expect a positive response on this point from my noble friend today, or even a sympathetic response, but&#151;who knows?&#151;if the election goes the right way and this Bill is not already on the statute book, a limited amnesty, based on clear, published criteria, would provide great reassurance to a good many people.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>My second point relates to Clause 31. The TUC is concerned that Clause 31 could raise the possibility of criminal sanctions being applied against people who lawfully took part in industrial action. Clause 31 creates criminal offences relating to tampering with the national identity register that are punishable with imprisonment for up to 10 years. I would like the position to be put on the record.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>The clause suggests that anyone whose job involves maintenance of the register, accessing or retrieving information, or facilitating access to or retrieval of information from the register could be committing an offence by participating in otherwise lawful industrial action. Clause 31(3) makes it clear that the offence covers conduct which,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;makes it more difficult or impossible for such information to be retrieved in a legible form from a computer on which it is stored . . . or contributes to making that more difficult or impossible&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>Clearly, industrial action by civil servants and others with responsibility for administering the register, on the face of it, could be covered by that provision. I have given notice to the Minister of that point, and I seek clarification, on the record, that that interpretation, which is causing concern, is not reasonable, and that civil servants and others who are involved with the administration of the scheme would not be made liable, should their industrial action make it difficult or impossible for information to be retrieved, as described in Clause 31(3).

<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>When I was a member of the Labour Party&#151;I was a member for more than 50 years before I was expelled&#151;I was always brought up to believe that ID cards and central registers were the tools of dictators and racists. Now it appears that that has all changed. I also associated with people who were proud to be called libertarians. I always have been and am still proud to be called a libertarian, because without such people we would not have any liberties in this country. They have always been under attack from one source or another. So let me declare again that I am proud to be a libertarian.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>As we have heard, this Bill had its genesis in the prevention of terrorism, and that is what I want to concentrate on. I have to say that I am completely and utterly opposed to the Bill. It is not necessary to deal with terrorism. Outrages have taken place in other countries where ID cards are in use, such as in Spain, so ID cards have not prevented acts of terrorism taking place. Indeed, is it not odd that in this country, which does not have identity cards, we were able easily to arrest last Saturday a suspect in Slough on a Spanish extradition warrant? We did not need ID cards to do that. It was done efficiently and the court case is being heard today.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>I fear that the drive to introduce ID cards has more to do with authoritarianism than with the prevention of terrorism. It follows inroads into the right to trial by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_88"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

jury; the attack on habeas corpus; the imposition of control orders and house arrest without reasons being given, and we now understand that the making of such orders is to be kept secret from the general public; undermining free speech by measures such as the incitement to religious hatred, the Bill for which is now before us; reversal of the presumption of innocence in some cases; the welter of new criminal offences over the past decade, and the reduction of the role of Parliament through ill-thought-out legislation rushed through the House of Commons by means of restrictive guillotines. We have done without ID cards and a national register for hundreds of years, and have dealt with considerable previous terrorist threats without them, and we can do so now.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>It used to be the case that everyone believed that government was there to serve the people, but the new Jacobinism&#151;if I can call it that&#151;is turning that dictum on its head and sees people as the creatures and servants of the state. Osama bin Laden must be laughing his head off as he sees our Government using him as a bogeyman to undermine our traditional freedoms and democratic rights on the pretext that it is the only way to keep our people safe from terrorism. Yet even as those traditional individual rights and freedoms are being whittled away here in the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have the temerity to lecture other countries on the subject of democracy.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>But there are indeed grave doubts about whether the ID card system can work. We have heard about them today. Such a huge undertaking has never before been attempted. The technology has not been tried and tested. Indeed, I understand that it does not exist at present. We are all aware of the great Child Support Agency debacle, and surely that ought to give pause to those seeking to impose this legislation on the people of this country. Together with the late Lord Russell and others, I was one of those who spent the watches of the night in this Chamber warning the Government, a Tory government, about the dangers and the unsuitability of the child support organisation. But they would not listen, the Bill went through, and now it is a disaster and a catastrophe. So I wish that governments would listen to noble Lords in this Chamber rather than carry on in the same old way, in accordance with their original thinking.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>Again, biometrics have been mentioned, but they have never been used on this scale before and their use in this way could lead to miscarriages of justice. The Government also cite in support of these proposals that they will help to deal with crimes other than terrorism. However, the marvellous report by the London School of Economics shows that in a range of countries without ID cards, crime is on a downward trend, whereas in countries with them, the trend is upwards. So ID cards do not necessarily help to deal with crime.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>Many people in Britain seem not to have woken up to the implications of a national register and ID cards. The penalties for non-compliance with ministerial orders are large and could involve imprisonment, while swathes of information about individuals will be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_89"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 89</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

made available not only to a host of public authorities, but perhaps also to private firms and institutions. The cost estimates are likely to escalate, some say by a factor of three. That will impose a much higher ID card charge than the &#163;35 to &#163;40 which is presently envisaged.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>We are being told that ID cards will not be made compulsory for the present, but that is the clear intention in the medium or long term, and if the Home Secretary is to be believed, they are to be tied in with a European Union ID card. I quote now from the Home Secretary&#039;s speech to the EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers made on 24 February in Brussels, as reported in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;&#039;An effective identity card system would make it easier for the Government to drop border controls with the rest of Europe&#039;, Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary, said in Brussels yesterday . . . &#039;The introduction of ID cards could change the situation 15 . . . 20 years down the line&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>So it is clear that the ID card system has a connection with the European Union. In fact, it seems that we are on course for an EU ID card, which no doubt would have to be carried at all times. Presumably, all the information about British people contained on those cards would be made available to public and perhaps private bodies in all the EU countries. That ties in with the view of the EU police chiefs task force, which agreed in October 2001 that the EU should speed up the universal adoption of ID cards. I should like to know whether that is proceeding. It seems evident that the Bill is a step on the road to a compulsory EU ID card, and not confined to the UK.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>But there really is no need for ID cards to fight terrorism and crime. The considerable resources and effort needed to introduce and manage the system would be far better used in improving the finance, manpower and efficiency of our security service and police forces, and in having policemen spend 90 per cent of their time on observation, patrolling, investigation and surveillance rather than, as they do at present, spending 90 per cent of their time doing office work and menial tasks in police stations. Surely this would be more fruitful and effective than imposing an alien and sinister ID system that will in any event turn into an administrative nightmare.
</p>

<a name="50321-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>I am glad that the Bill is unlikely to make any further progress if a general election is to be held on 5 May, and I implore the Government to think long and hard before introducing it again in the new Parliament.

The noble Countess, Lady Mar, asked what the 80 per cent of people who now believe that identity cards are okay would think if they knew what the Government were going to do with the information. I believe those people would say that was absolutely okay. Most people with whom I am in contact believe that identity cards are very important, and that, as my noble friend Lady Gibson said, they have nothing to fear from whatever information about them is available on record.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>I should like noble Lords to take a moment to look around the Chamber. We are all wearing our identity badges, or should be. All our staff&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="50321-22_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I appreciate that the noble Baroness would not know that there is no offence if we do not wear our identity badges within the Chamber as they interfere with overhead cameras. I say that in defence not only of myself but of others. However, I am sure that we appreciate the noble Baroness&#039;s general point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="50321-22_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Wall of New Barnet: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for those comments. I noticed that she removed her identity badge when she entered the Chamber. I now know that I ought not to wear mine regularly in the Chamber.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>I was going on to say that all the staff who look after us, the police who protect us, our researchers who facilitate these speeches, and our families who visit us here regularly, not only have ID badges but wear them round their necks. Many even wear them as a badge of honour, as I do. However, in future I shall remember what was said about wearing passes in the Chamber.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>I wonder whether noble Lords are aware of the documentation that a researcher who wishes to work here has to complete to apply for a pass. Very much the same information as would be required for ID cards under the Bill would have to be provided by researchers. Obviously, they would have to state their name, their surname, previous surnames, nationality and any previous nationalities that they may have held. Applicants would be asked about their families, their history, any criminal convictions that they might have incurred and would be asked to provide much security information. I believe that all of us in this Chamber would say, &quot;and rightly so&quot;. However, why are we different from anyone else in that regard?
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>I understand that the main opposition to this scheme concerns the database which will manage the information. The &quot;NO2ID&quot; campaign, of which the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, indicated he is a member, states that the national identity register will control your identity. It will decide who you are. Well, I know who I am and I am not convinced that the Government knowing my name, my address, the date and place of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_91"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 91</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

my birth and other such information will change that. Indeed, after all, Waitrose probably knows as much about me as anyone in this Chamber. In the future we shall have the opportunity to examine and assess the merits of any more information that is requested by the Government for inclusion on the ID card.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>I would like to end by saying that we use methods of ID in every environment in the country from banking, to driving, to flying. If the introduction of this scheme can not only assist us in our day-to-day lives, but also protect us, I would not question its introduction, and neither, I think, would the 80 per cent of people in favour of it. I understand the concerns of the Opposition but we cannot have our cake and eat it.

<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="50321-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Young of Norwood Green: </b>   My Lords, I applaud the Government for taking what I consider to be a sensible and necessary approach on this matter. Like my noble friend Lady Wall I believe that there is a certain irony in having this debate in this Chamber when we know that some individuals do not just remove their identity badges, or security passes, when they enter the Chamber but refuse to wear them at all. They do not seem to understand the basic purpose of the passes.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>I share with all noble Lords the view that no one wants unnecessary intrusion or government intervention in their lives. That takes us back to the issue which we debated for 32&#189; hours&#151;that is, the balance of rights and responsibilities, which was analysed by my noble friend Lord Giddens. At this point I too should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond, on a superb maiden speech. I liked the analysis that he made and, like the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, I agreed with many of the conclusions of the maiden speech.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>Is there a need to change? That is the primary question which we have to ask ourselves. I wish to refer to three aspects of the matter. First, as the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said, we live in a global society with huge movements of people and populations. That will not change&#151;it will increase&#151;and puts pressure upon the organisation of our society. Secondly, identity theft is no longer something about which one reads as a theory and as something that may or may not happen. It has doubled over a recent period of time. It represents a real and serious threat to individuals, to banks, and in terms of benefit and passport fraud. Thirdly, the illegal traffic in human beings has resulted in some exploited cockle pickers losing their lives in Morecambe Bay and in unknown numbers of women often being held in captivity for the purposes of prostitution.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>Terrorism and illegal immigration are other factors with which we have to deal and which I believe merit a change in the way in which we organise identification in our society. What exists at the moment? Passports are easily forged. There is a real industry in forged and fraudulent passports. The same could be said of a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_92"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 92</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

number of other means of identification whether they comprise driving licences or credit cards. We have a system at the moment that is certainly less than perfect.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said that we would be forced or coerced to register. Well, we are forced or coerced to register for a national insurance number when we start employment, and no one seems to think that is an unwarranted intrusion on civil liberties. I do not understand the use of that kind of terminology, although I welcome the debate. She then asserted that the cost of identity cards will be &#163;5.5 billion and will rise to &#163;10 billion, without a shred of evidence to support her claim.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="50321-22_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, if the noble Lord considered a little more of my speech, I was saying that those figures have been put forward variously. We have not heard from the Government a substantiation of what the costs will be for specific parts of the scheme. Of course I appreciate, as I am sure does the noble Lord from the way in which his peroration is developing, that the costs will depend on how the scheme works. The Government have not yet told us what the scheme fee will be or how it will work. I was being a little more pedantic than the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="50321-22_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Young of Norwood Green: </b>   Not a lot, my Lords. I do not think that the use of the word &quot;variously&quot; counts as a conclusive proof. The Government have started, although not finished, the analysis in giving us some idea of costs and of the best estimate for a combined passport and identity package and other cost evaluations. We have not seen the full scope of that evidence. Maybe it is not all available at the moment, but it is not right to quote figures of &#163;5.5 billion leading to &#163;10 billion. That does not help the debate, although it is realistic to challenge the Government to produce the most adequate figures that they can.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, said that the Bill will not help at all in relation to terrorism and immigration and that nothing is foolproof. I certainly agree with his last assertion that nothing is foolproof, but I do not see how he can assert as a fact that it will not help at all with either illegal immigration or terrorism. It will play its part, but it will not be a panacea as some people have said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="50321-22_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Lord give way? That was the starting point when David Blunkett came up with the suggestion of introducing ID cards. One cannot dispute that, and that is what I was saying in my speech.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="50321-22_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Young of Norwood Green: </b>   My Lords, it may have been, but it is not the only reason, and we have heard that from the Minister. It is not the only reason that I have quoted. I was merely picking up on the point that it is wrong to say that it will not play any part at all.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>I also do not understand how we can say that it will conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights, when 21 out of 25 countries in the European <br>&nbsp;<br>

Union already have identity cards. It seems to me that if that really was the situation, by now someone would have attempted to raise it. I agree with my noble friend Lady Gibson when she said that we would require safeguards to ensure that we deal with all immigrants in a reasonable and fair way.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>I also share the concern about the question of the technology, and the need to ensure that it is robust and that we do not face the huge cost over-runs that some introductions of new technology have caused to occur. I do not share the view of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, who seems to feel that the Government have a hidden agenda. The Government have made it perfectly clear that yes, there will be a compulsion to register but not a compulsion to carry the ID card. That is clear, and it currently exists in the Bill. The hidden agenda seems to be the centralised register, which the noble Earl, Lord Errol, said that people do not understand. That is being a bit patronising; surely people understand. We have a system of passports; there is a centralised register. If we have a centralised system, there will be a centralised register. People do understand that, and they understand what is happening to the society in which we live.
</p>

<a name="50321-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>It is said that ownership of identity would be taken from our hands to those of the state. Actually, that ignores that ownership of identity is being taken from some people&#039;s hands to another pair of illegal hands. That concerns people greatly these days. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, seems to fear that we will have to use it every time we go to Tesco or do any other small-scale transaction. Frankly, I doubt it. Anyway, he went on to analyse a lot of worst-case scenarios. If you listened to the debate that was taking place today, you would imagine that no IT system was working in this country. There are many that do work very well indeed, which is not to say that we have not had problems, but we should not extrapolate to the point where somehow we are describing technology as though it is not a benefit to society any longer.

<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>We all understand that there are many IT projects out there right now. Some work, some do not. What matters fundamentally about this project, however, is that it is unique, and it takes the technological barriers over and beyond hurdles that have yet to be crossed.

I am sure that will be a challenge. However, to hear the caricatures of technological systems as mostly failing and not working, we might imagine that we had a society that was in a permanent state of collapse. That is far from the case. I am making a plea that we get this in proportion. It will be a challenge, but one we can meet.

<a name="50321-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>Many more comments were made about the scale of systems and the amount of information, and whether this will benefit the public. This last was a point made by a number of people, including the noble Countess, Lady Mar. They asked whether we will get function creep, and whether the system would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Of course it will be. How we can compare the situation we face today with that when Churchill presided over the abolition of identity cards after the war escapes me. We are not in that kind of society. Would that we were, in which case I doubt we would be having this debate today.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>I would like to reassure my noble friend that I do not think he is sinister at all. Mind you, I do not think he is right, either. When I was a young socialist, I am not sure that I saw ID cards as the tool of dictators and racists&#151;although I suppose it is possible that they could have been used in those ways&#151;and I certainly do not in today&#039;s circumstances. Again, I emphasise the point made by the Government in the Bill, that the compulsion will be to register and not to carry.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>In this debate, we have to take into account today&#039;s circumstances and the requirements of today&#039;s society. We have the capacity within this Bill to balance rights and responsibilities to benefit us all.

<a name="50321-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>For a moment I was completely confused. I thought I had lost my place in the speakers&#039; list and that the Government were delivering their official response in the form of the noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green&#151;but I am sure the Minister will not let us get off so easily, and will come back with a robust rebuttal to our views.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>We welcome the Minister&#039;s statement on the Bill. We also welcome the thought-provoking speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmonds, delivered with such direct experience of some of the issues when breakdowns of law and order take place. It was a pleasure to listen to him.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>In setting out her stall, the Minister has added to existing confusion on the aims of the Bill. In addition to the aims set out in the Bill, she assures us that the creation of this type of ID card and register will enable the state to put a halt to all sorts of nefarious activity. She said biometric data will solve the problem of a range of other crimes.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>On the other hand, we are told we are doing this essentially to comply with international obligations, such as those imposed by the US on new passports from next year. She tells us that some 21 out of 25 EU members already have ID card schemes, so the implication is that it is merely a harmonising measure, and we are just coming into conformity with the rest of Europe. I shall touch on that when I come to the noble Lord, Lord Young, as well.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_95"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 95</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>My noble friend Baroness Ludford asked the Minister to reassure us that the Government were not undertaking this project in order to comply with EU or US requirements. The fact is that the US is implementing a biometric passport of its own. It will only require a digital photograph on a chip in a passport, and will not use a centralised register or database. So, lest we think that this is being imposed on us by international obligations, we should get that straight.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>In Clause 1, we turn to the claim that the scheme will enhance national security and combat organised crime and terrorism. The only serious research in this area was undertaken in 2004 by Privacy International, who are quoted extensively in the report referred to by so many noble Lords, the LSE <i>Identity Project Interim Report</i>. They found no evidence to support the claim that ID cards combat terrorism. I quote a short part of that aspect of their report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;Terrorists have traditionally moved across borders using tourist visas (such as those who were involved in the US terrorist attacks), or they are domiciled and are equipped with legitimate identification cards&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>that is, they have lived for some time in the country where they intend to operate. Those were the ones who carried out the Madrid bombings. The report continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>&quot;Of the 25 countries that have been most adversely affected by terrorism since 1986, eighty per cent have national identity cards, one third of which incorporate biometrics. This research was unable to uncover any instance where the presence of an identity card system in those countries was seen as a significant deterrent to terrorist activity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>Then we turn to the prevention and detection of crime. According to police in most economically developed countries, the major problem in combating crime is not lack of identification procedures&#151;ID cards or something similar&#151;but difficulties in the gathering of evidence and bringing about a prosecution.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>Several other aspects of the Bill cause concern. It brings about enabling legislation. It is written with a broad brush, with the detail left to the Home Secretary to bring forth in secondary legislation. While we accept the need for processes to be worked out in more detail, possibly at a separate stage, the range of powers to be dealt with later gives rise to concerns that relate to our civil liberties and human rights. We cannot accept that such a change to the relationship between the citizen and the state can be left to secondary legislation, which would be unamendable. We will therefore seek that the power to amend regulations be in the Bill. We are also concerned about the breadth of information that can be held and the element of compulsion that will be used.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>The Minister graciously mentioned the work of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As I am its only member speaking in the debate, I crave the House&#039;s indulgence for a few minutes to set out some of its many concerns. The JCHR put 14 broad but detailed and specific questions to the Home Secretary, which were responded to in some form or other. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_96"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Nevertheless, it has chosen to highlight that its concerns continue. Page 3 of the fourth progress report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;The committee notes the Government&#039;s argument that the Bill is enabling legislation, and . . . points out that it has repeatedly stressed the importance, where legislation intrudes on rights protected by Article 8 ECHR (right to respect for private and family life), for safeguards to be contained on the face of primary legislation . . . The Committee maintains its concerns at the scale of personal information which may be held on the National Identity Register under clause 1 of the Bill, in particular that held under clause 1(5)(h) and Schedule 1 paragraph 9 . . . The Committee concludes that the retention of this high level of information may not be sufficiently targeted at addressing the aims set out in clause 1(3) to ensure proportionate interference with Article 8 rights&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>I shall not go on and on, but have one final point. The report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;Under clause 4 of the Bill, where a document, such as a passport, is designated by the Secretary of State . . . The Committee considers that the effectively compulsory registration of personal information, dependent on application for a designated document, gives rise to a risk of disproportionate interference with Article 8 rights&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>The Minister confirmed that the powers set out in Clause 6 are to become compulsory. That is worrying, as it allows for a move to compulsory registration, for either all or particular groups. The details of a move to compulsory registration are not yet known to us, but the Home Secretary has confirmed that non-EEA third-country nationals might be required to register under Clause 6. What effect would that have on certain elements of the community? I come from the Muslim community, and know of the level of concern within it. Would the relatives of Muslims, who had recently arrived here under family reunion plans, be required to register compulsorily while their son or daughter&#151;the citizen&#151;would not?
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>Overall, the amount of personal information on the register and the wide range of powers for which it might be applied&#151;particularly where those do not relate to immigration controls&#151;create the impression that Clause 6 would not comply with convention rights. Indeed, it would probably be open to challenge under the Human Rights Act from the outset.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>It has been a wide-ranging debate with interesting views put from all sides. I found myself in the rare position, like the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, of agreeing with the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, who pointed out that liberty seeks to limit the freedoms of the few to expand the freedom of the many. He is quite right. The problem with this Government&#039;s approach is that they seek to limit the freedom of the many to deal with the problems caused by the few. They do not expand the freedom of the many&#151;that, whatever else it may be, is not what New Labour is about.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, quite rightly warned of the problems with the central register and many other technical aspects of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has the ability to blind us with his technical knowledge, but he raised some real concerns about over-reliance on biometrics, in particular on the dangers of a centralised system. The noble Lord, Lord   Lea of Crondall, spoke so eloquently of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_97"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 97</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

particular problems of those many non-citizens who contribute so much to this society, and we endorse his views.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, made strong points on the central purposes of the Bill, and the noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green, queried how any of the provisions in the Bill could possibly fall foul of the European Convention on Human Rights&#151;I commend the fourth progress report to him. This particular Bill will contravene Article 8, and Article 14 when read in conjunction with Article 8(2). From the way it is drafted, he queried why the 21 countries in the EU that have ID cards were not taken to the European Court of Human Rights. The answer is simple: they do not have this Bill. This is an authoritarian Bill which is nothing like many of the schemes that operate in other EU countries.
</p>

<a name="50321-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>Conscious of the time, we come to the costs variously put at &#163;3 billion, &#163;5.5 billion&#151;that is the Government&#039;s figure at the moment&#151;and rising. We have heard today of costs as high as &#163;10 billion&#151;

<a name="50321-24_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I hesitate to rise, but I have heard this figure of &#163;5.5 billion on so many occasions. That may be the figure of Her Majesty&#039;s loyal Opposition, but it is not the Government&#039;s.
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="50321-24_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Falkner of Margravine: </b>   My Lords, because we know so little of the detail of the way that the processes and technology will work, and the requirement for the outsourcing of the technology, we must be somewhat sceptical of whatever figures are provided. We know from our experience that the National Health Service computer system was meant to cost billions in single figures, and at last estimate has cost &#163;26 billion. If the figure of &#163;5.5 billion is not a government figure, we would be delighted to hear from the Government what they think the figure will be, so that we can test what the coverage and outlay of the provisions will be against it.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>We understand that most of the bill for the cost of the scheme will be picked up by the citizen, who will be obliged by the state under powers of compulsion to fork out for the ID card. In the various opinion polls cited by the Government, was the question put to people that they would have to pay something to the tune of &#163;85 per head for each ID card? Think of the figure when it applies across a large family. When the details of similar schemes were put to people in Australia and New Zealand, the resounding &quot;Yes&quot; that had been there before turned to a deafening &quot;No&quot;. We suggest that something similar might happen here if the details of the scheme get out.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>In conclusion, I echo the sentiment of my noble friend Lord Dholakia when he wonders why we are seeing this authoritarian piece of unworkable and expensive law come down to our Chamber in the last few days before we break up and the country goes to the polls.

legislation which would meet all our concerns to combat terrorism, save life and liberty, and leave the citizen in his rightful relationship with the state.

<a name="50321-24_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   My Lords, I rise to speak from these Benches as we come towards the end of this Second Reading debate. We have had an important and interesting discussion on this topic and I hope that it has been useful for the Government to learn a little more about how this House feels about the controversial issue of identity cards. We have heard a wide range of views&#151;from real enthusiasm to outright hostility&#151;on the Bill that has been presented to your Lordships&#039; House today.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>My first, and very pleasant, task is to add my warm    congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond. His wide experience and knowledge of the impact of terrorist activity will certainly add to the quality of further debate on the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>I remember as a very small child in 1939 having a silver bracelet with the number QEJR/176/4&#151;please note that it was &quot;stroke 4&quot;; forward slash had not been invented in those days&#151;engraved on it. It never came off my wrist until the war was over, and I must admit that it did not appear to do me any harm. But what a different world we live in 65 years later.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>I begin by echoing the words of my noble friend Lady Anelay, who opened this Second Reading debate on behalf of the Opposition. We realise that the Home Secretary inherited a difficult job, and I have to admit that he also inherited a difficult piece of legislation.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>The recent extraordinary events in this Chamber and in the other place during the passage of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill earlier this month show that we recognise that the world is a very different place from the one before 11 September. The change that that awful event brought means that we on these Benches are now prepared to consider the need to take identity cards seriously and to listen to the Government&#039;s reasons for putting forward such fundamental changes.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>As we have already heard today, the Commons did not have much of an opportunity to scrutinise this Bill when it was in another place. As usual, their debates were subject to guillotine Motions and, consequently, the Bill has come to this House in great need of detailed consideration and proper scrutiny. As we have heard, the Bill establishes the framework for introducing identity cards to this country. It is vital for us to consider that framework and to get it right. So there is an enormous amount of work to be done as the Bill progresses through this House.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>The position of the Opposition has been made clear by my noble friend Lady Anelay, but I would like to make my contribution to the debate by outlining again to the Government our position on the Bill. We feel that the Government should be able to meet those five reasonable tests before we in this House and my honourable colleagues in the other place pass the Bill. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_99"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 99</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Let us be in no doubt&#151;all the tests are important and they are all critical to the judgment of these Benches on the Bill as a whole.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>First, we would like the Government to make completely clear the specific purpose for which the ID cards they are proposing are being brought forward. There have been conflicting reports in the media and from the government Benches on this point, and we would like the House to be told once and for all what these ID cards are really for. If we do not know the purpose of the cards, how can we judge whether the need for them is great? How can we tell that the mischief they are aimed at is likely to be solved by the introduction of this legislation? In essence, we would like to know why the Government are seeking to introduce this legislation and why it has been drafted in this particular way.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>Secondly, we would like to know about the technology aspect of the cards. It is true to say that in this country we have problems with the forgery of documents such as passports and that the crime of identity theft is on the increase. Can the Government assure us that the system which they propose to use to implement the cards and the way in which they will protect the data stored on them will be robust enough to stand up to such problems? How will the Government protect against such fraud, forgery and identity theft? How will they ensure that someone will not be able to breach the security of the computer which holds all the data?
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>As we have heard in this debate, biometric technology is fallible, and we need to be aware of what might go wrong with the scheme so that we can safeguard it as much as possible.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>Thirdly, we would like the Government to place on the record whether they have in place the organisation necessary to introduce the scheme. In the other place the Home Secretary stated that this is a project that would take years to implement and is not something that can be rushed. We on these Benches accept that point entirely. However, we need to know that all the time we are moving forward on this enormous undertaking we are moving in the right direction. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s comments on this point.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>Fourthly, and I feel rather inevitably, we come to the issue of cost. The Government have consistently shifted their ground on how much the scheme will cost. Will the Minister indicate the current thinking? While we realise that it will cost money to make the scheme safe and effective we have no desire to sign a blank cheque on the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>We also have the question in the back of our minds: would the money be better spent elsewhere? If the Government want to stop illegal immigration, should we not spend the money on improving security at our ports, for instance?
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>Finally, we have concerns regarding civil liberties. The Bill proposes measures that will impact on every citizen of this country. The Government will gather and hold information on millions of people and we need to ensure that that is done correctly and that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_100"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 100</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

public have confidence in the system that the Government are running. Only when those five criteria are satisfied can we have confidence in the proposed Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>I as QEJR/176/4 and my colleagues look forward to examining the issues as we move to the next stage.
<a name="time_28"></a>
<a name="50321-24_time1"></a><h5></h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="50321-24_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, we have had a truly fascinating debate with some extremely fine speeches. I thought that initially I would try to list them, but there was real competition. Would I allude to the passion of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas?
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>Or what about the commitment and passion of the noble Countess, Lady Mar, and my noble friend Lord Stoddart; the erudition of my noble friend Lord Giddens; and the good sense of my noble friends Lady Gibson of Market Rasen, Lord Lea, Lady Wall and Lord Young&#151;who was accused by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, of stealing my somewhat weary position at this Dispatch Box? I assure her that my noble friend did not quite do that, but I would be happy for him to have my space.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>There was also a spirited exposition by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, of the liberal cause. Rarely have I heard such political speeches in your Lordships&#039; House. Then we had the calm persistence, with her usual charm, of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, followed by the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe. We will always try to remember her number as we have seen it before.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>So where are we? All that passion and erudition demonstrates that this is an issue of real importance to the House, and indeed to this country, and there is a passion to get it right, whichever side of the debate one falls. That is something that we must applaud. We welcome the depth and breadth of the scrutiny that will be given to the Bill in this House, because this is a debate that we must have in a way that will benefit our country. It is important that we acknowledge the enormity of the task with which we are all faced.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>This piece of legislation, whatever else one can say of it, is certainly not a rushed piece of legislation. The plans for identity cards have already been subject to considerable public consultation and debate over the past three years. A six-month public consultation exercise started in July 2002, with the publication of the entitlement cards and identify fraud consultation paper. A further consultation on the draft Identity Cards Bill started in April 2004. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked for such a consultation, so I say to him, with a degree of gentleness, that we have had it. An inquiry by the Home Affairs Select Committee started in 2003 and concluded in October 2004, following pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill. So noble Lords may say many things, but not that this is a rushed piece of legislation. The Identity Cards Bill was introduced in another place on 29 November last year and, with a small number of amendments&#151;only 19 government amendments&#151;has now reached this House.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_101"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 101</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-24_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>I also remind noble Lords that I do not accept the argument that this legislation radically changes the relationship between the state and the individual. I cannot accept that argument because the relationship between the state and the individual did not change in 1837 when it was made compulsory for every birth in England and Wales to be registered and recorded nationally, nor when similar provisions were introduced at a later date in Scotland and Ireland.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, suggested that we need to pilot biometric identity cards. I hope that noble Lords remember that I said earlier that we have already carried out a biometric enrolment pilot involving 10,000 people enrolling face, finger and iris biometrics. A report on that trial will be published in due course.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>My noble friend Lord Giddens referred to the report by the London School of Economics that was published today. Like the noble Lord, I only saw the report just before this debate started. I can reassure the House, and my noble friend, that the Government will look at it very carefully. However, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that we have already looked in some detail at that matter, as I described.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>I shall clarify some misconceptions once again. During the debate, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, talked about tax and finance records being disclosed on the bus. The register can contain only the information specified in Schedule 1. It will not contain tax or finance records, nor will it be of any use to the noble Lord on the bus until he is eligible for free travel on account of his age. I understand that that may be some time yet.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>The noble Countess, Lady Mar, was concerned about entries on the database relating to parents alleged to have injured children. The national identity register can contain only the information referred to in Schedule 1. It does not, and cannot, contain medical or criminal records, nor allegations of abuse. It will not be linked to the children&#039;s database referred to by the noble Countess.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>As to Clause 2(5) concerning the discretion of the Secretary of State to modify incorrect data, it is true that this clause does not make it obligatory to correct inaccurate or incomplete entries. However, the right to rectification under the Data Protection Act will apply. If the Secretary of State refuses to exercise his power to modify an entry, the data subject can apply to the civil courts for an order under Section 14 of the Data Protection Act to rectify the entry.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>The short answer to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, about whether the Data Protection Act applies, is, &quot;Yes&quot;, and all its works too. That robust instrument is there. None of the rights and duties is disapplied by the Bill. They will apply, subject only to the normal qualifications and exemptions in the Data Protection Act.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, questioned the title of the Bill. It is right that the national identity register is at the heart of the scheme, as is made clear in the title <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_102"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 102</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the Bill. However, for the majority of people it is about identity cards. This is not only the clearest way of stating it, but the most appropriate title for the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>I shall clarify the issue in relation to the ICAO. I was wounded at the thought that I might somehow have added to the opaqueness of the Bill. Let me try to clarify the subject and allow a little light to fall on it. The existing ICAO standard for passport biometrics is for a mandatory facial biometric. However, fingerprint and iris image biometrics are being considered by the EU as well as the ICAO as optional biometrics for passports.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>In response to the queries of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, I refer to paragraph 70 of the impact assessment. Examples of the areas in which public services will benefit from ID card schemes include administration, social security benefits, improving eligibility checks for free non-emergency NHS treatment, speeding up and improving the accuracy of criminal records bureaux, higher education, and general administration of services. There will be a broad spectrum of benefits.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>The noble Lord asked whether people would need proof of address. The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, also raised the issue. To establish both identity and entitlement, applicants will be asked to provide their current address and a history of addresses. That is most likely to be over the past six years unless there are particular reasons for needing more information; for instance, if someone has lived abroad. The addresses will be checked during the footprint check, and if discrepancies are identified, they will be discussed at the meeting. An inability to provide proof of an address will not prevent people being registered on the national identity register.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>Clause 43(10) gives power to make regulations on circumstances in which places can be regarded as an individual&#039;s address. That is likely to be used to allow students, travellers and homeless people to provide a contact address. Those issues are dealt with in relation to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50321-24_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>I turn to the thrust of the main points raised by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll. Biometrics are being developed around the world to improve the security and reliability of identity documents. British visitors to the United States are, as I said, already required to provide fingerprint biometrics on arrival. We have started to pilot the inclusion of fingerprint biometrics on United Kingdom visas, and the Home Office has introduced application registrations to asylum seekers which incorporate fingerprint biometrics. That has successfully demonstrated its utility in combating multiple asylum claims, including concurrent multiple claims that were being used as a route to making fraudulent benefit claims. We know that it works.

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="50321-25_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  My Lords, has the Minister heard the one about the Spanish bomb with the fingerprint on it which belonged to a United States <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_103"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 103</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

lawyer who had never been in Spain? It was definitely his fingerprint and he was gaoled for two weeks while it was ascertained.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="50321-25_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, if the noble Countess is suggesting that there are no circumstances ever when these things can be checked, that is clearly not true. It gives us a level of precision and ability to identify that we would not otherwise have. It is a tool, not a panacea, but it is extremely useful in the fight that we unfortunately have with dishonesty, fraud, terrorism and other matters.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of biometrics and whether they would be difficult to match. Most checks of a biometric will be against the holder&#039;s own identity and record. That is one rather than the only check that will be made. It is right, too, that we shall continue to have other cards that are issued for specific purposes. We are not suggesting that identity cards should replace library cards, for example. They are unlikely to do that. Individuals will use those cards in a way that is very helpful and productive as regards identity. That is the real import.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>I was asked whether the Bill will help in relation to crime and terrorism. The clear indication is that it will. That view was expressed by Sir John Stevens in November 2003 when he said that it is absolutely essential in the modern, dangerous world in which we live to have proper means of identification. Also, a team of officials went to Madrid to talk to the Spanish authorities about identity cards and their experience. The Spanish police stated that an identity card system makes life harder for terrorists and easier for the police. It hinders terrorist operations and makes it easier for the police to investigate and to track down terrorists.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>It was difficult to say exactly to what extent an identity card scheme contributes to preventing or frustrating terrorism because identity cards have been long-established in Spain, so there is no comparison. However, the police believe that ETA terrorists have been marginalised and driven to reside outside Spain because they can be identified. The Spanish police state that they have identified nearly all the terrorists involved in the Madrid bombings and that that was made significantly easier by their identity card scheme. Identity cards were also used to identify the victims of the bombings quickly. So it is not just useful in identifying villains, but it can be incredibly useful in identifying victims.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="50321-25_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Falkner of Margravine: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. Perhaps the Government&#039;s information is not quite as up to date as it might be. In the famous LSE report there is an extensive study of crime reported by police in EU countries which notes that Spain, which has ID cards, has the highest number of terrorist-related incidents in the whole of the EU&#151;1,218.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="50321-25_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Baroness says, but we have to listen to what <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_104"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 104</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the police say. They are saying clearly that without ID cards the situation would be even worse. Whether that helps us is a matter for noble Lords to consider.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>Perhaps I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. Imprisonment for failure to pay will not be an issue. There will be a civil penalty and civil penalties are recoverable in the civil courts, in debt recovery proceedings. Non-payment of debt cannot result in imprisonment. That was prohibited by the Debtors Act 1869 and is subject to certain extensions that perhaps are not entirely relevant here.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>To take up the point of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, on financial services, in July last year the Financial Services Authority (FSA) made it absolutely clear that, in its view, the Bill has utility. It said that in the long term, if identity cards were a more effective token of identity than anything currently available, they could contribute substantially to the fight against crime and reduce the cost to industry. Those matters are clear.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>It is also true that the widespread use of false documents is an essential aspect of terrorist activities. Al&#039;Qaeda&#039;s training manual requires its operatives to acquire false identities to hide their terrorist activities. We believe, therefore, that ID cards will make it harder for them to do that.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>I am conscious of the time. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, raised the issue of border controls and how they will be strengthened. We believe that ID cards will help to strengthen our borders against organised criminals for many of the reasons to which I have just alluded.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>The noble Lord also mentioned devolution and the difference that that will bring. As with passports or immigration documents the issue of identity cards will apply uniformly UK-wide. Therefore, the Bill covers matters that are reserved to the UK Parliament. However, the use of identity cards to access public services that are devolved will be matters for the devolved administrations. Some would say that the joy and the whole point of devolution is that those differences will be possible.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>I was asked about costs. The costs are &#163;186 million for set up over the first three years; &#163;415 million is the annual cost for biometric passports by 2008-09; &#163;85 million is the annual cost for ID cards; &#163;50 million is the annual cost for verification; and &#163;85 is the estimated cost of an ID card/passport package. Those remain our current and best estimates. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner of Margravine, will therefore forgive me, perhaps, for having risen to my feet at her &#163;5 billion, because that is significantly different from our figures.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>I should also tell your Lordships that the ICM survey showed that, when told the current proposals are for an ID card and passport package costing &#163;85, 68 per cent of those asked still thought it was a good idea. I am sorry to disappoint the noble Baroness, but we would say that was fairly robust.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>I join my voice to the congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond, on his maiden speech. It was a very fine speech indeed, not least because I agreed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_105"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with it. The noble Lord brings a wealth of experience to this debate, and we in this House have always benefited from that diversity of experience which enriches our knowledge and ability to understand issues which are not necessarily our normal ken or point of reference. I congratulate and welcome the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond, very much echoed what was said by my noble friend Lord Giddens. There are some who argue that having a national database of names and addresses and other identity information linked to biometric identity cards will be the start of some sort of slippery slope. I simply say that we do not believe that is the case. We agree with the assessment made by, and the wise words of, the noble Lord, Lord Ballyedmond, and the accurate analysis of my noble friend Lord Giddens.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>Conscious of the five points of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, that I have to deal with&#151;which I shall do incredibly swiftly&#151;I say to my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall and my noble friend Lady Gibson of Market Rasen that they are absolutely right in their analysis of Clause 31. I give them the assurance that they seek&#151;I shall do so telegraphically because of time, and shall be quite happy to outline it more fully later.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>Both the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, and the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, raised their five points. First, legislation must clearly define the purpose of the cards. The Identity Cards Bill sets out statutory purposes at Clause 1, and makes clear that identity cards are provided to individuals as security and a reliable method of proving identity; for helping to identify people securely in the public interest; to help prevent and detect crime; to help enforce controls on immigration and illegal working; to safeguard national security; and to deliver more efficient and effective public services.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>Secondly, is the technology sufficiently well developed and robust? We say that it is. The Government have always made clear that, before the final move to compulsion, there will be a rigorous evaluation to ensure that the technology is working and that public services have implemented the technology and business changes necessary to take full advantage of the scheme.
</p>

<a name="50321-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>Is the Home Office capable of making the cards work? The short answer is yes. The identity cards project is subject to regular scrutiny by the Office of Government Commerce, a gateway review process. The ID cards will be issued by a new agency, building on the existing UK Passport Agency. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, will remember the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_106"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column 106</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

history of the Passport Agency. Will she now rejoice with me at its total reformation and rehabilitation as an institution of some great excellence?
</p>




<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="50321-25_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I cannot resist the invitation to put on record my gratitude to the Passport Agency for allowing me to attend a meeting, arranged by my noble friend Lord Marlesford, about passport fraud.

<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>As to whether ID cards are the most cost effective way of tackling the problem they seek to address, many of the costs of introducing biometric identity cards will be needed in any event, with the move to introduce biometric passports.

Some of her points have been a little difficult to absorb. She seemed to imply that there was no need for her to read the LSE report because the Home Office had already considered matters in it. Did I hear her correctly? Will she explain why other government departments came to meetings when they were invited to by the LSE but the Home Office was either too busy or had other things to do and could not come?

Secondly, throughout the passage of the Bill it has been clear that the Home Office has been assiduous in trying to ensure that, wherever possible, we or our officials have attended meetings, engaged in consultation and given briefings. I do not know the history regarding the LSE but I can assure the noble Baroness that consultation is one thing on which we seem to have excelled on this Bill, as on so many.

</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="50321-26_spmin1"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees  (Lord Brougham and Vaux): </b>  Welcome to the eighth and, we hope, last day of the Charities Bill. There will be a Division in the Chamber, so whoever is speaking when it occurs will have to stop. We shall then return and play it by ear. If there is another Division, we will go off again.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="50321-26_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </b>   moved Amendment No. 183AA:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 45, line 30, leave out subsection (4).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>The noble Lord said: Once more into the breach, dear friends. We now come to Part 3, which concerns collections and funding. The amendment concerns Clause 42. The Explanatory Notes state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;This clause and the following 21 clauses . . . provide for the regulation of public charitable, philanthropic and benevolent collections. They build on provisions in Part 3 of the 1992 Act . . . [which] was never brought into effect, and will be replaced by these provisions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>We have already commented on the fact that Part 3 of the 1992 Act was insufficiently scrutinised before being passed in the wash-up period before the 1992 general election. Let us hope that we do not make the same mistake again.
</p>

<a name="50321-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>We have tabled this amendment because it seems rather odd to have a further definition of &quot;public charitable collection&quot; given in subsection (4) when other definitions exist earlier in the clause. Subsection (1) gives the two definitions of public charitable collections, being,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;collections in a public place; and . . . door to door collections&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>in paragraphs (a) and (b), with subsection (2)(a) defining when it is a public charitable collection as opposed to a charitable appeal and subsection (2)(b) defining charitable appeal.
</p>

<a name="50321-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Considering that those definitions are given, it seems confusing then to provide in subsection (4) a further definition of when an appeal to members of the public is a public charitable collection. Could not the definition of an appeal as given in subsection (4)(a) be transferred to the definition of charitable appeal in subsection (2)(b)? Subsection (4)(b) seems to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC2"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

superfluous, as it simply refers to subsection (2) and mirrors its wording. Surely the drafting could be more economic or succinct, so that there is not such confusion about the exact whereabouts in the Bill of the precise definition of public charitable collection.
</p>

<a name="50321-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>We have said many times that simplicity and clarity should be our watchwords in providing the regulatory framework for the charitable sector. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="50321-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I applaud the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, for moving an amendment that may&#151;we have yet to hear&#151;achieve clarity, and so on. I find the drafting of Clauses 42 to 44 very difficult, and I say that as an old and battered lawyer. I hate to think what members of the public&#151;I am thinking of the charities&#151;may make of that when trying to find their way round this extremely convoluted wording and definition. I note that public charitable collection is the same as charitable appeal, which is defined as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;an appeal for charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>There is no definition anywhere in the Bill of what are philanthropic or benevolent purposes. If there is no unforeseen objection to the amendment to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, I am right behind him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="50321-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   As the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said, this is an important part of the Bill dealing with the regulation of public charitable collections. It will replace the current legislation, which is outdated, fragmented and has been somewhat inconsistently applied. The current arrangements in place for street collections derive from a law of 1916, and the arrangements for house-to-house collections from a law of 1939. The Bill creates a new unified licensing scheme for public collections that removes the inconsistencies and ensures what we believe to be proportionate regulation. I look forward to explaining the Government&#039;s policy as we debate the various amendments.
</p>

<a name="50321-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Clause 42 defines the two types of public charitable collections: collections in a public place&#151;often referred to as street collections; and door-to-door collections. t also provides a number of definitions for the purposes of this chapter, including that a charitable appeal includes giving to philanthropic and benevolent purposes; the definition of what constitutes a public place; and that giving includes giving by whatever means, which would include by direct debit&#151;thus ensuring that face-to-face fundraising is properly regulated.
</p>

<a name="50321-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Under existing legislation, commercial participators who sell products house-to-house or in a public place, where a proportion of the profits go to a charity, would in most cases require a licence from the relevant local authority in whose area they were operating, as the activity would be considered to be a charitable appeal.

</p>

<a name="50321-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The Bill does not change that. Under subsection (4), the sale of goods in a public place where part of the proceeds were to be applied to charitable, philanthropic or benevolent purposes would be considered to be a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC3"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

charitable appeal, and therefore the licensing provisions of the Bill would apply. We believe that that is the right approach.
</p>

<a name="50321-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The Bill is deregulatory for door-to-door collections. Organisations proposing to undertake door-to-door collections would require a public collections certificate from the Charity Commission to demonstrate their eligibility to collect, which could be in force for a period of up to five years. They would be required only to notify local authorities for the areas in which they proposed to collect and the details of their proposed collections, rather than apply for individual licences for each collection from local authorities, as is currently the case. Some commercial participators would be able to operate under a public collections certificate that had been granted to the charity for which they were raising funds in the public collection, rather than requiring their own public collections certificate.
</p>

<a name="50321-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The amendment would remove the requirement on commercial participators undertaking charitable appeals in a public place, or door-to-door, to be bound by the licensing scheme for public charitable collections. We do not believe that that is desirable. Local authorities want to know what legitimate collecting activity is taking place within their areas, either door-to-door or in public places. By being aware of all the legitimate collections that are taking place, local authorities will be able quickly to identify any unlicensed activity that is occurring and take action. If this amendment were to be accepted, it would create a loophole that could be exploited as a means of avoiding the licensing requirements.
</p>

<a name="50321-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>In response to the consultation on those proposals the point was made by a number of respondents, including local authorities and charities, that commercial participators should be properly covered by the licensing scheme to ensure that local authorities know what legitimate collection activities are being carried out. We do not therefore intend to amend the Bill further to deregulate door-to-door collections or collections in a public place for commercial participators, although in preparing regulations and guidance we will be happy to consider what scope there would be for a different approach with regard to the conduct of those collections&#151;for example, in relation to the wearing of badges or the keeping of accounts. We also propose to produce a plain English guide to the Bill, which would be for charities, members of the public and hard-pressed lawyers.

<a name="50321-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister; I think that he read out his speaking note beautifully. The only trouble was that it did not quite answer my question, which was: could we not redraft the Bill so that subsection (4) became subsection (2), to bring it all into one place?
</p>

<a name="50321-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The point has been made to us that the way in which the definitions expand through the clauses is unhelpful. People working in the charitable sector should be able to go to one place to get the definition for which they are looking.

<p><a name="st_14"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 183AB in the name of my noble friend Lady Scotland, I shall speak to the other amendments in this group.
</p>

<a name="50321-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>We are grateful in this instance to the National Trust for pointing out the need for these amendments. Under Clause 43 as drafted, a charitable appeal which takes place on land where members of the public have access only by permission of the occupier, and where the occupier is the promoter of the appeal, does not count as a public charitable collection. It is therefore not regulated under the Bill. The purpose of that provision is to allow charities to organise their own collections on their own property without having to obtain a public collections certificate or a local authority permit. So in a sense, this is a deregulatory move, but a very sensible one.
</p>

<a name="50321-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The National Trust reminded us that it and some other landowning charities owned land to which the public now has a statutory right of access&#151;for example, under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Members of the public who exercise their statutory right of access are of course not on the land by permission of the occupier so, as the Bill is drafted, Clause 43 would not apply. That would mean that any appeal organised by a charity on its own land to which the public have a statutory right of access would be fully regulated. We do not think that is a justifiable burden, so Amendments Nos. 183AB and 183AC will put appeals on statutory access land on to the same footing as appeals on land where the public go by permission of the occupying charity. I should add, for the avoidance of doubt, that if the charity itself is not the promoter of the appeal on its own land&#151;and is not therefore in a position to oversee and control the appeal&#151;the appeal will fall to be regulated like any other collection.

</p>

<a name="50321-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Amendments Nos. 183HC and 183HD similarly alter the grounds on which a local authority can refuse a permit. One of those grounds is when a collection is to take place on the same day, or on the day before or after, another collection, except that the local authority may not refuse a permit on those grounds if, first, the collection is going to take place in one location on land to which the public have access by the occupier&#039;s permission; and, secondly, the occupier has given its consent to the collection. The effect of Amendments Nos. 183HC and 183HD is to extend that to cover statutory access land as well as land where the public go with the occupier&#039;s permission. I beg to move.

<a name="50321-27_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s explanation of this provision, which seems sensible.

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>This group of amendments relates to the period within which a promoter must notify the local authority of a proposed door-to-door collection or apply for a public collections certificate or permit to collect in a public place.

</p>

<a name="50321-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>A promoter of door-to-door collections must, under Clause 46, hold a valid public collections certificate, issued by the Charity Commission and in force for up to five years.

</p>

<a name="50321-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>A promoter of a collection in a public place must also hold a valid public collections certificate and must apply to the relevant local authority for a permit to conduct the collection at the time and place proposed. The need for a permit to conduct this type of collection is to ensure that the area is not swamped with public collections exceeding its capacity.
</p>

<a name="50321-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>A promoter of a short-term collection need not hold a valid public collections certificate, and need only notify the local authority of the proposed collection. Unless the local authority is satisfied that the proposed collection is not an exempt local short-term collection or that the promoter has been in breach of regulations or convicted of a relevant offence, and in either case serves notice on the promoter to that effect, the promoter can proceed with the proposed collection.
</p>

<a name="50321-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The Joint Committee recommended that we revisit the notification requirements as set out in the draft Bill, in the light of representations made by sector representatives questioning the workability of the notification requirements in the draft Bill. In response to the Joint Committee&#039;s recommendation, the Government intend that the notification requirements be prescribed in regulations made by the Secretary of State following further consultation. A further advantage of prescribing the notification requirement in regulations is that it provides flexibility to update them in the light of experience or future changes in the public collections field.

<a name="50321-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Amendment No. 183B, to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, would specify in the Bill the period within which a promoter must notify the local authority of a proposed door-to-door collection.

</p>

<a name="50321-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I agree that the notification periods to be prescribed must allow charities to plan and co-ordinate their collections, but this is probably best achieved through regulations following consultation.

or an application for a public collections certificate or permit to collect made. We realise that the existing formula within the prescribed period does not do what was intended. The intention is to require notice to be given within a period at least a certain amount of time before the proposed collection starts. But as the Bill is drafted, if the prescribed period were 14 days, then within 14 days would mean 14 days or less, giving the opposite result and making it unworkable for local authorities. The new formulation makes the intention clear.

Although I recognise that this is an attempt by the Government to tackle the point at which our amendment is aimed, we now have no certainty about how far ahead of the date on which a collection commences the certificate has to be applied for. The Minister said that regulations, after consultation, would establish this, but a concern has been raised that if this happens too close to the date on which the collection commences it could present the charities with a problem.

<a name="50321-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The reason for choosing 30 to 90 days is that, on the one hand, you want to give the local authority time to respond; on the other hand, you want to give the charity enough time to ensure that the permissions will be forthcoming. We want a prescribed period here because&#151;as we shall state when we come to later amendments&#151;there is a great deal of concern about the way in which local authorities have interpreted their so far more limited powers under the regulations and how they may do so in future. Fundraising bodies therefore argue that it is important that there should be a period greater than just one day in advance of the date of commencement of the collection.
</p>

<a name="50321-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>I shall of course withdraw my amendment when we come to it, but I wish to consider what the Minister said and to read the arguments he put forward when <br>&nbsp;<br>

he introduced the amendment. He will not, I hope, be unhappy if I am not prepared to allow these amendments to be nodded through today.

<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="50321-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   These amendments take us back many days to the time when my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury was talking about charity and the heart being connected. I wonder how the amendments would fit in with what happened in the final few days of last year when the tsunami disaster struck. Everything happened between Christmas and the New Year, which is certainly not a time when local authorities are at their brightest. I certainly question, therefore, a situation where you have to get a decision from a local authority in 30 to 90 days. The heart may well flutter if you have to wait for 30 days before conducting a door-to-door appeal.
</p>

<a name="50321-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>It could well be that last year children who were off school thought it would be wonderful to collect money for the disaster. I therefore pose the question as to how we would cope should there be, God forbid, another such occasion. As the disaster occurred only three months ago, it seems to me that we ought to be able to cope with such a situation in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="50321-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The tsunami appeals, very actively and very busily, took place without this regime kicking in. In fact, this regime would not kick in or inhibit such appeals in any way. As we all know, massive amounts of cash have been collected and, it is to be hoped, properly distributed. I do not think the noble Lord has to worry too much about the dead hand of local authority coming into play in such a situation. That kind of appeal did not fit within this regime because it was a national appeal; this regime relates to local collections.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="50321-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   If the local authority has not granted permission, would not the collections be illegal?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="50321-28_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   It would be a local short-term collection. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, we will ensure that charities have sufficient time to plan their collections and be set up within the regulatory regime. We are happy, in a sense, to use the position of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, as a starting point in consulting on the regulation. I accept the point about the need for clarity and so on. We want to ensure that the system is flexible and that is the beauty of using regulations, rather than putting something in the Bill. If we accepted the amendment, we would be more tied down than we need to be. So we would like to listen to the concerns that the noble Lord has expressed, because they are of value.

I know that I am trespassing onto the next clause, where there is an exemption for an appeal that is local in character. That which I have described would certainly be local in character, but would then be international in nature. If that covers the point, then that is fine. But, if, people get together independently and say, &quot;We must have a collection&quot;, they would not be in touch <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>This large group of amendments relates to the requirement to notify a local authority of a proposed door-to-door collection, or local short-term collection.

<a name="50321-28_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50321-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Amendment No. 183BZB replaces subsection (3)(b) of Clause 46, which relates to notifying a local authority of when a door-to-door collection is to take place. The new wording refers to the promoter specifying the prescribed particulars of when the proposed collection is to be conducted. The particulars to be prescribed by regulations made under Clause 60 could include the date on which a single collection is to take place, a series of dates for a series of collections, or a period within which several collections of unspecified dates would take place. In drawing up the regulations, we shall take heed of charities&#039; concerns to be able properly to plan their collecting activity. I know, for example, that charity shops often have arrangements with local authorities whereby they are licensed to collect door-to-door over a period without needing to provide the dates of the individual collections. I made reference with regard to the previous group of amendments that we shall consult widely prior to drawing up the regulations to ensure that they will be workable.
</p>

<a name="50321-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 183BZC, 183BZD, 183BB, and 183CZA all relate to Clause 47, which makes provision for local, short-term collections to be exempt from all the licensing requirements. That is to ensure that locally organised, infrequent, small-scale collecting activity can take place without the need to obtain a public collections certificate or permit to collect. The requirement for that type of collection would simply be to notify the local authority of the proposed collection, although the promoter would still have to ensure that it complied with regulations about its conduct. I shall explain how regulations will prescribe what types of collections would be eligible for this exemption when we come on to debate amendments to Clause 60.
</p>

<a name="50321-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Amendment No. 183BZC restructures subsection (1) of Clause 47. The revised wording draws a distinction between &quot;local, short-term collections&quot; and &quot;exempt collections&quot;. A local, short-term collection is one that is local in character, where the duration of the appeal does not exceed the prescribed period of time. The amendment provides for this in new subsection (1A). A collection is exempt if it satisfies the test for a local, short-term collection, is properly notified to the local authority, and the local authority does not serve a notice refusing to allow the collection for the reasons specified in subsection (3).
</p>

<a name="50321-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The revised wording in this amendment also serves two other purposes. It picks up the point mentioned earlier in debating the previous group of amendments, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC11"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC11</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

by correcting the drafting in subsection (1)(b) to allow the period within which notice of the collection must be given to be properly prescribed. It has also been modified so that the prescribed period for local authorities to serve notice refusing to allow the collection begins by reference to the date on which the local authority is notified, instead of ending by reference to the date when the proposed collection commences. We believe that that improves the drafting of the clause.
</p>

<a name="50321-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Subsection (2) of Clause 47 provides the matters that must be notified to the local authority. Amendment No. 183BZD updates the cross-reference in subsection (2) in light of the restructuring of subsection (1) by Amendment No. 183BZC. Amendment No. 183BB replaces existing subsections (3) and (4). As currently drafted, it enables a local authority to serve notice refusing to allow a proposed local, short-term collection, on the grounds that it is not a local or short-term collection within the prescribed meaning. This amendment gives local authorities an additional ground to refuse to allow a proposed local, short-term collection. The new ground is that the promoter has been convicted of a relevant criminal offence, or breached regulations made under Clause 60. This new ground will avoid a local authority being unable to prevent such a collection going ahead, even though it had serious concerns about the conduct of the collection due to the promoter&#039;s track record. Amendment No. 183CZA replaces subsection (6)(b) to reflect the changes to the structure of this clause.
</p>

<a name="50321-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Amendments Nos. 183BA, 183MA and 183NA would enable regulations made under Clause 60 to allow the notification of a series of local short-term collections exempt from the licensing regime to take place on specified or unspecified dates within a period.
</p>

<a name="50321-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>While we agree that that is a sensible approach for door-to-door collections, where some local authorities currently follow this practice with local charity shops, we do not think it appropriate for local, short-term collections, which could be in a public place or door-to-door collections. Our view is that local, short-term collections will be locally organised collections of a small scale, taking place within a short period of time, and not repeated with any frequency or forming part of a series of collections over time. The amendment would allow regulations to prescribe that a series of collections could take place on unspecified dates with a period notified to the local authority. We do not believe that that reflects the intended purpose of local, short-term collections.
</p>

<a name="50321-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Amendment No. 183NA would also make provision for regulations to allow a periodically repeated series of collections which could take place within a year and be notified up to one year in advance of the last collection in the series. The regulations could permit that in the case of door-to-door collections. I have already explained why we do not think that this type of notification would be appropriate for local, short-term collections. It also rather pre-judges the outcome of the proposed further consultation in relation to notification requirements.

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>I am grateful to Members of the Committee for raising these points. I hope that the Government&#039;s amendments deal with at least some of the issues behind the amendments. In the case of door-to-door collections, the Government&#039;s amendments will mean that the regulations can prescribe that the notification could cover one collection, several collections, or a period within which collections could occur without specifying the individual collections in the notification. We do not believe that the regulations for short-term collections should be able to provide for a series of unspecified collections, as the provision for local short-term collections is to allow small-scale, one-off collecting activity.

&quot;(   )   The appeal is local in character if it is being made on behalf of a charity or benevolent organisation whose registered office is within the jurisdiction of that local authority and whose total income is less than &#163;250,000.&quot;

<p><a name="st_51"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 183C relates to Clause 47 and the exemption for local short-term collections. The Government have very kindly tabled Amendment No. 183NAB, which I think is designed to answer some of the points that I seek to raise.
</p>

<a name="50321-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Clause 47 details how public charitable collections can be exempt from the requirement to obtain a public collections certificate. One of the requirements to obtain exempt status, as specified under subsection (1)(a), is that the appeal is &quot;local in character&quot;. It has been brought to our attention by the Institute of Fundraising that there is no definition of what constitutes a &quot;local, short-term collection&quot;. We feel that this amendment is important as it should be clarified that exemptions are to be granted to the smaller charities, and local charities at that, not to all charities. I am not sure that what the Government are proposing in Amendment No. 183NAB tackles that issue.
</p>

<a name="50321-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Smaller charities such as local PTAs or hospices do not have the resources to apply for public charitable collection certificates nor to compete with larger charities that plan collecting activities well in advance of the actual dates. Such small charities also need access to the area to which they provide services and which therefore may well contain many potential fundraising opportunities.
<a name="time_2"></a>
<a name="50321-29_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50321-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>The exemption for local, short-term collections will require promoters only to notify the local authority of their intention to collect; a permit or public charitable collection certificate will not be required. As I have said, the meaning of &quot;local, short-term collection&quot; is not defined, except in a very circular way, in the Bill. Under Clause 60(1)(d) regulations will be made setting out what constitutes a local, short-term collection.
</p>

<a name="50321-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The Institute of Fundraising believes that any definition should ensure, first, that smaller local charities fall under the exemption; and, secondly, that all charities are required to fulfil regulations which are proportionate to their resources and to the scale of their overall collection.
</p>

<a name="50321-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>The matter is further complicated as the definitions may relate to the size and nature of the collection and not to the size of the charity promoting the collection. Therefore some major national charities or branches of charities might fall under the exemption if they were <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC15"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to conduct a local small collection even though they would have the resources to fulfil the administration required for promoters of larger collections.
</p>

<a name="50321-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>This is the crux of the reasoning behind the amendment. Exemptions on local grounds should be available only to small charities which do not have the staff or resources to carry out the administration required for larger appeals. Inserting the wording suggested in the amendment in the Bill would achieve this. It would also clarify the definitions that need to be given and not leave this important distinction dependant on regulations which have yet to be made.

<a name="50321-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I much prefer government Amendment No. 183NAB to Amendment No. 183, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. To make it a pre-requisite that an appeal can be &quot;local in character&quot; only if it has its registered office in the jurisdiction of the local authority is far too demanding. I can think of 101 circumstances where that would work harshly. For example, in a town like Sudbury, which is right on the border of the local authority, if a charity was 100 yards the other side of the border but more or less in the town, you would not be able to call that charity&#039;s appeal &quot;local in character&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The other question that concerns me is whether the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, intends to exclude philanthropic organisations from this part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="50321-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   We really want to stimulate a response from the Government about how we should tackle the question of local appeals. Not having the benefit of years of legal training and legal work, I did not for a minute believe that I could possibly draft the amendment in the right way; my purpose was merely to be a gadfly to the ministerial team.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="50321-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, is too modest.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Clause 47 is important. It provides for exempt local, short-term collections that will not need to meet the full requirements of the licensing regime. The exemption is there to ensure that we do not stifle local fundraising activity by burdening it with a requirement for licences. It is important that we achieve the right balance with these proposals so that small-scale, locally organised collections can operate without the need for licences while ensuring that the level is such as to prevent the risk of bogus fundraising activity falling, if you like, beneath the regulatory radar.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>A local, short-term collection will be an exempt collection if the appeal is local in character. Clause 60 provides a regulation-making power for the Secretary of State, which includes in subsections (1)(d) and (2) the ability to prescribe the circumstances in which an appeal can be considered &quot;local in character&quot; for the purposes of defining a local, short-term collection. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC16"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC16</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

These include reference to the extent of the area within which the appeal is to be conducted; whether the appeal forms part of a series of appeals; and the number of collectors making the appeal and whether or not they are doing so for remuneration. The amendment would place in the Bill, rather than in the regulation-making power, a requirement that the meaning of &quot;local in character&quot; includes, as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said, charities located in the local authority with an income of less than &#163;250,000.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The amendment could have an adverse effect; by specifying in the Bill an income cap, it would exclude locally organised collection activity for a national charity or appeal. We think that small-scale, one-off, locally organised collections for a national charity or appeal such as the tsunami appeal or carol singing on behalf of Christian Aid should qualify as an exempt local short-term collection. Perversely, the amendment would prevent that.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>We agree, to a certain extent, with the intention behind the amendment that locally based charities should be able to qualify for exempt local short-term collections. I agree with this not just in principle but as a matter of fact. Where we differ is on the proposed &#163;250,000 income level. That may well be too high and we would need to consult before setting any similar limit.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>The government amendment provides that the regulations made under Clause 60 prescribe what could be considered a local short-term collection and should include reference to where the collections promoter is located and to the resources of the charity or other organisations on whose behalf the collection is being organised.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>We intend, as ever, to consult widely with the sector, local authorities and other interested bodies over the regulations which would set the precise boundaries of what could be considered a local short-term collection to ensure that the exemption will be set at the right level. Prescribing the precise terms of the exemption regulations would also provide flexibility in future when we needed to update them, should that prove necessary.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will be reassured by that explanation. We want a more flexible approach. We recognise the issue of income but we think the limit is set far too high. There is a perversity in the amendment which would probably end up being counter-productive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="50321-30_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   The Minister said that he thought the &#163;250,000 total income limit was far too high. Setting a limit like that is misconceived for a local charity when they presumably have to guess what the fruits of the appeal will be. Why do the Government need to contemplate an amount if the definition of &quot;local&quot; can be by geographic means, which I should have thought was a much more sensible way of going about things?
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>

<p><a name="st_63"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment relates to Clause 50, which in turn relates to the grounds on which the commission may refuse an application for a public collections certificate. One of the grounds, under subsection (1)(e), is that,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;it appears to the Commission that the amount likely to be applied for charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes in consequence of the proposed collections would be inadequate, having regard to the likely amount of the proceeds of the collections&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="50321-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Our amendment would insert the word &quot;overall&quot; before the word &quot;amount&quot;. We argue that the issue of returns on fundraising activities is more complex than the consideration of a simple amount, as implied by the current drafting of the Bill. The collections of direct debits on the street, for instance, produce a favourable return on the investment, but the initial cost of recruiting an individual in that manner is high. Face-to-face collection has been particularly attractive to younger donors, allowing charities to recruit new donors with a different demographic profile.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Running a collection is about more than simply bringing in new money. Other forms of fundraising, such as legacy fundraising, have much lower costs, but the visibility and marketing value to a charity of being present on the street on a busy Saturday is invaluable. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC18"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Collecting in that manner also allows fundraisers to establish a dialogue with a potential donor and begin a relationship that can be built on.
</p>

<a name="50321-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The Institute of Fundraising has brought this matter to our attention, as it is concerned that giving the Charity Commission the ability to refuse a public collections certificate on the grounds that the likely amount applied to charitable purposes will be inadequate, under paragraph (e), is too simplistic. We appreciate that the commission should refuse to issue public collections certificates if it suspects that the overall amount to be applied for charitable purposes, allowing for the long-term nature of some aspects of some aspects of collecting activity, will be inadequate, but that should be reflected in the wording in the Bill. I beg to move.

<a name="50321-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Clause 50 provides the grounds on which the Charity Commission may rely in refusing an application for a public collections certificate. A promoter planning to undertake public charitable collections, other than exempt local short-term collection, will need to apply for a public collections certificate from the Charity Commission. The Bill gives the Charity Commission the function of determining and issuing public collections certificates to organisations that it is satisfied are eligible to conduct collections. The Commission will consult widely and publish guidance on how it proposes to undertake its role in the public collections scheme. The public collections certificate could be in force for a period of up to five years.
</p>

<a name="50321-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The grounds for refusal of a public collections certificate are listed in subsection (1), and include, for example, that the applicant has been convicted of a relevant offence, or when the applicant has failed to exercise due diligence in carrying out previous collections. It is not my intention to explain each ground, as the list of grounds is necessarily long. The grounds have to cover all the possible circumstances that could arise in which the commission would be expected&#151;in the public interest, as much as anything else&#151;to refuse to issue a public collections certificate.
</p>

<a name="50321-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>This amendment would alter the ground in subsection (e). As the provision is currently drafted, it would enable the commission to refuse to issue a public collections certificate where it appeared to the commission that the amount likely to be applied for charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes in consequence of the proposed collections would be inadequate, having regard to the likely amount of the proceeds of the collections. The amendment would refer to the &quot;overall&quot; amount. The noble Lord explained his amendment clearly, and I certainly understand the point about visibility; in marketing, that is an important concept. However, the amendment would not improve the commission&#039;s ability to apply sophisticated and reasonable judgment when assessing what return on collections would be regarded as inadequate.

</p>

<a name="50321-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>We rest on the argument that the commission is in a better position than local authorities to make an informed and reasonable assessment, in full knowledge <br>&nbsp;<br>

of the wider fundraising environment, and not restricting its consideration to returns on the basis of any single collection, but to the returns over a series of collections. It is an important ground for refusal, to ensure that the commission would not be obliged to issue a certificate to an organisation or person it had investigated and found at fault in this regard. I do not believe that it is a ground that the commission would need routinely to rely on, but it needs to be there for the rare cases when it would be required. In these rare cases, it would be necessary because of the need to ensure the protection of the public, which we see as a very important component of the licensing scheme.
</p>

<a name="50321-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s point about visibility and not being judged simply on what can be collected at one place at one time is relevant, but we believe that we can deal with that issue in the guidance that is to be published.

It has to guess the likely amount of proceeds from a collection, then make a second judgment about whether the sums applied from those collections are adequate in terms of the charity. Given that the Minister talked of consultation and guidance, can he give the Committee some assurance that that will be an exercise within bounds? I imagine that if one was to go overboard about it, it could take up a vast amount of everybody&#039;s time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>

We have had that debate many times in this Committee; we want to ensure that we strike the right balance, and do not want to be excessive or create an overly bureaucratic monster.

</p>

<a name="50321-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Charities use a mix of paid employees, volunteers and subcontractors to perform fundraising activities. There is a variety of employment and volunteering opportunities within the sector and, indeed, within organisations within the sector. Remuneration of paid roles increasingly reflects the level of skill required by the individual involved. Where individuals are expected to bring in millions of pounds in income&#151;and with the responsibility of directing fundraising activities for the larger organisations, such as the NSPCC or Cancer Research UK, including overseeing public collections and other activities&#151;the salary levels will reflect that responsibility and may well be of the order of &#163;50,000 per annum or higher. Employed fundraisers with less experience and skills will be remunerated accordingly.
</p>

<a name="50321-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Charities may also use volunteers in some capacity, perhaps to run a local event or to collect money at a supermarket. Within smaller organisations, such as local community groups, there may be no paid employees at all.
</p>

<a name="50321-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Charities might also use a fundraising consultant or professional fundraising organisation. Payment will reflect the consultant&#039;s experience or the level of service that the professional fundraising organisation is to deliver. Such arrangements will be governed by contract. While it is important that the Charity Commission may refuse a public collections certificate if it believes that excessive payment to fundraisers may occur, it needs to have a clear understanding of the complex issue of the remuneration of fundraisers.

But what would be the position if the fundraiser were given an extremely expensive cruise for himself and his wife&#151;or for herself and her husband&#151;as part of the remuneration for a successful appeal, or given a high-powered car or something of that type?

</p>

<a name="50321-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>&quot;Excessive&quot; is probably a more precise term than &quot;inappropriate&quot; and is, perhaps, more relevant. The purpose of the subsection is to prevent circumstances arising where the commission would be forced to issue a public collections certificate to an organisation or individual who, for example, had a track record of taking in excess of, say, 75 per cent of the proceeds of collections as remuneration. I understand that there have been a few isolated similar examples.
</p>

<a name="50321-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>I think that the Charity Commission is probably in a very good position to judge what could be considered &quot;excessive&quot; remuneration in these circumstances. It does, after all, have very wide knowledge and experience of charity fundraising and in particular of different fundraising methods and techniques and remuneration arrangements. That would enable it to apply a long-term view over the life of a public collections certificate and to take into account various circumstances rather than applying a rigid formula.

He went on to say that, in some senses, &quot;inappropriate&quot; might tackle small sums. I think that it should. I can think of occasions on which a very simple appeal gave someone what in absolute terms was a small sum.

&quot;(   )   Upon an application to the applicant or a person referred to in subsection (1)(a) and (b) above, the Commission shall provide reasons for making the request, and such reasons may form the basis of an appeal to the Charity Appeal Tribunal.&quot;

<p><a name="st_81"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 183EA relates to Clause 51 and the power of the commission to call for information and documents. The clause provides a power for the Charity Commission to request information or documents from applicants or certificate-holders in respect of its functions. In certain circumstances, the commission might feel the need to request further information from an applicant who is seeking a public collections certificate. Amendment No. 183EA would ensure that reasons are given if the commission feels this need. We have discussed how we wish regulation to be deployed effectively by the Charity Commission without overuse&#151;the old &quot;proportionate&quot; argument that we have had in previous sittings.
</p>

<a name="50321-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>With this increase in regulation, it seems entirely sensible for there to be an increase in commission answerability and accountability. The amendment achieves the correct balance because it enables an applicant to request reasons for any demands made of him or her. These reasons could then form the basis of an appeal to the Charity Appeal Tribunal. The increase in regulation contained in this section needs to be balanced, and that would be achieved through Amendment No. 183EA. I beg to move.

<a name="50321-32_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   When the Minister considers the amendment, will he also consider&#151;and this may need to be done after today&#151;the fact that the commission&#039;s request under Clause 51 is not qualified in any way? Section 9 of the Charities Act 1993&#151;the information section&#151;shows that the right of the commission to request information or documents is subject in the first case to information in the possession of the person to whom the request is made and, for a document, only in respect of a document under his control. This is an open right of demand which could place the person to whom the demand is made in an impossible position, as he or she might have to incur considerable expense.

</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="50321-32_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The reason that there is a provision for this power to request information in respect of the commission&#039;s functions under this chapter is that the public charitable collections provisions apply to philanthropic and benevolent organisations and purposes, as well as to charities and charitable purposes. The commission already has powers under Section 9 of the Charities Act 1993 to &quot;require&quot; information relating to any charity, a point picked up by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. The powers in Section 9 do not extend to philanthropic and benevolent organisations&#151;hence the need for the provision in the Bill relating to the commission&#039;s role in licensing public collections.
</p>

<a name="50321-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The amendment raises two points: first, whether the commission should give reasons when requesting information under this section; and, secondly, whether there should be a right of appeal against a commission request for information made under the power. I shall deal with each point in turn.
</p>

<a name="50321-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>There is no objection in principle to giving reasons for requests for information in most cases, but there may be circumstances in which it would harm an investigation. If, for example, the commission was investigating allegations of fraud, it might want to request information or documents to determine whether there was cause for concern and further action. Giving prior notice of the reasons for the request for information may not be in the public interest and could provide an opportunity for evidence to be destroyed before the commission could use its protective powers or refer the matter to the police.
</p>

<a name="50321-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>We do not believe that a right of appeal is necessary for this power for the commission to &quot;request&quot; information relevant to the exercise of its functions in relation to public charitable collections. It is very different from the commission&#039;s power in Section 9 of the 1993 Act which enables it to &quot;require&quot; information relating to charities, and which gives rise to a right of appeal to the new tribunal. Where the commission requests information under this section, the person to whom the request was made could simply refuse.
</p>

<a name="50321-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The commission would have no right to demand the information, and the only consequence of someone refusing to provide the requested information to the commission might be that the commission decides to refuse to award a public collections certificate, or to withdraw or vary an existing public collections certificate&#151;all of which give rise to appeal rights to the tribunal. If the non-provision of information was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC25"></a>

pertinent in the commission&#039;s action, the appeal would at that stage examine the reasons behind the commission&#039;s request for information.

I am grateful to him for his explanation. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, put his finger on our concern about this clause; namely, that it is a very unqualified power. I rather wish that I had used that phrase in my remarks. Therefore, it is open-ended in terms of what the commission may or may not require.
</p>

<a name="50321-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>Bearing in mind that this is about applications for a public collections certificate or information about a person to whom such a certificate has been issued, it is quite a long chain for the Minister to argue that that might interfere with police investigations&#151;the destruction of evidence and so on.
</p>

<a name="50321-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>As regards the background of Clause 51, a person who is under suspicion would be aware that something of a different and much more serious nature is going on. I therefore did not find the bringing into play of the impact on the judicial and criminal process to be persuasive. This seems to be a situation where the commission could, using those powers, constantly ask for a bit more; that is, keep on chewing, having another bite, or the death by a thousand cuts for applicants. There is no restraining issue here.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>The noble Lord said: The next two groups of amendments relate to Clause 52, &quot;Transfer of certificate between trustees of unincorporated charity&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50321-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>The Explanatory Notes to the Bill state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;This clause enables the Charity Commission to direct that a public collections certificate in force be transferred from its holder(s) to another trustee(s) within the same unincorporated charity, where the holder(s) make such a request, and all the trustees of the charity consent to the transfer&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>Clause 52(3)(a) to (c) explains that the commission may direct that the certificate be transferred only when it is satisfied that each of the holders is a trustee of an unincorporated charity; that each of the recipients is a trustee of that charity; and that every trustee of the charity consents to the transfer.
</p>

<a name="50321-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>We feel that this is unduly restrictive. It is unnecessary for the commission to be given the power to interfere to such a degree. Is it entirely necessary for the commission to scrutinise a certificate transfer to such an extent that the consent of every trustee of the charity is assured?
</p>

<a name="50321-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>I would argue that the wording in Amendment No. 183EB is sufficient. The revised requirement that the governing body of a charity, acting as a body, can make the request to the commission when a certificate is to be transferred would ensure that the transfer is appropriately regulated while avoiding overly intrusive regulation from the commission. These tasks could be particularly onerous for the commission as there could be a large number of transfers.

<a name="50321-33_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I support the amendment. It seems practical and sensible. I also wonder whether the failure to refer in subsection (3) to &quot;benevolent or philanthropic&quot; organisations is an unintended omission or is otherwise accounted for.

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="50321-33_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The amendment gives me the opportunity to explain some of the thinking behind Clause 52.
</p>

<a name="50321-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>In setting up the regime for the regulation of public collections, we are hoping to achieve a system of regulation that, for the most part, will be light touch, but will give the Charity Commission the ability to consider matters in greater detail where the need arises. In that spirit, the purpose of the clause is to provide a method of transferring a public collections certificate that is easier for those involved than making individuals apply for a brand new certificate.
</p>

<a name="50321-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>We have limited this provision to unincorporated charities because they are bodies with which the Charity Commission will already have existing relationships and will, therefore, know much more about them. Charities are also fully within the commission&#039;s jurisdiction in a way that philanthropic and benevolent organisations are not. This provision is not required for charitable companies, as a charitable company is a legal person and so a certificate awarded to a charitable company would not need to be transferred just because its directors changed.
</p>

<a name="50321-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>In considering an application for a transfer of a certificate where members of the governing body have changed at an unincorporated, philanthropic or benevolent organisation, the commission would no doubt wish to ask for more information to make sure that it could be satisfied that the collection or collections would be properly carried out. It would also want to be satisfied that the relevant person was suitable. In practice, therefore, the commission would want to look at a request from a philanthropic or benevolent organisation to transfer a certificate in much the same way as it would look at a new application.
</p>

<a name="50321-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>We do not believe, therefore, that the amendment should be taken forward, as philanthropic and benevolent organisations do not fit with the underlying purpose of this clause, which is to enable the commission to offer an expedited procedure for the transfer of a certificate for organisations that it already has a relationship with. We believe that a public collections certificate should be transferred to trustees only and not to any individual named on an application without any restrictions on who that individual might be.

<p><a name="st_99"></a>The noble Lord said: In a phrase or two of the Minister&#039;s response to the previous debate, he just touched on the matters that I wish to raise here. We have just talked about how the public collections certificate can be transferred from its holder to another trustee within the same unincorporated charity. These amendments ensure that a certificate can be transferred if each of the holders and the recipients are trustees or members of staff of an unincorporated charity.
</p>

<a name="50321-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Within a small charity, it is likely that a member of staff will be responsible for organising collections as well as other daily activities of the organisation. Charity trustees are not usually involved in the minutiae of daily administration in a charity. If a trustee were named on the public collections certificate, it could cause difficulty were inquiries directed to the holder of a certificate by the local authority. Further, some larger charities are unincorporated and the administration difficulties could cause even more serious problems here.
</p>

<a name="50321-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Members of staff should also be allowed to hold certificates, as is currently the case with exemption-order holders. There are currently more than 40 exemption-order holders, which allows the holders to collect anywhere in England and Wales as long as each organisation notifies the relevant local authority of its intention to collect. Exemption orders are issued by the Home Office to a named individual, usually a member of staff. The orders can be transferred to another named individual if necessary.

<a name="50321-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The current legislation is broad enough to allow local authorities to issue permits just to local charities or to allow only one or two collections within their area per year. Examples that have been brought to my attention include a local authority citing its policy of allowing only local charities to collect when refusing Alexandra Rose Day permission to collect, even though that charity helps small and local charities to raise money.
</p>

<a name="50321-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Under the new scheme, local authorities will issue permits to organisations that want to conduct collections on the street. It is accepted that there are issues of capacity with collections on the street, unlike door-to-door collections, but, although it is important that local authorities can change conditions of permits as circumstances dictate, guidance needs to be made available to ensure that there is a consistent pattern to local authority regulation. Without that, the position of charities becomes very difficult. I beg to move.

<a name="50321-34_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson: it seems a very wide sea on which the local authority can float in attaching conditions. I know that it must comply with regulations, but it would be helpful if the Minister would give some idea&#151;I am sure that he will&#151;of what limits, if any, there are on the imagination of local authorities under the provision.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="50321-34_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, tempts me into expressing a view about local authorities and imagination. It would be very unwise to accept that temptation. I am grateful that the amendment has been tabled, because it will give us the opportunity to give a hint of our intention. I hope that when I have done that, the Committee will be satisfied.
</p>

<a name="50321-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>We have previously explained the two-stage nature of the process for collection certificates and permits to collect. I think that the Committee understands that. The reason that a permit is required from a local authority for collections in a public place concerns issues of capacity. Those do not arise so much in respect of door-to-door collections. I shall explain capacity issues in a bit more detail when we debate amendments to Clause 57. Clause 56 provides for the determination of applications and issue of permits by local authorities.
</p>

<a name="50321-34_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Subsection (3) enables the attachment of conditions to the permit. We intend here that the types of conditions will reflect local circumstances of the collection&#151;for example, to place a limit on the number of collectors or provide that collectors must not stand in particular places, such as close to a cash point or pedestrian crossing, one on the grounds of harassment, the other on the grounds of safety.
</p>

<a name="50321-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Subsection (5) provides that the terms of any conditions attached by the local authority under subsection (3) must be consistent with the provisions of regulations made under Clause 60, which enables regulations prescribing the types of conditions that can be applied to public collections certificates or permits. That would prevent the local authority attaching <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC31"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC31</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

conditions inconsistent with regulations providing for the conduct of public collections issued under Clause 60. Therefore, local authorities could not attach arbitrary or unfair conditions to permits. There is also the right of appeal against a local authority&#039;s decision not to issue a permit or to attach conditions to it, provided in Clause 59.
</p>

<a name="50321-34_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>So the amendment is unnecessary because the measure is not as draconian or extensive as it has been perceived. It will simply enable local authorities to attach sensible conditions to permits, not conditions that will in any way frustrate the purpose of the collection. That is not what we want; we would not want local authorities to do that.

</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="50321-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </b>   moved Amendment No. 183HA:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>Page 57, line 30, leave out from &quot;area&quot; to end of line 31.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment brings us to the knotty issues of Clause 57 and the refusal of permits. The clause details the grounds on which a local authority may refuse an application for a permit to conduct a collection in a public place. Subsection (1)(b) states that a refusal may be given if the proposed collection is to be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;conducted on a day on which another collection in a public place is already authorised under this Chapter to be conducted in the authority&#039;s area, or on the day falling immediately before, or immediately after, any such day&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Our amendment would remove the last phrase,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;or on the day falling immediately before, or immediately after, any such day&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The reasoning behind it is quite simple. A local authority unfavourably disposed to local collections could use the power in the Bill to restrict local collections to only two days per week and, indeed, to avoid any collections at all on Saturdays.
</p>

<a name="50321-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Consider the following example: a local authority gives permission for a collection on a Tuesday. That means under the Bill as drafted that no collection could take place on Monday or Wednesday. The local <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC32"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

authority then permits a further collection on the Friday, thus ruling out Thursday and, most importantly, Saturday. The net effect is to have only two collections per week. Surely the real issue is the nature of the locality in which collections take place&#151;the size, footfall, and so on&#151;linked to the day of the week on which the collection is to take place. The frequency of collections in Birmingham or central Manchester should be quite different from that in my local town of Ludlow&#151;or, dare I say it, Sudbury. So we argue that there should be no artificial, statutory barriers of the type envisaged on page 57, in lines 30 and 31. A collection every day in a locality with a big catchment area and a large passing population could be perfectly satisfactory, whereas one collection a month might be enough in a small market town.
</p>

<a name="50321-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>I have no wish to attack the Minister before he has spoken, but in this group there are government Amendments Nos. 183HB and 183HE. We feel that those amendments make the matter worse. The Government have failed to remove that very difficult last phrase, which would permit a local authority to restrict collections to two days per week. In addition, Amendment No. 183HB inserts additional words on page 57, in line 31, and in particular proposed new paragraph (b)(ii), which states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;it appears to the authority that as a result . . . the collection . . . would itself be unlikely to be successful&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Who is going to judge what successful means? A local authority&#151;judging that?
</p>

<a name="50321-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>We have discussed the problems of short term and long term. Having a relatively unsuccessful financial short term might give a greater effect long term. A charity might do something to raise its profile in a locality or in the country as a whole. A local authority has no expertise on which to judge whether a collection will or will not be likely to be successful. I should have thought that the charity should decide whether it wishes to deploy its effort or resources and live with the consequences of whether it is successful.
</p>

<a name="50321-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>You can think of situations in which a local authority might permit one set of charities to collect and not another, for all sorts of reasons not connected with the cause itself. Today I was faxed an example, which stated that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;the Town Centre Manager of Liverpool City Council has told the PFRA that he does not believe that the people of Liverpool will give by direct debit and has therefore set a limit of 6 fundraisers in the whole of Liverpool City Centre. This is unfortunately not an isolated incident, and I have had many local authority officers tell me that face-to-face fundraising &#039;will not work here&#039; when the charities&#039; experience is exactly the opposite&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>I look forward to hearing from the Minister the thinking behind the Government&#039;s amendments, but I have very grave doubts about the original drafting, and my doubts have not been assuaged by the new amendments or by the public reaction that I have received since they were tabled. I beg to move.

The provisions are altogether over the top, and I hope that the Government will resist the temptation to allow the local authority to engage in such speculations and to give guidance in relation to those speculations.

</p>

<a name="50321-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Clause 57 provides the grounds for the refusal of permits to collect in a public place, which are limited to grounds of nuisance and capacity. Capacity is an important issue and that probably explains why the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is concerned about the content of any guidance&#151;but guidance will be an important factor in ensuring that the local authority focuses on the key issues.
</p>

<a name="50321-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, because it would limit local authorities&#039; grounds to refuse to award a permit to collect. At the moment, the clause would enable a local authority to refuse to award a permit if there was another collection on the same day, or the previous day or the following day. The amendment would restrict that ground for refusal to whether there was another collection taking place only on the same day. We think that this goes too far.
</p>

<a name="50321-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>There are some areas where it is perfectly acceptable to have public charitable collections taking place every day of the week, given their particular circumstances, but equally there are other areas where allowing collections to take place every day could significantly exceed the area&#039;s capacity for collections. I do not know whether Ludlow or Sudbury are such areas; however, it occurs to me that both are small, but <br>&nbsp;<br>

significant and important, urban concentrations. The question is whether they would have the capacity to generate sufficient charitable giving in the way in which the noble Lords envisaged, if the amendment were successful.
</p>

<a name="50321-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>In such areas, the amendment would prevent local authorities refusing to allow collections unless another had been organised for the same day, which could, in theory, result in charitable collections on the street seven days a week.

<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="50321-36_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I can understand that charities and other fundraisers are concerned that as the Bill is drafted it would not prevent local authorities refusing permits for collections on arbitrary or inconsistent grounds. However, the clause is clearly aimed at capacity issues and we think that a charity would probably have good grounds for appeal if a local authority turned down its application simply on the basis that another collection was occurring the following day, without making any connection with the &quot;capacity&quot; of the area for collections.

<a name="50321-36_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   Perhaps I may interrupt the Minister, because he is getting the local authority to do the managerial work of the fundraising departments of charities, which I did not think was the purpose of the Bill. What would be the position if a local charity had fundraised on day one, but a large national charity later applied all over the country for co-ordinated fundraising on day two or on day nought&#151;the day before? Is he going to say that it will not be allowed to have its national fundraising day in one particular local authority area? That is what he is saying the Bill provides for.
</p>

<a name="50321-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>It is up to the charities to decide whether or not it is worth their while. They will stop fundraising exercises of this type pretty quickly if they are not profitable. Unlike a commercial venture, they cannot afford loss leaders. Charities cannot work that way.

<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="50321-36_spnew7"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   Further to the point made by my noble friend Lord Swinfen, what happens if a local authority has to decide between competing charities, each one equally commendable? How does the local authority decide which one to give a permit?

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="50321-36_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   Perhaps I may deal with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. National charities plan their collection days well in advance. They are well known and well advertised. I think that the conflict that the noble Lord sees there is not a real one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="50321-36_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   Is the Minister suggesting that smaller charities do not also plan well ahead? Some of them may not, but a large number of them will do. They need to plan even further ahead than the big national charities to make certain that they have the resources available on that particular day. It will take them a long time to recruit the volunteers and to assess them to make certain that they can operate on that day.
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="50321-36_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   That is clearly an important consideration. What I am trying to suggest here&#151;to paint a picture, if you like&#151;is that the large national charities will have planned well in advance. Their dates and times will be well advertised. Local charities will no doubt want to work round that so that they are not necessarily in conflict with a large well-advertised collection that will be taking place not only locally but nationally as well. So I think that the conflict which the noble Lord sees is probably not a real one.
</p>

<a name="50321-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>On the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, local charities are, of course, free to bring forward applications to pitch for the same day, but I get the impression, though I stand to be corrected, that they will be talking to one another so that they do not conflict. Clearly it is not in anyone&#039;s interest to have two charities competing in the same places in the same town on the same day. That is not a sensible way of working at all. I do not know what the noble Earl&#039;s experience is, but it seems to me that local charities that do street collections are very careful to plan round each other so that there is an orderly way of collecting and they maximise their potential. That is very sensible.

I am suggesting that capacity is an issue. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, about an evidence base. It is for the local authority to adduce the local situation and to see the potential local impact. That will undoubtedly inform its thinking on how it approaches the provision of permits. I think it would be a foolish local authority that did not have good reason to refuse a permit. It will no doubt want to find out, based on local circumstances, what the likelihood is of a successful collection that meets the aspiration of the charity.

<a name="50321-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Amendment No. 183HB adds a qualification to the grounds for refusal on the basis of capacity.

The three grounds are that the proposed collection would,

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>Amendment No. 183HE provides a power for the Secretary of State to make and, if needs be, revise guidance relating to matters to be taken into account. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC37"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC37</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I see that as a helpful provision, because it will enable the local authority to think more carefully and focus on the issues of capacity in a sensitive way. It is our intention that work should start on the guidance as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent. That will obviously run in parallel with the preparation of regulations.

<a name="50321-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Our intention would be to develop the guidance with help from those who know most about the practicalities of public charitable collections. Clearly, they will be closer to and will better understand issues such as capacity. We want to strike the right balance. We do not want to give local authorities the power to clamp down on collections or restrict them&#151;far from it. We want to encourage charitable giving and we want local authorities to be part of that general encouragement, because that is an important role for them in the locality.

<a name="50321-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>What does the amendment mean by the word &quot;inconvenience&quot;? Is it just the number of collections? Is it the number of collectors on the street, and would they inconvenience the public?
</p>

<a name="50321-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>I do not know whether the noble Lord has ever been what I might describe as a &quot;tin-rattler&quot; on the street, taking part in a collection. I have been one on a number of occasions. It is quite remarkable how many people can walk past, ostensibly without seeing you. They find it very easy to avoid you if they think that you would like a penny from them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="50321-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   I have done a bit of tin-rattling and collecting in the past&#151;though I confess, not so much in recent years. The noble Lord is right. People have a very neat way of avoiding your gaze, your interest or your solicitations. If there is excessive use of a particular area and pitch for collecting, it simply is a matter of whether that is in the general public interest of encouraging good collections.
</p>

<a name="50321-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>In my time as a council leader, I certainly have been petitioned by those who thought that we had too many collectors of a particular type in a particular place. People did feel harassed by some of them. I confess that that is not something that happened very often, but it is certainly not unknown to me.

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="50321-37_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   To my mind, the Minister has not explained adequately the word &quot;inconvenience&quot;. I can assure him that if the public do not want to give, they will not give. Charities will find that they will not operate in those areas because it is not worth their while.

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>I made it very clear that we accepted the issue of capacity, although I think that the Minister felt that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and I were not listening to the remarks that he made about it. As I said, the frequency of collections in, say, central Birmingham or Manchester should be quite different from that in my local town of Ludlow or of Sudbury. So capacity is not an issue.
</p>

<a name="50321-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Allowing a blank day either side of a day of collections does not actually meet the point. Two collections a week in Ludlow or Sudbury would be too many but probably not enough in a large area with a big footfall. The Bill as drafted does not achieve what the Government seek.

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>We are told that the charity sector should not be frightened of arbitrary decisions by local authorities. Yet the provisions in paragraph (b)(i), (ii) and (iii) of Amendment No. 183HB will be entirely arbitrary in the way they are interpreted. Being unlikely to be successful or causing undue inconvenience to members of the public sounds to most people in the charitable sector like a recipe for arbitrary behaviour.

I make the offer without having reflected on it at any great length, but it may help to satisfy Members of the Committee. I have listened to the ferocity of the pounding; I am not completely immune. I want to make progress and to ensure that we get something that is sensible and workable.

</p>

<a name="50321-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s first amendment would require the Secretary of State to make the regulations listed in Clause 60. In practice these regulations will need to be made for the scheme to work. However, we do not agree that the Secretary of State should be compelled to make them. I expect that regulations will cover all the items currently listed in subsection (1) of this clause.

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s second amendment relates to the offence in subsection (5) of this clause.

<a name="50321-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The current wording in subsection (5) of Clause 60 would enable the offence to be applicable to specified provisions in the regulations. We believe that this is more appropriate, as it would enable the offence to apply to the provisions of regulations only where it would be appropriate for it to do so. The provisions which would be subject to the offence would be specified in the regulations, and would be subject to full consultation as required by subsection (6). There would be some regulations, for example, where we would not want the offence to apply.

Clauses 58(1) and(2) empower local authorities to disrupt fundraising activity. With those intrusive powers, it is entirely necessary for there to be a degree of balance applied to the authority of a local authority.

Subsection (3) provides examples of the type of regulations that that might include, such as prescribing a minimum age for collectors; the use of badges or certificates of authority; or preventing annoyance to members of the public. Those are clearly matters relating to the conduct of the collection.

<a name="50321-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The amendments would significantly widen the scope of the regulation-making power beyond prescribing regulations on the conduct of the collection to include matters relating to local authority decision-making. They would specify that matters relating to the refusal by a local authority to issue a permit to collect in public, or the withdrawal or variation of a permit to collect by a local authority could be covered by such regulations.
</p>

<a name="50321-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>It is inappropriate to broaden the regulation-making power in that way. Also, having heard what was said earlier about Clause 57, we probably need to consider the matter in more detail outside the Committee.

<a name="50321-39_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is unnecessary. He said that it is a probing amendment, for which I am grateful. Clause 64(5) defines the &quot;notifiable amount&quot;, which must be included in the statement. It provides that the notifiable amount would be the actual amount of remuneration or, if that is not known at the time, the estimated amount of remuneration calculated as accurately as possible in the circumstances.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>It is difficult to think of circumstances where it would not be possible to at least provide an estimate. I assure Members of the Committee that the Government intend this clause to be underpinned by guidance, which would include examples of the types of statements that could be used in different circumstances and which would be drawn up following extensive consultation with the sector.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>I appreciate that there can be complex arrangements for the calculation of remuneration for both professional fund-raisers and commercial participators, but I hope that Members of the Committee will accept my assurance that the guidance will provide sufficient flexibility in calculating the notifiable amount.

<a name="50321-39_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   Clause 64 amends Section 60 of the 1992 Act and relates to the statements indicating benefits for charitable institutions and fundraisers, but it will be ineffective and will repeat past mistakes. Prior to the Charities Act 1992, the charity sector became aware that some unscrupulous companies and fundraisers were implying that their promotions and/or collections were being carried out in the name of charity when in fact only tiny sums were being passed to charity. By requiring those companies/professional fundraising organisations&#151;PFOs&#151;to state the basis on which they were being paid, it was hoped to outlaw that practice.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>What happened in practice, however, was that the provisions of the 1992 Act have not worked as planned. They have created a number of problems. Importantly, the required statements of the PFOs were so vague as to be unhelpful. The wording of the Act allowed companies or PFOs to make statements which were within the letter of the law, setting out in general terms the basis of their remuneration, but which were not particularly helpful or meaningful to potential donors. These statements have created an uneven and extremely misleading fundraising playing field. Statements are not required when the promotion or collection is undertaken by a charity or a charity&#039;s trading company. That distorts the picture on fundraising, particularly when charities outsource some or all of their fundraising programmes. It is clearly inconsistent.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Two examples demonstrate this. A collection undertaken by paid staff of a charity would not require a statement to be made but the real cost-benefit ratio after taking into account the overhead costs of the staff may be the same or worse than a collection undertaken by a PFO on an out-sourced basis. Similarly, with direct mail donation campaigns, generally no statement is required as the mailing is done in the name of the charity. Donors may mistakenly think, therefore, that no paid fundraisers are involved, and that long-suffering volunteers stuffed the envelopes in the old-fashioned way. In fact, today most major direct mail campaigns involve paid consultants at a not inconsiderable cost.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Clearly, statements do not help the public understand charity fundraising; if anything, they perpetuate public misunderstanding. In particular, the statements do not take account of other non-monetary and related benefits. In the experience of the Charity Law Association, charity fundraising is rarely undertaken only to raise money. As we have discussed this afternoon, many fundraising methods have the related aims of raising the profile of the charity, increasing the names on its database for future fundraising, for initiating campaigning and for other purposes. The current statements give donors, at best, only one side of the story and do not enable them to put the cost/benefit of the fundraising exercise in any kind of context.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The statements also fail to take account of the duties of charity trustees. In the case of fundraising initiated by charities, they fail to highlight the protection that the existing law already offers. At the end of the day, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC46"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC46</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it is the responsibility of charity trustees to act prudently and to evaluate the costs and benefits associated with a fundraising or awareness campaign. If they fail in this duty, they can be held accountable. The disclosure/statement regime does not help the public to understand that, but the public might have a greater degree of confidence if it did. If anything, the current regime does much to perpetuate the view that the best charities are those that spend the absolute minimum on necessary services such as administration and fundraising&#151;which, incidentally, is contrary to the advice and guidance issued by the Charity Commission.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>The statements also fail to detail the complexity of modern fundraising. Over the decades, charities have had to increase and evolve the ways in which they raise funds. Sponsored walks and flag days have increasingly been supplemented by more professional and in many cases sub-contracted methods of fundraising, such as direct mail, challenge events and face-to-face fundraising on the street, house-to-house and, in the case of payroll giving, in the workplace. Similarly, commercial promotions involving a donation to a charity may involve many parties, such as wholesalers, retailers and agents. Much professional time and charity money is currently devoted to determining who and what statements need to be made in those situations.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Street collections highlight each of these points. They are generally undertaken by individuals employed and paid by PFOs. However, they and their employer are almost never the only paid professionals/PFOs involved in the campaign. The tabard-wearing fundraiser must make the required statements under the 1992 Act, and this may lead potential donors to think, first, that this is a costly method of fundraising; and, secondly, that these are the only costs associated with the fundraising. Neither is necessarily true.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The PFA may subcontract all the associated data-processing to a specialist firm to enter, edit and scan, sorting out &quot;completed&quot; from &quot;failed&quot; forms. Another specialist subcontractor may then be employed to send &quot;thank you&quot; letters to those who have made a donation or subscription. The chain of specialist subcontractors may extend still further, with another firm processing and establishing the consequent direct debit or standing orders. None of this is apparent to the donor at the time the gift is made.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>We are not seeking to argue that street collections are not a good thing. Charities regard them as being extremely cost effective and as producing many other side benefits. But it is not clear to me how the provisions in Clause 64 deal with the problems that I have identified. If anything, they compound the problems by requiring the front-end statements to be still more specific. Accordingly, one can argue that these provisions will be even less helpful than those in the 1992 Act which they are designed to replace.
</p>

<a name="50321-39_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>In our view, it is not possible to address the problems I have identified simply by adjusting the wording of Clause 64. It is necessary to rework <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC47"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC47</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Sections 58 to 60 of the 1992 Act, and the amendment to the 1992 Act proposed in Clause 64 does not answer the changes that are now required.

<p><a name="st_170"></a>
<a name="50321-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Best: </b>   The Joint Committee considered the requirement for statements indicating benefits for charitable institutions and fundraisers but came at it from a rather different perspective than that of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts. We were worried about the new phenomenon of &quot;chuggers&quot;&#151;charity muggers. These are the people who approach you not only for an instant donation on the street corner but to sign up to a standing order or direct debit which may last for many years. The Joint Committee was concerned that people should be clear of the basis on which those soliciting donations in this way were receiving remuneration, if they were. They might, of course, be volunteers, but that would be quite unusual.
</p>

<a name="50321-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The Joint Committee was well satisfied that current practices are not, as was feared, intrusive or intimidating to the people from whom the donations were sought through standing orders and direct debits. It was also impressed that this reached a market of young people&#151;the 18 to 30 year-olds&#151;who escape almost all other forms of fundraising. The direct approach on the street can get to such people and sign them up to a commitment which not only means that they pay their standing order or direct debit for a year or two but which can make them lifetime supporters of a particular charity.
</p>

<a name="50321-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>This form of fundraising is becoming increasingly significant. The Joint Committee&#039;s concern was not that it should be prohibited&#151;it clearly has a great deal of merit&#151;but that the basis on which these people were making their approaches to the public on the streets should be known to the people making the donations. For example, it was the practice of one charity to pay the collector, the fundraiser, the full year&#039;s income from the standing order or direct debit for the first year of donations.
</p>

<a name="50321-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>It sounds an enormous amount and disproportionate in the longer term, but it might well be justified on the grounds that people will pay for the next 10, 15 or 20 years; they will receive mailings from the charity and the amounts received will go up and up. So a whole year&#039;s donations as commission for the fundraiser might not be unreasonable in the circumstances. But those who are solicited on the streets deserve to know the basis on which the person asking for a contribution is doing so.
</p>

<a name="50321-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>The Joint Committee considered that the best option was for the Bill to include a provision whereby both an identity card of the fundraiser and a written statement of the basis upon which that fundraiser was seeking ongoing donations through direct debits or standing orders from those they were approaching were required. The Government rejected this but accepted in principle that such measures were important. They hoped that self-regulation would be the mechanism through which charities would adopt good practices such as the identity card and written <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC48"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

statement, whether that is on a card or on the piece of paper when you sign up for your direct debit or standing order.
</p>

<a name="50321-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>While the Government have not incorporated a provision in the clause for those seeking donations of this kind to have to provide a written statement, nevertheless, if self-regulation does not in the end achieve the results the Government wish, how will the good practice they have accepted find its way through to these kinds of donations and fundraising?
</p>




<p><a name="st_171"></a>
<a name="50321-40_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I am not going to add to what has been said by the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord Best beyond stating what is only too obvious in the charity sector: the provisions in the 1992 Act, which we are here amending, are highly unsatisfactory. I am not satisfied that the replacement provisions in Clause 64 are as clear and as helpful as they could and should be. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.
</p>




<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="50321-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My brief states that the provisions of the 1992 Act have not been particularly effective in providing transparency to donors. Clause 64 therefore amends Section 60 of the Charities Act to require professional fundraisers to provide more specific information about their remuneration and so on. So we take the point. The noble Lord, Lord Best, referred to the Joint Committee. Certainly at that point we accepted the principle that all paid fundraisers should be required to disclose that they are paid.
</p>

<a name="50321-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>We intend to bring forward an amendment on Report which will make provision for paid fundraisers who are not professional fundraisers but may be employees or officers of a charity. When such people are involved in any public collection, the amendment will require them to state that they are paid employees of a charity. They will not be required to disclose the amount of that remuneration.
</p>

<a name="50321-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>We want to address the important points that have been raised today and we would like to consider further the changes to the clause that may be essential to meet them. Obviously we will read <i>Hansard </i>and take careful cognisance of what has been said in regard to the fundraiser statement issue. I hope noble Lords will feel satisfied by that.
</p>

<a name="50321-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>As to self-regulation and identity cards, we have tabled amendments about both issues. The identity card/badges issue is dealt with under Amendment No. 185 and the self-regulation issue is dealt with under Amendment No. 185A. We shall come to both amendments later in the list.

<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="50321-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   Before the Minister sits down, when he comes to consider this part of the Bill, will he reflect on the issue that has been raised with us that one wants to uncouple the existing cooling-off provisions, the refund provisions, from the solicitation statements required? We understand the need for the refund and cooling-off provisions&#151;they are a part of life now in many areas&#151;but the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50321-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Self-regulation will be a voluntary scheme which will promote good practice in fundraising, raise awareness and deal with complaints and the non-compliance of participants. Self-regulation would sit alongside and complement existing statutory regulations, such as the provisions on public collections that we have discussed today. It would not be expected to directly tackle fraudulent or bogus fundraising, which would remain within the remit of existing regulators, such as the local authorities, the commission and, of course, the police.

</p>

<a name="50321-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s amendment could have some undesirable consequences. For example, it would be difficult to agree on what,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;widespread evidence of persistent failures in charity fundraising&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50321-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>would mean. One interpretation is that that could make it very difficult for the Secretary of State to use that power until such time as considerable damage had been done to public confidence in fundraising.
</p>

<a name="50321-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>While maintaining high levels of public confidence in the voluntary fundraising sector is the ultimate aim of the scheme, we do not propose to measure the success or failure of the scheme on the basis of changes in public confidence, as such changes may be outside the control of the self-regulatory scheme. It would be possible for there to be a particular scandal which might severely damage public confidence in charity fundraising, but which the self-regulation scheme would be able to do little to prevent.
</p>

<a name="50321-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The criteria for assessing the self-regulation scheme outlined in the consultation paper do not focus on attempts to measure public confidence. Instead, they focus on what the Government believe an effective self-regulation scheme should cover. I do not propose to list all the expectations, but I will give some examples. The scheme should promote openness, transparency and accountability in fundraising practice. The scheme will need to attract high levels of voluntary participation across the sector&#151;although, of course, it is appreciated that it would take time to build up the numbers of participants. We also think that participants should reflect the diversity of the sector. The scheme and its members must also provide the public with a clear guarantee of what they can expect from fundraisers who are members of the scheme and from the scheme itself. There must be effective and meaningful sanctions for non-compliance that are proportionate to the nature and extent of any non-compliance.
</p>

<a name="50321-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>We appreciate that it will take time for self-regulation to prove itself and we want to give it a fair wind. The consultation paper suggests that it is reviewed when we come to review the impact of the legislation&#151;within five years of enactment. That should provide it with sufficient time to demonstrate its effectiveness.
</p>

<a name="50321-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Self-regulation remains the Government&#039;s preferred solution. We intend to publish the criteria for assessing its success following consultation. We will certainly take heed of the points raised by Members of the Committee today. On that basis, I trust that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

Amendments Nos. 185B and 187D would give effect to a recommendation made by the Joint Committee in the draft Bill.

The Joint Committee said:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;If self-regulation of fundraising fails to such an extent that the reserve power has to be invoked, we believe the seriousness of the situation would merit debate in Parliament.

<br>

This power has been included in other recent legislation where a consolidation Act was envisaged&#151;for example, the Communications Act 2003, where a power to this effect is to be found in Section 407. That power apparently allows the Secretary of State to make minor amendments in order to tidy up existing legislation before a consolidation Bill, to pave the way for the consolidation itself and to make it easier.

   &quot;DATA PROTECTION AND DISABILITY CHARITIES

<br>
(   )   Lists of the names and addresses of beneficiaries of disability charities (and similar lists held by public authorities for the purposes of providing services to disabled persons) may be accessed by disability charities for the purpose of assisting their beneficiaries and not for commercial gain.


<br>
(   )   To achieve this purpose the Secretary of State shall issue such an order as is necessary under paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 to the Data Protection Act 1998 (c. 29) (conditions relevant for purposes of the first principle: processing of sensitive personal data).


<br>
(   )   In this section &quot;disability&quot; has the same meaning as in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (c. 50) and subsequent amendments to it.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_196"></a>The noble Lord said: This is an amendment that, I hope, will strongly appeal to the Committee. It derives from a submission made to me by Anthony Wigram, who is chairman of a charity called U Can Do I.T. It is a small charity that has been in existence for five years, which gives Internet training to blind, deaf and disabled people in their own homes and uses 51 freelance tutors. A major difficulty for it and other charities like it which deal directly with disabled people is in accessing the target group. This is extremely difficult, if not impossible, due to the Data Protection Act, which makes it impossible for government departments and other organisations, local authorities and charities to share information about their client groups.
</p>

<a name="50321-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>For example, the charity has given training to more than 600 people during its existence. Those people could benefit enormously from help from other charities and organisations in the same field, such as Action for Blind People, Leonard Cheshire, the Shaw Trust, RNIB, RNID and so on. All those charities have a common interest in trying to help particular groups of disabled people. My remarks, so far, about U Can Do I.T. and disabled people apply just as much to all other charities within particular interest groups.
</p>

<a name="50321-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>It seems abundantly obvious that anything which prevents one charity being able to bring efficiently and quickly to the attention of the beneficiaries of a related charity the benefits which it has available, simply on grounds of data protection provisions which are more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC56"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC56</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

related to privacy and commercial considerations which are not applicable here, is self-defeating. I have heard since from other sources just how frustrating an impediment it is to the most effective use of scarce charitable resources.
</p>

<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="50321-42_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I, too, have had a visit from Mr Wigram and, indeed, from other charities in this field and the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is important. Perhaps I may take the matter a stage further. There is also a great deal of information that local authorities can provide, including from organisations such as Dial-a-Ride, Transport for All, which provide access to disabled people, and, of course, from the Department for Work and Pensions, which possess such information.
</p>

<a name="50321-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>It seems peculiarly perverse that if money is available to help people overcome their disabilities that somehow these organisations are unable to get in touch the people who will benefit from it. It would seem to be an Alice-in-Wonderland world if the Data Protection Act were being used to prevent us from helping people who were incapacitated in some way. I hope that we can find a way through this particular thicket.

<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="50321-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   I have one or two doubts about the amendment. Nothing in it allows disabled individuals to ensure that their name is not passed on to other charities if they do not want it passed on. That is a matter of privacy. I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, is trying to do. I am a great believer in charities working together. There is no point in redesigning the wheel. The charity I run works very amicably with others. But there is the privacy side.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>Charities co-operate on fundraising. The same method can be used with passing information on the services of one disability organisation to another. The fundraising literature is prepared by Charity A but is then sent out by Charity B to its list. The list is not passed over to Charity A&#151;it only gets the names and addresses of those who respond. Exactly the same could be done with services being provided by one disability organisation to the beneficiaries of another. The information can be posted by the charity that has the list of people on behalf of the charity which is willing to perform the service and to help them. So if they are prepared to co-operate and work together, I do not think the amendment is necessary. In fact, I doubt very much whether the Government would agree to it under the data protection legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="50321-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   The amendment is couched solely and exclusively in terms of benefiting the beneficiaries of a charity. Secondly, the logistical problems of dealing with the matter, as the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, suggested, are enormous and, for small charities, unsustainable. My sense of this is that the privacy element is minimal. I would be perfectly prepared to bring forward an amendment saying that if somebody actively does not want his or her name to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be circulated for the purposes of receiving a potential benefit they should be allowed to do that. But dealing with it the other way round is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and would undo the purpose for which the amendment has been brought forward. I wait to hear what the Minister says.
</p>




<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="50321-43_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   The purpose of the amendment&#151;to facilitate sharing information between public bodies and disability charities&#151;is laudable, not least because the information gathered will be of benefit to those who use the services of charities which work in this field and do an extremely good job. But there are problems with it. The Joint Committee received a memo from the charity U Can Do I.T., whose concerns I understand. It argued, very ably, about the perception that exists about the Data Protection Act and the way in which it works to prevent a useful transfer of information between government departments and public bodies.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>There is, however, no general prohibition against data sharing in the Act. It rather sets the standards which such sharing should attain. The first data protection principle states that personal data shall be processed &quot;fairly and lawfully&quot;. They must also be processed in accordance with the various conditions set out in the legislation. There are more conditions for sensitive personal data than for data which are not sensitive. If an organisation has trouble complying with the conditions for processing sensitive personal data, it can apply to the Department for Constitutional Affairs for an order. That is the Schedule 3 order mentioned in the amendment. However, in this schedule there is already a basis for organisations to disclose data they hold, if the people affected have given their explicit consent. A Schedule 3 order can be made only if there is an important public interest at stake. There would also need to be specific and suitable safeguards to protect the fundamental rights and privacy of the individual in this case.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>It is perhaps worth mentioning that if this amendment definitely gave a power to process information, as it looks as if the first paragraph does, then a Schedule 3 order would not be necessary according to provisions in the Data Protection Act. It seems to us that the fundamental problem is that the amendment would put the privacy of disabled individuals at some risk and we do not accept that that can be right. We agree with the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, in his interpretation. There might also be some ECHR implications.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>A pertinent issue here is the extent to which the potential beneficiary has given their consent to their data being shared. Under the Data Protection Act, bodies which hold lists of disabled people must ensure, among other things and so far as is practicable, that the individuals on that list are provided with a description of the purposes for which the data is to be used and any disclosures of personal data they intend to make. When the disclosure involves sensitive personal data, which includes information relating to an individual&#039;s physical or mental health or condition, then a disclosure should occur only when one of a number of specific conditions is met.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Currently, the most relevant condition is when the individual has given his explicit consent to that disclosure. Although it is not clear whether the disclosure would consist of information about an individual&#039;s particular disability, if their name was passed to a charity for the blind, for example, assumptions would arguably be made about condition of their eyesight. Provided that the organisation holding the list of disabled people make it clear that they would like to pass information about the people on their list to a particular charity and provided that they obtain the individual&#039;s consent for this disclosure, the Data Protection Act will not prevent it and the charities such as U Can Do I.T. would receive the referrals that they seek.

</p>

<a name="50321-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>In addition, when someone is known to be disabled, there is nothing to prevent the body holding the list asking whether they would like some information about relevant charities. That would obviously give them the opportunity to make contact with the relevant charities themselves. However, this amendment extends to arguing that those bodies with lists of disabled people should be allowed to make routine disclosures of information about disabled individuals, regardless of whether that individual has been asked if he would like this disclosure to occur and regardless of any wish he might have to keep information about his disability private and restricted only to those who need to know it.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Although we appreciate the good intention of the proposal, we do not believe that it is the case that all charities have a legitimate need to know about the disabilities of everyone who comes into contact with a particular government department, particularly in the case of those individuals who have no interest in the work of that charity, whether they might benefit from it or not. Given that the legislation does not prohibit the sharing of data, in our view it is difficult to justify such an exemption from the fair processing requirements. The fact that somebody is disabled surely cannot mean they should have the choice to determine who processes data relating to their disability withdrawn.

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>The amendment does not work as the noble Lord would seek for it to work. In fact, it probably goes much further than that and could lead to some unintended and harmful consequences. If we accepted the amendment, it would certainly put at risk some people who have a particular disability and who want their privacy and individual circumstances protected and disguised. For those reasons, we could not possibly accept the amendment.

<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="50321-43_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury </b>   moved Amendment No. 187AA:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>After Clause 67, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_16"></a><br>
   &quot;POWER OF COMMISSION TO REQUIRE CHARITY&#039;S NAME TO BE CHANGED

<br>
   In section 6 of the 1993 Act (power of commissioners to require charity&#039;s name to be changed) for subsection (3) substitute&#151;


<br>
&quot;(3)   Any direction given by virtue of section (2)(a) above must&#151;


<br>
(a)   not be given if the charity has obtained the written consent of the Commission prior to adopting the registered name;


<br>
(b)   not be given until the Commission has consulted all charities with the same or the like name; and


<br>
(c)   be given within twelve months of the time when the registered name was entered in the register in respect of the charity.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_203"></a>The noble Lord said: The name of the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Neill of Bengarve, is appended to the amendment. She presents her apologies to the Committee but has to be in Cambridge at this time.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The provisions of Clause 6 of the Charities Act 1993, which currently determine the power of the Charity Commission to require a charity to change its name are not adequate for the circumstances in which some charities find themselves. Other Members of the Committee may have their own stories, but we have had two cases in our office in the past two or three years of well-known and well-established charities finding that other charities have been allowed onto the register with names so similar as to cause serious misunderstanding on the part of the public.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>Given the arrangements as they currently are, in the light of those two cases&#151;which were both pursued with some vigour by the charities involved, which were upset by the new charities coming on to the register with similar names&#151;there is some real need for some changes to Section 6 of the Charities Act 1993. My amendment would add to that section, which is structured so as to give the Charity Commission powers to direct a charity to change its name within a year or a shorter period, if it is so determined, if&#151;and that is the point&#151;it is a registered charity and its name is the same as or, in the opinion of the commissioners, too like the name of another charity.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>I should add that there are other grounds on which a commission can make a direction. For example, it can do so if the name is misleading as to the purposes or activities of a charity, or includes part of a name of a charity controlled by regulations made by the Secretary of State&#151;using very common names, such as &quot;international&quot;, and so on. It can make a direction if there is an element in it that is misleading as to the work and activities of the charities involved, or if it is offensive. But the amendment deals with only the first basis on which the commissioners can direct the change of name&#151;when there is a similarity of names.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>The amendment says that the commission cannot give a direction when the charity involved as obtained the written consent of the commission prior to adopting its name. That would be one way of assuring a charity, it was not thereafter put to huge discomfort, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC60"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expense, disruption and all the rest of it by the commission deciding that after it has registered it was too like the name of an existing charity. That would allow a pre-vetting procedure, which would be perfectly easy for the commission to deal with.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>Such a provision would mean that you could write on behalf of a client charity and say that it proposed to call itself &quot;this&quot;, which would give the Charity Commission time to respond and say, &quot;We are anxious because there is another charity already called &#039;that&#039;&quot;. You could engage in such a correspondence, at the end of which the commission would or would not give consent. If it did, there would be no question of it afterwards deciding to issue a direction.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The second point of the amendment is that any direction must not be given until the commission has consulted all charities with a similar name. In one of the cases to which I referred when opening my remarks, one has to observe that the commission allowed on to the register another charity with a very similar name without any consultation with the charity with that name.
</p>

<a name="50321-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Finally, the third limb of the amendment is that the direction must be given within 12 months of the time when the charity was registered with that name, which replicates existing Section 6(3) of the Charities Act 1993. I commend this amendment for the Committee&#039;s support. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="50321-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has said, the amendment seeks to ensure that when the commission exercises its power to direct a charity to change its name there are safeguards to ensure that the commission does not act without proper care.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>I shall take some time to set out the current situation and how it works under the Charities Act 1993. Under the Act, the commission has power to direct a charity to change its name in certain circumstances; that is, the charity must be a registered charity and the name must be the same as or, in the opinion of the commissioners, too like the name of any other registered or non-registered charity at the time that the charity&#039;s name in question was entered on the register.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I hope that it will help the Committee if I give just a bit of background about the way in which the commission operates its current<i> </i>discretionary power. The commission must operate the power in accordance with administrative and human rights law. It will make a direction for a charity to change its name in order to protect the public, as contributors to charities, from being misled about the identity of the body to which they are contributing and to avoid similar confusion among potential beneficiaries. The commission operates on the clear presumption in favour of requiring a change of name in any circumstance where the use of identical or similar names is likely to mislead the public.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>By entering a charity name on the register, the commission is not consenting to the charity using a name. It cannot&#151;unlike the Registrar of Companies&#151;refuse to register a charity because it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC61"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

disapproves of its name or refuses to place on the register a new name validly adopted by a registered charity. Nor can the commission guarantee in registering a name that another charity will not have, for instance, protected the name as a trademark or otherwise.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>The commission has used the power to make a direction very rarely. It can think of only one occasion since the power was given in the 1993 Act. When an organisation applies to register, it checks the Central Register of Charities for similar names, and if it finds another charity with a similar name, the organisation applying for registration will usually voluntarily choose a different name.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>In practice, there are some organisations on the register with similar names, but the commission does not make a direction where the risk of confusion is negligible. For example, where two village halls were both called &quot;Springfield Village Hall&quot;, but one was in Norfolk and the other was in Nottinghamshire, the risk of confusion is very low. The commission&#039;s guidance to its caseworkers on that issue is published on its website and the criteria for deciding if a name is too similar, or if a similar name would be too misleading, are all there in the public domain.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>The first part of the amendment seeks to ensure that the commission should not direct a charity to change its name if the charity has obtained the written consent of the commission prior to adopting its name. In fact, the only circumstance in which the commission could properly exercise its power to make a direction to change a name, having previously consented in writing to its adoption, is likely to be where the original consent was made by mistake or on a misrepresentation. If that part of the amendment were accepted, it would impede the commission in protecting the public against being misled as to which charity they are giving money to or receiving services from, where consent has been obtained from the commission by misleading or incomplete information.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>The second part of the amendment seeks to ensure that the commission cannot make a direction until it has consulted all charities with the same or like name. Currently, when considering whether to make a direction, the commission takes into account relevant information from charities which appear to be directly affected. The commission will set out its reasoning for intending to make a direction to trustees directly affected, and allows them the opportunity to comment. Existing charities with a similar name to the charity which the commission is thinking about directing to change its name are in any case likely to agree that the commission should make the direction on the charity in question.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>There are also some practical obstacles to accepting this part of the amendment. There is, in fact, no definitive list of charities as many are excepted and exempt and the commission does not hold a register of such charities. So the commission could not consult all charities, although it could consult all registered charities. However, this would not necessarily be the best use of resources in all cases. This part of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC62"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column GC62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment does not allow for any consideration of whether the decision and any particular harm in that particular case merits that level of resource.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>The third part of the amendment repeats the current requirement that any direction must be made within 12 months of the charity&#039;s name being registered.
</p>

<a name="50321-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I hope that I have explained sufficiently the way in which the commission currently exercises its power. I should perhaps remind the Committee that it is exercised only very rarely. The commission takes the exercise of the power very seriously as it clearly concerns an important aspect of a charity&#039;s identity, but the regulator needs sufficient room in which to manoeuvre in order to ensure that the public are not misled. We believe that the current power strikes the right and appropriate balance.

<a name="50321-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. He slid over the most important first limb of the amendment in a rather naughty way.

<a name="50321-44_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>The Bill is littered with references to &quot;charity trustee&quot; and &quot;trustee for a charity&quot;. I fondly but ill-advisedly thought that by putting this amendment into the interpretation clause, Clause 70, I could save an awful lot of time and confusion throughout the Bill. However, since discussing the matter with the Minister&#039;s excellent officials, I realise that this is a bridge too far. However, I have no doubt the Minister will wish to read into the record one of the most turgid and downbeat ends to any committee&#039;s consideration of any Bill in parliamentary history. I leave him to it. I beg to move.

<a name="50321-44_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>I am minded not to read the account into the record, other than to simply say that the amendment would create more confusion. In the Bill as drafted we have put either &quot;charity trustee&quot; or &quot;trustee for a charity&quot; or both, depending on which trustees we wanted to refer to. With this amendment it would then be necessary to work out in each case from the context whether the definition of &quot;charity trustee&quot; was intended to include a &quot;trustee for a charity&quot;. We do not want to go along that route and I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, does either. I can therefore confidently predict that he will withdraw his amendment.

There have been many amendments which have come through from the charitable sector. I think that it is universally felt that the Bill has had a good airing and that all the sector&#039;s points have had a chance to be ventilated and given expression. That is an important part of our process. The Minister has been extremely tolerant of the mud that has been thrown at him, and the Bill team have been assiduous in the notes that they have passed to him to keep those of us on this side of the Committee on the straight and narrow. So I should like to place on record our thanks to him and to the Bill team for the courtesy and consideration they have shown us.

As a mere bit player, I should like to say that the noble Lords, Lord Phillips of Sudbury and Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, have towed well and hard in moving these amendments.

However, all of us, had this been in local government, would have been declaring an interest and walking out and we would not have been able to have a Bill.

<a name="50321-45_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Northern Ireland: Strategic Framework for Good Relations</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="50321-45_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="50321-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>This Statement sets out how I intend to take forward the policy and strategic framework for good relations in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="50321-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The Government&#039;s vision for the future of Northern Ireland is that of a peaceful, prosperous, stable and fair society firmly founded on the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance and mutual trust and the protection and vindication of human rights for all. The founding principles of partnership, equality and mutual respect ensure a basis for good relationships.
</p>

<a name="50321-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The publication of the policy today sets out our aim establishing over time a shared society defined by a culture of tolerance; a normal, civic society, in which all individuals are considered as equals, which respects diversity and where violence is an illegitimate means to resolve differences, but where differences are resolved through dialogue in the public sphere. The policy document outlines realistically the scale of the challenge and that good relations will build on the significant progress of the equality agenda.

</p>

<a name="50321-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>The policy objectives to achieve the policy aim include: eliminating sectarianism, racism and all forms of prejudice to enable people to live and work without fear or intimidation; reducing tension and conflict at interface areas; facilitating the development of a shared community where people wish to learn, live, work and play together; promoting civic-mindedness via citizenship education through school and lifelong learning; protecting members of minorities (whether for example by religion, race or any other grounds) and mixed marriages from intimidation and ensure perpetrators are brought to justice; ensure that all public services are delivered impartially and guided by economy, efficiency and effectiveness; shaping policies, practices and institutions to enable trust and good relations to grow; encouraging understanding of the complexity of our history, through museums and a common school curriculum; supporting cultural projects which highlight the complexity and overlapping nature of identities and their wider global connections; supporting and learning from organisations working across ethnic divides for reconciliation, including those operating on a north-south basis; ensuring that voice is given to the diverse victims of violence in Northern Ireland, including via archives and victim-centred reconciliation events; encouraging communication, tolerance and trust across Northern Ireland, but particularly in areas where communities are living apart; promoting dialogue between, and mutual understanding <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="50321-45_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr   Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="50321-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>I am today placing in the Libraries of both Houses copies of a new paper entitled <i>Fighting Poverty to Build a Safer World: a Strategy for Security and Development</i> published by the Department for International Development (DfID).
</p>

<a name="50321-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The strategy&#151;which has been produced in close consultation with other government departments, NGOs, researchers, the UN and other international organisations&#151;analyses the links between security and development. It shows how we can better promote the security of the poor, and suggests ways in which the international system can better achieve both security and development goals.
</p>

<a name="50321-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Security matters for poor people in poor countries. In times of peace, they are the worst affected by violent crime, lawlessness and state-sanctioned abuse; and in times of conflict, millions of poor people have been killed, injured or forced from their homes. So the poor need security as much as they need clean water, schooling or affordable health.
</p>

<a name="50321-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>DfID has been at the forefront of international efforts to promote security for poor people. We have initiated programmes to support police and security sector reform in developing countries, in order to make these public services more effective and accountable; we have improved access to justice for poor people; we have tackled poor governance; and we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS3"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column WS3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have developed ways of analysing conflict and insecurity, including their impact on the poor. But we need to do more. Our aim is to promote security as a basic entitlement of poor people.
</p>

<a name="50321-45_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>The strategy explains how we will put the safety and security of the poor at the heart of our development work. We will make more use of political and conflict analysis in our programme design; pay greater attention to how regional and global conflict and insecurity affect the poor in countries where we work; focus our work to improve governance more directly on the security of the poor, including giving more attention to the role of security and police services and the judiciary; link conflict prevention and conflict reduction more regularly into our programmes; and work with a wider range of civil society organisations, so as to build relationships with groups with different views on development.
</p>

<a name="50321-45_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>To implement the strategy, we will work closely with other government departments, international organisations including the European Union and the United Nations, and governments and communities in our partner countries.

<a name="50321-46_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Legal Services Reform</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="50321-46_spmin0"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  On 15 December 2004, I informed the House that I had warmly welcomed Sir David Clementi&#039;s report on the regulation of legal services in England and Wales and broadly accepted his main recommendations. Since publication of the report, I have met key stakeholders, including consumer groups, a number of times. In the course of these meetings we have built a strong consensus in support of consumer-focused reform of legal services.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>I will publish a White Paper later this year. I will set out detailed proposals for a legal services board. Regulatory powers will be vested in the board, and delegated by it to the professional bodies, as long as they meet the standards the board sets. The professional bodies will be required to separate their regulatory and representative functions.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>The White Paper will set out the arrangements for appointing members to the legal services board, and will propose a lay chair and a lay majority with appointments being made on merit, by the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. The board will have a range of sanctions available. The White Paper will set these out, but I expect them to include setting targets, imposing fines, issuing guidance, directing a professional body and removing one or more regulatory powers, with the board ultimately having the power to remove regulatory powers from any professional body which has failed. Taken together, these arrangements provide a robust framework that will promote consumer interests.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>I accept Sir David&#039;s recommendation for an office for legal complaints. This will be simpler for consumers to use and understand and will provide consistent, fair and professional handling of cases for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS4"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column WS4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

all complainants. As with the Legal Services Board, the White Paper will set out the detailed arrangements, but I expect the office will also be led by a board with a lay chair and a lay majority.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>I warmly welcome Sir David&#039;s proposals to facilitate the creation of new business structures. Non-lawyers will be able for the first time to become managers, owners or investors in legal practices. This will create an opportunity to bring in new capital and develop new ways of working that should benefit consumers. Robust safeguards will be established to protect the consumer and the profession&#039;s reputation.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>Many of the changes that will be outlined in the White Paper will require legislation and I intend to bring forward that legislation when parliamentary time allows. I am committed to legislating to bring the regulatory framework I have described into full effect.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>I can announce today that I have set up a consumer panel to advise the Government as we take forward reforms. The panel will comprise representatives from Citizens Advice, the Federation of Small Businesses, the National Consumer Council, the Welsh Consumer Council and <i>Which?</i>.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>Going forward, I will continue to work closely with all interested parties to ensure that we establish a new framework for the regulation of legal services that protects and promotes the needs of consumers and allows the legal profession to flourish and retain its reputation as the best in the world.

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="50321-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Sport and Tourism (Mr. Richard Caborn) made the following Written Ministerial Statement on 18 March.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS6"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column WS6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50321-46_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>It remains the Government&#039;s view that commercial agreements between the relevant parties provide the appropriate long-term basis for the funding of racing. However, in the light of a judgment by the European Court of Justice last September it has become clear that the British Horseracing Board is not in a position to proceed immediately with its plans to fund racing by the sale of database rights in place of the current statutory levy. Following consultations with the Horserace Betting Levy Board, the British Horseracing Board and the Association of British Bookmakers, I have therefore accepted the interim recommendations made by the independent review group, chaired by Lord Donoughue, that more time is needed to develop the commercial options and that it is in the public interest in the well-being of the sport that the levy arrangements should therefore remain in place for a further limited period. We will accordingly be making an order under Part 2 of the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004 to end the levy on 31 March 2009, and to close the levy board six months later.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>I welcome the agreement of the parties that Lord Donoughue&#039;s group should continue to explore the commercial options, considering all areas relating to the funding of racing which it believes are relevant to establishing appropriate post-levy arrangements, with a view to preparing a final report this autumn. It will then be for the British Horseracing Board and the other parties to work towards putting agreed arrangements in place to meet the above timescale.

</p>

<a name="50321-46_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a>In the mean time it is important that racing continues to take forward the modernisation of its structures, with priority being given to the establishment of an independent regulatory authority.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>It is also important that, both now and after the ending of the levy arrangements, there continues to be proper financial support for the advancement of veterinary science and education and for the improvement of breeds of horses, which are the levy board&#039;s other statutory purposes. I have therefore made clear the Government&#039;s wish to see the board, while it continues in being, take over the funding commitments previously given by the British Horseracing Board in respect of the Equine Fertility Unit and the equine genome project; to maintain support for veterinary science and education at 2.5 per cent of levy income and for breed societies at no less than current levels; to take forward consideration of the establishment of a university chair in the field of equine veterinary science; and to complete the grant to the national stud, for which budget provision was previously made, on the stud&#039;s proposed re-establishment as an independent charitable trust.
</p>

<a name="50321-46_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work of the members and staff of the levy board, who have been contending with an extended period of uncertainty, and of their commitment to running the levy arrangements effectively for longer than had previously been expected.

<a name="50321-47_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Inheritance Tax and Pensions </h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="50321-47_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My right honourable friend the Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="50321-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a>We have been asked to clarify how inheritance tax (IHT) will apply to choices made by pension scheme members under the new simplified pension regime, and in particular what the implications are when scheme members opt for an alternative secured pension rather than taking an annuity at age 75 as they have been obliged to do in the past.
</p>

<a name="50321-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a>The same broad principles will continue to apply to the new regime as they have done to the old rules, and as they do to any other situation where people are able to make choices affecting their future wealth and that of others.
</p>

<a name="50321-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>People are broadly treated as making a taxable transfer for IHT purposes when they omit to increase their own wealth in favour of increased wealth for others, just as they are when they transfer to others, wealth that they already have. This is a principle of general application, and has always applied to choices under pension schemes as it has to any other choices that people make about their wealth. It is important that we maintain this principle, both in the interests of fairness between taxpayers and to ensure that pension funds remain dedicated primarily to providing retirement income.
</p>

<a name="50321-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a>The Inland Revenue published a statement of practice in 1992 setting out when IHT would be applied to choices made under the pension rules in force at that time. A new and wider range of choices will be available under the simplified regime, and that statement will no longer be valid. Treatment broadly comparable to that in the statement may remain appropriate in some situations, but in others that is clearly no longer so.
</p>

<a name="50321-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>I have asked the Revenue to open discussions with interested parties to seek a consensus on the detailed application of IHT law to the new situations arising under the simplified regime, and on how in practice cases which are chargeable should be identified and any charge should be quantified. The Revenue will shortly be publishing a consultation document setting out its analysis of the IHT issues as a basis for these discussions.
</p>

<a name="50321-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>ASPs were designed to provide an alternative to annuitisation for those with religious objections to risk pooling. They were not meant as a vehicle for inter-generational transfers by scheme members generally, and the Government will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that they are not being used for avoidance.

</p>

<a name="50321-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a>On 30 November 2004 (<i>Official Report</i>, cols. <i>24&#150;27 WS</i>) I announced the publication of an Implementation Framework for Reconfiguring the Department of Health&#039;s Arm&#039;s Length Bodies (ALBs) and achieving its three overarching objectives:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>a 50 per cent reduction in the number of ALBs;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>a saving in expenditure by ALBs of &#163;0.5 billion by 2007&#150;08; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>a reduction in posts of 25 per cent in the same period.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="50321-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a>The ALB change programme is part of a wider programme to improve efficiency and cut bureaucracy in the management of the National Health Service. The aim of these activities is to reduce the burden on the front line and free up more resources for the delivery of front line services to patients and users. This wider programme is to ensure that the increased investment in the NHS&#151;42 per cent in real terms from    2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08&#151;is accompanied by modernisation that cuts out waste.
</p>

<a name="50321-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a>Today I am announcing the achievement of a further milestone towards the ALB change programme&#039;s key objectives. In November 2004 we made the following commitment as a first step towards our savings target on ALB expenditure:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>&quot;Even with these new functions, which bring new costs, we will be setting the 2005&#150;06 budget for the ALB sector so that it will cost about &#163;100 million a year less to run than in 2003-04.&quot;
</p>
</ul>
<a name="50321-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a>I am pleased to report that I am today setting budgets for the operating costs of ALBs for 2005&#150;06 which will reduce Department of Health funding by in excess of &#163;150 million compared with 2003&#150;04. This is despite the fact that in 2004&#150;05 the ALB sector assumed new functions agreed by Parliament that increased the sector&#039;s costs substantially. A significant <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS9"></a>

<b>21 Mar 2005 : Column WS9</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proportion of the savings generated in Department of Health funding will be redeployed for investment in front line healthcare. We have additionally provided some &#163;50 million to fund one-off identified costs in ALBs. This includes initiatives which will deliver savings in future years and enable us to continue the downward trend in operating costs for the ALB sector when we set budgets for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<a name="50321-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a>In setting the 2005&#150;06 budgets, we have:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>invested in ALBs which deliver front line healthcare, like the National Blood Authority (an increase in Department of Health funding of more than &#163;38 million over 2003&#150;04), or carry out crucial work to protect public health, like the Health Protection Agency (an increase in Department of Health funding of more than &#163;36 million over 2003&#150;04);

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>achieved the greatest savings in ALBs which provide central services to front line NHS organisations. The reduction in Department of Health funding for this group of ALBs comes to more than &#163;220 million compared to 2003-04 and provides a lower cost-base for overheads in future years; and

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>met our commitment that spending on ALBs undertaking inspection and regulation will not exceed 0.4 per cent of the national spend on the NHS and social care and made progress on our policy of full cost-recovery for work relating to the independent health and social care sector.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="50321-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a>Alongside these savings, we are also on course for ALBs to generate very substantial savings for the NHS front line by improving the efficiency of the services they provide centrally on behalf of the NHS.
</p>

<a name="50321-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a>We expect to generate further savings of over &#163;100 million in 2005&#150;06 from new national framework agreements let by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) alone. This follows savings of over &#163;25 million in 2004&#150;05. PASA is on target to achieve savings of &#163;240 million per annum by 2007&#150;08 for the NHS. Work is also under way to deliver efficiencies in the services offered by other ALBS. Taken together, this puts us well on course to meet or exceed our commitment to deliver &#163;250 million to the front line by the end of 2007&#150;08 through efficiencies generated by ALBs, as promised in the 30 November 2004 implementation framework.

<a name="50321-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a>The major reconfiguration of individual ALBs is also on course. The total number of ALBs will have reduced from 38 in 2003&#150;04 to 34 on 1 April and is on course to reduce further to 31 by 1 October this year. The changes are:

The total grant in aid provided by the department in 2003&#150;04 was &#163;1,265 million. Therefore the 2005&#150;06 grant in aid is over &#163;150 million less than that included in 2003&#150;04 operating costs. We have additionally funded &#163;50 million one-off costs in order to enable further recurrent savings in later years.

<a name="50321-48_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Adult Social Care: Green Paper</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_10"></a>
<a name="50321-48_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="50321-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a>I am announcing today the publication of the Green Paper <i>Independence, Well-being and Choice: our vision for the future of social care for adults in England</i> (Cm 6499).
</p>

<a name="50321-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a>This is an important part of our modernisation programme for public services and will set the social care agenda for the next decade. Formal consultation will enable us to develop firm proposals which will transform the lives of people who use social care by giving them more control and more choice in helping them to decide how their needs can best be met.
</p>

<a name="50321-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a>These ambitions are based on what people who use services told us they would like to see. Turning this shared vision into reality will mean that social care services will have to be redesigned to give people more control over their assessments and how the money is spent. But this is not just about social care services. We want to see the capacity of the whole community harnessed to make sure that people have access to the full range of universal services to secure the best possible outcomes for all adults.
</p>

<a name="50321-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a>The key proposals in the paper include the wider use of direct payments and the piloting of individual budgets to stimulate the development of modern services delivered in a way that people want; a strong strategic and leadership role for local government; closer working between health and social care sectors and greater involvement for the community and voluntary sector; plans to stimulate care capacity and informal caring; and encouraging the use of new models of service delivery, including assistive technology and extra care housing, and a greater focus on preventive services.

<a name="50321-48_para4"></a>

Following the election, the Minister of Home Affairs confirmed to DfID that it was the government of Malawi&#039;s intention to inquire into the shootings in May 2004. He has since advised that investigations are on-going. The Malawi Government have no plans to reopen enquiries into the earlier shootings at present.

Seven donor (sponsor) countries and 37 beneficiary countries have signed the agreement so far. All seven sponsoring members (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK) have pledged funding towards AITIC&#039;s first five years of operation as an intergovernmental organisation. This is laid down in Annexe I to the agreement.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>It is not possible to give a date when Professor Greenwood ended his assistance in relation to this issue. He has been instructed on a number of occasions by government departments in relation to a variety of different legal issues relating to the conflict and its aftermath and is currently acting in the case of <i>R</i> (on the application of Al-Skeini and others) v <i>the Secretary of State for Defence</i> concerning civilian deaths in Iraq, which has now reached the Court of Appeal.
</p>

<a name="50321w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>Over the same period, Professor Greenwood was instructed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office and the Cabinet Office in relation to a number of other legal issues not connected to the Iraq conflict. Details of the issues on which Professor Greenwood has been instructed to provide legal advice are withheld on the grounds that this would disclose information related to the formation of government policy. Professor Greenwood has, however, acted for the Government in relation to a number of cases in the domestic and international courts during this period: the Ojdanic case in the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; <i>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</i> v <i>United Kingdom</i> in the International Court of Justice; the General Assembly request to the ICJ for an advisory opinion on the Palestinian wall (UK observations on admissibility); <i>R</i> (on the application of the European Roma Rights Centre and others) v <i>Immigration Officer at Prague Airport and others</i>; and <i>R</i> (on the application of Abbasi and Mubanga) v <i>the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and others</i>. Professor Greenwood also acted in relation to the individual SIAC appeals and the SIAC derogation appeal before the Court of Appeal and House of Lords, although he did not appear in court in these cases.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>Information about Professor Greenwood&#039;s professional fees is not held centrally as he has been instructed by several different government departments. While every effort has been made to provide full and complete information, records do not exist to verify precisely what fees have been charged on all matters going back to January 2003. The best information that can be obtained is that, as at 21 March 2005, his professional fees in relation to work connected with the conflict in Iraq amounted to approximately &#163;46,000 (excluding VAT). As at the same date, his fees in relation to other matters amounted to approximately &#163;53,500 (excluding VAT).

<a name="50321w02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 provides that a country may freely appoint its own nationals as members of the diplomatic staff of its diplomatic mission. However, the consent of the receiving state is required where a person is a national of the country he is appointed to represent and also a national of the receiving country or is a national only of the receiving state. Whether or not a person holds the citizenship of a third country is not relevant to his or her acceptance as a member of a mission. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would not consider British nationality a bar to the appointment of a person to the diplomatic mission of a country of which they are also   nationals. As indicated in my reply to the noble Lord on 10 January 2005 (<i>Official Report</i>, col. WA 3&#150;WA 4), we estimate that fewer than 10 members of diplomatic missions in London hold British citizenship, but that accurate details could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_29"></a>Whether those consultations which they carried out prior to the introduction of general shooting licence WLF 18 complied with the Code of Practice on Consultations.   [HL1690]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_26"></a>
<a name="50321w04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   In April 2004 a consultation document on the review of general licences was sent to 92 stakeholder groups. This documentation was also published on the Defra website. The 12 week written consultation period concluded on 14 July 2004. Further extensions to the closing date were given to particular organisations where they requested more time to prepare their responses. The timescale for responses was therefore well in excess of the required 12 weeks and involved a wide range of interests.
</p>

<a name="50321w04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_18"></a>Defra officials carefully and open-mindedly analysed all 218 responses received. In addition, they pro-actively held discussions with organisations representing conservation and shooting interests. The validity period of the old general licences was specifically extended from 31 December 2004 to 28 February 2005 to allow such analysis and discussions to take place.
</p>

<a name="50321w04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_19"></a>It was not possible for Defra officials fully to prepare and publish a summary of responses within the recommended three month period. Priority was given to analysing responses and revising general licences before the old licences expired on 28 February 2005. Officials are now in the process of preparing a summary document for publication.

cross reference it with other data sets. There is, however, no standard definition of a beach or a definitive list of all beaches in England. Therefore, no comprehensive data are currently available on English beaches with which to cross reference the data on SSSIs. Some 362 SSSIs have part of their area between mean high water and mean low water marks. The total area of these 362 sites is 355,000 hectares and will include large muddy inter-tidal areas such as the Wash and Morecambe Bay, as well as sandy or shingle areas known as beaches. Using data from the Environment Agency, 302 of the designated coastal EU bathing waters are found within 210 SSSIs in England.

<a name="50321w04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_23"></a>In 2003-04 the overall cost of bovine TB testing in Great Britain was &#163;33.2 million and compensation (including salvage, valuation and haulage) was &#163;34.4 million.
