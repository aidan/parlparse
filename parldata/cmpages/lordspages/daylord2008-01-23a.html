Under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, details of individuals are not publishable because it could affect public safety.

We have cleared two-thirds of Northumberland and, by the end of the year, hope to have cleared the whole of Northumberland of grey squirrels. But we have a problem: the public perception is that grey squirrels are being released by Defra in the north of England. What efforts are being taken to inform the public that the release of grey squirrels is not taking place in the north of England?</p>

There are lots of rules about where they can be released&#151;roughly within one kilometre of where they were captured. They are taken only on welfare grounds and, notwithstanding the difficulties of the red squirrel, I do not think that six is a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="08012362000023">We have to remember that the grey squirrel is the only wildlife that most urban dwellers see in their gardens. The fact that it is a pest and is driving the red squirrel out is a serious problem. However, the issue of grey squirrels being released is not a factor, because they are not allowed to be released in areas where the red squirrel lives. We know where they are: on the islands, in the north of England and in the buffer zones. While I am on this topic, the Red Alert North England partnership has 16 forest areas in the north of England where there is the greatest chance of maintaining the red squirrel. I want to announce that Forestry Commission Woodland Improvement Grants are available to support red squirrel conservation work. The application for those grants closes on 29 February. Red squirrel conservation work is currently undersubscribed.</p>

Will the Minister confirm that the red cannot coexist with the grey and that 85 per cent of the existing English red squirrels are in the Kielder Forest? Will he further confirm that Natural England will not issue licences for the release of any grey squirrels in the northern counties, and will he look again at extending that to include the northern part of Lancashire, which is very near some of the buffer zones in the Craven district of North Yorkshire?</p>

We are incredibly sympathetic to protecting the native red squirrel. However, I have to go with the facts I have. As I said, licences are very restrictive about who can release. As I also pointed out, in the only year for which we have release data available, six grey squirrels were released under licence out of a population of more than 2 million. I cannot claim that is a serious problem. They were released under very restrictive licence conditions. However, I shall be happy to look at the Lancashire border zones, as my noble friend asked.</p>

It is the responsibility of landowners to control grey squirrels on their land. There is a set of rules about capturing grey squirrels and where they can be released.

It is a pity about what has happened to the red squirrel population due to grey squirrels having been introduced from the United States. Some European countries are now having the same experience as us; by overprotecting the grey squirrel, they are losing their red squirrels. They have not learnt the lessons that we have. But we are considering the interests of biodiversity where release of the grey does not pose a threat. I am not against red squirrels, but only six greys have been released under a very strict licence issued by Natural England on wildlife grounds.</p>

There are a lot more greys than reds, of course. Greys also live at much greater density, hence their prevalence in urban areas. There are up to 18 per hectare as compared with an average of one per hectare for red squirrels. Moreover, greys are more able to recover from environmental impacts and disease, so they are much more immune in that sense than the red&#151;hence the demise of the red. But people like to see squirrels in their gardens. However, I should add that not everybody likes them in their gardens. I am trying to cut down on the letters and e-mails.</p>

I believe that he will share the concern of many in this House about the increasing disconnection between Parliament and the people. There are specialist programmes, not least on the BBC, but you have to turn them on especially to listen to them and the routine day-to-day work of both Houses seldom gets a mention. My simple and costless idea would constantly remind the public, both consciously and subconsciously, of where the governance of this country springs from, or at least where it ought to spring from. I hope the noble Lord agrees that we all too easily take democracy for granted and that ideas such as this one surely give it a helping hand.</p>

As he will appreciate&#151;we recently discussed a similar Question&#151;it is a very big step indeed to move from seeking to make the public more aware of Parliament&#146;s work and this House&#146;s responsibility, which this House is increasingly discharging, to giving instructions to broadcasters, when we pride ourselves on the fact that broadcasters are independent of government.</p>

It would be no bad thing if the noble Lord, Lord Vinson, and others wrote in to raise the point with the director-general, who is open to some creative thinking. What is rather more worrying is the decision by the independent television authorities to restrict coverage in the regional areas of Britain. It causes me some concern.</p>

As I think I said when the noble Lord, Lord Vinson, asked this Question in October, is not part of the solution to give broadcasters, and through them the public, greater and easier access to what goes on in this place?

Six hundred thousand children have been lifted out of relative poverty and the number of children living in absolute poverty has more than halved, from 3.4 million to 1.6 million, a fall of 1.8 million children. My noble friend is right to point out that there is an issue concerning the so-called working poor. The new PSA that the departments have published focuses on that.

Child poverty is a relative measure, based on children below 60 per cent of median average earnings. This means that, as earnings rise by average wage rates but benefits rise only by prices, if the Government do nothing at all, even though the country is getting wealthier, the number of poor children must increase. Therefore, does he agree that we must not only ensure that poor children of lone parents get maintenance and that lone parents get back into the labour market, but recognise that half of all poor children are in large families in which the parents are often in work? We may need to rebalance the tax credit system away from supporting the first child and rather more towards supporting the later children, as most of Europe does.</p>

Obviously, the Government will consider all these issues and deal with them appropriately at Budget and PBR time. My noble friend is right that the measure that we use, which is relative low income, is 60 per cent of current median income, rather than average income. However, that is not the only measure that we use. She is also right to say that if all we did was increase benefits by inflation, not earnings, there would be, in a sense, a downwards escalator. However, that is not all that we do. We have announced child benefit increases in excess of inflation and earnings and we have introduced changes to the child element of the child tax credit above linked earnings. As she is

I want to find out whether this will have a detrimental effect on on-site regeneration renewables, which might well be limited in their potential under the trading scheme to earn ROCs. This issue seems quite technical, but could have a major effect on the implementation of companies on site building micro-generation schemes which would reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. However, we believe that if Clause 36 is implemented there might be a significant problem with them claiming ROCs. I may be completely wrong on this issue but I very much hope that the Government will look at this potential problem. The whole purpose of the Bill is to reduce the release of carbon dioxide. Therefore, anything that reduces the incentive for private firms to build microgeneration schemes would be detrimental.</p>

We wanted more discussion of Clause 36 because there is concern about the issue of emission trading systems generally. We on these Benches welcome emission trading systems because they are an efficient means of reducing carbon emissions. The financial community is concerned about schemes such as the CRC, which is excellent in its own way, and the amount of trading that can take place. The number of units under the CRC, for instance, which will be the first emission trading system to be introduced under the Bill in 2010, will not be enough commercially to sustain a market. As the majority of these units will be used by those organisations that ask for an allocation in terms of an auction, is the Minister convinced that a trading system will work and that there will be sufficient liquidity in the market to make these instruments something of value that can be traded? I understand that most of the organisations involved in the EU ETS do not see the market being of a sufficient size for it to be credible and for there to be the type of market for other instruments that we have talked about under the clean development mechanism and joint implementation in the EU ETS.</p>

We do of course want to encourage the uptake of renewable energy. However, where the carbon savings from renewables are already counted by supplier schemes, perhaps in the form of renewables obligation certificates, there would be double counting if the same units of renewable electricity could count towards the CRC targets. Therefore the proposed approach is to ensure simply that CRC participants do not double count emissions savings.</p>

The proposals have already been the subject of wide consultation, and the Government will publish their response to the latest consultation in February.

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="08012362000099">Clause 37 builds on the provisions set out in Clause 36. While Clause 36 covers schemes which directly and indirectly cause or contribute to emissions, Clause 37 provides more detail on the activities which may be considered indirectly to cause or contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Perhaps I may give a quick example of the distinction between directly and indirectly causing emissions. The former may be the burning of coal which produces greenhouse gases emissions from power station chimneys because the emissions occur directly on-site; the latter relates to the consumption of electricity produced by the power station, wherever this may occur. An example of a trading scheme which targets indirect emissions could be one which targets the supply of heating fuel. This could be regarded as relating to indirect emissions as the emissions themselves take place at the point of use by the consumer rather than at the point of sale. However, it would be easier and more cost effective to target the suppliers of the heating fuel through a trading scheme rather than to seek to introduce emissions trading schemes between the millions of consumers of heating fuel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="08012362000100">The Government already have some limited powers to introduce trading schemes relating to direct emissions from a point source such as a power station chimney under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999. However, there are notable gaps in these powers as they apply only to quotas of emissions and would not allow trading schemes to be introduced with the purpose of encouraging activities which reduced the emissions. In addition, those existing powers relate only to direct emissions and would not allow a trading scheme to be introduced which targeted indirect emissions alone or a combination of direct and indirect emissions. For instance, it would not be possible to introduce the new carbon reduction commitment under those existing powers as it targets direct carbon dioxide emissions from the organisations covered by the scheme as well

In short, we need to encourage greater energy efficiency from all parts of the economy if we are to meet our targets. The aim of Clause 37 is to ensure that the trading scheme powers can be appropriately targeted so that all these possible sources of emissions could be included in a trading scheme. The powers fill a gap which currently exists in terms of introducing timely and cost-effective policies to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

Without those powers, the Government would be forced to rely on fiscal measures or regulation to ensure that particular sectors were helping in the fight against climate change. I am sure that Members of the Committee do not intend that potentially more cost-effective trading policies with a lighter touch should not be introduced, because that would be the effect of removing the powers from the Bill.</p>

Under paragraph (a), he uses electricity to operate all his plant. Production of electricity leads to direct emissions. Under paragraph (b), he buys components from specialist manufacturers, which are all direct emitters or use electricity, which is an indirect emitter. Under paragraph (c), the motor manufacturer throws away waste components and off-cuts. Although he did not necessarily use them for the purpose of paragraph (b), it led to effectively throwing away direct or indirect emissions needed in their production. This category is separated from paragraph (b) to provide the exemption for things that are to be recycled&#151;off-cuts are a good example. Under paragraph (d), his cars run on petrol, so their use leads to direct emissions by consumers. That sets out how the different parts of Clause 37 might apply.

Most of us around the Chamber would agree that it is sensible, but I can see this paper trail going everywhere.

The whole point is that there is going to be trading between different suppliers and manufacturers, some of which will not necessarily all be in this country. That is how one would take account of trade between countries. The key issue is that in, let us say, the production of a component that is imported, its carbon footprint must only be counted once in a scheme. Double counting would not make sense. It has to be separated out. As I said, the point of original production is the place to do that.</p>

That is fine, but the trouble when you are operating such a system is that it is not like VAT, where you have a flat rate and everybody knows what the input VAT is. In this instance, we will be dealing with a trading system, and the effect on the outputs will depend on the cost of the certificates that the manufacturer has to purchase to cover that liability.

Obviously I have been inadequate in explaining these matters so far, for which I apologise, but I shall try to answer the question by reading the Bill that we are scrutinising. We are dealing with Clause 37, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"><a name="08012362000313">&#147;For the purposes of this Part activities are regarded as indirectly causing or contributing to greenhouse gas emissions if they involve, in particular&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012362000297">paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d). I recited examples of that in the production of motor vehicles. Clause 36, which we have just passed, defines a trading scheme&#151;at the bottom of page 17&#151;as,</p>
<ul><a name="08012362000334">&#147;a scheme that operates by ... limiting or encouraging ... activities that consist of the emission of greenhouse gas or that cause or contribute, directly or indirectly, to such emissions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012362000298">For the purpose of this part of the Bill, those activities indirectly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions&#151;because there has to be a definition of direct or indirect&#151;are those listed in paragraphs (a) to (d) in Clause 37. I gave the example of a motor vehicle plant. It would not matter where that plant was because the end of Clause 37 says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"><a name="08012362000314">&#147;This Part applies to activities carried on in the United Kingdom, regardless of where the related emissions, reductions or removals of greenhouse gas occur&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012362000299">We have always said that a tonne of carbon anywhere on the planet is a tonne of carbon. It does not matter whether it is in the UK or anywhere else.</p>

Defra&#146;s own documentation says that the CRC, which is the first of the schemes, is expected to cover 52.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is a little under 10 per cent of the UK&#146;s total emissions. I am not sure whether that is after rationalisation and overlaps. At the moment the EU ETS, according to Defra, accounts for some 52 per cent of carbon emissions in the UK under phase 2; we now have this scheme, which goes down to 10 per cent. Having spoken to the Carbon Markets Association and that sort of organisation, I seriously believe that we are already down to a level at which these schemes get quite uneconomic to operate in cost-benefit terms.</p>

I entirely agree that the CRC is hugely less administratively

The CRC already covers all those businesses above &#163;500,000 of electricity or energy costs a year. I would be interested to understand from the Minister what the one after the CRC is likely to be. Surely we need to start using other instruments after that, because I am concerned&#151;as I said earlier on, when the Minister was unable to answer, although I can perhaps understand why&#151;that even with the CRC there is not sufficient liquidity in the market for the serious financial institutions that make these things work, for which London has become a great centre, actually to get involved.</p>

I apologise for not answering the question about liquidity, but I have a better answer than the one that I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, about the administrative burdens. All the issues would have to be looked at when considering whether to develop a scheme. The question would be whether it was too costly or administratively burdensome to introduce a trading scheme, in which case the Government would have to look at other instruments. It is hypothetical, but when there are proposals for a scheme the Government have to consult and Parliament must approve it by affirmative procedure. There is no chance of something that would damage industry in a big way slipping through on the nod, without any debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="08012362000121">On the liquidity of the market, it is expected that the carbon reduction commitment will cover up to 5,000 direct participants. While the volume of each trade may be small, we expect the amount of trades to be considerable; that will be the test of a liquid market. In addition to direct participants, third parties will be able to trade in a secondary market, which will further increase that amount. The noble Lord mentioned the consultation; as I said, the Government will publish our response to that next month and, as part of this process of looking at more detailed aspects of the CRC, we will consider further issues relating to that market.</p>

We have spent hours on this; it is now our sixth day in Committee. That is no criticism, because I want to be able to tell the noble Earl that he ought to be able to rest assured that this is not intended to increase bureaucracy, although there will be an increase.

I am in the business of manufacturing some metallic product; in order to do that I require to purchase energy with a carbon cost, but I trade in the market to buy carbon certificates to cover that cost. That is how the new system will work. As I trade in the market, the price of those certificates will go up and down across the year, depending on circumstances and how people judge the market, and so on. Now, I have to include that cost in my product costs, but the truth is that because it is a variable cost I will not really know the cost of my purchased carbon certificates until I am well into the year, if not until the end of it. I would only then be able to assess what they have actually cost me and make a proper price for goods that I supplied at the beginning of the financial year. That is because we do not immediately know the effect of one on the other. The alternative way is to charge the carbon certificates that you use at a particular time directly on to the cost of your output, but that will mean that, if the cost of carbon certificates fluctuates, the cost of your product will have to fluctuate to take account of that. That seems to me a rather peculiar system to operate.</p>

Amendment No. 165A is a probing amendment designed to elicit the operation of allowances and in particular to examine the scope of the prohibition against the allocation of allowances for money. Perhaps I may give an example. Let us imagine a situation where a large business owned and controlled by one person&#151;perhaps a beef baron or a cereal Croesus. In the unfortunate circumstances of unexpected death or bankruptcy, would the estate be able to sell any allowances left unused against business already completed at the time of death; or would the allowances have to be returned to the scheme pool? Presumably, in the event of a sale, merger, takeover or break-up, the unused allowances would be transferred to the new owners.

The report on the Buncefield explosion indicates that there are infrastructure problems throughout the oil distribution industry. A glance at any local authority asset management plan will identify infrastructure problems with gas mains, school boilers, oil tanks and so on. Any of those could cause a major fire with its attendant emissions.

One of the major flaws with the whole ETS was that the allowances allocated to some energy companies led to a windfall to energy producers. The allocation was probably due to the lobbying power of some of the German energy companies involved in the European scheme. The point of Amendment No. 166 is to say that these allowances should not be allocated. One of the major problems with the ETS is how to keep the price of carbon at a realistic level. If the price collapses, as has happened in the past, the whole basis of the scheme becomes almost irrelevant and the scheme suffers. This is a probing amendment to find out the Government&#146;s view on the value of such a proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="08012362000148">Amendments Nos. 165A, 166 and 166A concern the way in which allowances in trading schemes are allocated to participants. As currently drafted, paragraph 5(4) of Schedule 2 makes it clear that trading scheme regulations introduced by the powers in the Bill may not include provision for allowances to be offered in return for consideration&#151;effectively by auction or otherwise for sale. As the Government explained during pre-legislative scrutiny, we do not consider that it would be appropriate for provisions in regulations made under the Bill to allocate allowances by auction or otherwise for sale. Instead, given the importance of auctioning to government economic policy, with a potentially significant fiscal impact on the UK as a whole, we believe that the right approach is for these powers to be taken through a money Bill. For example, the Finance Bill was the legislative vehicle for introducing provisions to allow for the auction or sale of allowances in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Amendment No. 165A would remove the Bill's provisions on auctioning, and we therefore cannot accept it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="08012362000149">Although it is government policy to push for increased levels of auctioning in trading schemes, as that approach is consistent with the &#147;polluter pays&#148; principle, Amendment No. 166 would be overly restrictive by requiring all allowances in every scheme established by the powers in this part of the Bill to be auctioned post-2012. It is essential that the relevant national authority should be able to decide the right level of auctioning to be used alongside other possible measures, to ensure that environmental goals are achieved effectively and without undermining wider government aims, such as supporting business competitiveness.</p>

<a name="80123-0004.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="08012362000150">That was also the view of the Joint Committee, which stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012362000335">&#147;auctioning allowances might have very different implications depending on the design of different trading schemes, and on the differing economic and administrative circumstances of the participants&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012362000300">It concluded that the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="08012362000336">&#147;should not contain a blanket provision to rule auctioning in or out for all trading schemes, but that rather this should be decided on a case by case basis&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012362000301">We agree with that reasoning and therefore cannot accept Amendment No. 166, which takes that restrictive approach.</p>

However, he did not make it clear that we did not agree with the Government on the first point. We listened to the explanation of why paragraph 5(3)(a) of the schedule was in the draft Bill, but we also pointed out that it appeared to be contradictory to the Government&#146;s intention to decide on auctioning case by case. The Government&#146;s argument was that there were good reasons for auctioning, and I agree with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="08012362000154">We were told that the Government&#146;s legal advice was that this provision would not be an impediment to provision in the Finance Bill. However, we said in paragraph 196 of our report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"><a name="08012362000317">&#147;Notwithstanding this assurance, we continue to have some doubts. The wording of paragraph 5(3)(a) does not limit the powers of the regulations that can be made under the draft Bill, but rather asserts those powers over the method of allocation, and states that this method must be free of charge. Moreover, while paragraph 5(3) states explicitly that &#145;Paragraph (a) does not affect the power to require the payment of a fee&#146; (which we understand to relate to administration fees, rather than the purchasing of allowances), it does not contain an equivalent clarification that the paragraph does not affect the power to auction allowances under other legislation. At the very least, the current wording could cause confusion. We note that some industrial groups have welcomed this provision, potentially under the misapprehension that it was ruling out the use of auctioning for any trading schemes that would be set up in the future. Most importantly, there does not appear to be any need for the provision in paragraph 5(3)(a) at all: were the draft Bill to remain silent about whether allowances would be auctioned it would achieve precisely the Government&#146;s intention, simply through failing to provide the power to introduce auctioning through secondary legislation. Given that the provision in paragraph 5(3)(a) appears to be superfluous as well as problematic, we recommend that it be deleted&#148;.</p>

I simply do not understand why the Government insist on leaving this provision in the Bill. It adds nothing and retracts nothing. We think that there should be the power to auction, and that it is perfectly appropriate that that is done through the Finance Bill. Why on earth should we have a provision in the Bill that is likely to cause confusion and appears to deny the very principle that the Government want to pursue?</p>

In the first quotation I was not quoting a full sentence, because it does not start with a capital letter. I have no advice about what the committee felt about paragraph 5(3). I think he was saying that the committee felt the paragraph was not required.

However, paragraph 5(3) applies to more than just the possibility of allocating by auctioning. It is entirely likely that different trading schemes would require careful thought about how to allocate any quotas, as it were, and that is likely to be different for each scheme. To put it crudely: without involving the question of auctioning, how are we to determine who gets how much? I should have thought that the basis for deciding those principles of allocation would come under paragraph 5(3). I agree that the Joint Committee addressed that matter in considering the issue of auctioning, but I hope my noble friend will agree that paragraph 5(3) would apply to much more than just the question of whether or not to auction.</p>

Therefore, this would probably be covered in the same way. I do not know, but my answer, as an ordinary, reasonable person, is that if a company has purchased something, it becomes an asset of that company, irrespective of what happens to the company. In other words, if a company disappears or gets sold, the assets and whatever it has purchased get transferred. That asset may be intellectual or physical property, or certificates to do certain things. They would go with the company.</p>

What if you are a farmer? One example given by my noble friend concerned foot and mouth disease and the burning of livestock. Surely the Minister would agree that, at the moment, it is not possible to get proportionate insurance against that sort of liability. Indeed, the Minister has a consultation out with the livestock industry at the moment, looking at how cost sharing can happen in the future. His statement is, if he will forgive me for saying so, a bit broad in accepting that it is always possible to take out insurance and for that to be affordable. In some cases&#151;including flooding, which is not a good example&#151;it is not possible to get insurance coverage.

There is no provision for that; I have discussed it with insurers. One could not even offload this. That is why the consultation on cost and responsibility sharing is under way. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, gave examples of what happened in 2001 when the Army commandeered a field, dug a trench and filled it with cattle that had come from all over the place. In those circumstances, that would clearly not be a burden on a particular landowner or farmer. There would have to be a different set of rules for it. That would be force majeure; it would require the national authorities to have some kind of arrangements and regulations to cover it. I do not think that there is a case to be made.

With the first of the amendments we are seeking to secure assurances from the Government on the limits that will be placed on trading overseas credit. In an earlier debate on this topic, my noble friend Lord Cathcart used the analogy of the buying of indulgences. That is a powerful analogy, if one-sided. The philosophical points surrounding the balance between ensuring genuine carbon reductions at home and support for overseas development were covered substantially at Second Reading.</p>

We understand that carbon trading and international offsetting are complicated issues, as the debates this afternoon have demonstrated. However, we still hope that the Minister will be able to furnish the Committee with some idea of the Government&#146;s position on the international offset of emissions at home.</p>

I found myself agreeing strongly with two of the noble Lord&#146;s amendments&#151;those labelled &#147;A&#148;, which perhaps means that they have been tabled more recently than the others. I was glad that he said that Amendment No. 167 is a probing amendment. As he says, the issue is complicated and the development of these schemes will change substantially over time. Therefore, the Committee on Climate Change needs to look at the situation as schemes develop and to produce firm recommendations.</p>

I think that he thought, as I do, that we need to come down from the 40 to 50 per cent level, which has been widely accepted up to now in the international market, and seek advice from the Committee on Climate Change. The figure will change from time to time as the issue develops. I firmly support the two &#147;A&#148; amendments but would leave the other two as probing.</p>

I think that I am right in saying that the amendments apply to individual trading schemes as opposed to the overall figure for the net UK position. As drafted, clearly for probing purposes, Amendment No. 167 indicates a limit of 25 per cent on any scheme, which raises one or two issues. First, is it legally possible under some trading schemes where UK participants are entirely free to trade within the European Union to set a limit on their ability to buy credits from elsewhere in the EU&#151;up to, say, a quarter of their target? As drafted, the amendment raises the issue of whether a limit can be set in UK terms when we are involved in an EU trading scheme. That is an important issue if we apply it not to an overall position but to an individual trading scheme.</p>

<a name="80123-0005.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="08012362000183">The second issue is just to express a doubt. On aviation, it is highly likely that over the years two or three things will happen. First, aviation will continue to grow considerably and we shall be unable to hold that tide back. We may hold it back to a degree but it will continue to grow. Secondly, aviation will not be able to introduce carbon emission reduction schemes fast enough to offset that growth for a considerable time. If, as I understand it, the European scheme sets the cap at the average of the previous three or four years, that raises the interesting question of how aviation will cope. It is likely to be in one of two ways: in the early years by buying credits from outside the European Union, through the clean development mechanism, and so on; and over time by increasingly squeezing other sectors in the EU by pushing up the price of carbon, hence making it expensive for other industries that can undertake carbon emission reduction measures.</p>

<a name="80123-0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="08012362000184">Whether or not aviation would get caught in that would depend very much on its remaining part of the Emissions Trading Scheme in the European Union as a whole, which is the current intention, or on moves being renewed in the European Parliament to keep aviation separate if, despite the current intention, aviation being part of the trading scheme is not yet embodied in law. If we passed an amendment such as this, or even an amendment in the spirit of this one, aviation would be in a tough position. In effect, we would be telling people that we were going to stop aviation growth in this country.</p>

<a name="80123-0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="08012362000186">Amendments Nos. 167 to 168A relate to limits on the amount of carbon units, whether international or European. The Bill allows participants in UK trading schemes to use emission reductions delivered through European or overseas trading schemes towards their domestic obligations. This allows UK trading schemes to be linked to other trading schemes across the world. That is fully consistent with the development of a global carbon market, which will help to strengthen the global response to climate change. However, Amendments Nos. 167 and 168 would place limits on this and reduce the flexibility to develop domestic trading schemes that have the best outcomes for cost-effective emission reductions, which could therefore lead to increased costs to UK business both now and in the future. An example of how this power may be used comes from the carbon reduction commitment, which proposes the conditional use of credits from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme but purely as a safety valve to prevent the CRC allowance price rising to undesirably high levels.</p>

<a name="80123-0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="08012362000187">Other trading schemes established under the Bill could target other sections of the economy, operate in different ways and have different linkages to trading schemes elsewhere, whether within the European market or more widely. Our view is that the right approach&#151;the Government always have the right approach&#151;is to keep our options open at this stage. That makes sense. We are in uncharted waters here and it would be quite wrong to limit ourselves. If there is to be a limit on the use of units from the EU or from overseas in a domestic trading scheme, the best way to proceed is to have this debate when this House and the other place discuss individual future schemes, as they will. Indeed, the Bill requires both Houses to approve any new trading schemes.</p>

<a name="80123-0005.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="08012362000188">On Amendment No. 168A, we have previously discussed whether there should be limits on the contribution that European and international credits can make towards the UK net carbon account. I undertook to consider that issue, which we are doing throughout government. I assure noble Lords that Whitehall is abuzz with packages of ideas flowing from your Lordships&#146; five days of debates so far. It will be no different today. The volume of paperwork being generated is enormous. I hope to bring good news in due course.</p>

<a name="80123-0005.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="08012362000189">We do not see why any limit for the national net UK carbon account as a whole should be set through regulations making trading schemes under Part 3 of the Bill. This has the potential to be confusing and we are not sure what value this part of Amendment No. 168A would add. The amendment would also require any such limit to be approved by the Committee on Climate Change. As we have previously discussed, Clause 40(1) requires the Government to seek the advice of the Committee on Climate Change before making any regulations under Part 3. This is an important safeguard, which relates to all the matters

<a name="80123-0005.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="08012362000190">Amendment No. 167A would require new trading scheme regulations explicitly to state the amount of units from schemes abroad that may be counted towards the net UK carbon account. We accept the spirit of the amendment, which seeks to provide further transparency regarding the extent to which the UK uses international credits to meet its target. However, it is not clear how the wider question relating to the UK net carbon account as a whole is linked to the establishment of an individual trading scheme. In addition, Clause 12(6) already requires the Government to report annually on the number and type of carbon units that have been credited to or debited from the UK carbon account. In effect, Amendment No. 167A would do no more than replicate what is in Clause 12(6), if we have understood it correctly. Not only do we agree with the spirit but we agree with the practicality and the desirability of having something such as this in the Bill. I hope that, if I have got that right, noble Lords will not press these amendments.</p>

Under a Private Member&#146;s Bill on climate change local authorities will be obliged to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from the domestic sector. Although this is not covered by this Bill, it might well be covered by further Bills and much of the regulation of local industry will be dealt with by local authorities.

In fact, as I discovered some years ago, there is an even huger number who are members of police authorities&#148;. People come here with experience and I appreciate what the noble Earl has said. Let me explain who the enforcement authority is under the existing and the proposed trading schemes. Under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, the enforcement authority is the scheme regulator. In England and Wales, it is the Environment Agency; in Scotland, it is the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; and in Northern Ireland, it is the chief inspector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="08012362000198">We expect to take a similar approach for the carbon reduction commitment. The enforcement authority is expected to be the scheme administrator, which will be the same bodies as in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The scrutiny arrangements that I have set out will ensure that proposals for the technical details of trading schemes, including who the enforcement authority should be, will need to be justified and such decisions taken on a case-by-case basis. We therefore consider that it would be unnecessarily inflexible at this stage, ahead of having any detailed provisions of particular schemes in front of us, to place restrictions on which persons or bodies may be appointed to undertake enforcement action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="08012362000199">It may be the case that in a future scheme administered by these powers, a local authority would be the most appropriate body to act as the enforcement authority. But as a preliminary view, we think that it is unlikely that local authorities would be chosen, because trading schemes work best on a much larger scale, which is why the larger agencies tend to be chosen. I asked whether we could rule out local authorities in order to have clarity in the Bill, but I have been assured that it has not been envisaged that local authorities will play a big role. However, there is the possibility that in a future case for which we do not have a hypothetical example, they might be the most appropriate body, although we cannot conceive of a case where they might be.</p>

I know that there is always an argument about this, but I think that about 80 per cent&#151;certainly well over 70 per cent&#151;of local government money is provided by central government in the first place. The idea that local government is out there raising all its own money is preposterous. One should not seek to give the impression that it does. However, clearly there is no doubt that this would be a new burden in the context of climate change and local authorities should be properly financed and resourced for any new burdens relating to activities under this Bill. I cannot conceive of anyone in Whitehall who would disagree with that. The argument would be about the amount and, probably, the area.

In these circumstances, it would be more appropriate to make the appropriate revocation, repeal or amendment using secondary legislation. This would allow the consequential changes to be made at the most appropriate time and with suitable transitional arrangements. For example, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2005 made small consequential amendments to the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 and to the Environment Act 1995 to ensure that the Environment Agency and other regulators were able to charge operators for the various services that they provide under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

It will also remove the need to make primary legislation to effect minor or technical changes when the principle and contents of a new trading scheme have been consulted on, debated and passed using the affirmative procedure, which is an explicit requirement for changing existing legislation under Clause 40. In addition to this safeguard regarding the parliamentary procedure which must be followed, as we have previously discussed, Clause 40 also requires public consultation and advice from the Committee on Climate Change. Any consequential amendments to existing legislation would be done in certain specific circumstances, with a view to streamlining the process and reducing the administrative burden on business and industry.</p>

It is clear that the regulations are to be made by each authority involved and that either legislature may then pray for an annulment. Part 3 of Schedule 3 is differently worded, as its paragraphs 9 and 10 do not refer to the Secretary of State, although paragraph 9(3) specifies &#147;a national authority&#148;. Paragraph 11 covers the case of a draft order made by the Secretary of State and approved by Parliament. Paragraph 12 then refers to annulment, but in a different fashion from the reference in paragraph 8. My doubt is whether paragraph 12, as worded, actually covers that peculiarity allowed under paragraph 9(2)(b); namely, an order that contains provision outside the,</p>

This new power allows such a scheme to be made by the Scottish Ministers through secondary legislation. As noted elsewhere in the debate, we have agreed the relevant aspects of the Bill with each of the devolved Administrations and, like us, Scottish Ministers wish to ensure a facility to create, in a single instrument, trading schemes that operate across all territories of the UK or any combination of them.</p>

The Scottish Ministers&#146; policy is that the appropriate procedural mechanism to establish such a scheme which includes provision within the competence of the Scottish Parliament is an Order in Council made by Her Majesty. An Order in Council is the procedure required for various purposes under the Scotland Act 1998, and precedents for its use in relation to matters containing a mix of reserved and devolved matters in Scotland are set in the Health Act 1999 and the Energy Act 2004.</p>

The multi-legislature procedure that applies to these schemes is regularly used; for example, it is not uncommon for this House to scrutinise statutory instruments covering England and Wales made jointly by the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers. The Scottish devolution settlement is different; there is a precedent in the Scotland Act for the Order in Council procedure in the Bill. If the proposers of the amendment simply wanted the same procedure to apply for Scotland as for Wales and Northern Ireland, they would simply need to add Scottish Ministers to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2.

A briefing note that described in further detail the scope and intention of the scheme has already been circulated, but let me reiterate that the CRC may affect up to 5,000 organisations whose participation will be assessed on their electricity consumption from a 100 kilowatt metering system.

I will explain why the power is necessary. A key, basic objective of the carbon reduction commitment is to ensure that organisations as a whole are covered by the scheme, with the CRC obligations being placed on the highest UK parent organisation. This is to stimulate greater awareness of energy use emissions within an organisation&#146;s senior management. Large businesses are often structured and restructured into groups, the constituent parts of which are separate legal entities or subsidiaries. To deal with this, and to ensure that we cover organisations in their entirety and therefore maximise emissions coverage, it is proposed under the CRC to capture business group structures. That also better explains one of the answers I gave earlier.

While we appreciate that gathering the data required to produce a good report might take time, we expect government to monitor progress on an annual basis anyway.

The Minister expressed concerns that years vary and that therefore annual reporting could be misleading. I take a contrary view. Given an annual report which included the year in the context of past performance and future progress, we would have a continuing view in much the same way as government finance is reported at present.

That is the bad news about adaptation; it means planning for failure. Clearly, we have to do that.

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="08012362000283">It is excellent that adaptation appears in the Bill, otherwise it would be a Bill around enabling carbon trading, setting targets and setting up the Committee on Climate Change.

To have a clause saying, &#147;Despite the very long timescale for reports, the Secretary of State has power to put back even those&#148;, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, pointed out, adds insult to injury. I do not think that the Government would disagree with this line of argument, but it is absolutely essential that the timetable is tightened up, not only in taking this topic seriously but in really starting to plan for something very big that is going to happen to local communities, regions and us as a whole.</p>

The impacts of climate change are indeed very striking. I hope that I am right in citing that, out of the past 50 years, the past 11 to 12 have been some of the hottest on record. I accept that from time to time during the years ahead that pattern may well change, and we may go from hot to cold. That should not stop us from coming forward with a report to reflect the circumstances with which we have had to cope during that year. Like the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, I think that the expression &#147;from time to time&#148; lacks focus and suggests that it is not important, when it is very important.</p>

The Minister could even come back and say, &#147;No, we cannot accept them as they are, but in theory we support the message behind them&#148;. We are asking the Minister to accept that the rationale of a five-yearly timetable for risk assessment and action planning does not give adequate opportunities for public scrutiny of the progress that has been made or the opportunity to hold the Government to account for delivery, particularly if the five-year intervals overlap different Parliaments.</p>

After all, we are dealing not with the mitigation of events into the future but with the consequences of the situation we are already in, due to what has happened over the past 150 or 200 years. We are feeling those effects now and the need for action to deal with them is urgent. Surely we ought to reflect that in our approach to reporting.</p>

During the proceedings of the Joint Committee she made what I thought was an important suggestion: that the adaptation report should be timed carefully to come before the Committee on Climate Change considers the next five-year targets and before the process of the Government setting those budgets. The effort regarded as practically and scientifically sensible needs to be informed by the impacts on the ground. Again, if we accept these amendments we will have the reports in adequate time for them to be taken into account in the setting of budgets. That is another good reason for supporting them.</p>

As I understand it, Clause 48 deals with the assessment of the risks involved and what actions might be needed. It is the next clause that deals with the programme of action being proposed. I would have assumed that a careful and rigorous assessment of risk had to be drawn up thoroughly. I hope that will not change every year; you cannot have consequential policies that change annually. The measures and the programme of action that follow from the subsequent paragraph will be on the basis of the risk assessment. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="08012362000290">I do not find it quite as unacceptable as other noble Lords that that risk assessment, setting out any risks that we have to face up to and programmes of action that are needed, would take some time in the first instance, nor is it unacceptable that this would not require a reassessment of those strategic risks every year. That is not to say that if events happen, that will not require a reassessment&#151;although the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is far more qualified to comment on that than me.</p>

<a name="80123-0007.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="08012362000291">If there is to be any continuity of policy, it is essential that the risk assessment in Clause 48 is done rigorously, thoroughly and not in a way that invites change every year. If we kept getting that assessment so wrong that measures flowing from the programme of action in Clause 49 had to be changed, it would be chaotic. The idea of a considered and measured approach to assessing the risk and then reporting on that to Parliament, with reports on assessing risk being laid no more than every five years, is fairly reasonable. If something came up that made a reassessment of risks necessary, that would not prevent a reappraisal happening, but to insist that there be an annual risk assessment in this way is unnecessary&#151;unless there are matters that require that. It is under Clause 49, which we are not yet able to discuss, that a programme of adaptation would come forward. Again, that programme should be adhered to in the medium and long term. One thing is

I am confident that the Government will adhere to the undertaking given by the Minister. When we debated Amendments Nos. 158, 175 and 183B, we talked about an adaptation committee, or some independent scrutiny mechanism, that would include a mechanism or set of descriptors similar to the ones that exist in the Bill for the Committee on Climate Change, as to what that committee would do and how it would undertake its work.

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="08012362000293">In terms of the periodicity of any reports, I will hedge my bets and go for a middle course. Every five years seems slightly too infrequent, but annually is quite an onerous commitment. When we debated those amendments, it was suggested that an adaptation committee might not be a standing committee, but rather one that was set up from time to time, if that would save the Government a little cash. I pointed out that that was a bit cheese-paring, bearing in mind the cost of the impacts of adaptation that this committee would help to diminish. When we debate future amendments on the adaptation duty that needs to be laid on a whole variety of bodies, I hope we will conclude that we are rather running out of road in getting some impetus behind the adaptation agenda. Therefore, in the early stages, a committee on adaptation that reports more frequently, until the head of steam that really gets us moving has been generated, might well be one way forward.</p>

To that extent, a five-year reporting period is the most appropriate. We have to remember that we are dealing with gradual changes over a very long time. It is true that you can find examples where change seems to be speeding up but that is because the penny has dropped on the planet only in the past few years that these changes are happening and we will be in trouble if we do not do something. That does not alter the fact that the changes have been incredibly gradual. It has taken 100 years for the temperature to rise by 1 degree. That is a long time.

We believe that it is unlikely that there will be significant progress in the evidence base more frequently than every five years and certainly not within the space of 12 months, as Amendments Nos. 169 and 173 would require.

The assessment of the risks of climate change under Clause 48 is a major piece of work&#151;I make no bones about that.

That is the reality of what noble Lords are asking for. I have not come here with any surprises.

Due consideration of these results as well as other scientific developments from, for example, the intergovernmental panel will be required. Further work will then be undertaken to produce a robust assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. Therefore, we do not plan to publish the initial risk report within 12 months but will produce it as soon as possible without compromising the quality. Our best estimate is that it will be within three years.</p>

However, we also want to ensure that we are able to take into account new developments in the scientific and economic evidence as and when they occur. A lack of flexibility in the reporting cycle could make the adaptation programme less responsive to the latest scientific developments and international research, such as new findings from the intergovernmental panel. It would be self-defeating if, for example, we were forced to publish a UK risk report a few months ahead of a new piece of work from the intergovernmental panel analysis that significantly advanced the global scientific consensus on the issue.

I mentioned the modelling for the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme which started as far back as 2001. The bulk of the work has been carried out since 2004; so for three years. The report is due later this year and is based on brand new methodology that the Met Office Hadley Centre has had to develop from scratch; so there is new work. I accept that once it has been developed, it is developed, but I am giving an example of looking at these issues. New methodology has to be agreed and developed from scratch.

The Met Office wants to use the most up-to-date models, HadGEM2 and HadGEM3, for the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme. It is using one model called HadCM3 that would make it run even slower. Creating a new methodology annually is beyond the resources and academic capabilities of the Met Office Hadley Centre staff. That is not to rubbish them; this is leading-edge technology. New scenarios also need to incorporate advances, new observations, models and methods. None of these is updated annually. It would not be practical.

<a name="08012374000042"><b><a name="80123-0008.htm_spnew8"><a name="08012374000201">Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> This has been an interesting and important debate at this point in our deliberations. I am delighted to see that the mythology that was mentioned did not affect the monitor for too long; the monitor suggested for a time that we were debating the Children and Young Persons Bill, but we have come back to climate change now. I congratulate the noble Baroness on initiating this important debate and I hope that I can give noble Lords a reassuring reply. The Government see these issues as being extremely important and I hope that I can build on the comments that my noble friend has made around the issue of government reporting in general.</p>

<a name="80123-0008.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="08012374000043">First, let me get to the specifics. As noble Lords have said, a changing climate will have an impact on developing countries; we are all well aware of that in your Lordships&#146; House. Those countries are less well equipped to deal with these changes than the UK is. I am pointing towards the moral and ethical issues that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, mentioned. We recognise the need to support these countries practically and, through better understanding of the likely changes, to build their resilience to a changing climate.</p>

<a name="80123-0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="08012374000044">However, we do not think that government reports under Clauses 48 and 49, as proposed in Amendments Nos. 170 and 178, are necessarily a good route for doing that. That is for two reasons. First and most important, adaptation must be integrated into our mainstream development work for it to be most effective. That is part of sustainable development in the round. Secondly, by building the resilience of the UK to the impact of a changing climate, we will be better able to help other countries and to share our experience with them. To do that, we need to have a clear focus for national risk assessment and to follow up with a programme of action. We will make a step change by doing this and by addressing those issues in the UK.</p>

<a name="80123-0008.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="08012374000045">On Amendment No. 170, we do not see that it would add any value for the UK to duplicate the role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, nor do we consider that that would be appropriate. The IPCC is the leading global scientific body on climate change, as we have heard, bringing together more than 2,000 scientists from across the world. The IPCC is already charged with carrying out regular, detailed and independent analysis on the global impacts of climate change. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize, received jointly with Al Gore, for its efforts to build and disseminate knowledge on climate change and measures to combat it is a measure of the esteem in which its work is held worldwide.</p>

<a name="80123-0008.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="08012374000046">The UK has had a leading role in the IPCC and contributes to it through the work of hundreds of UK scientists involved in the IPCC process&#151;I take this opportunity to pay tribute to their work. We are active participants in IPCC events and through financial support. We believe that the better approach

Therefore, we cannot accept this amendment. However&#151;and this is an important point to make&#151;I assure Members of the Committee that the Government will take into account the existing work done by the IPCC and others on the global impacts of climate change in formulating our development programmes.</p>

<a name="80123-0008.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="08012374000047">Amendment No. 178 would require the Government&#146;s adaptation programme to report on our activity to support adaptation to climate change outside the UK. However, the Government already provide this information, so this amendment would lead to unnecessary duplication. To be specific, the Government already report to Parliament on our work to help developing countries to adapt to climate change through DfID&#146;s annual departmental report, alongside reports on our overall progress towards meeting the millennium development goals. The most recent DfID annual report is in the House Library.</p>

<a name="80123-0008.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="08012374000048">I shall now pick up my noble friend&#146;s comments on government reporting. The information is there, although I understand that, from time to time, it may not stand out as much as it should. My noble friend has been very responsive to concerns expressed in Committee about how we can promote transparency and make information widely available to the public and to Parliament. I am sure that we will continue to be receptive to that. In addition, the Government have responsibility, through the International Development Act, to provide assistance for sustainable development and poverty reduction and are obliged to report annually to Parliament on these commitments through the International Development (Reporting and Transparency) Act 2006. There is not a strong argument for duplicating existing activity, which would be the effect of the two amendments.</p>

<a name="80123-0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="08012374000049">However, I want to reinforce how seriously we take the impact of climate change on developing countries and to remind the Committee of some of the practical steps that the UK is taking to support adaptation work internationally. The UK has already put in place a number of major initiatives to help developing countries to adapt to climate change, including &#163;74 million for building capacity and improving knowledge of the problems in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and an &#163;800 million environmental transformation fund. The UK is contributing &#163;20 million to UN funds for developing country adaptation strategies and pilot projects. We are following up on actions from the climate risk assessments of the UK development programmes in China, India, Bangladesh and Kenya. This is part of the work to mainstream the need to adapt into development programmes. For example, in Bangladesh, the child livelihood programme is a &#163;50 million programme to work with 100,000 people who live on low-lying islands, thus reducing their vulnerability to floods. It is a mainstream development activity and a direct response to the increased risk of disasters as a result of climate change.</p>

<a name="80123-0008.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="08012374000050">I have a long speaking note on a number of other initiatives, but I am sure that Members of the Committee would be delighted if I moved on. Previously, we have discussed the relationship between the action that we are taking in the UK and

We also had a good discussion earlier in Committee about the need for the Committee on Climate Change to have awareness of the international dimension and not to focus purely on domestic issues. We promised to take this away and to consider it, which we are doing.</p>

<a name="80123-0008.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="08012374000051">The Government are willing to ensure that the Bill covers domestic and international issues, as that will add important value to the work that the Bill will promote. In this case, we are not convinced that the amendments would add value, but we think that this debate has been important; it has given us the opportunity to be clear about our commitment to take the much wider view. With that, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

In particular, I pay tribute to the work of the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, and the whole staff at Kew. In thanking the Minister very much for her full reply, I declare an interest: the British embassy in Argentina funded a visit that I made as a member of the Joint Committee on climate change in order to have a discussion with Argentinean parliamentarians, the media and so on. It was the British embassy&#146;s initiative, under the Government&#146;s programme, and it really raised the level of discussion in Argentina. I concur with the Minister that the Government are making important strides in the world. The sort of work that Defra and the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, are doing needs to be kept at the heart of our debates and the information that we receive. I accept that this may not, therefore, need to be in the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We are mindful of the rigour underlying the Stern report. We need to understand how global warming and our efforts to stop it are going to affect daily life. With this must come an understanding of how climate change will affect the life of people in this country as well as ecosystems and the environment.</p>

By making this a part of the report, we by no means want to suggest that economic pragmatism will be driving efforts to stop global warming. Yet a forecast of the likely economic ramifications of climate change would be advantageous to business, to industries that might have a hard time with this legislation, and to the fight against climate change itself. Understanding the economic implications and their development enables us to identify areas for improvement. We need to ensure that we fully understand the extent of the problem so that our solutions will be firmly set in a real-world framework.

I want to be as open as I can be in Committee as it will help on Report. First, let me reassure your Lordships that the Government develop their policies and deliver their services within the overriding framework of sustainable development. We are trying to live within environmental limits and to achieve a just society by means of a sustainable economy, good governance and sound science. The policy development process is based on a sound analysis of the costs and benefits of different courses of action. That said, these amendments do not add value to what is already in the Bill.</p>

I want to make it clear that the risk assessment will be thorough and comprehensive. The report will make use of expert and independent knowledge and include spatial, sectoral and temporal coverage of the risks from climate change and the associated vulnerabilities of these risks for the UK. It will identify gaps in the knowledge of these areas. At the moment, Clause 48(1) requires an assessment of the risks for the United Kingdom that do or may arise from climate change. This covers risks to the whole range of factors in the amendment and more besides. It is already as wide as it could be. We think it better that the Secretary of State should have a duty to assess all the risks to the United Kingdom, rather than to pick out particular risks now, before we have even conducted the first risk assessment under Clause 48.</p>

If the intention is to ensure that the adaptation programme addresses the need to secure a healthy natural environment and a healthy and just society, then this is already covered by the provision requiring the adaptation programme to contribute to sustainable development.</p>

We are grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s explanation of his amendment, and are particularly pleased that there is a consensus that sustainable development is an important consideration in any adaptation programme. Yet we do not think that this amendment enhances the Bill. It is better that the adaptation programme should contribute to sustainable development as an active part of the overall effort made to achieve sustainable development. We would be concerned that, if the programme only had to be consistent with sustainable development, some of the sense of activeness might be lost. &#147;Consistent&#148; seems neutral to us.</p>

Amendment No. 182 relates to the Secretary of State implementing a programme for adaptation. If there is a programme for adaptation, we on this side of the Committee think that there should be a duty to implement it. There is a duty to introduce the risk assessment, but it does not extend to a duty to implement the programme. It is not enough to just have some good ideas.</p>

It is not our intention to bind the hands of the Secretary of State such that he must follow only the specific programme outlined. We recognise that contingency is always a part of policy-making and there needs to be some space for a Minister to respond to it. However, this part of the legislation places the duty for developing the programme on the Secretary of State. We feel that it is important that the programme that is developed can and will be effective. Thus, we want to ensure that it will in fact be put into effect.</p>

Much of this Bill seeks a fair balance between mitigation and adaptation. We have discussed the need for special provisions and expertise to deal with adaptation. I am sure that the Minister will say that, as the Bill places a requirement on the Government to develop an adaptation programme&#151;matters for which the Secretary of State is responsible&#151;it is inconceivable that the Secretary of State would not fulfil or implement such a programme, which must contribute to sustainable development.

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="08012374000083">With the amendment, we return to the issue of whether the Government should be placed under an obligation to implement a report setting out their proposals and policies. I assure this Committee that adaptation is an integral part of this Bill and we fully intend to deliver on our commitments to ensure that the impacts of climate change in the UK are effectively addressed. No reasonable Secretary of State is going to develop a set of policies and then just ignore them. The whole idea of putting a programme in place is, for the first time, to ensure that coherent adaptation planning actually takes place. Clause 49 represents a significant step forward in the UK's response to the impacts of climate change, and we should not lose sight of this fact. Those plans will inevitably lead to action; for one thing, Clause 49(3) requires subsequent adaptation programmes to contain a report on progress of earlier programmes, which will be the trigger for assessing how effective the programme has been.</p>

A statutory obligation to implement a programme may remove flexibility to amend the delivery programme if more appropriate and effective policies and measures are developed, so it might also result in significant costs if circumstances change after the programme is announced. We of course expect to be held to account under the usual parliamentary scrutiny process and will be reporting to Parliament on both the risk report and the adaptation programme. In addition, as I set out in our previous debate, a duty to implement a programme could be seen as a very broad enabling power for a Government

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="08012374000085">On the more general question of duties to implement, which I believe is at the nub of this, I shall respond in some detail to some questions raised in a previous debate on Amendment No. 60. In that case, I noted the inappropriateness of giving the Government a wide and unfettered enabling power, and the need for clarity and certainty when imposing duties on people. These points are equally applicable to this amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, suggested previously that the duty in Clause 1 was not clear or certain. It is not fair to draw a comparison between a duty to implement a qualitative policy programme that has not yet been written, and the clear and quantified duty in Clause 1(1). I hope that this helps to clarify why we believe the duty to meet the 2050 target is of a different nature from those proposals for a broader and less well defined duty to implement a policy document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="08012374000086">It will be clear from the statement published by the Secretary of State under Clause 15&#151;the final statement for 2050&#151;whether the net UK carbon account has been reduced by at least 60 per cent. If the figures show that the 60 per cent reduction has not been made, then it will follow that the Secretary of State has breached his duty. That is what we mean when we talk about clarity and certainty in the context of a legal duty. To the extent that the noble Lord was really saying that the shorter-term implications&#151;between now and 2050&#151;of the duty in Clause 1 might be less clear, which is why we have carbon budgets to set the trajectory to our 2050 target, I repeat that we are considering how the concerns of the Committee can be met, as previously discussed. In other words, this is not the end of the issue. We are giving further consideration to the matter.</p>

We are talking about an almost unbelievable reversal of the energy coefficient of growth, on the carbon side at least. I have been involved for many years in this whole business of how to have emissions trading and how to get China and India involved. I remember saying at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, as chairman of the world trade union group on the environment, that we needed to bring in India and China and, at some point, to have a degree of support from the developing countries on the basis that we are each entitled to so much carbon. I remember the American being astonished at what he called those communist ideas. However we do it, the central point is to recognise that there must be pain as well as gain.</p>

At the present time, to the order &#147;Drain the North Atlantic&#148;, we would add, &#147;Install windmills to keep out the water&#148;. The extent to which we think we can run an economy without carbon will quite surprise some people. We are a long way from getting that into the bloodstream of&#151;that is, owned by&#151;people.

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="08012374000097">I am sorry that my noble friend the Minister is not present. I hope he does not think this an unimportant matter for debate. The Bill is overwhelmingly predicated on choking off demand through price, either directly through taxation, indirectly through energy supply-side increases or through emissions trading and carbon taxation. I use the generic term &#147;carbon tax&#148; in my amendment. That predication is palpably clear from the Oxford Economics reports commissioned by the Treasury, but has it been openly stated by Ministers? I think not; at least, I have not heard my noble friend Lord Rooker say so. He may correct me if I am wrong.</p>

<a name="80123-0009.htm_para30">
<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="08012374000098">A research paper produced by Oxford Economics, again commissioned by the Treasury, gives this equation: an increase in carbon prices to about &#8364;60 per tonne to all sectors of the economy is sufficient, at 2006 prices, to reduce emissions by 30 per cent relative to their 1990 levels by 2020. That finding assumes that all reductions in carbon emissions are achieved by UK firms and households rather than by a purchase of carbon reductions from other countries. That quite explicitly demonstrates that we are predicating our whole approach on choking off demand though prices&#151;and, we could add, through taxes. That process will be inherently regressive; certainly so, if we take no steps to reverse the regressive effect. It is no poll tax, but if we think about the proportion of income that the bottom 25 per cent of the population, or the bottom 10 per cent, have to spend on heating their homes then is not far off that. If they have a car, we should be saying&#151;as one Oxford study does&#151;that the proposal is equivalent to removing one-third of cars from the road. Well, guess whose cars those would be?</p>

<a name="80123-0009.htm_para31">
<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="08012374000099">If we think that we have approval for all of this, we are kidding ourselves. We are far from that. I strongly support this Bill&#146;s principles, having been involved in this business for a very long time. However, I am afraid that the principle of choking off demand through price increases&#151;whether through taxation, energy supply increases or emissions trading carbon taxation and so on&#151;will not be without huge social conflict unless we make provision in advance to avoid that. It will not be sufficient, in a few years&#146; time&#151;when we have doubled the price of carbon through tax, or whatever&#151;to say &#147;Well, nobody opposed the Climate Change Bill. You all supported it&#148;. I would not care to have to make that argument in a pub by that stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="08012374000101">The standard line in the Treasury cannot be a million miles away from the analysis of the Stern report as the noble Lord, Lord Stern, was in the Treasury all of his life. It argues that the macroeconomic numbers for meeting our carbon targets would not produce a shock out of line with the sort of numbers that vast structural changes to our economy in the past 100 years or so have entailed. I think people have in mind a Ted Heath-type period&#151;the oil shock and so on&#151;but the numbers are totally different. We have to achieve the results advocated in the Bill. The jury may still be out on whether an ice age will come back in the next 5,000 years. As an old trade union official, I know that trade union officials are very long-sighted in negotiations, but no one normally looks ahead for 5,000 years. We all have to agree that this is a programme that will be relevant for 50 years, and we cannot go on without the price tag being associated with the Bill. It is like having an orchestra in which the only instruments are the trumpet and the harp. We need all the instruments in the orchestra.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="08012374000102">Some sections of society&#151;the wealthiest&#151;will be able to take this in their stride. Poorer people will not. There will also be an effect on employment. The noble Lord, Lord Stern, acknowledged that. To make a purely arithmetical point, all other things being equal, lower economic growth would mean that we would have to take a hit on employment or productivity. We are committing ourselves to reducing carbon in an economy that will be three times bigger at the end of the planning period than now. All the studies have shown that the price elasticity of demand for carbon is rather low; in other words, people need a lot of it. It has also been remarked that if we are going to push up the price of carbon in this way, which may be necessary, it is tantamount to saying that as soon as ordinary people can afford to go to Malaga on their holidays, they cannot go. It is all right for everyone else to go, but we will push the price up so they cannot go. That is what we are saying in the programme that the Bill is inaugurating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="08012374000103">Those are blunt statements that lead to discussion, but I hope they demonstrate that there is a huge problem in the lack of ownership in Birmingham, Manchester, Scotland or Wales of what we are talking about. No one has bought into this so far. They may have done so at a casual level; everyone says, &#147;What a good idea&#148;, but it is not true. The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, has described the changes in our socioeconomic set-up as being as profound as World War III. If that is true, it means that we cannot simply write a blank, post-dated cheque without giving anybody any guess about the amount of money the cheque is for, which we will all have to pay. When I say, &#147;no ownership&#148;, I mean among consumers. My noble friend Lord Whitty wears a hat on the National Consumer Council, but everybody is involved wearing two or three different hats: as taxpayers, workers, consumers, industrialists or so on.

I am afraid that there is no point saying that we need a new politics without responding to some of the points I am making. This is my only contribution to this debate. There have been 30 hours of debate so far, and this is my only speech, but I have to say that there will be a collapse of trust in government when Ministers of whatever Government tell people in due course why this pain is being imposed on them and, to add insult to injury, that they agreed to it because Parliament agreed the Climate Change Bill. The paradox is &#147;no pain, no gain&#148;. We are being very precise about numbers when it comes to the targets for 30, 40 or 50 years&#146; time, but there are no numbers on the fiscal side. We cannot guess at that.</p>

I am sure that someone can think of a simpler title or acronym for it. I acknowledge the formal point that the Minister always makes, which is that this is not a Defra Bill, but sitting round the table in such a forum we will need people from the Treasury, BERR and Defra as well as interested parties such as workers&#146; representatives, consumer representatives, industry and others to show their ownership of mitigating the negative side of the cost-benefit outcome for the less privileged people in society. The climate change committee has a separate, very important function but it is not the function to which I am referring, and it cannot do the trick of delivering ownership. It is essential that there is something in the Bill along the lines of my amendment, and I will be happy to discuss it any level. I thank the Committee for being accommodating about the time that I have taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="08012374000106">Finally, on the European front, which is mentioned in the amendment, today&#146;s announcements in Brussels remind us that the fiscal numbers are easier to get at when we look at the European picture. We need a European agreement on the carbon tax, which was the basis of my maiden speech in 1999. However, we do not want a contradictory mess of competing subsidies that would destroy the internal market. That was also a theme of the statement agreed in Brussels today. Bringing people in to get some ownership of this agenda and to take the responsibility of explaining it to their affiliates is the way to win hearts and minds. I hope the Minister is able to say that proper consideration will be given to it. I beg to move.</p>

A few amendments ago, the Minister chose the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> definition of adaptation by referring to &#147;modifying in the light of new circumstances&#148;. That is a nice, gentle, Oxfordy way of describing it. These will be drastic changes. They might take some time and be differential in their impact, but the changes will be drastic over the period that this Bill envisages. They are changes in our lifestyle, the pattern of the economy, the nature of work, the balance of work and life and the pattern of consumption. All of those require us to face up to them in a similar way to the concentrated period to which my noble friend Lord Puttnam has just referred.</p>

In wartime&#151;and in this sense, the equivalence referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is quite correct&#151;all the elements of civil society pulled together and the pain was at least assumed to be more or less equivalent across all levels of society. One of the phrases that we remember from wartime is the late Queen Mother&#146;s remark that at last we can look the East End in the face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="08012374000119">We will be in similar times over these kinds of adjustments. That will require the engagement of leaders of industry, business, commerce, trade unions and other parts of society&#151;and indeed of consumer organisations, such as my own&#151;to make their communications available in putting across the same message. I suspect the Government are not going to be too keen about the prescription put forward by my noble friend Lord Lea. It is a bit corporatist and not with the Zeitgeist. However, it is inevitable that we will have to find some new way to bring all the leaders of society into this battle.</p>

We had instances during the two world wars of the last century, but we should not underestimate the convulsions that occurred in centuries prior to that. People then had to adjust to even more significant change because, having lived in static societies for almost the whole of their lives, they found themselves in societies subject to substantial convulsions. So people can and do adapt to change.</p>

There was no way that I could keep up with the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, with his poetic flights, although they were much appreciated. I am therefore very glad that the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, brought us back to the prosaic. He was right: these challenges will make demands on society in terms of the necessary resources.</p>

We did not talk about huge bureaucracies in the First and Second World Wars, although the numbers of government servants increased on both occasions, as they were bound to do. Even in a society much more committed to limited government, the United States was transformed by the Second World War in the amount of its bureaucracy, as the noble Earl calls it. Others among us would not express that in pejorative terms. However, there was a large number of public servants dedicated to fulfilling a goal which society recognised as being of such significance that all society subscribed to it.</p>

That is why the broader approach of the Government is that all new policy proposals will be examined for their impact on business, charities, the voluntary sector and so forth. All that must be subject to an impact assessment to determine the costs and benefits of the proposals. It is clear that we will be going through a process of considerable business and societal change, but we are building into the Bill a model to ensure that there is careful assessment of the impact of the policies that are to be followed.</p>

We have established a body, which is charged and fully accountable to the nation through Parliament, to take responsibility for this process.

There is a growing realisation in the wider society that if we do not control and abate the growing impact of global warming, it will produce disastrous consequences for us all. That is the basis on which we expect and can anticipate the whole of our society to respond to the challenge. The Opposition here and in the other place will do their job of critical scrutiny of the Bill and at times we will look divided, but every sentiment expressed from both Opposition Benches is set against an acceptance of the broad principles of what the Bill seeks to achieve.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires that, before the codes are laid before Parliament, the Government must first consult the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities, the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Institute of Legal Executives.

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="0801248000009">The changes proposed to the <I>Notes for Guidance 6B1 and 6B2 </I>in PACE Code C do not extend the range of offences that are considered suitable for telephone advice; they simply extend the service to include cases where the suspect asks for advice from a specific solicitor. The decision to include these types of cases follows from the outcome of the public consultation exercise carried out last year by CDS Direct on expanding the service to cases where a detainee would request his or her own solicitor. This is anticipated to achieve a rise in the net savings to the legal aid budget of a further &#163;2 million to &#163;6 million per year. Importantly, it will mean that detainees are able to achieve access to legal advice at the earliest opportunity and that the time they spend in police custody may subsequently be reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="0801248000010">It is vital that the quality of legal advice is not compromised. That is why the minimum quality standard that CDS Direct providers have to achieve continues to be higher than that needed by firms of solicitors.<I></I>The benefits from these changes are, therefore, for both the detainee and the criminal justice system. To manage the process effectively, the expansion of CDS Direct to own-solicitor cases will be in two phases. The first will be in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and the West Midlands from 1 February and the second will be throughout the rest of England and Wales from 21 April. That will allow any problems to be identified and resolved quickly, without compromising the quality of service for legal aid clients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="0801248000011">I wish to assure the House that the CDS Direct service will continue to apply only in relation to appropriate cases. For example, a solicitor will still be called to attend the police station where the police are going to carry out an interview or identification parade or in cases where the suspect is eligible for assistance from an appropriate adult, is unable to communicate over the phone or alleges serious maltreatment by the police.</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="0801248000012">The expansion of CDS Direct is vital to supporting the wider legal aid reform programme, the aim of which is to ensure that legal aid services are procured in a way that provides value for money for the taxpayer while maintaining a steady income for lawyers and a quality service for defendants. The government reforms to legal aid, such as the introduction of fixed fees, which the expansion of CDS Direct supports, will give legal aid lawyers a tangible stake in the efficient operation of the justice system at the police station and at court and will enable the Government to purchase services in a more efficient manner. I am aware that the Law Society was initially unhappy with the wording used by the police in relation to the use of one&#146;s own solicitor. This has now been rephrased and the new wording agreed with the Law Society and ACPO.</p>

<p><a name="st_183">
<a name="0801248000016"><b><a name="80123-0011.htm_spnew5"><a name="0801248000261">Baroness Hanham:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his clear exposition of the order. While I recognise that some of these changes are extremely sensible, none the less they raise one or two questions, which I should like to put to him. Paragraph 2.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum states that the changes are rather minor and that they,</p>
<ul><a name="0801248000244">&#147;reflect other minor legislative changes and make other minor corrections to the previous Codes of Practice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801248000166">You could be slightly misled by that into thinking that all the changes to the code are rather minor. However, it is fair to say that the proposed revisions to the code of practice are in many respects&#151;the Minister outlined them just now&#151;not minor at all, notably those to Code C, where significant changes are made, in particular to the right of representation in a police station for less serious offences, as the Minister pointed out.</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="0801248000017">The Minister mentioned the Law Society, by which I have been briefed, as, I am sure, have other noble Lords. He said that some changes had been made as a result of that body&#146;s representations, but they are certainly not apparent in the order. I am sure that the Law Society has drawn its concerns to the Government&#146;s attention.</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="0801248000018">Changes to the way in which representation may be accessed in a police station for those charged with some more minor offences, particularly for those who seek publicly funded representation, mean that that will now have to be carried out through telephone advice from CDS Direct. Despite what the Minister said, this removes at a stroke the right of a defendant to ask for his own solicitor, or another from the same firm, to be called. This right was previously enshrined in the PACE code. The changes now being made to remove this provision came about as a result of recommendations in the report of the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles&#151;as the Minister said&#151;to try to achieve greater economies in the legal aid system.</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="0801248000019">Furthermore, it will be for the Defence Solicitor Call Centre&#151;the telephone advice system&#151;to determine whether legal advice should be limited to telephone  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_296"><b>23 Jan 2008 : Column 296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>advice or whether a duty solicitor should attend the police station. Therefore, it will not be in the hands of the person who is being detained to make a choice. Only if the person detained actually says that they will pay for legal advice&#151;therefore, it will not be publicly funded&#151;will the police be able to contact his named solicitor directly. This then means that the officers are fully aware of the relationship between the detainee and his solicitor and possibly of the fees being negotiated in order for him to give his advice. Neither I nor the Law Society considers that a very satisfactory situation.</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="0801248000020">Another concern raised relates to the appropriateness of telephone advice for someone from an ethnic minority. The Minister said that a duty solicitor could be sent for for people who find using telephones difficult. However, some people, not only those with a disability, but those from ethnic minorities with certain cultural difficulties, particularly those who cannot speak English very well, may not have sufficient understanding to give and receive clear instructions over the telephone. Who will decide whether interpretation is necessary or whether a person from an ethnic minority or someone with a disability such as blindness or deafness has insufficient understanding?</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="0801248000021">I wish to ask the Minister the following specific questions. Have the Government considered the points raised by the Law Society? If so, how do they justify the restriction of a telephone-only service where someone may justify publicly funded advice but have their own solicitor? Does the Minister see the difficulty that, where a detainee has his or her own solicitor, the only way in which they can have access to him or his firm is by telling the police that they are going to pay for it? Surely that is not a matter where the police should have any involvement, although that is what is being brought about by the limitation to the telephone-only system. Can the Minister tell us how the difficulty of appropriate ethnic minority representation is to be handled?</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="0801248000022">The last matter under Code C&#151;this point was not raised by the Law Society&#151;to which I refer is the inclusion of provisions for both a caution and a warning to be given in Welsh. I know that this will apply in Wales but does the order presume that the caution or warning will have to be given first in English and then in Welsh, or will it just be given in Welsh, in which case other people present might not understand what has been said?</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="0801248000023">Finally, provision is made under Code E for interviews to be undertaken by a digital recording system, as the Minister said. He explained that a pilot would take place in the Lancashire Constabulary, east division. How long will it last? Will the end date of the pilot be put into the code? At the moment the pilot is open-ended. Presumably, before this measure is rolled out, not only will discussions take place with other interested parties but the code will have to be amended. As I say, at the moment the pilot is limited to the Lancashire Constabulary. I hope that the Minister will comment on that.</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="0801248000024">The more important point that arises from these interviews, on which the Minister touched, is the whole question of how the integrity of the interview is to be guaranteed, as under this system there are no  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_297"><b>23 Jan 2008 : Column 297</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tapes that can be sealed. In fact, all references to sealed tapes are taken out under the changes to the code. Discussions will take place while the pilot is conducted, but how will the integrity of the recording be guaranteed? In particular, there is a need to ensure that there can be no suggestion of subsequent manipulation of the interview that has been given. Has consideration been given to producing a simultaneous CD or DVD that could physically be sealed in the presence of the detainee, thereby giving that reassurance? I understand that after the introduction of the PACE system&#151;that is, of recorded interviews being sealed in the presence of the detainee and his solicitor, if present&#151;disputes in court over what was said at interview fell to virtually nil. It would be clearly counter to good justice if there were a return to such interview recordings being considered unreliable because they could be perceived as having been tampered with.</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="0801248000025">I apologise for detaining the House on a number of questions, but I think that they need an answer. I hope that the Minister will be able to supply the answers tonight.</p>

One of the more cheering aspects was that, the other day, the other place fully debated this order, unlike the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. I have drawn on the Minister&#146;s reply there in some of my comments. I thank the noble Lord, Lord West, for giving us the benefit of his view on the changes and I hope that some of my questions, which follow on from Tony McNulty&#146;s comments, will be appropriate.</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="0801248000027">The suspect&#146;s access to legal advice and their choice of solicitor in providing such advice is crucial. It seems that this code is now moving towards a two-tier justice system, which is a surprising thing for this Government to be aiming for; I would have thought that they were aiming to give more equal justice to all. If I interpret correctly what the Minister said, if you pay you can get your own solicitor if you want to, and if you do not pay you do not. That really is a two-tier system.</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="0801248000028">Are those things that are considered minor classified according to the tariff that they would incur should the case go to court and the person be found guilty? A minor assault might not be so minor when you look at the tariff for it. How was the issue of the minor matter decided, or will it be up to the judgment of the police in particular cases? That issue deeply concerns these Benches, because the police would arrest and detain a person, and the police would then make a judgment on whether the case was minor. The Minister mentioned cases of serious maltreatment, but again who will judge that? It will be the police, I presume, in the first instance, who will judge whether the suspect has been seriously maltreated by the police. That is certainly not without its problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="0801248000029">I gathered from the other place that the proposal on CDS Direct will be rolled out in two phases: Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and the West Midlands in February and, if this order is passed, the rest of the country in April. That leaves only one

Is the Minister satisfied that one month to evaluate such fundamental changes is anything like enough?</p>

<a name="80123-0011.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="0801248000030">In the first evaluation, in some 8 per cent of cases CDS Direct found, on providing initial telephone advice, that one of the exceptions requiring attendance of the suspect in person applied and it had to pass the case back to the duty solicitor. In 22 per cent of other cases, the matter had been misdirected. In other words, in nearly a third of cases the police had assessed the situation and got it wrong, which is pretty bad for the suspect and a waste of everyone&#146;s time at best&#151;at worst, it threatens or actually affects adversely the suspect&#146;s rights. What sort of thing would constitute serious maltreatment? If, for example, someone was arrested who should be taking medication and they were denied that medication, would that constitute serious maltreatment? Where would a suspect be able to find any reference to what constituted serious maltreatment? How are they going to know whether something constitutes serious maltreatment and therefore be able to ask for their case to be dealt with in a way other than CDS Direct?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="0801248000032">Lancashire is to pilot Code Echo, and I concur with the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about security. I agree that perhaps having a concurrently recorded CD that was sealed would be a satisfactory answer. The idea of having password access only is laughable when you realise what people can hack into and change digitally. If you have something that is not sealed in the presence of the suspect and is merely held in a password-access way, a digital alteration would be impossible to detect. If you get a clever hacker&#151;we know that there are some very clever hackers out there&#151;it is possible to think of some really quite serious situations arising. That is a cause for concern, and I hope that the Government will look further at that issue.</p>

The principles of how this is achieved are set out clearly in Code Charlie. The Law Society, ACPO and the Legal Services Commission have agreed on the operational detail of how the service of a chosen solicitor where the detainee wishes to pay privately or receive advice pro bono&#151;because that can be done&#151;is secured through the DSCC. These operational details are contained in the guidance issued to custody officers and are consistent with the amendments to Code Charlie that we are considering at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="0801248000035">Both noble Baronesses asked about the custody officer being required under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to determine on arrival at a police station whether a person suffers in any way from any form of vulnerability. That also includes language and ability to speak English. CDS Direct has access to what is effectively a call centre&#151;it is rather more than that&#151;which does immediate translation and covers a huge number of languages. It has proved extremely effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="0801248000036">Concern was expressed about the security of the digital network, recordings being sealed and keeping recordings. The purpose of the pilot, which is planned to last for six months, is to reduce and not to retain bureaucracy. It will trial a secure, tamper-proof system that will enable only authorised persons to access recordings. It provides automated audit, thereby increasing rather than reducing security and accountability. I admit that sometimes in performance these things have not been as good as one might hope. We will have to look at that extremely carefully to ensure that it delivers what we expect. With regard to the pilot itself, that aspect covers the issue of records being kept securely, which both noble Baronesses touched on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="0801248000038">The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raised the issue of serious maltreatment. That depends on the professional judgment of the CDS Direct adviser, who is legally skilled and competent. There is also a responsibility on the custody officer to ensure that that is covered. Regarding evaluation, we have been running a pilot scheme since 2005 and, as I mentioned, we have been getting good results. With regard to what is considered a minor matter, we are looking at non-imprisonable offences, such as drink-driving, although clearly not where someone has killed someone, and breach of warrants or bail. I hope that that covers most of the points that were raised. If it does not, I am happy to come back in writing or to talk outside the Chamber.</p>

It is vital that we continue to do all that we can to improve the delivery of justice and I am glad that these points were raised today.

Finally, Amendments Nos. 182E and 182J both require reporting authorities to have regard to their own report in the exercise of their relevant functions. This is important as it will help to ensure ongoing consideration of adaptation and that it is mainstreamed through embedding in the workings of an organisation.</p>

As already noted, we agree with the overall aim of Amendment No. 183A regarding the need for risk assessments, plans and guidance and the need to disclose information and to co-operate in light of government guidance and evidence. I thank noble Lords for all the work that has been done on this, and for the indication that we are all thinking in a similar way.</p>

<a name="80123-0012.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="0801248000058">There are only three main areas of difference. First, Amendment No. 183A suggests a blanket general duty on all listed authorities. We believe that that process would impose disproportionate burdens and costs on public bodies. As previously explained, we feel that the targeted, risk-based power outlined in the government amendment would be a more appropriate approach. Secondly, the Government's approach is more in line with the relationship between central and local government in terms of local autonomy and flexibility. It would also not cut across and duplicate other performance management frameworks. Thirdly, the Government's amendments cover a broader range of organisations than those in Amendment No. 183A. That amendment proposes that a duty should apply to bodies listed in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. While this list covers the most essential bodies to civil responses in major crises, a wider range of bodies may need to be covered to address ongoing adaptation issues. I have tried to complete that as quickly and as succinctly as possible. I beg to move.</p>

It is right that certain bodies should have duties and the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 states very well those that should have such duties. I agree absolutely with the Minister that his amendment would cover a broader range of organisations where there need not be a duty as such but a more discretionary approach at the call of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="0801248000067">In the background notes to the amendment, the Minister indicated how and on what evidence the decision to require a body to report would be taken. The evidence is in three chunks. One is the overall risk assessment across the nation, which I believe would be very broad brush and would not identify individual organisations that are not doing the right thing by adapting to climate change. The second is a little staggering because it is evidence for events, which is like saying, &#147;Let&#146;s see which bodies screw up&#148;, and then requiring the ones that screw up to report&#151;I apologise for the unparliamentary language. It does not seem satisfactory that we wait for evidence of failure. The third is existing performance frameworks. I shall give just two examples. One example is the criteria by which local authorities report. The local authority performance indicators are very selective; local authorities can choose the ones on which they will report, although they will have to provide information on the full range. Another example is the utilities, such as electricity companies. Unless they are specifically required by the energy regulator to provide information that would allow a judgment to made about whether they are doing a decent job by climate change-proofing their systems, I am not sure how that judgment would be made. Under the government amendment, the Minister would be floundering to get the right sort of evidence to be able to tell which of the many, many bodies he would want to require a report from because he believed that they were not doing a good job of adapting to climate change.</p>

That is a bit slow. We are already seeing the impact of the sort of weather that climate change will bring, and if we wait for that rather leisurely process we might well find ourselves in three, four, five, six or 10 years still waiting for some of the big investment programmes that some of these important providers of public

Right at the end of her remarks, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, spoke of her fear of the leisurely process, which is exactly the point I was making in an earlier debate on the need for prompt action if we identify that something is wrong. The process takes quite a long time to unfold as you go through planning and all the rest of it; I cited the example of the Maidenhead flood defence scheme.</p>

There was nothing that she said with which I did not agree wholeheartedly. It was very interesting; as, point by point, she ticked off certain matters, I observed that those were exactly the points that I had written in response to the Government&#146;s speech. For example, she referred to the relationship with local authorities, which is particularly critical for the Environment Agency. For all its good work, it can find flow systems blocked by local authorities that take the wrong decisions on planning, or obstacles which the Environment Agency feels should be removed. The noble Baroness referred to electrical services. Certainly it was my experience that when one had floods, one was also often acutely nervous about the possibility of the total loss of power as electrical facilities were inadequately protected or inadequately raised above the flood. She spoke about rail services. Like many others, I was diverted by way of Bath on the way from Cardiff and Newport on Monday. As soon as you have a bit of rain, the main rail line from South Wales to Paddington floods. It is a regular event now and really some action has to be taken to see that that kind of thing does not happen. The noble Baroness made the point absolutely rightly that it is not enough just to have guidance; we need clearly stated requirements.

Keswick is at the head of the Derwent Valley, situated under Skiddaw and about three miles downstream from Thirlmere, which is the main water supply for Manchester. In 2005 there was a major flood which, in the view of most people in West Cumberland, arose because of climate change. The powers of the Environment Agency were tested. The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, who is in the Chamber, is the chief executive of the Environment Agency. She saw all my correspondence and knows of the many meetings that I have had with it. During my dealings with the Environment Agency, I found that there was a dispute over what powers it had to instruct the water company&#151;United Utilities, which owned and extracted water from Thirlmere&#151;to control the amount of water that it holds there. The higher the water level, the greater the likelihood of flooding in Keswick at times of the year when there is heavy rainfall.</p>

In fact, we found ourselves arguing with its lawyers about what powers it had. I thought that it had the powers and I was quoting from sections of legislation.

But the fact is that it is a private company and water is its asset. Therefore, there is a conflict. The shareholders and the company will want to retain their assets. But the people will say, &#147;Our communities are endangered&#148; because of what they believe to be the effects of climate change.</p>

If public bodies do not have a duty in this area they will be disabled in taking the sort of action they need to take. I know from my years of experience in local government that local government also should have such a duty. I have not previously advocated laying too many local duties on local government, as I would rather that it was given powers and choice. Here, however, we are talking about short-term action that needs to happen quickly. If the Bill does not place this duty on all public bodies then we will be saying that they have first to address their other duties. They will be assessed on those other duties, because that is how the assessment schemes work; they will be assessed as excellent or failing on the basis of whether they are performing those duties.

I mean &#147;planning&#148; in its widest sense because that is what adaptation means. I do not think the Minister would suggest a more relaxed timeframe of 10, 15 or 20 years. The work needs to start now. Public bodies need to be given this duty to enable them to reprioritise some of their thinking and to re-address the issues of how they work.

How often will they prepare reports? From the text of the amendments, it appears that they will do so on demand. It occurs to me that one might compare and contrast&#151;in the classic sense&#151;the responsibilities on the Secretary of State under Clauses 48 and 49 with those being placed on public authorities. However, the authorities will be outlining their progress towards meeting the objectives that they have outlined, which is certainly welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="0801248000089">While we welcome the Government trying to correct their omission, I wonder whether they have gone far enough. Although the amendments place a duty on reporting authorities to publish statements of proposals and assessments of their progress, there is not an actual duty to comply with their proposed measures. As it stands, it would be enough for a public authority to develop a plan and not do anything at all, as long as it published a report saying so. It seems that this provision could be tightened. Does the Minister agree that it is important for there to be an assurance that public authorities will implement their adaptation proposals? Incidentally, are there really 25,000 public authorities in the United Kingdom? I am astounded at the figure. At any rate,

We certainly support the spirit of this amendment. Action to adapt to climate change is not going to happen unless there is a concerted effort from everyone involved. Our slight scepticism stems from the fact that it is unclear whether this duty is necessary in this part of the Bill. It is also unclear how far this amendment might be applied. The section has no explicit reference to any persons or bodies, so while I assume it targets government policy and agencies, it is unclear how far that targeting could be extended. It seems too prescriptive&#151;and, at the same time, unclear and nebulous.</p>

We do not need to wait until the national risk assessment is complete to use the power, although it would be a significant step forward in terms of our evidence base. It is not a question of waiting. There is a wide range of circumstances where the power could be used, not just in the light of an event such as the floods this summer, but in the light of the national risk assessment in Clause 48 and the adaptation programme in Clause 49, or on the basis of new scientific evidence. The power is designed to mesh with, not duplicate, other activities to mainstream adaptation into ongoing work. For example, I think I may have mentioned the new local government performance framework and the making space for water strategy, which is due early this year. We do not need to wait until the national risk assessment is complete to use the power.</p>

The impact of climate change will be felt by everyone. The term covers more persons and bodies than are contained in the list in Schedule 1 to the Civil Contingencies Act. We think it is important that the power to issue guidance and directions should cover more bodies than are caught by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. For example, drainage boards and the Countryside Council for Wales are not covered by the list in the 2004 Act, but they should be thinking about the need to adapt to climate change.

Our approach should ensure a similar outcome as a duty but without what we think would be disproportionate burdens and costs. The reporting element will increase transparency over progress in adapting to climate change and provide an incentive for authorities to act. The duty would be supported by the information to be produced by the Government following commitments in the Bill. The statutory guidance will set out the processes that are useful in establishing both the risks from the impact of climate change and how to draw up adaptation strategies. That guidance would help make the public sector&#146;s approach to risk assessment more consistent and so help us build a more accurate picture of the risks and the action needed to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="0801248000127">The noble Lord said: I do not wish to prolong the debate for too much longer. I shall speak briefly to the amendments in this group which relate to co-ordination.  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_321"><b>23 Jan 2008 : Column 321</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I remind the Committee that we discussed Amendment No. 183B at length, which concerns the setting up of an independent scrutiny committee. During that debate I came to the conclusion that the amendment was too weak and that that body needed to be stronger. The body would be an advisory group but it is necessary to ensure greater clarity as regards leadership in this area. This is borne out in practice with regard to the various agencies involved in delivering adaptation on the ground. Rather than inventing new organisations or opting for radical change, we believe that the Environment Agency should have a much stronger and more obvious leadership role in this area.</p>

<a name="80123-0015.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="0801248000128">I remind the Committee that dealing with river and coastline flooding are already the responsibility of the Environment Agency, but drainage is in the hands of local authorities. Water on main roads comes under the remit of the Highways Agency and local authorities; and private water companies are responsible for sewer flooding. As we saw last year, a complex system of organisations deals with water at different stages in different places while it is going in different directions. However, what is important from a citizen&#146;s point of view is that the matter is dealt with quickly and effectively.</p>

<a name="80123-0015.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="0801248000129">I am not sure that the relevant amendment completely fulfils that objective as we accept that there needs to be a national advisory committee. However, we believe that to enable all the bodies that have responsibilities in this area to take effective executive action on the ground, a body such as the Environment Agency should have a lead role, thereby enabling everybody to know where the leadership role resides, and the responsibilities that come from that.</p>

<a name="80123-0015.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="0801248000130">Amendment No. 183BA, which stands in my name, would amend the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act to make sure that it contains a duty to co-ordinate the assessment of risk due to climate change and to co-ordinate adaptation and other such measures. It is important to include that duty in the responsibilities of the bodies covered by that Act. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0801248000131"><b><a name="80123-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="0801248000293">Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> These amendments have our broad support. There is, indeed, a serious problem with this country&#146;s approach to dealing with floods. As the floods last summer revealed, there needs to be a better strategy. Indeed, more recently, floods have kept some noble Lords from the Chamber. We are all delighted to see the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, in his place today after his enforced absence yesterday. There were rumours that government business managers had ensured that he would not be present.</p>

<a name="80123-0015.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="0801248000132">As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said, there are too many agencies and organisations with competing priorities to be able to co-ordinate the fight against flooding in a manner that will achieve results. Floods, and the various things that are required to assess their risk and prevent them, do not seem to fall to any single authority&#146;s jurisdiction. Local authorities at different levels, the Highways Agency, water companies, government departments, agencies, including the Environment Agency, and others all have responsibility. I am not against having a diversity of providers, as long as they are

As has been mentioned in earlier debates, river systems are enormously complex and spread far across many local boundaries.</p>

<a name="80123-0015.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="0801248000133">There is also still a considerable responsibility, which is often overlooked, on local landowners. Where these are exercised through internal drainage boards, they are generally well managed. However, too often elsewhere no one seems to take charge of the neglected drain or abandoned field ditch that should be part of a surface water drainage system of a recently constructed housing estate or business park. The poor maintenance of drains, ditches and sometimes sewers contributes to the risk of flooding.</p>

<a name="80123-0015.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="0801248000134">Furthermore, there is a failure to appreciate and respond to the strategic nature of flood risk. At the moment, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the potential risk of future flooding, and more work certainly needs to be done. Does the Minister have flooding in mind when he talks about adaptation to climate change? Where does the Minister think the responsibility for co-ordinating the response to flooding should lie in the future?</p>

I will speak in favour of the amendment proposed by my noble friend and I will call in evidence the flooding that took place in Hull in east Yorkshire last summer and the independent review body&#146;s interim and final reports on that flooding, which have now been published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="0801248000136">When the flooding in Hull was taking place, I was, fortunately, a long way away in the Pyrenees, but some of the people whom we were with there were from the Hull area and we got a fairly first-hand account of the horrific circumstances there. We now know that some 8,600 homes and 1,300 businesses were affected by the flooding. Some 6,300 people were forced to live in temporary accommodation and many other people camped out upstairs or lived in caravans and so on.</p>

I came away extremely impressed by the way in which everyone in the city had mucked in and worked together, including local community groups, the council and its employees, the other statutory bodies, the police and everyone else.

To meet some of them in their homes was a very encouraging experience, because of the resilience of the community in the face of what was absolutely horrific&#151;when the water just rose and there was nothing that anyone could do about it because there was nowhere for it to go. Hull is built on a classic flood plain; the whole of Hull is just above sea level, just below sea level or at sea level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="0801248000139">One of the things that the city council did was to set up the independent review body quickly, under the chairmanship of Professor Tom Coulthard, the professor of physical geography at the University of Hull. I had the opportunity to read both the interim report, which was ready when I went to Hull, and the more recent final report. The reports are an absolute model of readability and clarity in their presentation; that has to be commended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="0801248000140">The reason for commenting on those reports this evening is that some of the fundamental points that they make are in support of this amendment. They clearly point out that no single agency was in charge of flooding in Hull. This was singular, unusual flooding because it was pluvial&#151;that is to say, rainwater flooding&#151;rather than an overflow of rivers or the breaching of coastal defences. It was almost entirely because there was simply too much rain falling on that very flat place for the drains to cope. There was no problem with the maintenance of the gullies or the drains; it was simply that the system could not cope with the huge volume of water that fell.</p>

<a name="80123-0015.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="0801248000141">I shall read three of the recommendations from the interim report. The first one is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_98"><a name="0801248000239">&#147;No single agency (e.g. Yorkshire Water, Environment Agency, Hull City Council) accepts responsibility for any elements outside their own terms of reference nor have they historically allowed others to influence their own obligations. This is a recurring theme&#151;one of inadequate consultation, co-operation and unity between the agencies&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801248000174">not after the event but beforehand, in order to have a system in place that could cope better. Here is a further recommendation:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_99"><a name="0801248000240">&#147;The flooding in Hull has revealed the difficulties of having multiple agencies responsible for different areas of the drainage system. We feel it is vital that the Environment Agency, local authority and water company closely co-operate on operation, investment and design&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801248000175">The review body&#146;s solution, looking at the problem from the local point of view of Hull, is this:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_100"><a name="0801248000241">&#147;We recommend that an independent Drainage Board for Hull is set up&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80123-0015.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="0801248000142">The final report, which confirms the findings of the interim report, includes a related recommendation:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_101"><a name="0801248000242">&#147;Formal and accountable cross-agency co-operation and co-ordination must be implemented&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801248000176">Interestingly, the report adds:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102"><a name="0801248000243">&#147;Emergency planning for pluvial flooding&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801248000177">that is, rainwater flooding&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0801248000252">&#147;should be undertaken by all regional and local authorities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801248000178">The report is excellent. The people who produced it are to be congratulated on it, as is the city council on commissioning it. I hope that all the agencies concerned&#151;they will, no doubt, have copies&#151;will take it very seriously. My basic point is in support of my noble friend&#146;s amendment: there has to be a much more unified, co-ordinated approach to flood control, particularly in places that are built on coastal flood plains, such as Hull.</p>

Indeed, we are international leaders in many aspects of tackling climate change and recognised as such by the United Nations. There are very few people in the Committee who would not accept that forestry has a major role to play in combating climate change. Our key approach is based on sound science. I argue that sound science is critical if we are to be effective in tackling this problem. We have a next-steps agency, Forestry Research, which, again, is an international leader in forestry. We have statutory responsibilities regarding diseases of plants and trees.</p>

In other words, there will be two public bodies trying to achieve the same ends. That coloured my earlier thinking, when I felt that it was necessary to be focused and clear on this. I have no real problem over who does what, but it must be made clear in the Bill or we will have more confusion. The result will be that we do not get the action that we all desperately want this Bill to deliver. I ask the Minister for an assurance that he will go back and check all these amendments. There may be many other bodies in a queue. Any one of the 25,000 other public bodies could be affected by these two amendments, which have, perhaps, been suggested to the Minister without the full implications having been completely thought through.</p>

He goes on to say that the current patchwork of legislation and responsibilities is not helpful and needs addressing. One of the interim conclusions is that flooding legislation should be updated and streamlined under a single unifying Act addressing all sources of flooding, clarifying responsibilities and focusing on a risk-based approach to managing flooding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="0801248000149">Defra is currently developing a more integrated, holistic approach to all forms of inland flood risk, across a range of government policies.

In defining the new role, the projects considering the existing relationship between flood-risk management organisations include local authorities, the Highways Agency, Ofwat and water companies, who are determining how it will work in practice.</p>

The project is drawing evidence from the integrated urban drainage pilots and the lessons learnt from the summer 2007 floods. That would include the report specifically from Hull and other local areas. It is essential that the Government do not make hasty decisions on an issue of such importance as overall responsibility and, first, we must properly assess the evidence. That evidence is being collected in the Pitt review which does not report finally until summer 2008. Consultation is under way on the very substantial interim conclusions.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0001.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08012365000009">The noble Lord said: This amendment deals with Clause 6, which is about guidance to local authorities. Subsection (2) lists a number of areas in which guidance may be given: it may be given to one or more local authorities; it may relate to one or more relevant functions; and it may relate to the exercise of one or more relevant functions. My amendment seeks to add a new paragraph (d) and includes the word &#147;must&#148;, indicating that it is obligatory, not permissive, as the clause stands.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08012365000010">It seems to me that if local authorities are anxious to find out how to exercise their functions and they choose to ask the LBRO, the LBRO should not be able to duck the question. In my other lives, one of the most aggravating issues has been when you go to a regulator and say, &#147;Look, this is something that we are a bit concerned about. Can you help us to decide whether we should proceed?&#148;, and the regulator says, &#147;Go ahead, and we&#146;ll decide whether we&#146;re going to take you to court afterwards when you&#146;ve broken a particular regulation&#148;. Local authorities should be able to ask the LBRO for guidance and the LBRO should have to provide it if asked. It should not be able to say, &#147;This is a bit difficult. We&#146;d like to duck this one&#148;.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08012365000011">I added the words &#147;without charge&#148; because the other way to shut off difficult inquiries is to say, &#147;If you want to make the inquiry, it will cost you a lot of money. We&#146;ll charge you for it because it will cost us to prepare this advice&#148;. That is a way of ducking the issue. Therefore, I should like to add an obligatory paragraph (d) to Clause 6(2) whereby, if requested, the LBRO must give guidance to a local authority and cannot charge for doing so. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC104"><b>23 Jan 2008 : Column GC104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>There is an issue concerning the weight of guidance, which we shall come to. I do not know whether the noble Lord has it in mind that a request made by one authority will have force as regards all other authorities, but it seems me to that he makes a very good point here. Whether it is about guidance in the formal sense or the less formal sense in which we would probably use the term outside this building, I do not know, but, having identified the point, there may be some implications which have not been foreseen and which one might think through after today.</p>

<p><a name="08012365000013"><b><a name="80123-gc0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="08012365000142">Lord Bach:</b> The amendment would transform the way in which the LBRO operated. Clause 6 sets out its function of giving guidance to which local authorities must have regard. Guidance can be issued to one or more local authorities, in relation to one or more relevant regulatory functions and, where necessary, in relation to particular cases. The subject matter of any such guidance is rightly a matter for the LBRO&#146;s discretion. In practice, we would expect the LBRO to feel able to give advice to businesses and local authorities on an ad hoc basis where this would be helpful. This amendment would require the LBRO to give guidance on request.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08012365000014">We see two risks here, both of them quite serious. First, the LBRO would quickly become completely overloaded with requests for guidance. I emphasise that it has always been our intention that the LBRO should not be a huge organisation, but a compact one. Secondly, even though there is a cost element in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, we still think that vexatious use could easily be made of this process. A business might delay effective enforcement action by calling in the LBRO.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08012365000015">The LBRO&#146;s responsiveness to topical issues in regulatory enforcement by local authorities will of course be critical. Perhaps I may add that if the LBRO is asked for guidance and it refuses quite unreasonably to do so, its refusal could be challenged by way of judicial review. Whether such an application is successful would depend on the level of unreasonableness, but we think that we have this right. The amendment would open the door too wide.</p>

<p><a name="08012365000016"><b><a name="80123-gc0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="08012365000143">Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for her sympathy. I expected that the Minister would not like an obligation on the LBRO and I accept the force of the arguments about administrative overload and vexatious use. I understand too what the Minister has said about how the LBRO will be expected to be responsive. However, in any practical case, I have to say that it is unreasonable to think that a business will go to judicial review to try and get the LBRO to give advice. That would never happen because it would not be worthwhile. If, in practice, as the Minister hopes&#151;and I share those hopes&#151;the LBRO responds positively, that will be fine. If, however, the LBRO finds that it is in a sticky position and uses delaying tactics to avoid having to make difficult decisions, I suspect that some of its value will be undermined because I do not think that those seeking advice would ever wish to go to court to try and force the LBRO to give advice as appropriate.

But here we are in the realms of guidance, which has a lot of both formality and force.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08012365000020">Amendment No. 31 seeks to amend Clause 6(4) by ensuring that the LBRO must consult those listed not only before giving guidance, but before varying or revoking it. I am grateful to the Bill team for pointing out that before the LBRO varies or revokes guidance, or in doing so, under Clause 6(6) it issues further guidance. If it is going to do so, then before that it would have to consult on it. So in a sense there is a revolving door here. Every time it wants to change what it has issued, there has to be another consultation. That is quite right, but it led me to wonder whether, if it simply wanted to withdraw guidance and not issue any substitution, it has to issue guidance that is no guidance, or says, &#147;This guidance does not amount to anything&#148; for there to be the consultation that the clause requires? That seems a bit of nonsense. I am sure that, in the real world, these things would normally happen quite sensibly, but we are trying to make the legislation as close to foolproof as we can.</p>

Amendment No. 40E was tabled quite late at the request of the National Consumer Council. I wanted it to see the response to its way of dealing with the matter. Of course, sometimes there may be conflict between the interests of the consumer and of business, in particular.

I emphasise that this amendment relates to Clause 11, which is rather different from Clause 6&#151;the guidance clause. While &#147;representative bodies&#148; are not specifically mentioned in Clause 11, the guide to the Bill makes clear our intentions regarding this point. Subsection (3) makes sufficient provision regarding the LBRO&#146;s obligation to consult prior to publishing a list of regulatory priorities.</p>

This group of amendments implements two recommendations by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of this House in relation to Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill. On Amendment No. 33, the committee took the view that the use of the LBRO&#146;s powers of direction to make compliance with guidance compulsory for local authorities, or Ministers&#146; use of their power of direction over the LBRO to do so, would have an essentially legislative character where these affected more than one local authority. Noble Lords will have seen the committee&#146;s report on this issue, which recommended that any such directions should be made subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the negative resolution procedure. There is no intention that the powers of direction should be used to circumvent Parliament or the Welsh Assembly. The Government have therefore accepted the recommendation in full and the amendment would implement it in both the English and Welsh contexts.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0001.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08012365000046">Amendments Nos. 52 and 55 relate to Clauses 15 and 16 and deal with the related changes to Ministers&#146; directive powers. Amendments Nos. 59 to 61 relate to Clause 18. However, it is important that I should tell the Committee that, because I did not press an earlier government amendment, Amendment No. 60 should read, &#147;A statutory instrument containing an order made by the Secretary of State under section 7(3A) or 15(6)&#148;. The reference to &#147;4(7)&#148; is taken out because that would have followed only if I had pressed my earlier amendment. It is a technical matter but it is important that it should be on the record.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0001.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08012365000047">The amendments to Clauses 15, 16 and 18 would make appropriate changes to the procedure for statutory instruments under Part 1.

Clause 22 allows the Secretary of State to specify by order those enactments which specify regulatory functions performed by local authorities which will come within the scope of the primary authority scheme in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The committee took the view that this provision should be subject to the negative resolution procedure on condition that the orders were not used to extend the scope beyond that already listed for England and Wales in Schedule 3 and Clause 4(3).</p>

<a name="80123-gc0001.htm_para30">
<p><a name="08012365000049">The Government have accepted the substance of this recommendation subject to a minor drafting change. Had we restricted the orders to legislation already listed in the Bill for England and Wales, this may have resulted in the omission of legislation having an effect equivalent to that in Schedule 3 or Clause 4(3) for England and Wales but which is specified in legislation for Scotland and Northern Ireland. For example, many regulations that apply elsewhere in the UK under generic Acts of Parliament have been applied in Northern Ireland by Order in

Those should not be excluded, and the drafting change will not affect the substance of the order-making power. It will not be possible for the Secretary of State to extend the scope of application of the Bill in respect of Scotland or Northern Ireland by way of an order under the clause. The amendment would therefore restrict the orders not to the legislation listed in the Bill but to legislation which contains equivalent functions to those conferred by legislation listed in the Bill where this differs.

Where the LBRO could have issued a direction to all 400 authorities, it will be able, as a result of the amendments, to issue only to one. How often could it issue a direction to one authority? On Monday, it could issue a direction to one, on Tuesday, it could issue a direction to another and on Wednesday, it could issue to a third. For what is it intended that the LBRO might use these directions? As the Minister said, under Clause 15, the Secretary of State can start the process by giving the LBRO a direction to make a direction. It would help the Committee enormously if we understood what it is intended that the power of direction might be used to achieve.</p>

In fact, the Secretary of State can realise exactly what the original clause in the Bill allowed him to do, only now he must limit himself to issuing a given direction, serially, and not in one fell swoop.

Anticipating Clauses 15 and 16, were the LBRO to act in this way, the Government would certainly consider using their powers of direction to stop it doing so.

The point of Clause 7 is as follows. We understand the concerns relating to it. It allows the LBRO to give directions to one or more local authorities to comply with guidance that it, or another body, such as a national regulator, has issued. The power to direct is intended as a backstop power that might be used where, for example, one or more local authorities persistently acts with disregard for a particular piece of guidance and that disregard is, frankly, detrimental to business or the public or, as could often happen, both.</p>

<p><a name="08012365000062">It is not intended that the LBRO will be directing local authorities as a matter of routine, and its use of this power is subject to important controls. Let me set those out. It may only use the power to direct a local authority: first, with the consent of the Secretary of State, or Welsh Ministers where applicable; secondly, after consultation with any relevant regulator; and, thirdly, after consultation with such other persons as the LBRO considers appropriate. We believe that that will include local authorities, LACORS and professional bodies such as the Trading Standards Institute and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health.</p>

<p><a name="08012365000063">The Committee will know that the Government have accepted the recommendation that that should be subject to a statutory instrument process where directions apply to more than one local authority.</p>

<p><a name="08012365000065">The Government recognise that there are legitimate anxieties about the use of powers of direction by public bodies at the centre in the context of local democracy. I suspect that that is what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, and the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, are getting at in their questions. It is easy to caricature this debate as one of central versus local government, but the LBRO needs to be able to address the particular issues facing regulatory services which are, frankly of critical national importance but, perhaps too often, although certainly not always, have an extremely low priority for local authorities in practice.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08012365000067">Our consultation produced an overwhelming view from business that the LBRO would need significant powers of compulsion beyond those of merely issuing guidance. Perhaps that is not very surprising. But business is not alone in that view; many of those who understand the sector well, and have its best interests at heart, take the view that a small, strategic body with significant powers is critical to the future success of our local regulatory services.</p>

<p><a name="08012365000074">It is important that we address what is, in some ways, at the heart of the matter. We will come to other relevant clauses, but this is about local democracy, the autonomy of each local authority and, somewhere else in the forest, the need to ensure proper regulation. My objection is, of course, to the power of direction. I have heard so much over the years about local authorities&#146; freedoms and flexibilities and yet, too often, we come to a point where it is freedom &#147;so far but no further&#148;. There may be a direction to a recalcitrant individual authority or to all local authorities. Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether the requirement in subsection (4) that before giving a direction the LBRO has to consult will extend from the individual authority to all local authorities. This follows our debate on an earlier clause. At the moment the consultation is with &#147;such other persons&#148;, other than the relevant regulator, &#147;as LBRO considers appropriate&#148;.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08012365000075">Either way, having given guidance, if the LBRO is then faced with the question of whether it should give a direction, I would say that it has pretty much failed because its guidance has not taken everyone along with it, and that is the style that we are being encouraged to assume will be adopted. It will also have corrupted the English language in the process, because while a direction about guidance is not a contradiction in terms, perhaps it should be.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08012365000076">Under Clause 6, local authorities must have &#147;regard&#148; to guidance. Every local authority will have a published enforcement policy, it will be required to comply with the statutory regulator&#146;s compliance code, and the manner in which functions should be conducted is expected to be clear, proportionate and transparent. If a local authority does not have due regard&#151;which properly allows for rejection; due regard cannot mean rolling over and saying yes to everything&#151;to guidance, there are legal appeal mechanisms, a corporate complaints procedure and the local government ombudsman. All of this has been pointed out by the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services in its very good briefing.</p>

I thought that this briefing, while in some respects interesting and useful, is particularly weak on Clause 7. It refers to:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012365000120">&#147;Removal of the power of the LBRO to direct local authorities to comply with its guidance&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012365000106">Local authorities are already required to have regard to LBRO guidance. In thinking that Clause 6 is unnecessary, surely the LGA is thinking of the generality. Indeed, as my noble friend the Minister indicated a short while ago, the LBRO is not going to jump in just because of a difference of view between them as to whether the guidance issued should be followed.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08012365000080">Enforcement is completely unnecessary if on all occasions every local authority up and down the country complies with what the LBRO says is significant and important. But what if a wayward local authority persistently takes no notice of the guidance? It makes no sense for the LBRO to be given no provision in statute to deal with an exceptional case. Statutes have to deal with the exceptional case as well as ordinary circumstances, and let us not forget the safeguards. There has to be ministerial consent, or the consent of Welsh Ministers, and Clause 7(4) provides that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012365000121">&#147;Before giving a direction ... LBRO must consult&#151;</p>
</ul><ul><a name="08012365000130">(a) any relevant regulator, and</ul><ul><a name="08012365000131">(b) such other persons as LBRO considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012365000107">So safeguards are built in. There is no intention that the new body should rampage over local authorities. However, if it has given guidance, and it is clear that that is not being taken notice of by a particular local authority, especially persistently, surely there has to be a back-up power, which is what Clause 7 is.</p>

<p><a name="08012365000082">My noble friend Lord Hodgson spoke of the difference between talking and going to war. I remind the Committee that if one goes to war, one has to have a pretty good reason to believe that one would win. I cannot think that any single local authority would rate its chances very highly. It seems that all the leverage is on the side of central government.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08012365000083">The Minister said that the amendments give Parliament the right to pass a negative resolution to stop directions being given to more than one authority. Nevertheless, another sentence in the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012365000122">&#147;We consider that the Minister should provide a list of the guidance to which Clause 7(1)(b) refers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012365000108">As the noble Baroness said, there is something called &#147;advice&#148; and there is something called &#147;guidance&#148;, which is written. Some of my questions on the previous amendment sought more information on the level of certainty of the guidance at which somebody, either in the Secretary of State&#146;s office, because of

It is not as though it is a normal situation where a Secretary of State is giving directions to a public body; many more players are involved who can initiate the process.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08012365000085">The power for the LBRO to make directions in Clause 7(1) as amended today by Amendment No. 33, which will introduce subsection (3A), still raises two major issues. Before I go into them, I point out that the clause has a contradictory title: <I>Guidance to local authorities: enforcement.</I> I have always been brought up to believe that when Daddy or Grandaddy gave me guidance, they were not intending to enforce it, and I was hoping to find that they had no power to do so.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08012365000086">Further, I can find nothing in the Rogers report, which was cited by the Minister on Monday. It is 187 pages long and, on first reading, looks like a most diligent and excellent report. I think that a huge amount of work has gone into it. I find nothing in its recommendations which goes beyond a request that the Government agree the proposed six priorities, which are set out&#151;the Government had asked for five; Rogers came up with six&#151;and that local authorities, having been given the approval, which will assist them at all times but particularly in times of straitened resources, to get on with the job, and that the LBRO be the guardian and monitor of best practice. It is clear that Rogers is fully in support of the LBRO being the guardian and monitor of best practice; he says nothing about enforcement by the LBRO upon local authorities. Nor is there good evidence that enforcement upon local authorities was part of Hampton, still less of Macrory. They were all looking for enlightened, continuous improvement in the process of regulation by consent.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08012365000087">The first big issue in Clause 7 is that it gives the LBRO, a non-departmental public body, the power to make guidance mandatory by direction, and a direction compels compliance. I have had some correspondence with the department, as the Minister will know, and I believe that this is an unprecedented use of the power to direct. If there is a precedent, will the Minister provide the Committee with it? The main reason I believe it to be unprecedented is its indirect nature and the number of parties involved. I cannot find an instance as complex as this one.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08012365000088">The second issue is that the width of the duty upon the LBRO to give guidance and to support the giving of guidance by regulators under their respective Acts, means that a direction made by the LBRO will still have legislative character. This raises the question as to whether the powers contained in the Bill can be justified. Before attempting to give my answer, it is  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"><b>23 Jan 2008 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>necessary for me to go back to something the Minister reminded the Committee about&#151;the interaction between Clauses 15 and 7. Although Clause 7 has the safeguard of the Secretary of State needing to give consent to an LBRO proposal to direct, nevertheless, under Clause 15, the Secretary of State could give the LBRO a direction to direct a local authority, thus overriding Clause 7. That is not altered by the amendments put forward today. This combination of powers to direct places the control of the scheme laid out in the Bill unequivocally in the hands of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08012365000089">Amendments Nos. 33 and 52 do not change the fundamental position; they reduce the powers so that they can only be exercised without parliamentary scrutiny if they are applied to one local authority. Thus, if it were judged that the regulatory behaviour of Camden in response to guidance was inconsistent with that of Cornwall, and that both were in error, a direction could be given first to one and then to the other to get into line. It seems extremely unlikely that one ever could achieve consistency between Northumberland and Hackney, for example. The process could either start under Clause 7 with the LBRO or under Clause 15 with the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08012365000090">At this stage&#151;again I apologise for speaking at some length&#151;I will say more about how directions have come to be used to seek powers as wide as those in Clause 7, which need compelling justification. There are two reasons. As directions never have been, and are not, subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval&#151;and usually must be complied with&#151;successive Governments have introduced them into Acts for limited purposes. The two accepted purposes are, first, for administrative reasons&#151;matters such as how to prepare accounts or keep asset registers in line with Treasury practice&#151;and, secondly, as a power of last resort. That is why one was pursuing backstop, compulsory and reserve powers. A power of last resort is to be used if and when a public body moves too far away from the purposes set for it by Parliament&#151;so far, so good&#151;and is well recorded in accepted commentaries such as Bennion and Craies. Later in the Bill, we will come to amendments which follow the Constitution Committee&#146;s similar views on the subject of directions and the need to be cautious because of the lack of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0002.htm_para29">
<p><a name="08012365000091">I turn to my second main issue. In recent years, the use and potential use of directions have been widened to include things such as general and policy directions and, in this instance, to include two ways&#151;one direct and one indirect&#151;in which guidance can be turned into an instruction on behalf of the Secretary of State, either on the LBRO&#146;s own initiative or as a result of an initiative by a regulator. I believe that this puts local authorities in an impossible position. If so little confidence is shown in their ability to follow and resolve regulatory issues and if the determination of how they should be resolved is to move them into the hands of a centralised public body doing the bidding of the Secretary of State, why should local authorities be diligent? They could tell themselves and their constituents that, once again, they must do what they are told. It is no fun barking when a bigger dog is about to tell you how and when to do so.</p>

<p><a name="08012365000111">There is no mention of the consumer, just businesses. Someone with my background might be expected to approve of that aspect of it but it is interesting nevertheless.

Every amendment would add more and more words. Very few words are sufficient, but people want more and more. The word &#147;appropriate&#148; in Clause 7 is a good one. You must then rely on the intelligence of those issuing these documents to know that if they issue something then those affected ought to be informed. If you want to defy business practice and write essays&#151;as an academic I would love to write longer essays and think of many more exceptions to this rule&#151;then do it, but you are not adding anything substantial to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08012369000001">As to the Question whether the clause shall stand part, again I am puzzled. I have never been involved in a local authority and, therefore, do not have the great regard for local authorities that some people involved in them have. However, I know one law of British politics: when parties are in opposition, they extol the freedom and value of local authorities and say that they should be able to do what they want, but when those parties get into power they see to it that local authorities are told what to do&#151;or else. That has been my observation of local authority life for at least the past 42 years.</p>

I shall deal, first, with the intention to oppose Clause 7, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and my noble friend Lord Eccles have put their names. As Clause 7 stands, it gives the power of direction to local authorities, as many noble Lords have said. Therefore, we face a situation in which an unelected, non-departmental body is issuing a direction, which comes with a duty to comply, to elected local government bodies.</p>

He could argue that we are in such a place. However, I do not believe that he can feasibly argue that the LBRO is independent. He has pointed out today that it is subject to the direction of the Secretary of State, so it is clear that it is not a non-departmental body but an arm of government that implements directions, not all of which, as my noble friend Lord Eccles said, are to be laid before Parliament. It is a flagrant bypassing of the constitutional process.</p>

I suggest that this clause is a far cry from two of the stated aims in Clause 5&#151;transparency and accountability. Therefore, I support the demand of my noble friend Lord Eccles that the Minister give us sufficient justification as to why this unprecedented relationship should be created. If he were able to do that, I would support my noble friend Lord Hodgson, whose Amendment No. 34 replaces the original instruction to publish any direction, subject to the opinion of the LBRO, to ensure that it gets into the hands of those who need to know.</p>

The approach taken by some noble Lords who have spoken suggests that Clause 7 will be implemented and used on a regular, day-to-day basis and that local authorities will be directed and told what to do, or else, almost from the very start. I attempted to describe the Government&#146;s view on this when dealing with the previous amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, but I need to try again in order to persuade the Committee that these are not savage powers that will be used by a ruthless organisation which is the creature of government; it is a sensible provision which is supported by business, by the National Consumer Council and by the Trading Standards Institute.</p>

I do not accept that. The people who will make up that body will have been working in trading standards for many years.

Our attention has been drawn to it because it has support from other noble Lords and we understand the intention behind it. Clause 7(6) requires the LBRO to publish directions that it issues under Clause 7 in such a manner as it considers appropriate. Clause 7(6) does not explicitly state that the LBRO must publish its directions in such a manner as to ensure that those affected are informed; its general duties as a statutory corporation require it to do this. In particular, it is under a general public duty not to carry out its duties or functions irrationally. Frankly, if it were to issue a direction and not inform those that it affected, the direction would be likely to be struck out in any judicial review challenge. There could hardly be a greater irrationality than for the LBRO not to inform

<p><a name="08012369000014">The accusation is that Clause 7 is all about centralism. We make no apologies for responding appropriately to the Hampton report, but it may interest the Committee that when Hampton proposed the Consumer and Trading Standards Agency, he envisaged it being a large non-departmental public body with powers comparable to the Food Standards Agency, which would have given the LBRO a detailed audit function and the right to take over the management of particular local services on direction by the Secretary of State. That is much more than what we propose in the Bill. Hampton went further than us. We have modified Hampton to try to meet criticisms that the Bill is just about centralism.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08012369000015">Noble Lords should accept that this is a distinctive area of policy that calls for a distinctive sectoral solution. There is too much complexity in the way in which regulations are imposed and enforced. Frequently, enforcement is a very low priority for local authorities. It is absolutely right that enforcement should belong with the experts at local level, but their work has national implications. The LBRO exists to improve co-ordination.</p>

He used the analogy of his daddy or granddaddy giving him &#147;guidance&#148; and said that, as far as he was concerned, that certainly did not mean that they were insistent. However, if his daddy or granddaddy had given him guidance and he wilfully refused to accept it&#151;not once or twice but wilfully refused to accept it&#151;I fear that his daddy or granddaddy might have insisted on that guidance being implemented. That is not a bad analogy with what we are discussing. To continue the analogy, I say that only a naughty authority or series of local authorities which continued unreasonably not to follow that guidance and to take no notice of it at all would be subject to Clause 7. That would be justified.</p>

<p><a name="08012369000021">The noble Viscount quite rightly reminded me that the committee on which he sits with distinction&#151;the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#151;asked my department for a list of the guidance that might be involved in the LBRO&#146;s powers of direction at Clause 7(1)(b). The Bill restricts this power to guidance that is issued to local authorities,</p>
<ul><a name="08012369000024">&#147;under an enactment ... which relates to the exercise of a relevant function&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012369000022">We replied:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012369000023">&#147;In effect this will mean guidance issued by other bodies with statutory powers to issue guidance relating to the exercise by local authorities of the functions that fall within LBRO&#146;s scope&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80123-gc0003.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08012380000002">The noble Viscount also asked whether there were any precedents to this specific approach. In the letter that I wrote to him a few days ago, I said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012380000266">&#147;I can only answer in relation to the Bill, which is specifically geared to the particular issues associated with regulatory services, and the difficulties of inconsistency and service which impacts adversely on the interests of businesses and consumers alike. Here as elsewhere in the Bill we have sought to find a means of creating a body charged with setting the best possible regulatory framework for UK businesses, without impacting adversely on local authorities&#146; operational requirements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012380000248">I shall say a little more about the fact that there is no precedent for these powers. We have not found a direct precedent but there are powers that we would argue are equivalent. For example, the Food Standards Agency can, under legislation, take over the food safety regulatory functions of a local authority where it considers that authority to be failing in its duties. Whether that is a precedent or not, I would argue that it is not a bad equivalent example.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0003.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08012380000003">The noble Viscount and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, also mentioned that under Clause 15 the Secretary of State&#146;s powers of direction seem to be unencumbered. However, they are encumbered, and we will eventually come to my Amendment No. 52, which I mentioned in passing a few minutes ago. That amendment states that the Secretary of State cannot give the LBRO directions relating to its functions under Clause 7 in relation to two or more local authorities. That is exactly what the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended. If the Secretary of State wants to direct the LBRO, he can do so only by order, subject to parliamentary oversight by the negative procedure. Therefore, the Secretary of State will also be encumbered in his powers. I hope that that goes a small way towards satisfying noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08012380000004">If businesses require a tough Clause 7, as the noble Lord, Lord Cope, suggested, I do not think that implies that that will not be in the interests of anyone else. I argue that it will also be in the interests of consumers. Perhaps I may quote briefly from the National Consumer Council. It is a very distinguished body and has been chaired by equally distinguished Members of this Committee, including my noble friend Lord Whitty, who is not in his place now but was here and spoke the other day. On Clause 7&#151;I argue that this is relevant&#151;it said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08012380000249">The council goes further than us, adding:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012380000309">&#147;Indeed, we are concerned that the requirements on LARS to consult and obtain the consent of the Secretary of State before issuing a direction are too onerous and might work to dissuade LBRO from legitimately exercising this power. The requirement on LBRO to conform to the better regulation principles should be sufficient to ensure LBRO uses this power appropriately&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012380000250">Our contention is that the National Consumer Council is absolutely right on this issue. I rely heavily on what my noble friend Lord Borrie said when, early in this debate, he argued that Clause 7 was just a sensible course to take in the Bill. My noble friend Lord Desai agreed with him.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0003.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08012380000005">Unlike my noble friend Lord Desai, I am a great fan of local government, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, for reminding me that he served on two different authorities some time ago. I have the greatest respect for its independence. I cannot for a moment accept what my noble friend said about how, when they come to power, Governments change their mind about the independence of local authorities. That certainly does not apply to my own Government.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0003.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08012380000006">I hope that noble Lords will bear in mind what I have had to say when they consider this clause, and I am conscious that I have gone on for some time. But this power will be used sparingly; it is a backstop provision and brings with it considerable safeguards. I do not think that noble Lords on the other side who have spoken have explained how this particular structure, one which is there to assist us in better regulation by local authorities, can possibly succeed without it.</p>

The noble Lord says that this is no place in which to have the argument about centralisation and decentralisation, but I remember very well a speech by the noble Lord, Lord Desai, in which he said more or less that while you may think that you can pursue decentralisation, you should not have the slightest hope that it will ever work. It was an extremely good speech, but of course it was completely wrong. He has also said that one government after another get beguiled by the need to keep powers in the hands of Secretaries of State and to be good centralisers. To a certain extent he is absolutely right, but there is always hope of amendment of life. Under the new leader of the Conservative Party, I think that we might just possible get there.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000008">I want to touch on just a couple of difficulties before responding to the full and helpful reply made by the Minister. There has been a lot of discussion about business. The Committee should remember that the whole deregulation/better regulation thing came about as a result of initiatives taken by business in dialogue with the political system. I suspect that that dialogue was of the kind that says, &#147;If we go on like this and impose all these costs, we shall become globally uncompetitive&#148;. That is certainly what happens in Brussels and is the kick-start for all this. A

<a name="80123-gc0003.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08012380000009">In that connection, I should mention that the second priority out of the six in the Rogers report is alcohol. I wonder whether the regulation of alcohol can ever be expected to be wholly consistent in every part of the country. When the Minister prays in aid the aim of consistency, has exactly what that means really been thought through? In that regard, the Committee is moving along with very little evidence. There are not too many hard examples of things where you can say, &#147;Yes of course, if the regime were to be changed, that would go better&#148;, in the documents I have read. On the matter of precedence, I shall certainly have a close look at the Food Standards Agency direction. I would be interested to see whether it has ever been used or looks likely to be.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0003.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08012380000010">Lastly, on the question of the frequency of use of a power to direct, of course that is something the Committee would be right to take into account. How often it is used is important. But one of the problems here is that there is no central database about directions. As far as I can see, it is extremely difficult to find out when directions have been used and what they were used for. As always I have had good assistance from the Library, but the librarians are finding that information difficult to track down. We have had again today all the assurances about safeguards, about the stop-gap and a reserve power, and how there is no intention to use it except when it is really necessary, but again the evidence for whether that has happened to date and whether it will continue to happen in the future is quite scanty.</p>

As I tried to make clear in one of our debates on Monday, much alcohol regulation comes from the police, because they have a major input into the matter, but they are quite outwith the whole of this legislation anyway, so a lacuna exists.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000023">Two of the amendments, to Clauses 9 and 10, would allow the LBRO to make &#147;recommendations&#148; rather than &#147;proposals&#148; to a Minister or Welsh Ministers. In drafting them, I was trying to understand what was meant by &#147;proposals&#148;. They would seem to be points which the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers would either accept or reject, and &#147;recommendations&#148; might imply more of a spectrum. I have tabled the amendments to understand the relationship between the LBRO and Ministers. It may be entirely technical, and the Minister may tell me that a provision of this order is necessary to make any advice to Ministers intra vires the LBRO. If so, it adds to the Bill. I suppose one must accept it, but if that is the answer it means that we must probably be very careful that everything we want the LBRO to be able to do is spelt out.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000024">The National Consumer Council brought Amendment No. 35A to me as another probing amendment, seeking clarification of whether the clause allows the LBRO to advise on whether local authorities are exercising their functions effectively, and whether Ministers intend the LBRO to have that function. Given that the central objective of the LBRO will be to secure precisely that effectiveness, as we discussed on Monday, it will have to collect evidence to assess this and report to Ministers. Is that covered by subsection 1(a), which refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08012380000310">&#147;the way in which ... local authorities ... exercise any of their relevant functions&#148;?</ul>

Of course there is some scepticism about the ability of a new public body to tackle bureaucracy. Sir Philip Hampton&#146;s report on regulatory enforcement was articulate about the confusion and complexity of the regulatory system that local authorities have to interpret and then put into action. They stand at the enforcement front line, but have to interpret and implement regulations issuing from a multiplicity of government departments and national regulators&#151;regulations which can on occasion be frankly difficult to reconcile.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0004.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08012380000026">The LBRO will have a new and unique role in this system, getting the system as a whole to work in a way that is better for businesses, for the public and for local authorities themselves. This will sometimes involve giving a little more urgency to the dissemination of the many cases of good practice out there. Sometimes this will frankly mean telling home truths to the Government about the framework that it sets. Its role as adviser to the Government will be absolutely critical to its success. This is not a technical reason why this clause tells us about the LBRO&#146;s powers on giving advice or making proposals to a Minister of the Crown; it is an important part of the new scheme we are attempting to set up.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0004.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08012380000027">A number of questions were raised at Second Reading about the LBRO&#146;s role here. Will it be able to give its view, publicly if necessary, on new regulations and how they are being implemented? Will it be able to give its own recommendations for areas of existing law where a rethink is needed? Its power to give advice and make proposals to the Government under this clause will allow it to do both. I hope that the Committee will welcome that.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0004.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08012380000028">We are emphatically not seeking to create a new body along the same lines as, for example, the Law Commission, dedicated primarily to in-depth reports on particular aspects of regulation. The LBRO will be small with significant operational responsibilities, but it will have the power under the Bill to make any proposals that it sees fit from its particular expert perspective. We also think we have the wording right in Clause 9.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0004.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08012380000029">Amendment No. 35A, which is a probing amendment, would add another subject to those on which the LBRO might advise Ministers. We do not think that the amendment is strictly necessary as the existing provision at Clause 9(1)(a) permits the LBRO to give advice to Ministers on the way in which local authorities exercise their relevant functions. There is no reason why this should not include advice on the effectiveness of the way in which they do so. Indeed, we think that that will be a critical part of their role. I hope that, with that explanation, the noble Baroness will be able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I have just been looking at Clause 14, which is the usual &#147;ancillary powers&#148; clause. According to subsection (1), the LBRO can do anything necessary or expedient in connection with, or for the purpose of, exercising any of its functions. Four examples are then given in subsection (2), and they are all practical, mechanical matters: entering into agreements, acquiring property and borrowing or investing money. Perhaps I may ask a hypothetical question. Would Clause 14(1) have allowed the inclusion of Clauses 9 and 10, which we have just been debating, if those matters were not spelt out? I ask that without having given any notice. If the Minister would prefer not to answer that question now, I shall be very happy to discuss it following the Committee.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0004.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08012380000037">I am conscious of what was said earlier about the possibility of overloading the LBRO. Perhaps these amendments in their full form, as the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, mentioned in his speech at Second Reading, would overload the LBRO as it is currently envisaged. However, I am also conscious of the fact that, under Clause 9(1)(b), the LBRO may give advice to a Minister of the Crown on &#147;the effectiveness of legislation&#148;. If it chooses to do so, that would go a long way towards achieving the results sought in these amendments. Indeed, the LBRO can be required by Ministers to give advice on various matters, including presumably on future as well as existing legislation. To my mind, it is important that the LBRO has an eye to pending and future legislation that adds to the regulatory burden. If it does not do that, as well as looking at how existing legislation is being implemented on the ground by local authorities, it will not be as effective as we all want it to be in improving the regulatory environment.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08012380000038">I admit that the two amendments are expressed in very complete and decisive terms. A few moments ago, we discussed the difference between guidance and direction but, knowing that the <I>Companion to the Standing Orders</I> of your Lordships&#146; House is expressed in terms of guidance but always taken as holy writ, one can lead to the other from time to time. The most important element of these amendments is that the LBRO must look to pending and future legislation as well as to the existing regulatory environment; it should not concentrate solely on the latter. Unfortunately, in the helpful guide to the Bill available in the Printed Paper Office, I have not been able to find any reference to the need for the LBRO to look at current proposals, so that adds force to my wish to at least try these amendments on the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000039"><b><a name="80123-gc0004.htm_spnew5"><a name="08012380000337">Lord Borrie:</b> The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, is interesting, but he has recognised in his own speech its negative aspects. The word &#147;overload&#148; is simple enough but it means a great deal. The Minister has spoken of the LBRO as a small authority, so it is not appropriate to overload it with responsibilities. On the wording of the amendment, the use of the term &#147;must&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148;, which is used in Clause 9(1), is disturbing. As he quoted it, Clause 9(1) gives the LBRO the role of advising on the,</p>
<ul><a name="08012380000311">&#147;effectiveness of legislation relating to the exercise by local authorities in England or Wales of their relevant functions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012380000253">The noble Lord will know that this limits the LBRO&#146;s responsibilities concerning how it chooses to give advice. It also limits regulatory matters on which it would advise to &#147;relevant functions&#148;, which harks back to Clause 4. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment seems to suggest that the new office must give advice on any legislative proposals from Europe or from Ministers about any regulations, not just those concerned with &#147;relevant functions&#148;. If the LBRO had to do that, I am not sure that it would have much time to do its essential work of co-ordinating and ensuring greater

Clearly, the noble Lord has a case for saying that someone should be doing that job, including looking at all new legislation to do with regulations or otherwise, wherever it comes from, but the scope of his amendment is surely much too broad.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000040"><b><a name="80123-gc0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="08012380000338">Lord Cope of Berkeley:</b> I will defend my drafting in one respect at least. I grant the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, his point that I should perhaps have said something about the LBRO&#146;s &#147;relevant functions&#148; in drafting the amendment. That is clearly what I had in mind and what I think the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, had in mind on that occasion. On &#147;must give advice&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148;, I was following the precedent of Clause 9(2), which concerns advice to a Minister, rather than Clause 9(1), which concerns advice that the LBRO chooses to give.</p>

We therefore support the need for there always to be a two-way consultation process in which the Government speak to the LBRO and the LBRO, ideally placed as it will be, speaks to the Government. The amendment will stipulate such communication as a duty of the LBRO and, it is hoped, will go some way to preventing the introduction of unnecessary or irrelevant regulations. The LBRO would be able to tell the Government how proposed regulations would fit and whether they might cause an intolerable burden for the regulators. Surely the Minister thinks it is a good idea for Her Majesty&#146;s Government to receive as much advice as possible if they really are, to quote the Minister,</p>

<p><a name="08012380000043">Having said that, the noble Lord has raised an important issue. It is part of the LBRO&#146;s role in advising government to look at legislative proposals.

<p><a name="08012380000254">must include new legislation, new orders, and regulations coming from Europe. This should be an important part of what the LBRO does&#151;to anticipate what the Government and national regulators intend and give advice about such regulations.

I wonder whether there is not, on page 15&#151;</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012380000273">&#147;Current National priorities for local authority enforcement&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012380000257">a fairly serious gap. I know that the Government and, in particular, the department represented by the noble Lord, Lord Bach, is interested in businesses. Better regulation has always been interested in businesses and, to some extent, voluntary organisations. I have never been so sure that it is interested in the interests of members of the public. It ought to be. I have never been certain that the department sees its role as better regulation for the benefit of members of the public, although, of course, within the list of priorities on page 15 they gain some advantage.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08012380000071">The gap here concerns anti-social behaviour. An enormous amount of local authority time and money is spent dealing with anti-social behaviour. They are all members of crime and disorder partnerships which they share with a number of other local bodies. It is not good enough to say that that is nothing to do with regulation because in a number of cases it certainly is. For instance, we have listed here,</p>
<ul><a name="08012380000316">&#147;entertainment and late night refreshment licensing&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012380000258">as one item that is a priority. Fair enough, anti-social behaviour often arises in that connection. But so it does in a number of other areas where local authorities have to carry out regulatory functions. For instance, they have to ensure that people behave themselves in public parks&#151;the definition of anti-social behaviour is extremely wide these days&#151;they have to deal with noise, which is often a matter of anti-social behaviour, and they deal with housing management. If they do not do it themselves because they have sold off their housing stock to an arm&#146;s-length management organisation or some similar body, they nevertheless have a residual power and duty to help those bodies to deal with anti-social behaviour in the housing management field.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08012380000072">This is a fairly major issue in a number of places and, as I am sure the noble Lord knows, I spend a great deal of time going around inspecting local authorities on the question of privacy. Anti-social behaviour is left out of the list. Is it a mistake or is it because the department does not consider that it is anything to do with businesses and, therefore, it does not need to be included? I can tell the noble Lord that many local authorities would find that a list of priorities that did not include anti-social behaviour would think that the Government had seriously let them down. I did not have an opportunity to give the noble Lord notice because I saw the list only today, but I would very much welcome his response on that point.</p>

I am grateful for the contribution of the noble Viscount; he has a wealth of experience in this field and what he has to say is important. The priorities to which he referred are those that I believe he saw in the guide and are the result of the Rogers independent review, which the Government have accepted. We agree that many other significant issues are involved here and, because the noble Viscount has taken me slightly by surprise, I do not wish to flannel him off with words. If he will be kind enough to allow me to do so, I intend to write to him with a fuller answer to the issue he raised, particularly about ASBOs. That is the best that I can do this afternoon to give a proper answer to his question.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08012380000075">The list that he referred to is evidence-based and is drawn from extensive consultation with business, regulators, consumer groups, local authorities and government. It was drawn up independently by Rogers, who is the distinguished chief executive of Westminster City Council. He is not employed by the Government in any capacity and his report was accepted in full.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08012380000076">I will write to the noble Viscount but I want to make it clear that my department is concerned with successful business, regulatory reform and enterprise, and has an important role to play in the consumer field. So although it is business and consumer-orientated, the department is part of government and the noble Viscount&#146;s queries demand a proper response. That is what they will get.</p>

It is not strictly within the regulatory function that the noble Lord and the Bill seem to be dealing with but it is nevertheless a fully regulatory activity of local authorities. Housing management is a difficult job and some areas are rife with anti-social behaviour, but local authorities have to deal with it and take steps to eradicate it as far as they can. The fact that it was left out by Rogers is no answer at all. If the local authorities are being told to allocate their resources to relevant functions, and the relevant functions do not include this one, they are being told in effect that this activity is being downgraded.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000078">The Government have been emphasising for some time the importance of tackling anti-social behaviour.

Although it deals to some extent with housing management, it does not deal with the generality of anti-social behaviour&#151;for example noise, behaviour in parks, what happens outside pubs and nightclubs when they close. It is useful legislation but it does not cover the totality of this problem.</p>

I was struck forcibly when reading the evidence given to Rogers that a lot of people in the local authority system were asking to be given priorities. That is the point made by the Minister on Monday. The reason for that is because local authorities are short of resources and so, unless they know what it is the Government really want them to do, they do a bit of this, a bit of that and a bit of the other rather than concentrating on the things that really matter. Quite a large amount of evidence of exactly that type was given to Rogers. It reinforces the importance of the need for the Government to consider whether the six priorities they have accepted actually cover the areas they should and whether they do not miss anything of perhaps equal importance.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08012380000085">The noble Lord said: This clause is concerned with the relationship between the LBRO and other regulators. Amendments No. 42B is a probing amendment to discern the reason why the hands have been laid on five regulators and not on the rest, while Amendment No. 43 would in effect require the LBRO to create a memorandum of understanding with any regulator with whom it had to work as opposed to stipulating these five. Paragraph 39 on page 9 of the Explanatory Notes for this clause states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012380000275">&#147;It is deemed particularly important that LBRO enter into memoranda of understanding with these five regulators as they all have functions that overlap with those of LBRO&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012380000259">To be sure, but there are plenty of other important regulators which I suspect will have a far greater need to collaborate with the LBRO. Let me give a couple of examples. The first is the Charity Commission, which appears in Schedule 5.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08012380000086">Going back to enforcement priorities, paragraph 36 on page 8 of the Explanatory Notes lists one of them as,</p>
<ul><a name="08012380000317">&#147;(iii) trade description, trade marking and doorstep selling&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012380000260">The Charities Act, which we passed quite recently, has a whole part devoted to the issue of doorstep and street selling, which is an extremely prevalent and important way for charities to raise money. We have 180,000 charities in this country in every parish, town,

They are perceived to be much less important than the five listed in Clause 12(2).</p>

<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08012380000087">A second example is the Highways Agency. I can see that it would have a substantial overlap with the Better Regulation Commission. It is not even in Schedule 5, nor in Amendment No. 111 of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, which would add names to Schedule 5. To suggest that the Gambling Commission is more important to the operation of the LBRO than the Charity Commission or the Highways Agency seems extraordinary. Worse, if the LBRO is to do a great deal of business with the OFT, it confirms my worst fears that it will operate at a hugely high level&#151;it will be, as somebody said in our debates on Monday, an NBRO. To be effective, the LBRO must follow Keynes&#146;s words and crawl across the frontiers of human knowledge with a hand lens, not operate at 10,000 feet in a plane marked &#147;OFT&#148;. We must ensure that this new operation is really focused on the detail; that is how we will get the right regulatory balance. The way this clause has been drawn suggests far too high a level, and far too far-reaching and broad a remit: a remit which properly belongs to a national organisation, not a Local Better Regulation Office. I would therefore like to hear from the Minister why these bodies have been picked out, and why we are not looking at some of the other regulators who will have day-to-day contact with the communities in which the LBRO should be operating.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08012380000088">I am not against memoranda of understanding; they are good to have. But I do not see why they should be confined to these five&#151;some of which seem to have peripheral, if any, day-to-day contact with the LBRO&#151;if the LBRO is to function as I perceive it should, and as I think the Minister does too from the way he has explained it as a co-ordinating, even-handed approach across the country. I beg to move.</p>

One of the examples just given by the noble Lord&#151;the Highways Agency&#151;is not even listed in Schedule 5. If all the regulators listed in Schedule 5 were added here, there would be a considerable increase in the work of obtaining memoranda of understanding as required by Clause 12.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08012380000090">There is of course a problem of local authorities receiving mixed messages from central government, which is why there is a mention of memoranda of understanding here at all. The LBRO is a non-departmental agency of central government; so are the other regulators listed here and those in Schedule 5. Having some memoranda of understanding is vitally important: it helps to improve the consistency of messages coming through to local authorities from central government. However, the LBRO, as has already been said in debates this afternoon, is a small organisation. It must focus its efforts. Subject to correction from the Minister, I understand that these five specific regulators&#151;not 30-plus, or whatever&#151;are listed in Clause 12 because they have the greatest amount of day-to-day contact and interaction with local authorities. Many of the others in Schedule 5 do not.</p>

It then had and today has almost constant day-today contact with trading standards departments of local authorities up and down the country on individual cases involving a whole lot of different legislation. The reason that the Food Standards Agency and the Health and Safety Executive are listed among the five is that they, too, are central bodies that have almost constant contact. Therefore, it is important that each of those bodies has an understanding with the LBRO so that they do not tread on one another&#146;s feet when they are dealing and interacting with local authorities. It is most desirable that there should be a list, but it should surely be limited.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000092">Where I shared the views of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, in moving the amendment was in his thinking that if that list is finite forever, it might not be sufficient. In other words, it might be desirable if, let us say, some power was had by the Secretary of State to add to that list if evidence showed that, this year, next year or in 10 years, some other agency ought to be added to that list.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000096">Perhaps I may explain the rationale for Clause 12.

<p><a name="08012380000097">The national regulators&#146; role, to look out for particular aspects of local authority enforcement, is different from that of the LBRO.

<a name="80123-gc0005.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08012380000098">There is a risk of overlap, and the memoranda of understanding will set out the basis on which the LBRO and each regulator will operate to remove any risk of, for instance, contradictory guidance being issued. Both regulators and local authorities have welcomed the clarity that this clause will bring to some of the important relationships that the new organisation will need to develop. Other regulators are of course involved, and the LBRO has the power, but not the duty, to enter agreements with any additional regulators under Clause 14.</p>

The mention of the word &#147;disproportionate&#148; in Clause 13(2) and &#147;proportionate&#148; in Clause 13(3) captures that expression for the purposes of the clause, but we think that the better word here is &#147;unnecessary&#148;.</p>

Looking at them both, I see Clause 15 as the converse of Clause 7. For example, the LBRO can give a direction with the consent of the Secretary of State on certain specific matters. It may be that, under Clause 15, the Secretary of State wants to require the LBRO to do something. Can we get an explanation of which directions are specific and which are general? &#147;Specific&#148; is certainly intended to be left in, in any event.

At Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, claimed correctly that the LBRO was different from a quango because he had never known a quango, at its inception, to allow for its own dissolution when the objectives have been achieved. That is an interesting point. I do not know of a quango that has been dissolved in this way. I think he is correct that it is an unprecedented clause, and no less welcome for that.

<p><a name="08012380000152">We would all love to reach the position where the regulations we are referring to in the Bill are being perfectly implemented in an even manner and in line with best practice all over the country so that the LBRO has worked itself out of a job in that respect. But what about the &#147;primary authority&#148; business that we have not yet reached in Part 2? Is that going to fold up at some point because regulation is so even across the country that it can be abolished? I am glad that the Minister thinks that this objective is within sight and therefore can be provided for, but what did the noble Lord, Lord Jones, have in mind when he said that the objective was about to be achieved and we can dissolve all this?

To have it unattached, as it were, leads me to my second point, which is simply to say that it is a little odd that a body created by primary legislation can be dissolved without further primary legislation. That is especially unusual since the LBRO will be able to make transfers, which presumably will include things like the enforcement of proceedings, to another body.

On Amendment No. 56 and the phrase found in the guidance and the Explanatory Notes about the intention to dissolve the LBRO when it has achieved its objective, I am not sure how that can sensibly be put into legislative form. At some point someone might say, &#147;We consider its objective has been fulfilled&#148;, but someone else might think the contrary.

After all, we had the Better Regulation Task Force and we are losing the Better Regulation Commission into another body, as was announced on 16 January. The Better Regulation Executive is a powerful body within the department and I can visualise a time when that body will take over nearly all the role of a national better regulation body called the LBRO. I do not see any reason to quarrel with the Government&#146;s wish for this body to have a limited life and then disappear. It would be entirely in accordance with policy.</p>

When it has done so, it may well be appropriate for it to be dissolved. The LBRO will be a relatively small body working at the centre of a complex and sometimes disparate regulatory system. It will need time to establish itself, to develop effective working relationships and to use its influence and statutory functions to effectively deliver its objective. We consider it unrealistic to expect the LBRO to achieve all this in only five years. If it were to do so, all the better, but it is not appropriate to place such a time limit on its work.</p>

But that could happen before five years or long after. As the noble Viscount implied, what would happen if future legislation were to overcome this legislation? I should make it absolutely clear that we do not anticipate either of these events occurring, but we have to bear them in mind when responding to an exact series of amendments such as these.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0006.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08012380000168">We think we have got this right. It is important that the Committee understands that if the organisation were to be dissolved, as we hope one day it will be, it would be by the affirmative resolution procedure. The alternative would be to dissolve it through primary legislation, but I think the Committee will agree that the affirmative resolution procedure would be satisfactory. Under Clause 17(2)(b) the functions of the primary authority could be transferred to another body on the dissolution of the LBRO.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0006.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08012380000169">I have been asked to justify Clause 17 by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, which is a fair request. The LBRO has some ambitious objectives, but we anticipate that there will come a time when its objectives have been achieved and local authority regulatory services are implementing regulations in a way consistent with Hampton and the principles of better regulation. We have therefore made provision for its dissolution. The order may make provision for the transfer of property rights and the liabilities of the LBRO to another person, and may provide for the transfer of its functions to another person.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0006.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08012380000170">The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee expressed some concern regarding the provisions for transferring functions under Clause 17(2)(b) and asked that the provision be justified. I shall attempt to do so now. Some of the LBRO&#146;s functions in relation to the primary authority scheme will be ongoing. They will need to be performed in the future regardless of the overall quality of local authority regulation. This is relevant to Part 2. For example, the register of primary authority partnerships will still have to be maintained and the LBRO&#146;s arbitration function will have to continue. The Government&#146;s intention is that the provision should allow for another person to take on these functions so as to ensure the continuing and effective functioning of the primary authority once the LBRO has been dissolved. I hope, therefore, that Clause 17 will stand part of the Bill.</p>

They are allowed to use the name &#147;McDonald&#146;s&#148; and everything that goes with it, but they are distinct businesses. In some cases, the branches of a big organisation are literally branches, and some are franchises operating under the same arrangements and using the same brand.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000197">I am not convinced whether the arrangements we are discussing should apply across a franchise business, but I am concerned to know whether or not the Bill presently covers franchise businesses. As I read it, it does not. We shall have to rely on the legal experience of the Minister and the other legally qualified Members on both sides of the Committee. A &#147;person&#148; can be a company or any other legal entity, but in a franchise business there is a &#147;person&#148;, a company&#151;I have mentioned McDonald&#146;s&#151;which has an agreement with A, B, C and D, who are individuals trading in different towns. These are different people. They are not the same person as McDonald&#146;s; they are separate persons even though they have an agreement with it.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000199">After I mentioned the matter at Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, was kind enough to write to me. His letter covered a number of matters but on this point he said:</p>

They are probing amendments to explore a particular point. For example, what will happen with a company owning the fabric of public houses, some of which may be managed by employees of the company? The business is clearly under the ownership of the company and if, for the sake of argument, the company is headquartered in Wolverhampton, it might choose the local authority of its headquarters as its primary authority. As the Bill is drafted, I think it is the intention that the primary authority would have jurisdiction over all the managed pubs in the company. Would the tenanted pubs, the fabric of which are owned by the company but each of whose tenants are running small businesses in their own right, also have the cover of the same primary authority?</p>

<p><a name="08012380000203">Clause 20 defines the scope of Part 2 of the Bill, limiting it to regulated persons, be they a business, a charity or another organisation that is regulated by more than one local authority.

<ul><a name="08012380000319">&#147;a person carries on an activity&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08012380000265">in the area of two or more local authorities. I stress the words &#147;carries on&#148; and &#147;activity&#148;.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0007.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08012380000204">Franchises present a difficult case in this context. Depending on the level of control that a franchisor exercises over its franchisees, it is questionable whether a franchisee is subject to regulation by more than one local authority and therefore whether it should have access to the primary authority scheme.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0007.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08012380000205">Where a franchisor exercises extensive control over its franchisees and the franchisor is in effect regulated by a number of local authorities through its franchisees, it is appropriate that the franchisor has access to the primary authority scheme. The Bill makes provision for this. I can confirm that this type of franchise would be able to benefit from Part 2.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0007.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08012380000206">However, the scope of Part 2 does not capture franchises where a franchisor exercises very little control over its franchisees. The amendments would have the effect of including the latter type of franchise within the scope of Part 2. It would not be appropriate for that type of franchise to have access to the primary authority scheme as it is made up of a series of individual business that are regulated by only one local authority. Part 2 has been deliberately drafted to capture only businesses that are regulated by more than one local authority, as it is those businesses that are faced with the difficulties and costs that result from inconsistent advice and enforcement. I understand that the form of words in Clause 20(1)(a), &#147;carries on an activity&#148;, is found also in competition legislation which deals with this issue.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000207">If a franchisor exercised no control over its franchisees with regard, for example, to health and safety, and there was no central policy on it, it would not be appropriate for that franchisor to have a primary authority partnership with respect to its health and safety functions. Likewise, if a franchisor drew up a promotional scheme&#151;for example, a &#147;buy-one, get-one-free&#148; scheme&#151;but did not oblige its franchisees to instigate the promotion, it would not be appropriate for the franchisor to have a primary authority partnership with respect to the promotional aspects of its trading standards function.</p>

We will have a system with a register and website, and the local authority will know that a multiple of some sort, which has a business in its area, enjoys the protection of a primary authority. They will be able to look that up. But if it is a brewery which owns a lot of pubs, there may be a primary authority which looks after that brewery overall.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0007.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08012380000210">However, it is not true to say that, merely because it is on the register, the local authority will know whether a particular pub is subject to overall control by the brewery or whether it is in the hands of a tenant who can do more or less what they wish in terms of health and safety, hygiene and all the rest of it. How is the local authority to know on which side of the line a particular outlet falls? I do not see anything in the Bill that helps us.</p>

I started by saying that this is not an easy issue. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, is quite right to raise it at this stage, but it is not beyond the wit of local authorities to sort it out. Some franchises are effectively single businesses running in one place. Others, and their policies, are clearly controlled from elsewhere. It may not always be easy to work out which is which, but that will have to happen if this concept of the primary authority is to succeed in a particular locality.</p>

It can go in and take action if there is a breach of something which must be enforced. Is the Minister seriously saying that, before it does so, the local authority must go behind the façade of the business, look at the accounts and the policy statement of the overall owner of the business and decide which side of the line it will fall? If so, it will add greatly to the bureaucracy that the Bill imposes on local authorities. That is extremely undesirable.</p>

I think that I made an error in saying that the database would, as it were, be run by local authorities. The LBRO&#146;s database is the important thing here. But we should not forget that the enforcing local authority has a role, too. The local authority in which the noble Viscount&#146;s public house is to be found will be the enforcing authority for that local authority district. The issue is whether the primary authority in that area of business&#151;breweries&#151;will have a role in ensuring that the enforcing authority carries out its enforcement in accordance with the guidance it may have received. The LBRO&#146;s database will determine whether the primary authority has a role or not.</p>

This will be difficult, because my understanding of what the Minister said was that a business, a franchisee, may find itself in a position whereby some of its activities with regard to health and safety, hygiene and so on, because of the nature of its agreement with the franchiser, will be regulated by the primary authority arrangements that apply, but other activities in health and safety and hygiene&#151;which are not specifically dealt with in the franchise arrangement between the franchiser and the franchisee&#151;will be subject only to the local authority. This will be confusing for the business, but will be even more confusing for the local authority, as the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, suggested, because it does not have immediate access to the franchise agreement that will decide the matter.</p>

<a name="80123-gc0007.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08012380000215">This may lead to disputes about which local authority is in charge. The crunch will come when something has gone wrong, there is enforcement, action is taken, fines are imposed, court cases are pending, and that sort of thing. The question would then arise as to whether or not the action being taken was correct and which side of the line it fell&#151;was it part of the primary arrangement or not, or had the local authority intervened on the right basis? There is still some confusion on this matter, but the Minister is trying to intervene after taking further advice, so maybe he can clear all of this up.</p>

The first is that on contact with the local authority, if it has a primary authority, the business will have every incentive to tell the authority. Businesses have been asking for a primary authority. Given the remote possibility that that has not clarified the matter completely for the Committee, perhaps I may write to the Members of the Committee with a longer clarification of this issue in good time before Report. This issue is worthy of a letter.</p>

Suppose that the local authority makes a mistake and the enforcing authority chooses to enforce and uses one of the civil sanction powers that we shall consider later in the Bill. In fact the authority should have obtained the approval of the primary authority before it did anything, but did not. Can that be raised as a defence by the person who is subject to the civil sanction? Will or will it not be a defence in a criminal case that the procedures set out in the Bill were not carried out? I do not expect the Minister to give an answer now, but could he include that point in the letter, because this matter will lead to greater complications later on? If there is a challenge, it will go to the first-level tribunal and, in some cases, the courts, because it may not go through a civil sanction system. There will be further trouble later on down the line unless this matter is clarified at the beginning.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000232">Although Amendment No. 71 is related to Amendment No. 67, it is a little more complicated. The point that I am trying to get at it is: how will a &#147;local&#148; local authority&#151;an enforcement authority, in the jargon of the Bill&#151;know for certain that it is affected by an agreement? For that to happen, two things seem to be necessary. First, the company concerned&#151;the regulated person&#151;must tell the primary authority exactly how many branches it has. When it opens or closes one, it must give notice. Secondly, the primary authority must then tell all the other local authorities involved that a branch has opened or closed and who is affected.</p>

<p><a name="08012380000233">As emerged a little in our discussion of the previous amendment, it is very important that local authorities know clearly which businesses are under which scheme; where they have to give notice to the primary authority before they take some enforcement action; where they may be affected by inspection plans; and where all this apparatus will apply and where it will not. It will be difficult enough for the &#147;local&#148; local authorities.</p>

Interspersed among them are franchised businesses, which we have already seen are rather complicated, and individual local shops which may have only one or two branches locally. They can all have separate regimes. For that matter, if half a dozen shops in the high street represent different chains, each of them may have a different primary authority somewhere or other&#151;the chances are that they will. So in an ordinary, quite small high street, you will have 10 different local authorities governing health and safety, hygiene regulations and all the rest of it, in the different businesses along the street.</p>

So some of the local authority officials from the &#147;local&#148; local authority who examine the business will be there under a local arrangement, and others will be under a broader, primary arrangement made by a distant authority. It is going to get complicated, so it is important that it is clearly understood who is regulating whom, otherwise the whole thing will dissolve into confusion.</p>

I remind noble Lords that I and others spoke at Second Reading about our apprehension that the primary authority partnership will spark much resentment when one local authority is empowered to take over the jurisdiction of another in relation to a multi-site business or, say, the description we have just had of a high street.

The LBRO is obliged to maintain a register of primary authority partnerships. This is going to take the form for practical purposes of an online database to which local authorities will have routine access as a means of securing effective mutual consultation. This will be accessible to all local authorities and it will be a comparatively simple matter to decide whether there is a partnership in existence in relation to a particular business. This removes the need for a formal notification requirement on either the business or the primary authority of the sort set out in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. The responsibility for bringing the partnership to the attention of all the local authorities which need to be aware of it remains firmly with the LBRO, thus removing a potential burden from both the primary authority and business.</p>

I should like to inform the House of the outcome.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"><a name="08012354000025">We considered the wider context in which the FCO, and the UK, are now operating: the changes driven by globalisation; the interdependence of foreign and domestic policy; the growing diversity of international actors; and hence the need for a modern foreign ministry to be constantly reassessing where and how it can make the most valuable contribution.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para18">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"><a name="08012354000026">Based on this assessment, I have approved a new strategic framework to guide the work of the FCO in future. This has three elements, reflecting the three main roles of the FCO:</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"><a name="08012354000027"><I>Providing a flexible global network serving the Government as a whole</I></p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"><a name="08012354000028">In addition to delivering our new policy goals and essential services, our posts abroad will continue to support the rest of Whitehall in delivering home departments&#146; own international priorities.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para21">

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para24">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"><a name="08012354000032">We have identified four new policy priorities on which the FCO will focus, on which I briefed the House on 8 January: countering terrorism and proliferation; reducing and preventing conflict; promoting a low-carbon/high-growth global economy; and developing effective international institutions, especially the UN and EU.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para25">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"><a name="08012354000033">I intend to put more of the FCO&#146;s overall resources into these new priorities. A closer alignment of resources and priorities will enable the FCO to deliver better for Britain and HMG. So we will be increasing substantially the overall level of resources the FCO puts into counterterrorism and counterproliferation; climate change; Afghanistan and other conflict regions; and key international institutions. All these areas will receive additional staff and money.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para26">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"><a name="08012354000034">We have also decided that we should adapt the FCO&#146;s overseas network of posts to align it more closely with our own priorities and those of HMG as a whole. So we will be shifting a proportion of our diplomatic staff from Europe and the Americas to Asia, the Middle East and other parts of the world, while continuing to sustain our global flexibility  and reach.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para27">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"><a name="08012354000035">As I told the House on 8 January, we will continue to manage the FCO&#146;s overseas network to reflect changing demands and challenges. We will ensure that our resources are aligned with our priorities and that the UK has a cost-effective and flexible network of overseas representation around the world.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para28">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"><a name="08012354000036">In order to put more resources into these new priority areas and to sharpen our strategic focus, it is necessary to reduce the resources the FCO puts into certain other issues, notably where other Whitehall departments in London are better placed to direct HMG&#146;s international priorities, particularly in the areas of sustainable development, science and innovation, and crime and drugs.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para29">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"><a name="08012354000037">Our ambassadors will, however, remain heavily engaged on all these issues in those countries where they are of particular importance to Britain: eg, the fight against drugs in Colombia and against crime in Jamaica. Our posts overseas will continue to operate as a base for all Whitehall departments on which they can put their own staff and resources to deliver their own priorities in the countries concerned. Our ambassadors will continue to offer advice to departments and their local representatives, and act locally on their behalf wherever needed.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para30">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"><a name="08012354000038">This new strategic framework will replace the FCO&#146;s 10 existing strategic priorities. This is in line with the view expressed by the Foreign Affairs Committee in its response to our 2006-07 departmental White Paper that &#147;10 strategic priorities is too many&#148; and that they should be &#147;simplified and reduced in number&#148;. We will be taking forward the detailed planning and implementation over the next few months, inside the FCO and with other government departments.</p>

<a name="80123-wms0001.htm_para31">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"><a name="08012354000039">I believe that every organisation, including every government department, should regularly reassess its own aims and priorities. Successful organisations stay focused on the biggest issues on which they can make the biggest difference, and regularly readjust that focus as circumstances and priorities change. That is what we have sought to do for the FCO through this new strategic framework.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_220"><a name="08012353000257">The requirement for revenue commitments from a ferry operator at the outset of the project was imposed as a means of helping ensure viability of the project. This requirement was withdrawn by the RDA following responses to the procurement exercise for the outer harbour project. The requirement was waived on the basis that it was not judged commercially realistic in today's market to expect that a ferry company would commit to revenue guarantees at such an early stage, before construction of the outer harbour had begun. At the same time, the RDA judged that the proposal submitted in response to the procurement exercise by the developer who was eventually selected presented a sound and viable development without revenue commitments at the outset from a ferry operator.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_221"><a name="08012353000258">The successful developer's proposal was based on enabling larger vessels for existing trades to call at Great Yarmouth and attracting a range of new trades, with port facilities and the commercial focus evolving over time in response to market trends. In addition to attracting ferry services, the proposal identified the following potential sources of revenue; expanding support for the oil and gas sector; expanding the scope and scale for importing aggregates; extending the support for existing trades such as forest products, fertilisers and agri-bulk; providing port and support facilities for the wind farm; catering for oil and gas de/recommissioning demand ; attracting containerised short sea and feeder trades; attracting car imports; attracting new technology projects. Release of information on the amounts of revenue expected would prejudice the commercial interests of the port developer.</p>
