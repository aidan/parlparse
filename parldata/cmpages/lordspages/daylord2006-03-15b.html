<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they will legislate against the use of genetic test results in employment and insurance.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, in their 2003 genetics White Paper, the Government wholeheartedly endorsed the Human Genetics Commission&#039;s view that no one should be unfairly discriminated against on the basis of their genetic characteristics. The Government are currently undertaking a discrimination law review to develop a clearer and more streamlined framework of equality law. It will consider calls to extend discrimination law into new areas, including the case for introducing protection in relation to genetic discrimination. I cannot predict or pre-empt the review&#039;s findings.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that extremely promising reply&#151;it sounds as if the Government are really moving on this. However, is he aware that some human rights lawyers, academics, trades unions and GeneWatch UK have expressed deep concern that we now have no legal barriers against the unfettered use of the tests to discriminate against people and that those with genetic disorders in the United States and Australia are being discriminated against by employers and insurance companies? If we do not act shortly, the same kind of thing will happen here. Although we have a moratorium on insurance companies using genetics, it is a temporary measure; there is no permanent solution. We really need some legislation to prevent abuses happening before they have begun. So will the Government move as soon as possible, please?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, in this country there is no evidence of any large-scale genetic testing in the workplace. My noble friend raised the issue of predictive genetic tests. They cannot be used by insurers unless the tests have been approved by the Government&#039;s Genetics and Insurance Committee, and there are strict limitations on them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, is there any suggestion of people being obliged to have genetic tests? I know that insurance companies have had a voluntary code against the practice, but it would be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1214"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

terrible if people were forced to have any kind of genetic test if they did not wish to face what they feared could be an unpleasant reality.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we have a ban until November 2011 on the use by insurers of results from predictive genetic tests unless, as I said, the test has been approved by the GAIC. It would have to be for a policy over the substantial financial limit of &#163;500,000 for life insurance and similar high limits for other types of insurance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   My Lords, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 does not cover people who have had predictive genetic tests. Will the forthcoming review of equality legalisation ensure that such people are included?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, as I said in my opening reply, I cannot predict what will come out of the review. However, people with a genetic condition are protected by the Disability Discrimination Act once their condition becomes disabling.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Coity: </b>   My Lords, I recognise that discrimination of all kinds is something that we cannot accept. However, people who go for employment generally have to have a medical, and sometimes insurance companies require certain information before deciding what the premium for an insurance policy will be. How does the assessment of genetic difficulties compare with other assessments required for employment and insurance?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, as I said, there is no evidence of large-scale genetic testing in the workplace, but the Government have asked the Human Genetics Commission to assess the current prevalence of genetic testing in the workplace and to report back in the spring.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Wilkins: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend concerned that people will not be confident to take genetic tests unless the Government legislate to ensure their protection against discrimination?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, as I said, we have a review in place on the issue, which will explore the concerns. We must await that review&#039;s outcome.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, I believe that my noble friend, in the context of insurance policies, mentioned a limit of &#163;500,000. Why is there a limit at all?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I said that there was a ban until 2011 unless the test had been approved by the Government&#039;s Genetics and Insurance Committee, and it has to be above those limits. So it has to be both approved by the committee and above those limits.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend says that there is no evidence in this country. However, there is bags of evidence in the United States and <br>&nbsp;<br>

Australia. Does that not matter to him in terms of the speed of legislation? If we do not act now, then, according to predictions, the practice will definitely come here. The sooner we act, the better. Otherwise we will be following events rather than anticipating them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we are aware of what is going on overseas, but we must deal, in UK law, with mischiefs in this country. We are having a review, and we will consider that review carefully. A Green Paper in the summer will set out the initial proposals coming out of that review.

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Janner of Braunstone </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What steps they have taken to deal with extremist organisations using the internet.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, our laws allow full freedom of expression within the limits provided by the Human Rights Act 1998. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 and the offences of encouragement to terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publications in the Terrorism Bill, if passed, will apply to the internet. The Association of Chief Police Officers is looking at how racist material on the internet is dealt with, and we continue to work with UK internet service providers to make UK systems resilient to improper penetration by extremist groups.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Janner of Braunstone: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Is she aware, however, that racist organisations in this country are using the net for their purposes, and so, unfortunately, is Amazon&#151;the mail order company&#151;which sells and, of course, profits from the sale of racist and anti-Semitic literature, including Hitler&#039;s <i>Mein Kampf </i> and the notorious forgery, the <i>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i>?<i> </i>In those circumstances, does she agree that our law already places totally acceptable limits on free speech where necessary, including libel, slander and incitement to racial hatred? Will she please call on Amazon and others to stop profiting from the sale of such racist propaganda?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that it is important that racist organisations do not make improper use of the internet, which is why ACPO is looking at that very issue. I agree, too, that we have proper limits on free speech, and that anti-Semitic and racist literature is to be deplored wherever it is published. I am confident that Amazon will be aware of what my noble friend says and will doubtless give it the weight that it deserves.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew16"></a><b> Viscount Bridgeman: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the case mentioned by the noble Lord, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1216"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1216</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Janner, is totally different from such bodies as the Muslim Public Affairs Committee, whose activities on the internet provide such disgusting hate mail?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60315-01_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, it is invidious for me to talk about individual cases. What I will say, however, is that any hate material used and placed on the internet is a matter of concern; those are issues, as I have tried to make clear, that we need to address. ACPO, in particular, is trying to find ways of dealing with those issues more effectively.

<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Rochester: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the Church&#039;s total opposition to anti-Semitism under any pretext whatever? Is she also aware of its support for respecting the religious sensitivities of others? How are the Government promoting those values on the internet and elsewhere?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am aware of what the right reverend Prelate properly indicates is the Church&#039;s position, with which the Government absolutely concur. Noble Lords will know that we have done a great deal to enhance the opportunities for different religious groups to come together. I mention, <i>en passant</i>, the attempts that we have made in, for instance, the reducing reoffending alliances, which bring religious groups together to address those issues. We will continue to take every opportunity that we can to enhance harmony in our religious and other communities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, why is it not possible to take action under the existing incitement to racial hatred provisions rather than wait for the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 to come into effect?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, all actions that can properly be taken under current legislation are being taken. The noble Lord is right to highlight the fact that other provisions are available; the additional provisions that we have made available will make it the easier to address some of the issues. He is absolutely right that we need to use current legislation as creatively as we can while we await the implementation of other legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness D&#039;Souza: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister also agree that suppressing unpopular and perhaps offensive views can sometimes make them a great deal more dangerous by encouraging action rather than political discussion and dialogue?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, that is right. That is why we have freedom of expression and why the Human Rights Act refers to proportionality and balance. There are views that are deeply abhorrent and deeply unpleasant to all of us, but people must have the freedom to explore those issues, and we can then vigorously disagree.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>

the violence threatened against people carrying out respectable, legal and ethical animal research? A large number of websites in this country offer weapons to people who wish to protest against animal research that is done in proper circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I wholeheartedly endorse what my noble friend has said. That is why this House has joined with the other place to pass legislation that trenchantly tries to address that issue. I assure my noble friend and the House that we will continue to do all that we can to make sure that it does not continue to be a scourge for the scientific community, which does so much to try and make our world better.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Coity: </b>   My Lords, although I recognise the thrust of the Question in terms of literature that should not be acceptable on the internet, I wonder whether my noble friend can also address an associated question. The most extremist activity that takes place on the internet might well be the encouragement of suicide bombing and other terrorist activities. If it is still on the internet, perhaps the security services can get in there and ensure that it does not happen, rather than moving away from it and causing us greater difficulty.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is right to highlight the opportunities on the internet. That is why we have brought before the House specific provisions in the Terrorism Bill that will deal with inappropriate activity. The House had the pleasure of discussing them at some length in passing the relevant clauses.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew10"></a><b> The Countess of Mar: </b>   My Lords, the Minister seems to be talking just about material produced in the United Kingdom. Have Her Majesty&#039;s Government any control over material brought in from overseas?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, we do not have direct control but, irrespective of whether a website is hosted abroad, someone who was accused of the offence of inciting others to commit crimes would not be exempt from prosecution merely because they had used a website that was hosted in a foreign jurisdiction. That gives us great comfort. Our internet service providers have been energetic in trying to make sure that there is no improper penetration of services here.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, according to newspaper reports, there are websites based in Florida that incite murder and violence against those who conduct animal experiments in this country. It is suggested that the websites are somehow protected by the first amendment to the United States constitution, which is absurd. Will the Government make representations to the United States authorities to make sure that that kind of incitement to murder and violence&#151;sometimes worse&#151;will be eradicated?

<a name="60315-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Watson of Richmond </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What plans they have to persuade households of the benefits of saving energy.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  My Lords, we aim to publish our revised climate change programme shortly, which will set out our future plans to engage consumers in energy saving. At present, the Government support activity to persuade householders of the benefits of saving energy for our climate change and fuel poverty goals through the work of the Energy Saving Trust, the Warm Front programme and the energy efficiency commitment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Watson of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. Given that more than 30 per cent of the energy that we use in the United Kingdom is used in our own homes, will the Government urgently examine the possibility of real tax incentives to homeowners to insulate their own home? That course of action is proving very successful in some other countries.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right to point out that a high proportion of energy use is attributable to domestic dwellings. My figure is not quite as high as 30 per cent, but perhaps it matters not: it is a very high proportion.
</p>

<a name="60315-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>I am afraid that I cannot say much about what will be in the climate change review. It might be that this Question could be asked again&#151;I am not encouraging the noble Lord to do so&#151;in two or three months, but the noble Lord is right to say that we have to look at further ways of fiscally incentivising those who produce energy-saving products and those who receive them. Although I have mentioned a couple of the ways in which we are already dealing with the matter, the noble Lord will know that there are other ways of promoting energy saving&#151;for example, product labels, home information packs and regulatory measures&#151;but the role of incentives is also important.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60315-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, one can take the view that the present price of energy is sufficient to incentivise people, but that seems not to have had much effect yet.

The issue of climate change, in which I know that the noble Lord is passionately interested, has meant that there is a requirement to raise public understanding way beyond its present level. As the noble Lord knows, we have launched the Climate Change Challenge Fund, which has available to it &#163;12 million up until 2007&#150;08. The intention is to try to persuade people and inform them of the dangers of climate change from the bottom up; it seems to work better that way than from the top down. That is an absolutely essential part of what the Government must do to make more people aware of this real danger.

<a name="60315-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </b>   My Lords, would my noble friend consider that one highly important way in which the Government could start to encourage the saving of household energy is in your Lordships&#039; House itself? Judging by the dilapidated windows in this place and the amount of cold air coming through them and elsewhere, there is more wastage than in many households throughout the country.
</p>

We share the hurt and pain that must have been caused to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General. Does the Minister accept that we have the most disaster-prone Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police? He assumed a political role in relation to ID cards; he prevented the IPCC conducting a legal investigation; he made insensitive remarks about the Soham murders; and now he seems to have been found recording private telephone conversations. Will the Minister, first, ask the HMIC to discover how many such conversations have been recorded and, secondly, ask the police committee of the Greater London Authority whether Sir Ian is a fit and proper person to run the Met?

Does my noble friend the Minister recognise that under the leadership of Sir Ian Blair as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police we have seen crime in London at its lowest level for five years, the number of non-terrorist murders at its lowest level for 10 years and the sanction detection rate increase by 70 per cent? As for the transformation of the Metropolitan Police, we are now seeing 50 per cent of those who are applying to join and to train as police constables coming from black or minority ethnic communities. Is that not a record that should be supported, and should we not do all in our power to sustain it into the future?

</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="60315-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister take the opportunity to repudiate some reports that have appeared in newspapers suggesting that the story may have come from people in the office of the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General? It would be very helpful if the Minister made it clear that no one in the Government had any association with briefing the newspapers about the story.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="60315-03_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I have absolutely no indication that that is the case. We are clear that the Government have behaved appropriately in the matter and have responded in a way that is proper.

<a name="60315-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, when I ring the Minister&#039;s office, I assume always that someone will be listening and writing down what I say or recording it in order that there is a proper record. Would the Minister agree with me that that is a regular part of good administration? I, for my part, cannot understand what the fuss is about on that particular point. Could she clarify that?

</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60315-03_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, as far as I am aware, the only side of the House that has attacked the commissioner has been the Liberal Democrat Benches. I may have been wrong, but I did not take it that there had yet been an attack on the commissioner&#039;s integrity or the way in which he had discharged his duty from Her Majesty&#039;s loyal Opposition.

the Minister clarify where the law is in that regard, quite apart from recent events? I understand that it is legal if one records a telephone conversation without telling the person on the other end but that it is not if the recording is passed to anybody else. Does that mean that a secretary cannot in fact produce a transcript of that conversation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="60315-03_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, to give a full answer I would have to take some time, not least because the noble Baroness is touching on the interception of telephone calls, which is covered by Part 1 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and we would have to talk about the RIPA position. In essence, what the noble Baroness said is right, but I can write to her about the detail. Nothing that she has said at the moment would cause any difficulty. The secretary keeping a note and not publishing it to anyone would not, as far as I am aware, contravene any provision&#151;but I shall write more fully to the noble Baroness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60315-03_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Imbert: </b>   My Lords, we have heard the case for the prosecution; is it not now time to pause and hear the case for the defence?

</p>

<a name="60315-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>I speak as a redundant commissioner, and I confess that whenever talking to senior public officials I would make a record of our conversation. As a young constable, I learnt to write shorthand at over 100 words a minute, so I did not have to resort to the modern method of recording. I confess also that I did not tell my correspondents that I was making a note, and they did not tell me that they were recording what I said.

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1224</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60315-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Amendment No. 22C is largely technical. It clarifies Clause 5 by adding, where it says that an application for a designated document,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;must include an application to be entered on the Register&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>the words &quot;or be accompanied by&quot; after &quot;include&quot;. We have already enjoyed the delightful opportunity on two separate occasions to discuss Amendments Nos. 16 and 22 at length. The first was on Report on 23 January and the second was on consideration of Commons amendments on 6 March. On the latter occasion we had an extensive argument about the manifesto and the commitments that were made thereby, and for the purpose of today&#039;s debate I do not intend to refer to those issues again. I do not intend to spend very long now repeating the arguments we have had on previous occasions as to why the Government believe the Bill should not be amended in the way proposed in Amendments Nos. 16 and 22.
</p>

<a name="60315-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>We believe there is a persuasive reason for the linkage that exists in the Bill as it now returns to your Lordships&#039; House. Last week, we started to phase in the issue of &quot;e-passports&quot;, incorporating a facial image biometric. Once we have moved on to the next phase of biometric passports, including facial image and fingerprint biometrics, anyone applying for a passport will have to go through the same sort of application process as for an identity card and will have their personal details and biometrics recorded on a central passport database. Without the linkage with identity cards, this would be without the safeguards that we have introduced into this procedure by virtue of this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60315-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Our plans to link passports and identity cards have a long history. This should, therefore, not come as a surprise to anyone. I wish simply to summarise the chronology. In July 2002, the Government issued their first consultation document about a card scheme and one of the options canvassed was for a universal scheme linked to passports. In November 2003, we announced the decision in principle to introduce identity cards. It was then made clear that there would be a two-stage scheme. In the initial stage, as well as introducing a voluntary plain identity card for those who do not have a passport, we would link identity cards to more secure passports. In <i>Identity Cards&#151; The Next Steps</i>, the policy document published in November 2003 (Cm 6020), we stated at paragraph 16(ii):


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;linking more secure passports and perhaps eventually driving licences to the scheme on a compulsory basis so that they will be acceptable forms of identity card. By linking the card scheme to widely held identity documents most people will get a card conveniently and automatically as they renew an existing document&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>In April 2004, we published the draft Identity Cards Bill, and the same word, &quot;must&quot;, was included in Clause 5(2) as we are now debating. We were again very clear that in the first, initial stage of the identity cards scheme, there should be no possibility of obtaining a designated document, such as a passport, without an identity card. Paragraph 2.17 of the consultation paper on the draft Identity Cards Bill, published in April 2004, (Cm 6178) said:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1225"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1225</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;Once a document such as a passport has been designated as an ID card, this will be the only form in which it will be available&#151;i.e. there will be no &#039;non-ID card&#039; variants. It would undermine confidence in the system if there were to be identity documents available, on demand, at different levels of security&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>In November 2004, we introduced the first Identity Cards Bill, which was agreed by the other place and passed at Second Reading by this House in March 2005. The same provision requiring applicants for passports or other designated documents to obtain an identity card was included in that Bill.
</p>

<a name="60315-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>In May 2005, this Bill was reintroduced. Yet again, we made it absolutely clear that, once designated, obtaining a passport would also mean being issued with an identity card. That is the background against which we now consider what happened in this Bill.
<a name="time_4"></a>
<a name="60315-04_time1"></a><h5>3.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60315-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>I believe we have been clear and consistent on this point. The Government have listened and made concessions on a number of other points in the Bill, including: the requirement to publish the six-monthly estimates of cost; the removal of Clauses 6 and 7, to bring forward compulsion by secondary legislation; as well as a large number of other technical amendments, many originally proposed in this House by noble Lords opposite to clarify and to improve the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60315-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>That is the function of this House: to clarify, to improve, to amend, to ask the other place to think again and, if necessary, to think again. The simple fact is that this Bill, with the provisions in Clauses 5 and 8 linking designated documents and identity cards, was passed by the House of Commons on 18 October.
</p>

<a name="60315-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The Lords Amendments Nos. 16 and 22 were rejected by the elected House by a majority of 31 on 13 February this year and again, by a majority of 33, on 13 March. If necessary, these amendments will continue to be resisted strongly by the Government, and the other place will continue to make its voice heard.
</p>

<a name="60315-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>We have the result of having asked the other place to think again. We have debated this issue and voted on it, and it has been rejected twice by the elected House. Therefore, we have to ask ourselves whether this is not the moment when this House should give way to the elected Chamber, because our role is to review and not to wreck.
</p>

<a name="60315-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>If that is so, there comes a moment when we have to bow to the other place. I would respectfully suggest that we would honour the function of this House better if we did that with a degree of grace.
</p>

<a name="60315-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>I simply ask, therefore, that your Lordships consider whether it would be proper and in the tradition of this House to go further. I remember with great clarity what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, when he was pressed on this matter on Radio 4. He responded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;At the end of the day the House of Commons will have its say&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>It has spoken. It has spoken loudly. Its voice is rising, and I do not think that we need a cacophony to tell us that the time has now arrived. Therefore, I move that your Lordships&#039; House should not insist on <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60315-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>By far the major part of the Home Secretary&#039;s opening and closing speeches were devoted to trying to re-interpret the Labour Party manifesto at the election last year. At col. 1249 he quoted from the manifesto&#151;and these words have been repeated several times:


</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I am afraid that my primary school teacher, Miss Lovelace, would have give Mr Clarke 0 out of 10 for that. She would have pointed out in the sweetest way, because she was never nasty to a wayward child, that the word &quot;voluntary&quot; in that sentence related to ID cards, not passports. It plainly did not say or mean to say, &quot;We will introduce ID cards initially on a compulsory basis as people renew their passports voluntarily&quot;. Indeed, more than 80 per cent of the population have passports. Yet that is the cock-eyed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1227"></a>

interpretation that is now pressed on the public by a government who seem to be losing their sense of shame.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Only an administration that desperately needs to dis-impale itself from the hook of its own making would resort to such double-speak. If this was a City prospectus, the financial equivalent of an election manifesto, the FSA would be down on it like a ton of bricks. The Square Mile may not be a beacon of moral scrupulousness, but it would scoff at the verbal gymnastics being employed by the Government. Noble Lords should listen to the Home Secretary again. In the same speech, he stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;That position is that the scheme will initially be based on a stand-alone identity card, issued on its own on a voluntary basis, or together with a document such as a passport, which is also issued on a voluntary basis. That seems to be clear and unequivocal&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 13/3/06; col. 1249.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Conceivably, Mr Clarke, that is so, but only so long as you do not link the two, as the designation process under Clauses 4 and 5 does, and only so long as the designation process does not, in making that link, force the citizen seeking or renewing a passport to take out an ID card as well. But that is precisely what it does. It staggers me that we are still discussing that point. Try that argument out on anyone in the high street or in a pub and you will get an &quot;are you mad?&quot; look.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The inglorious reality is that the reason the Labour manifesto last year talked only of &quot;voluntary&quot; ID cards, was to disarm the opposition that was already apparent from civil liberties lobbies, among whom there are many Labour voters and for whom the issue of compulsion was important, if not vital.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>When Mr Clarke wound up on Monday, he stepped yet deeper into his own verbal bog, arguing that what really matters is not the manifesto at all, but what was said before the manifesto&#151;namely what was in the Bill published in 2004. Indeed, the noble Baroness gave us a long peroration today of what happened before the manifesto. But that, too, is patently feeble. We all know full well that what matters for the purposes of the manifesto mandate&#151;and the Salisbury convention&#151;is what is in the manifesto. You cannot at one and the same time sanctify manifestos by claiming, as the Commons regularly does, the right to override this place on the basis of commitments in them&#151;most recently on the Hunting Bill&#151;and, at the same time, ignore a particular commitment on the grounds that you do not much like it and have had second thoughts. We know full well that manifestos sometimes very intentionally change old policies and priorities and adopt new ones to attract wider public support at elections. If, besides scanning the 111 pages of Labour&#039;s last manifesto, the public are also supposed to have reviewed what Labour Ministers said and what Bills were before this House and the other place in the previous year or two, the situation would be as daft as it would be unrealistic. What would the poor voter be supposed to make&#151;

<a name="60315-05_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I can deal with it very simply. I am the first and last to acknowledge the primacy of the other House. I would never challenge it for a second. But here we are dealing with an exceptional case in which this House is seeking to uphold the manifesto of the Government, and that is the truth of it. I shall continue if I may.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>What would the poor voter be supposed to do, confronted with a Bill, which, as we said, came before the other place and this place before the manifesto, which says one thing, and the later manifesto, which says another? It is perfectly clear that the manifesto is what counts when the electorate go to the polls. It will not do for the Government to argue otherwise, in particular, because the Home Secretary is, after all, the embodiment and guardian of law and order, and that in turn depends on the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I sincerely say to the House that the example being set by the Government in this instance is self-damaging&#151;indeed, it damages us all at a time when public trust in politics is already fraying. I say all this with genuine reluctance because I recognise what a hugely difficult job the Home Secretary does and what ability, energy and, in normal circumstances, decency the present incumbent brings to that onerous task.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Before I sit down, I need to say a word about the effects of our amendments because they have still apparently not hit home. Mr Clarke&#039;s first argument on Monday, and we heard it again this afternoon, was that unless, as he put it, the processes of taking out a passport and taking out an ID card were merged&#151;that was his word&#151;citizens would be deprived of what he called,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;the statutory safeguards provided by the Bill, such as the creation of a national identity scheme commissioner&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The answer to that is simple. If you believe that there are extra safeguards by having an ID card, as the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, and the noble Baroness said last week, you will no doubt take out your voluntary ID card. That is fine. That is up to each of us to decide.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>It is also for us to decide whether or not we better protect our identity against fraud by having an ID card. Again, voluntarism is best: first, because there is considerable disagreement as to whether the ID card will do that&#151;I refer to the honey-pot risk; and, secondly, because the overhanging and perhaps dominant issue in the general debate is whether we should be forced to hand over to the state the mass of Schedule 1 information that will create the database standing behind every card, as Tony McNulty, the Minister, put it on 13 February. Here, again, I am afraid that misleading statements have been made, most recently on Monday, when the Home Secretary said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;The same data will be held in both cases&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 13/3/06; col. 1250.]&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="column_1229"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1229</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60315-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>referring, of course, to ID cards on the one hand and passports on the other. The noble Baroness gave a comparable impression to that in our debate on 6 March, although she has not done so today.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>For a passport, you need give only your present principal address, compared with the prospect for ID cards under Clause 1 of providing not only all your addresses in the UK and abroad, but the time you have spent at each of those addresses&#151;back without limit. Your file at the ID registry will also contain 13 categories of personal reference numbers, compared with one or none for the passport, plus your record, registration and ID card history, validation information, security information, and, above all, your intimate audit trail information. None of that is needed for a passport.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Why do the Government continue to pretend otherwise? Add to that the danger of future pressure to add to the list of required data and the managerial imperative&#151;the economic rationalisation&#151;favouring merger of all state information on to the ID register. The information commissioner was surely right to deliver his sombre warning last October.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Like the noble Baroness, I do not propose to repeat the general arguments that I and many others of your Lordships deployed on 6 March, and earlier, in support of the Motion. Suffice it to say that this uniquely complex centralised scheme is ill-thought through, incompletely costed, hugely costly, technologically risky and corruptible both internally and externally. Furthermore, the ambitious claims made for it have steadily lost weight as they have been subjected to detailed scrutiny in this place and beyond it. A compulsory scheme will add to what has become, I am sad to say, a surveillance state of unparalleled reach among democracies. What is more, the majority of our EU partners either have no cards or voluntary ID cards.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, picked out Sweden, Finland and Denmark at the end of her speech last week to support her case, and said that they were &quot;hardly totalitarian states&quot;. How true, but let us consider the facts. Sweden introduced a simple national ID card on 1 October last year, but it is voluntary. Finland has a simple and voluntary card. Denmark does not have an ID card at all.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Our Motion would allow those who favour cards, for whatever reason, to have them voluntarily without the compulsion of the Government&#039;s proposals. Very many would have cards; very many would not. I received a message when I arrived this afternoon from a woman who said that she represented a large number of embattled and battered women. She said, &quot;For goodness sake, don&#039;t let them have compulsory cards because the register will be fallible and we will be vulnerable&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60315-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Over time, compulsion is likely to have a profoundly damaging impact on that trust and allegiance of the citizen towards the state and its organs without which our most cherished hopes and, indeed, the stated aims of the Government in this Bill, cannot be realised. We and the Conservatives have abandoned the other <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="60315-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I support Motion A1 moved by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and oppose government Motion A. The objective of the noble Lord&#039;s Motion is admirably simple. It would enact the Government&#039;s manifesto commitment. The Minister said that she does not want to return to that lengthy argument and instead gave us a history of other government documents&#151;all of which I have read because that is my job. The public, who go to vote in a general election as their citizens&#039; duty, rely on a manifesto. If we cannot rely on it, why bother with elections at all.
</p>

<a name="60315-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The manifesto commitment said that the Government would introduce ID cards, including biometric data, such as fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out, initially, on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports. This Bill and the Government&#039;s Motion would not do that. For all those who need a new passport, it would make the right to leave this country conditional, on us coming into compulsion, on being entered on the register and on buying an ID card. I could not put it better than the Minister&#039;s honourable friend, Mr Mark Fisher, did in another place on Monday evening this week. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;If we believe in a voluntary scheme, as the Home Secretary and the manifesto say that we do, there is no way that we can reject the Lords amendments . . . By rejecting the amendments, the Government will be opting for compulsion&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 13/3/06; col. 1260.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

</p>

<a name="60315-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Compulsion it would be&#151;compulsion by stealth, but compulsion no less. The government amendment in lieu does not change that. It is not just technical; it is cosmetic. I do not give way unless the noble Lord is to say that the government amendment is more than cosmetic. Perhaps he will wait until there is a relevant part of my speech on which he would like to intervene. If he wishes to speak on the government amendment, I shall give way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60315-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. In this House, as in others, for a good debate it is essential for these kinds of interventions to take place. That seems to be sensible. The noble Baroness has been very helpful in e-mailing me various points following last week&#039;s debate. She is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1231"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1231</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

very anxious to ensure that we maintain and keep to our commitments in our manifesto. Suppose we had agreed in our manifesto to double international development assistance but we quadrupled it. Would that be keeping to our manifesto commitment? I think it would. If we go beyond and improve on our manifesto commitments we do better than we promised.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="60315-06_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I am always so pleased to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes. I sometimes think he is my greatest ally on the Benches opposite. When I consider the manifesto commitments on education reform and what is happening in another place today, on reforming the health service and on smoking issues, of course, the noble Lord is right to point out that this Government can be relied on to abandon their manifesto commitments. He asked whether I would allow interventions and explained how important they are. What a pity that the Home Secretary in another place refused to do so on Monday night.
</p>

<a name="60315-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>I return to my speech. The Government&#039;s technical amendment would simply mean that compulsory application to the register with a designated document could be made either on one form or two, so compulsion by stealth is still there. As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has said, we are then left with a huge audit trail of our lives. In the course of proceedings on the Bill we have heard many arguments. The Home Secretary has many admirers in this House and in another place. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, that for much of the time I am one of those admirers. But I believe that the argument put forward on Monday by the Home Secretary was surely one of the most extraordinary that we have yet heard and it should not be given house room by any Member of either House. He said that the manifesto commitment that a scheme would be voluntary would be true even in a regime where free British people would not be allowed a passport to travel unless they paid up and enrolled for an ID card because, and I quote him,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;That is the free will that people may exercise in deciding whether or not they wish to have a passport . . . That is the free will over what they can do and how they can operate. That is what the wording means&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 13/3/06; col. 1261.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Oh, that George Orwell were alive today to hear those words. The Home Secretary says that it is all free will. I do not think that that is a definition of freedom that our parents and grandparents had in mind when they took up arms to defend it. On 6 March, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said (at col. 570 of the <i>Official Report</i>) that we should not exploit &quot;infelicitous&quot; drafting. I wonder whether the noble Baroness has had direct experience of drafting manifestos. Maybe she has. If she has, she will know that every word, in every sentence, in every manifesto is pored over, discussed, decided and cleared at the highest level. The pledge that ID cards would be rolled out voluntarily will have been agreed personally by the Prime Minister, as it would by every Prime Minister, and by the Home Secretary. So the Government must <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1232"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1232</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have decided deliberately on the wording in the manifesto. They had the chance to state openly in the manifesto that, if elected, they would force us all to be registered and to pay for an ID card, but they chose not to do so.
</p>

<a name="60315-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Under the Motion tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, the individual would have a real choice and genuine free will and, if they wished, they could choose to go on the register and have an ID card. There is nothing to stop them. The individual could have exactly what the Home Secretary is trying to say that they have; they would have free will&#151;free will to have a passport and, separately, the free will to have an ID card.
</p>

<a name="60315-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The Home Secretary and the Minister have repeated their Second Reading arguments about the purposes of the scheme. The Home Secretary went into some detail on Monday night. I simply remind the Minister as gently as I can that we set out five clear tests on purposes in Committee. We took great care to go through them, but the Government have failed to come up to scratch on each one. We believe there are quite simply other and better ways of securing our safety, reducing the fraudulent use of services, and managing migration&#151;ways that would not pose a risk to our freedom to the extent that this grandiose scheme will do, and that would be more financially prudent. Even government departments have recognised that. The Minister in charge of the Bill in the other place, Mr Burnham, confessed to the press that government departments have not exactly been rushing to him with cheques in their hands to sign up to the Home Office scheme.
</p>

<a name="60315-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>The Minister argued last week, as has the Home Secretary outside this House, that we should be bound by the advice of the Wakeham commission in recommendation 7 of its report&#151;a report that the Government have not fallen over themselves to implement in other areas. The commission, chaired by my noble friend Lord Wakeham, recommended that the House should be cautious about challenging the clearly expressed views of another place on issues of policy. I entirely agree. We are always cautious, but every now and then come fundamental issues of freedom and ancient liberty. I believe this is one such issue.
</p>

<a name="60315-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>We agree with the view of the Select Committee on the Constitution, which said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;we continue to believe that the constitutional significance of the Bill is that it adjusts the fundamental relationship between the individual and the State&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>If we believe that a government have got the balance wrong on such a significant matter, and one that is not covered by the manifesto, surely, if we have any role in this Parliament, we should have the right to insist on our view. I therefore strongly urge this House to support the Motion tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, and to defend the right of the people of this country to exercise their free will.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="60315-06_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Eatwell: </b>   My Lords, surely the noble Baroness, in urging the House to accept the amendment, will also want to consider its cost to the Exchequer. She has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1233"></a>

<a name="60315-07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I will be delighted to do so as soon as the Government are prepared to tell us the costs of their scheme. So far, they have refused.
</p>

<a name="60315-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>In urging the House to follow this road, it is important that we uphold the right for the people, not the Government, to decide voluntarily if they want to be enrolled for an ID card. Why do the Government not trust the people to exercise their free will? That is my advice to the Government; trust the people, and accept Motion A1.

<a name="60315-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, says that nothing undermines the state of politics more than passing a Bill of this kind. I say to him that nothing undermines people&#039;s trust and confidence in politics than a Bill that is increasingly supported by a majority of the people, that people want to be enacted, and that has twice been approved by the other place&#151;an elected assembly&#151;but which the alliance opposite believes should be rejected. It is that which is undermining the political process and undermining trust.

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, referred to the surveillance society and the noble Baroness last week referred to this being a fascist Bill. I can tell her what fascism is: it is the destruction of the individual. This Bill is about recognising the individual and giving the individual an identity. Members opposite laugh. That is because they do not have a clue, frankly, what the people of this country think. They do not understand why the people of this country wish to have identity cards.

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60315-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Gould of Brookwood: </b>   My Lords, the first way in which I know is because there was a general election&#151;a party won and a party lost&#151;and this measure was in the manifesto.

<a name="60315-07_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Gould of Brookwood: </b>   My Lords, the manifesto states quite clearly that it will be the case that as people apply for a passport they will, as time goes on, be able to have their identity card.
</p>

<a name="60315-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I shall tell noble Lords opposite why I know what the public think: it is because we asked them what they think, and they said that they support identity cards&#151;and they support identity cards in significant numbers, with a great majority. It is such a failure for the House and Members opposite not to understand that if the people&#039;s will is rejected time and time again, confidence in this process will be undermined. I say to the House that enough is enough. Let us follow the will of the people. Let us trust the people, as the noble Baroness opposite said, and let us move on.

<a name="60315-07_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, perhaps may I say in answer that if it is really the case that the people were mad enough to choose voluntarily to bring themselves under a system of compulsion which will expose the innermost secrets of their lives to identity theft&#151;which is already growing&#151;and which will make them extremely vulnerable, I am very disappointed in the public. I would be most interested to meet the kind of people the noble Lord meets because I can imagine no one saying, &quot;Yes, I want a passport, but I also insist on having compulsorily an identity card which will put me at risk&quot;.

<a name="60315-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Incidentally, the very creation of such an enormous national identity register will be a present to terrorists; it will be a splendid thing for them to disrupt and blow up. It will also provide valuable information to organised crime and to the intelligence services of unfriendly countries. It will be accessible to all of these. I find it extraordinarily difficult to believe why anyone would voluntarily and enthusiastically come forward and say, &quot;Do let me join this dangerous club&quot;.

<a name="60315-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I come to this matter in relation to the other Bills which have been before the House relating broadly to the area known as civil liberties. On those matters, I found myself siding quite clearly with the concerted opposition to the Government&#039;s proposals. However, on this matter I find myself more persuaded by the position the Government have taken, while accepting that there is a judgment to be made and, as with all these issues, a balance to be struck.
</p>

<a name="60315-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>We are told that to have identity cards and the national identity register as eventually a compulsory measure&#151;and, as an interim step, a compulsory measure for those who have other documents&#151;would fundamentally change the relationship between the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1235</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

individual and the state. We must recognise, however, that that relationship has been changing for a long time. A hundred years ago, you could travel anywhere in Europe, and get a job anywhere in Europe, without a passport. The world changed during the 20th century. Of course, restrictions were introduced during the two world wars. In the context of the 21st century, it is inevitable that, sooner or later, something like the proposal before us will come.

</p>

<a name="60315-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>For those reasons, I think that the Government are probably doing a sensible thing in taking this step. Technically, and in reality, it might be somewhat different&#151;perhaps, to some noble Lords, very different&#151;from what was in the manifesto. Is not it likely, however, that prevention of terrorism is precisely the area in which government thinking would move on relatively quickly? I agree that a great deal of information will be provided that currently is not provided when we apply for a passport, but I find the description of the details to be requested as the innermost secrets of our lives or an intimate audit trail to be an overstatement. I note, however, that we must give the date of our death as part of the information, which is perhaps food for thought.

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>In the 21st century, we face difficult threats to determine and assess. We live in an ever more global age in which, to some degree, there is a clash of civilisations&#151;perhaps of several different civilisations&#151; with a whole series of interfaces. Our global culture of communications and travel makes that extremely sensitive and difficult. I believe that it would be wise for the House to accept the will of the other place on this matter and then to concentrate on the things that really matter&#151;how the register is to be protected, how it is to be safeguarded, how it is to be used, and all the other questions including costs.

A person who acquires a biometric passport will not be obliged to inform central government every time he or she moves house, on pain of a penalty of up to &#163;1,000. It is this prospect that will infuriate members of the public once they discover it, which, at the moment, very few have.

<a name="60315-07_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Peston: </b>   My Lords, I intervene with reluctance. I say immediately that I have no intention of debating identity cards in what I have to say. Unlike Mozart&#039;s music, hearing the speeches on this subject once is enough. We do not need to hear them several times, as seems to be offered at the moment.
</p>

<a name="60315-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>This is not about identity cards. It is a serious constitutional question about the relationship between this House and the other place. I am just about to enter my 20th year here, and I know of no example of misbehaviour&#151;I use that word advisedly&#151;of this House corresponding to what is being proposed at present. We are a scrutiny House and any legitimacy that we have is based on our dispassionate scrutiny of legislation. Our role is to expose the nature of Bills and to ask the other place whether it would like to think again. I remind your Lordships that the Government do not have a majority in this House, nor do the Official Opposition. In my judgment, there will never, in our lifetimes or beyond, be a majority in this House for an elected government in this country. The House will always be as it is now, balanced broadly between the Government and the principal Opposition, with plenty of other Peers as well.
</p>

<a name="60315-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Unless the Official Opposition have come to the conclusion that they will never form the government of this country again, they are behaving in the most foolhardy way imaginable in suggesting that we should send this back to the Commons yet again. The other House may be wrong&#151;I do not want to argue about that; they often are wrong&#151;but it is the elected Chamber. I thought that we had for some time accepted that it was the primary Chamber, and whether it was right or wrong, it must get its own way. I have not the slightest doubt about that. Noble Lords who are in favour of the amendment may well be right&#151;I do not know as I do not have the expertise. But whether we are right or wrong is now completely irrelevant to what is confronting us. What is confronting us is a very deep constitutional matter. We have asked the other place to think about this twice, and twice is sufficient. Not only would it be unconstitutional, but I advise noble Lords opposite that if they are ever in government again, they will be deeply sorry if they create a precedent on this matter today.

<a name="60315-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, I feel that it is right to respond to the very serious point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Peston. His argument is based on the convenience of government not the rights of Parliament. I argue that what we are talking about are the rights of Parliament.
</p>

say, but &quot;convenience&quot; is an understatement. I think we are discussing something much deeper than the convenience of government; we are discussing the rights and wrongs of the position of this House relative to the other place when we have done our scrutiny job. And no one could accuse us of not doing our scrutiny job.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, I understand now and I can follow the noble Lord&#039;s argument even better.
</p>

<a name="60315-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>It was very interesting to hear the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Gould. It was nice to see the sorcerer&#039;s apprentice in the flesh, telling us how these things are done. On the substance of the argument, voluntary means voluntary and compulsory means compulsory. I invite the noble Lord, Lord Gould, to tell us whether one of his focus groups tested those two words before the general election. I suspect it did. The reason that &quot;voluntary&quot; went in the Bill, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, pointed out, is that it is a softer and more acceptable word.
</p>

<a name="60315-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I took part in writing four manifestos and fought on two, so I know a little about them. Some are kept, some are changed and some are quietly forgotten. The issue here, as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has rightly said, is to do with the relative responsibilities of our two Houses. I do not accept that the Salisbury convention stands any more. It is absurd that a convention set up 60 years ago between a Labour government with 48 per cent of the electorate behind them and a wholly hereditary, Conservative-dominated House of Lords should still apply, with a Labour Government elected by 34 per cent of the vote and Labour now the largest party in the House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord can tell us what percentage he believes one should have to govern this country?

</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, clearly they have the right to govern this country on 34 per cent, but I think it is a very dangerous percentage&#151;a very dangerous percentage from which to appeal to manifesto commitments and a very dangerous percentage from which to ask this Parliament to start giving away some of its powers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord for giving way. Surely the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, was that the House should accept the words in the manifesto. That is the Salisbury doctrine. The noble Lord is therefore picking and choosing, as we would expect him to do, those items in the manifesto with which he agrees and which he will therefore support. He will then say that the Salisbury convention does not apply to the items that he does not support.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, I am not saying that at all. I am saying that legislation is either well written or badly written.

changed the wording to which you committed in the manifesto&#151;is the last refuge of legislative scoundrels. What we are really debating today is what this House should do at this point.
</p>

<a name="60315-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I know that the Minister has two means of addressing this House: sometimes she is charming, and sometimes she is scary. I suspect that this afternoon we are going to get &quot;scary&quot;. We will be told what this House should not do, what it must not do and what it dare not do. But I suggest that the powers of this House were not given to it by James I or Charles II. They were given less than eight years ago by the democratic House of Commons. Included in those powers was the power to reject part or all of legislation. If we do not retain that sanction, then ping-pong becomes mere shadow boxing. All Ministers have to do is to sit pat, knowing that they will ultimately have their way. I therefore think it is very important in the relationship between the two Houses that this House retains the right to say no.
</p>

<a name="60315-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, has intervened about 12 times today. He makes me think of an American footballer from Chicago a few years ago called the Refrigerator. He was not very good at American football but he used to fall on opponents from a great height. I always think of the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, as the Refrigerator of the government Benches. The fact, however, is that we have the Parliament Act. That ensures the right of the elected House to have its way. But this House must retain the right to say, &quot;Not in our name&quot;. That is the process, and that is the process we are going through today.
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, the Parliament Act has been used four times since 1949. Three of those occasions were on free votes, not whipped votes. The only occasion when it was used on a whipped vote was the European Parliamentary Elections Bill. I will not go into detail, but that was a very special case and an arrangement between the parties. Since 1949, however, the Parliament Act has always been used on a free vote.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, I shall end on the Parliament Act and the power of this House to say no. Last time, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, quoted Wakeham, which sent me back to a document that we greatly underestimated on its publication. I am glad that she drew our attention to it. Perhaps I may quote from it at greater length:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;were to express concern about a particular Government proposal and exercise whatever powers of delay or referral were available, that would lead to (renewed) public and media interest in the issue, with opportunities for the concerns to be set out. It would force the Government to reconsider the issues in light of that interest, and it would give members of the House of Commons an opportunity to revisit the issues and make the final determination in the light of all relevant information. The Government of the day <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_1239"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>would have to take such powers and their consequences into account in drafting its legislation in the first place as well as seeking to put it on the statute book&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>That is my argument. The government of the day cannot come to the Dispatch Box at a late stage and say, &quot;Whoops, sorry, it was infelicitously drafted&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Lord, Lord McNally, therefore saying that we have now reached a pass where this House is entitled to veto the will of the other place?
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew10"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   No, my Lords. The Minister will see that the machinery was in the 1998 Act. If this House says no, as it did over fox hunting, the other place&#151;the democratically elected House&#151;can and should prevail. But it has to take the consequences of that. When it comes to legislation as important as this&#151;one of those rare occasions to which Wakeham referred&#151;we have the right to say no. It is not a veto; it is this House using the powers that it was given by the democratically elected House. If you take that power away, you are left with an emasculated House of Lords and a House of Commons that is dominated by an over-powerful executive which was elected on a very small majority of votes. That is a very dangerous way to run a democracy. Lord Hailsham described it 30 years ago as an &quot;elective dictatorship&quot;. We are the barrier to that today.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60315-08_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may respond directly to the noble Lord, Lord McNally. His argument fell into two parts: first, that the House of Lords has the power to say no; and, secondly, that in this case it ought to say no. The argument would be nonsense if the second part were not taken in with the first. Let us examine the first part&#151;that the House of Lords has the right to say no. I expect that it does. I do not have statutes in front of me, but I expect that what the noble Lord says about the legal position between the two Houses is probably right. But it is not a question of rights; it is a question of judgment. It is question of whether it makes any sense in the operation of the British constitution for this House to insist on something which twice has been rejected by the House at the other end of the corridor.
</p>

<a name="60315-08_para7"></a>

<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="60315-09_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   My Lords, if we were today discussing a reform of the House of Lords Act, no doubt that is an issue that would be considered. I have sat through a number of these debates in the 15-odd years that I have been in this House. About once every 18 months, we have this absurd wrangle between the two Houses. Ping-pong is played. Ping-pong, frankly, is an absurd game anyway, played primarily by people&#151;

<a name="60315-09_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   I am warned, my Lords, and I take the warning. It is played primarily at least by people who are not constituted in the way that I am. However, that seems a pretty futile and absurd way in which to run a government and a country. This House has its views and that House has its views, but what is the relationship between the two? What the noble Lord, Lord McNally, is proposing is a relationship of almost permanent dissent and dispute. The noble Lord shakes his head at me but, with respect, that will do him no good. The fact is that we have to devise a system of resolving the differences between the two Houses. Until we have in this country a proper disputes resolution procedure such as the one written into the American constitution, then it will be the basic relationship between the elected House and the unelected House that continues to matter. There is no doubt whatever in my mind that the House that should prevail ought to be the elected one.
</p>

<a name="60315-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Should the elected House prevail now? That argument has gone round and round, but there is nothing new to be said on the issues. It is perfectly clear from some of the contributions from the other side that the argument is not about whether it should be tied to a passport, but whether there should be identity cards at all. The noble Baroness, Lady Park, was&#151;to put it slightly neutrally&#151;pretty strong in what she had to say about identity cards as such. That view was not shared by everyone in your Lordships&#039; House and is certainly not shared by the general public.

<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="60315-09_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, what I object to is a compulsory national identity register. I stay by that, and do not think it in any way inconsistent.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="60315-09_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   My Lords, I listened carefully to what the noble Baroness said. She said she objected to it being compulsory and could think of no conceivable reason why a sensible person would do it voluntarily. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I finish on this note. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, is raising profound constitutional issues.

</p>

<a name="60315-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peston, said that this debate is no longer about identity cards but about the respective or relative responsibilities of the two Houses. It would be irresponsible of this House, he said, to stand its ground at this stage; I believe that he used a word even stronger than irresponsible. Yet it is not only about the relative responsibility of the two Houses; it is also about the rights of the individual against the Executive. Those who are now the Executive gave the clearest promise to the people that identity cards would be rolled out on a voluntary basis. I can see no ambiguity at all in the manifesto&#151;and ambiguity cannot be created out of it, however much they may wish to do so. That promise having been given, the Executive ought to be kept to it. That is why, on this occasion, I will vote in favour of the amendment.

The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, specifically said that he believes in the primacy of the other place. &quot;However&quot;, he said, &quot;this is an exception&quot;. Those were the words he used&#151;or, &quot;This is an exceptional case&quot;. I would be happy to give way if the noble Lord did not say that, but I see that he is not willing to proceed further on the matter. He said that the other place&#151;the elected House&#151;should be able to have its way, but that this case was exceptional, which was not what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said. But I do not mind the Liberal Democrats disagreeing among themselves. That is perfectly reasonable.

The only question is how often it should be allowed to say no. I thought that my noble friend Lord Peston made an excellent point. For any party that wants to be in government to know that in this place it will never have a majority, however much this place is changed, and that it will always have to use the Parliament Act when it is defeated, umpteen times, is to turn this place into a nonsense.

<a name="60315-10_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, we do not have a power of veto in this House&#151;all we have is the power to delay things. If we keep on voting no, they will then use the Parliament Act. The only consequence of that is that the Home Office will have to vote one more year before it can have its new, shiny, half-a-billion-pound-a-year department to issue the ID cards. That will be the sole consequence. Therefore, we might as well push the matter to the limit to point out that the Magna Carta established the concept that the Executive should not have an unfettered right to do what they want. Since then, Parliament has tried to control the Executive. Unfortunately, the balance of power has changed in another place over the past century in such a way that the Executive to a large extent now control another place and what goes through. The strange doctrine has arisen that the Government have the right to get their business through Parliament&#151;meaning that the Executive have a right to get their business through Parliament. That is the tail wagging the dog and is the opposite of what Magna Carta said. We need to remember that.

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The other point, which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, made so well, is that if governments are being elected by a minority of the electorate, what they put in their manifesto statement is very important because that is what the people put them up there to do. For them then to say that they have changed their mind is very dangerous, because you effectively have then elective dictatorship. That is what we are seeing happen. To answer the earlier question, if they had more than 50 per cent or perhaps 60 per cent of the electorate voting for them, maybe we might rethink. But until that situation arises, let us leave it as it is. We do not have a power of veto but we do have a power of delay. I see no problem in using it. It might change things, because it will give people time to think about the issue a bit harder and see whether they really do want to push the Bill through in a year&#039;s time.

<a name="60315-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The right reverend Prelate said that people did not have to worry about things like this a century ago. In the 1850s Britain did not have passports and ID cards, and we could go to the Continent and do what we liked. The continentals could not; they had ID cards, and unless you were either a criminal and bribed your way or one of the ruling elite, you could not move around the place and work where you liked, which is part of the point of this entire debate. I entirely agree with my noble friend Lord Monson, because I am very annoyed that I will be one of the few people who will be liable to a &#163;1,000 fine if I do not notify a change of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60315-10_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, with regard to the Parliament Act, we ought to be entirely clear what we are talking about. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, and the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, have said, &quot;Use the Parliament Act&quot;. That Act has been used only once on a whipped vote on a major item of government policy, and that was the Parliament Act 1949. The Acts since&#151;the Act changing the age of consent, the Hunting Act and the War Crimes Act&#151;were all passed on free votes. The only other one was the European Parliamentary Elections Act, which, as I know the noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde and Lord Henley, will remember, was an arrangement between the two parties.
</p>

<a name="60315-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>The official Opposition have to decide whether the killing of the Identity Cards Bill for a year or longer is the issue on which they wish to force the will of this House. I have just had a quick count: there are more than 20 former Members of the other House sitting on the Opposition Benches. Perhaps they will win today. I think they intend to vote&#151;it would be awfully hard for them not to do so today&#151;but then the official Opposition will have to think very carefully indeed. Is this the issue on which they wish to create a precedent?
</p>

<a name="60315-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Former Chief Whips have a very long memory. If the official Opposition create this precedent, we shall eventually use it. It will be a long time before they are in government, but we shall remember it. This is a major step: the first time since 1949 that the official Opposition have forced the use of the Parliament Act, which has been suggested. It will be interesting if we hear again from the official Opposition whether they agree with the use of the Parliament Act. I will give way to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, if he will tell me whether the official Opposition are prepared to envisage the use of the Parliament Act on this Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="60315-10_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, I will probably be supporting them when they do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="60315-10_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Strathclyde: </b>   My Lords, I always thought the rules of the House were that you should listen to the whole of the debate before indulging yourself in it. However, on this occasion I am prepared to make an exception because of the kind invitation of the noble Lord, Lord Carter.
</p>

<a name="60315-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>This House should always proceed with caution when it is trying to defeat the Government, even when it is asking the House of Commons to think again on a Bill it has passed. Generally speaking, we do that; I think we always do that. What is so unusual about this aspect is that the Government have already been defeated on two occasions, and therefore this is the third occasion on which we are dealing with this matter.
</p>

<a name="60315-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>In this context, perhaps I may make three points. First, I think the House should proceed with caution and should deal with matters as controversial as this only when they are very few in number. This is the first <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1245"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1245</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

time in this Session that we have come to an issue of this kind. Secondly, we should proceed only on an issue where there is good deal of public support for what this House is doing. Thirdly, we should not proceed if there are issues to do with the Salisbury convention. My noble friend and the Government may disagree about the use of the Salisbury convention; I am entirely satisfied that there are no Salisbury convention implications if the House were to return this small point back to another place.
</p>

<a name="60315-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Let us look at the Parliament Act. The Government, in the House of Commons, have three choices: They can accept the will of this House, the amendment proffered by your Lordships; or they can amend it and seek some form of compromise. I must say that the ability to find a compromise between &quot;may&quot; and &quot;must&quot; is relatively limited, but there are great minds in the Home Office&#151;perhaps they can find a way around this impasse. I am sure my noble friend Lady Anelay and, in another place, my right honourable friend David Davis would be very glad to meet the Home Office to discuss such a proposal. The third option is to do that which has been recommended by the noble Lord, Lord McNally. They would get their way but they would have to wait to get their Bill through the use of the Parliament Act. I have said many times that using the Parliament Act is a sign of failure of the parliamentary process. It may be that we have got to that stage. I do not think we have got to that stage quite yet. So I have no difficulty in answering the question of the noble Lord, Lord Carter. If the Government regard this as being so important that they should get their way, then the Parliament Act is there to do precisely that.
</p>

<a name="60315-10_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, that was an extremely long intervention. Only one more sentence: it is not the first time this Session, it is the first time since 1949.

<a name="60315-10_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </b>   My Lords, if I had been asked a few weeks ago whether I subscribed to the doctrine advanced by the noble Baroness, I would have had absolutely no hesitation in agreeing with her. It is an intolerable idea that an unelected Chamber should hold up the will of an elected Chamber. However, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, pointed out, the noble Baroness has a skilled ability to move from being conciliatory to being scary. When she is being scary, she tells us that we are going to be elected. Well, roll on the day. Roll on the day that we are going to be elected.

</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60315-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </b>   My Lords, looking at the parliamentary dobbins, and the unelected on the other side, I am not surprised that the noble Baroness takes that attitude. My view is: roll on the day that we are elected. I will tell the noble Baroness that if she likes to wait until that time, the constitutional crisis between this House and the other House will have been nothing compared to what happened before 1688. We will have a real crisis on our hands. I intend to vote vehemently&#151;not only tonight but on any other night that it comes before this House&#151;because I am against it. Furthermore, I am practising for opposition again in this House. I detest this Prime Minister. If I were to knock on doors in Arbroath or Montrose and say to people, &quot;I want to be there, in the House of Lords. I wish to be elected, because I am going to help that nice Mr Blair get his legislation through&quot;. They are going to say, &quot;Oh, no, we want you to get rid of the nasty Mr Blair&quot;. By the time that I am on the third doorstep, I will be changing my tune.

</p>

<a name="60315-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I will not be part of an upper House that will accept a modified power, but I will argue that we ought to have absolutely coextensive powers with those of the House of Commons&#151;if not slightly greater. I anticipate that, if that is what we are being threatened with at that time, we will have an electoral system for this House superior to that for the House of Commons. We will certainly not have any dodgy postal vote system round the country such as we have experienced in the recent past. I warn the noble Baroness that I am not in the least impressed by the argument of an elected Chamber fighting against an unelected Chamber. I am practising for the time that we are going to be elected&#151;with which I am threatened&#151;and so I shall vote.

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="60315-11_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I found the noble and learned Lord&#039;s intervention extraordinary. He will be very cautious about asperity of speech, but I think that he has gone very near its mark.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Let us look at the position that we are in. In response to the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, about my demeanour, I of course thank him for his compliment in relation to charm. I take in good measure the fact that he finds me scary. I do not necessarily think that that is how the whole House finds me, but I am content if it is so.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>The Government do not rely on the Salisbury convention in our arguments; we rely on the fact that the amendments have been rejected twice by the elected House. As my noble friend Lord Carter pointed out, it is noble Lords opposite who are relying on what is&#151;I regret to say&#151;a perverse version of the Salisbury convention, according to which the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1247"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Opposition can ignore the will of the elected House on the basis that they contend that we have not complied with our own manifesto.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, encourages the Government to rely on the Parliament Acts as a mode of general disposal for all our legislation. We need to pause long and hard in relation to that. The reason I say that that is the natural consequence of what he proposes is that, if history continues to repeat itself, this House will find itself in a position similar to this, time and again. We ask the other place to think again, and it does. We repeat our request, and it responds. Sometimes it gives this House huge pleasure when it responds, because it has the wisdom to agree with us. On other occasions, it has the audacity to disagree. It is entitled to its audaciousness because the people of this country elected it and did not elect us. Therefore it is entitled to have its say because, when the time comes, it is its Members&#151;not us&#151;who will go back to the country and say, &quot;I plead for your vote&quot;, and the people of this country will have an opportunity to reject them.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>For so long as our constitution remains as it is, we in this House have the privilege of not suffering the consequences of our own conceit. Therefore, we have to think very carefully as to how our conventions have evolved. The respect in which this House is held is rightly high because we have acted judiciously; that is our history. My noble friend Lord Carter is absolutely right to remind us that this would be the first time since 1949 when we would have departed from that.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, sought to suggest that this was really only a tiny little amendment, of no fundamental consequence. In case there is any misunderstanding, this is one of the most fundamental clauses in the Bill. The reason that it is of fundamental importance is that it goes to the very root of how we have constructed the way in which ID cards will be implemented. It goes to costs, in terms of facilities. We need to understand its very nature.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, spoke about Sweden, Finland and Denmark. I say to him that we have to remember that they have compulsory population registers. That is what we were talking about: the register. That is an important consideration.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Looking at the other issues that have been raised, I was taken aback that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, talked about abandonment of policies. I was trying to count in my mind how many policies noble Lords opposite have now abandoned&#151;immigration policy, selective education, health passports and opposition to student fees. I would respectfully invite the noble Baroness to remember that the current leadership of her party has very little connection with that which went before. We have not abandoned these provisions or the way in which we dealt with this matter. We have affirmed and confirmed that what we said we were going to do we are about to do.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I invite noble Lords to give real weight to what was said by the right reverend Prelate, who, if I may respectfully say so, expressed himself with great <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1248"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1248</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clarity, proportion and balance. My noble friend Lord Peston was right in his powerful intervention to remind the House of what our role is. The comments of my noble friends Lord Richard and Lord Barnett were also right. They have the sagacity to guide us, and I think that we should listen carefully.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>We now have to make a decision. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, talked about a major difference. On driving licences, we already have a provision that if one fails to notify a change of address, a &#163;1,000 fine is liable. We know that that is the case. On these provisions, I remind your Lordships that the scheme that will operate under the first stage differs from the compulsory stage. We have already said that those matters are to be returned to. I will not again go through, as I did last time, the difference between the database and the information you have to provide for ID cards. I set it out on the previous occasion&#151;I remind your Lordships that there are very few differences indeed.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>We have once again had the privilege of having a very extensive debate. One has to ask just a couple of questions. What is new in the arguments that we have explored today and which differs from the two occasions when we discussed the matter before? If the noble Baroness opposite succeeds in the vote, we propose to ask the other place to think again, but on what basis? What is the new fact that they have failed to give adequate consideration to on the previous occasion that we are inviting them to consider again? I have not detected one. In that case, are we simply going to ask them again and again and again, until they&#151;and, frankly, we&#151;lose the will to continue?
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>I hear reference to &quot;the will to live&quot;, but I know that this House is more resilient. For as long as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, stays in his place, we can all know that we have a long journey yet to make.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I know that noble Lords enjoy these debates, but there is a time when we have to come to an end. I hope that we have now absolutely exhausted ourselves in relation to this issue and that we will not have to return to it again&#151;and we will not trouble the other place to shout even louder than on the two occasions that they have said &quot;no&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I propose that we now conclude and that this matter should not be pressed to a vote; if it is, I invite noble Lords to vote for this House&#039;s reputation and to vote for the other place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="60315-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, the first thing to clarify is that, because the other place gave an amendment in lieu and did not simply reject our amendment, we are not at the end of the road. That may depress many of your Lordships, but I provide that information as a matter of fact.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The other thing worth saying is that last Monday, the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, in levelling his defence against our proposal to make the scheme voluntary, did not in any sense call upon the constitutional justification of the Commons&#039; position that has been the mainstay of the noble Baroness&#039;s closing speech and has been the subject of speeches <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1249"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1249</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from various noble Lords. Mr Clarke attempted to justify the Government&#039;s case according to the issues that he raised in the other place&#151;none of them were constitutional issues; they related to the merits and demerits of this Bill. It was those arguments that I sought to address in opening the debate on my Motion.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>It is inevitable, I fear, that there will be repetition in the proceedings as we pursue them under the Parliament Act, because, frankly, the only tools at our disposal are to come back, come back and come back. It is scarcely surprising that there no brand new points were raised in this debate.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>What I accept completely is that this House should not return this measure to the Commons without grave and considered thought. I attempted to say that earlier, and the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, was kind enough to say that he still supported our arguments but, for constitutional reasons, would not support us in the Lobby. In my point that he picked up, I was saying that I believed that this was the exceptional case which did warrant taking the process to its conclusion. That process, as my noble friend Lord McNally said, was put there for a purpose.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The Parliament Act was not legislated for on a whim or without immense care and consideration. There were two elections leading up to it&#151;but what was arrived at gave this place powers that we are now exercising. Apart from the merits of the Bill itself, the only constitutional issue is whether we are right this evening to take this one whole step further&#151;whether we are right to put it back to the Commons in the hope that, even now, it may think again or, at least, may compromise again.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>It is for each and every one of your Lordships to decide whether you think this is such an important matter. The noble Baroness talked about the respect with which this place will be held. Yes, there is a respect issue if we put the matter back to the Commons tonight. But there is another respect issue that is much broader and deeper&#151;whether this Government should be allowed to pursue a measure on a compulsory basis, when they expressly and specifically said that it would be voluntary. I have to tell your Lordships that I have never had such a unanimous mailbag in my eight years here. That is not a long time. I have not had a single representation made by any organisation or individual in support of the Government&#039;s position in making this card compulsory for every citizen.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>However, a great many organisations and individuals have said to me, &quot;Relieve us of a step that we believe will take this wonderful country of ours one pace further along a road down which we do not wish to proceed&quot;. That is a road towards a managerial state, an intrusive state and a surveillance state. We have had a great deal of legislation&#151;I shall not bore noble Lords with it&#151;which has added to those characteristics since this Government came to power.
</p>

<a name="60315-11_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I end by appealing to your Lordships to share with me the sense that this is a Bill of the highest possible importance, the consequences of which will be long <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="60315-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>Page 1, line 7, after &quot;as&quot; insert &quot;the Commission for&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, having listened to a serious debate on what should happen to legislation, we now return to the detail of the wording of this&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="60315-13_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, I wonder whether noble Lords who wish to speak to one another could do so outside. We are unable to hear the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith.
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="60315-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I shall move a little closer to the microphone, which might help.
</p>

<a name="60315-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Having dealt with high principles, the future of the House and a few other things in a debate that descended somewhat from my perspective, we now return to the detail of a Bill. In this group of amendments, we come to what we should be doing when we draft legislation. I am talking about the use of the English language and precision in the meaning of Bills.
</p>

<a name="60315-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>Part 1 of the Bill is entitled:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;Natural England and the Commission for Rural Communities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>That could be read all sorts of ways. It is very imprecise and it could be positively misleading. It could perfectly properly be saying that Natural England is a function of the Commission for Rural Communities, but that is not what the Bill is about at all. One has to read the script following on from that title to find out what this is about. I therefore have a problem with the use of this brand-name title for Natural England.
</p>

<a name="60315-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>I know that the Minister will say that the predecessor organisations have chosen the name. They are perfectly entitled to have their say, but we are not dictating what they should call themselves but, in effect, we are writing their birth certificate. I have a birth certificate and, from time to time, I am called on to produce it to prove who I am, say, in a legal matter or sometimes in matters concerned with the Government. Nothing that appears on my birth certificate includes anything that I am normally called. That may seem to be a mystery, but it is no less a fact. I am called &quot;Bill&quot; by most of my close colleagues and that name does not appear on my birth certificate, and I am called &quot;Lord Dixon-Smith&quot; on more formal occasions and that does not appear on my birth certificate, but everyone knows perfectly well who I am.
</p>

<a name="60315-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The title &quot;Natural England&quot; is not a natural title; Natural England is not a natural body. It is a wholly artificial creation; it is a government agency. For the life of me, I cannot see why we do not call it that. Of course, if subsequently it decides that it wants to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1254"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1254</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

called by some abbreviated name, that is perfectly all right and it can do that. Here we are dealing with legislation which should be both precise and clear. That is precisely what Part 1 of the Bill is not. I am sorry that it takes a group of 90 amendments to rectify the situation. Once again, I give my thanks to the Public Bill Office for its help in deciding all the places the Bill has to be amended so that it should appear before us in proper English, in a manner that can be understood.
</p>

<a name="60315-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>When we discussed this matter in Committee, I put forward two different titles. This time I have put forward only one title. We should be consistent in what we are doing. I think Natural England should be called &quot;Commission for Natural England&quot;. That would precisely describe what it is, an entirely human organisation, an entirely human creation, a government agency, or whatever one chooses to call it. &quot;Commission for Natural England and the Commission for Rural Communities&quot; would be a consistent and understandable title for Part 1 of the Bill. In my view,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;Natural England and the Commission for Rural Communities&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>is certainly very unclear and not an appropriate title to appear in legislation. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="60315-13_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I support my noble friend in his comments. I did so in Committee and do so again on Report.
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="60315-13_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, we debated this matter in Committee. It would be a shame, when the Bill becomes an Act, if we sent this extremely important body into the world with a risible title. As I said in Committee&#151;these are true stories&#151;I mentioned this name to someone, who said that it sounded like a brand of yoghurt. The other day, I tried it on someone else, who said that it sounded like a health farm. The letter that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, read out said it all; if we have the Commission for Rural Communities, why on earth can we not have the commission for natural England?
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="60315-13_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  My Lords, we thought long about the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and by other noble Lords in Committee, about the name of the new body, but we still believe that the name Natural England and its strapline, &quot;For people, places and nature&quot;, best sum up what this agency is to be about&#151;conserving and enhancing for us all to enjoy, now and in the future, the national treasure that is England&#039;s natural environment.
</p>

<a name="60315-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I remind the House that the name was proposed by the chairman of the three predecessor organisations&#151;namely, the Countryside Agency, English Nature, and the Rural Development Service&#151;following consultation with the staff of these organisations and their partners, and it has their support. That final point may be of some importance at a time of what will be substantial change for all those working in those organisations. It is the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1255"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1255</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

name they are now used to. There are no established rules about whether the names of non-departmental public bodies should include the word commission, agency, council or executive. Although there is a tendency for commissions to be mainly advisory bodies rather than executive bodies, even this simple distinction has not been applied consistently.
</p>

<a name="60315-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>We favour the simplicity of Natural England for two reasons. First, the many customers and organisations with which it deals will shorten its title to Natural England. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, conceded that. Whatever formal name it is given in statute, there is a good argument for aligning its legal title with the name by which it is known. Secondly, it will help people to position it in relation to two important sister organisations&#151;English Heritage and Sport England. On that pragmatic basis, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="60315-13_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, am I correct that the Minister said that the name was consulted on only within the department and the predecessor organisations, and that there was no outside consultation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="60315-13_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I said that the consultation was with the staff of the organisations and their partners&#151;those organisations being the Countryside Agency, English Nature and the Rural Development Service. I went on to say that it had the support of the staff as well as the chairman.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="60315-13_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, it seems that we have a difficulty. The Minister has said that there are two case precedents where people have used this sort of abbreviated title, but I still rather fancy that it is bad use of the English language and bad use of legislation, and I would prefer not to see it there. I am not sure that we can take the argument any further. There is only one way of resolving the matter; either I withdraw my amendment or I press it to a vote. If I withdraw it, I might feel inclined to bring it back at Third Reading after further discussions. I think perhaps that I will do that. The noble Baroness is looking concerned, so maybe I could not do that. If I cannot do that, perhaps the best thing to do would be to get it out of the way. I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<a name="60315-14_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Byford </b>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1258"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1258</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

&quot;(   )   The functions of the Rural Development Service are divided between the Regional Development Agencies and Natural England.&quot;

<p><a name="st_142"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment deals again with the Rural Development Service. In Committee, the Minister stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;A large part of the Rural Development Service&#039;s functions, including the delivery of the agri-environment schemes . . . will be the responsibility of Natural England&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 24/1/06; col. 1101.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>He also said that it was neither legally necessary nor appropriate to mention that fact in the Bill. At that time, we agreed to disagree with him.
</p>

<a name="60315-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Our main reason for bringing this issue back on Report is because of the doubts surrounding the funding of Natural England. The money that goes out of the door in the form of agri-environment scheme funding is presumably not in question. It will be what it will be, and will be made available either via Defra or directly from the Treasury. We do not know. Perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to disabuse me if I have got it wrong.
</p>

<a name="60315-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>The money that enables Natural England to administer the schemes is, however, a rather different matter. If there is no reference to the transfer of responsibilities, will the necessary funding be made available at the same level as when the task was part of the RDS? Or will there be discussions about how many staff are needed and which computer hardware or software is required? Or will they all be transferred? How much will be devoted to the accountancy systems which are, presumably, fairly sophisticated?
</p>

<a name="60315-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>It seems fairly well accepted that the Government are trying to cut back on expenditure wherever possible. Part of that is simply reducing the funding that they allow for certain items&#151;national parks, for example, as we discussed in Committee&#151;and of shifting responsibility for the delivery away from government to, for instance, local authorities. An example of the latter is the Chancellor&#039;s promise of free local transport for the over-60s, for example, which has resulted in some councils having to consider raising council tax by up to 2 per cent. We should not like to see the delivery of agri-environment schemes compromised by lack of funds.
</p>

<a name="60315-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>I refer to the Minister&#039;s letter to me of 29 January, as it underlines my concern. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;Following the Curry Commission recommendations, the Government has made clear its desire to shift resources by modulating . . . funds from Pillar 1 subsidies to Pillar 2. The UK has been at the forefront of voluntary modulation for several years. It is true that modulation will have an effect on the amount of subsidy that farmers receive but our industry has remained amongst the most competitive and sustainable in the EU. The agreement reached also provides for the possibility to allow transfers of up to 20% of Pillar 1 funds to Pillar 2. There is a provision in the agreement which allows Member States to choose whether or not to co-finance transferred funds, adding incentive to transfer funds to rural development&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>However, the letter goes on clearly to state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;No decision has yet been taken about whether the Government will match-fund additional transfers from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. It is clear that the decision reached will have an effect on the amount of funds needed to transfer to deliver rural development, including the agri-environment programme&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<a name="60315-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>That is why I have returned to the matter today. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="60315-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches have concerns such as those expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. Funding is an issue. We are aware that Defra is under extreme pressure in terms of funding. One of the reasons I was unable to support the previous amendments was my fear that a lot of expense in reprinting letter headings and so on would be entailed. Funding is an issue. This is an interesting question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="60315-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Monro of Langholm: </b>   My Lords, I apologise for missing the earlier stages of the Bill, which was a great disappointment to me. I declare an interest as the Minister who oversaw the Wildlife and Countryside Act and who was responsible for rural affairs in this country. I support the amendment because the Government seem to be obsessed with commissions, committees and agencies. The more that can be spelt out clearly, the easier it will be for those who live and work in the countryside. It is an absolute headache to discover which authority to go to, particularly where local councils are involved. The amendment gives us an opportunity to spell out exactly where certain sums of money will be placed. Any form of clarification in this world that has now become so complex is an advantage to those who try to earn a living in the countryside, which I assure noble Lords is a jolly difficult undertaking at the moment. I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="60315-14_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, this amendment seeks to clarify the position of the Rural Development Service. It is not a separate legal entity from Defra. It is neither legally necessary nor appropriate to mention that in the Bill. It is, however, appropriate to provide that clarification in the Explanatory Notes and I have already given assurances that we will seek to do so.
</p>

<a name="60315-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The noble Baroness was right that the RDAs will take responsibility for socio-economic funding, as we made clear in the Rural Strategy 2004, though this will be effected by means of the RDAs&#039; own powers and changes to secondary legislation, which do not need to be mentioned in the Bill. So the EU rural development regulation schemes that are run by the RDS, such as vocational training, processing and marketing grants and rural enterprise grants, will in future be administered by the RDAs.
</p>

<a name="60315-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The large part of the RDS functions, including the delivery of agri-environment schemes, will be the responsibility of Natural England, as the noble Baroness recognised. Chapter 1 of Part 8, which relates to powers to enter into delegation agreements, provides a mechanism to delegate RDS functions. We expect to use those powers for some of the RDS functions. Others will be managed by changes to secondary legislation or using Natural England&#039;s own <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1260"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1260</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

powers conferred by the Bill, such as the power to enter into management agreements that is established by Clause 7.
</p>

<a name="60315-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>It is a pleasure to see the noble Lord, Lord Monro, back in his place. We missed him at earlier stages of the Bill. I accept fully his point about the difficulties facing those who seek to earn a living in agriculture and the countryside. It is our intention in this Bill to make the system easier for people to understand. With regard to agri-environment, it is difficult to say anything more about funding. The agri-environment budgets for 2007 are still being discussed with the EU. It is much too soon to make decisions on items such as match funding while that is going on.

</p>

<a name="60315-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>For the constituent bodies of Natural England, the Government intend that the outcome sought and the level of programme funding for 2005-06 to 2007-08 will be set out in their approved corporate plans. This year&#039;s programme funding for those constituent bodies will be &#163;246 million. Future budgets will be set by the Secretary of State as part of corporate planning rounds.
</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="60315-14_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way. I think she was saying that the budget for the Countryside Agency in the year ahead would be &#163;246 million. Can she remind us what the budget for that agency was in the present year, which is nearly past?
</p>




<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="60315-14_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, I hope that inspiration might come to me in answering that question. It is possible that I shall get help; I do seek to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, if possible.
</p>

<a name="60315-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Returning to the future, Natural England&#039;s budget will be set by the Secretary of State while its future services, programmes and priorities will be a matter for its board, when established, in consultation with Ministers as part of the corporate planning round. I am delighted to be able to tell the noble Lord now that &#163;65 million is currently the approximate Countryside Agency budget. I have no absolutely detailed figures, but it is in that region. With these reassurances, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="60315-14_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, while I thank the Minister for her response, I believe she would accept that I am still quite concerned for the long-term. In her reply, she mentioned that some responsibility would go down to the RDAs and that some things would be done through secondary legislation. Can she share with the House what sort of things would come in secondary legislation? If not, I should be grateful if she could come back to me on that between now and Third Reading.

&quot;(   )   action in the countryside to assist the containment of global warming,&quot;

<p><a name="st_152"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Bill is clear that the purposes of Natural England are all to do with conservation, protection and preservation. That is absolutely fine, so far as it goes. It means that Natural England, with the Bill as presently drafted, is concerned with the past. My amendment seeks to make part of its functions


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;to assist the containment of global warming&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Global warming is the present; its more pernicious effects are the future. So, in a sense this little amendment&#151;so simple and plain&#151;brings the past and future together for once. It is here and now that they meet. If we consider global warming, the news is consistently bad. We have just heard that global atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased to its highest level ever. Well, we knew that it was going up, so every year will be the highest; more disconcerting is that it is now also rising at its most rapid annual rate ever.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>The polar ice-caps are breaking up and melting; they are not reforming in winter as they used to. In countries like Switzerland, the glaciers are retreating. At the weekend, I spoke to someone who lives in Switzerland, I asked how the glaciers were being affected. He said that a track that he used to go up 25 years ago to visit a bar that used to be on the edge of the ice is now 40 feet above it. The track itself is dangerous as a result. If you miss your footing there is a 40-foot fall. We have recently had reports of increasing acidification in the oceans due to carbon dioxide absorption. That will damage the reproduction of shellfish, plankton and corals; more importantly, if they are unable to make their shells&#151;which lock up carbon in the form of calcium carbonate&#151;then we restrict the sea&#039;s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. As I have said, the problem of global warming is consistently worsening.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>Many things can be done. When I last introduced this amendment, I suggested the word &quot;development&quot; to assist the containment of global warming in the countryside. That did not find favour, so this time I have used the word &quot;action&quot;, which describes nothing in particular yet could be vital in one particular respect. An interesting research paper was published in <i>Science</i> in 2004, entitled <i>Stabilization <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1262"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1262</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies. </i>One of the writers&#039; options was forest management; they suggested the planting of large areas of forests in temperate areas. Another was agricultural soils management. Those are both existing technologies; as things which occur in the countryside, they are actions which Natural England could perfectly well participate in and promote.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I make no apology for bringing forward this amendment. It is important that we get global warming under control for, if we do not, we have no certainty of being able to preserve anything in our present countryside. Two possibilities are being talked about. One is that the Gulf Stream&#151;which produces the equivalent energy around our islands of 30,000 power stations providing heat for us&#151;will cease to flow. If it does, ours becomes more akin to a Nordic climate. The alternative is that warming continues without that effect; if that happens, then we go to a more Mediterranean kind of climate. In both eventualities the continuation of the countryside, as we know it, will not be happening. Natural England will then have an impossible task.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>So, I make no apology for bringing back the amendment. As I said initially, the past and future have to meet somewhere. They are meeting here and now. I beg to move.

<a name="60315-15_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, on this amendment. The Bill is called the natural environment Bill. We know that global warming is the biggest threat not only to our natural environment but to our very future. I do not wish to rehearse the arguments that the noble Lord so eloquently put as to why that needs to be addressed. I believe that Natural England as much, and probably more, than most agencies, needs to be in the forefront of addressing these issues, particularly with regard to adaptation.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>My one small regret might be that we have not saved our voting energies. I have no idea whether the noble Lord will test the opinion of the House, but if we were to vote, we should have saved our energies for this amendment rather than the one on names. The issue that he raises is extremely important and I hope that the Government look kindly on including something in the Bill with reference to this important issue.

<a name="60315-15_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   My Lords, I support my noble friend&#039;s amendment, in principle at any rate. He has given us a vivid description of the consequences of not coming to terms with the difficulties of global warming. I have no doubts on that matter at all. I have the honour sitting on Sub-Committee D under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Renton of Mount Harry. In a report that we produced on the EU Commission&#039;s trading scheme, we looked very carefully at the matter, and it became abundantly clear to us as the report proceeded that the problems of global warming are enormous. As my noble friend rightly said, the latest figures are frightening.

<a name="60315-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>We all have a huge responsibility to deal with this issue. Whether the amendment gives a remit too far to Natural England within this Bill is a moot point&#151;and, looking at the Minister, I am pretty convinced that that is what he is going to say. He may well have a point. But in principle I entirely support what my noble friend has said&#151;and I think that the Minister would have to come forward with a very convincing argument not to support the amendment. But I shall listen carefully to what he has to say.
</p>




<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="60315-15_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I support my noble friend in his desire to have a wake-up call on the needs of not only conserving and preserving the countryside, but also to look at the effect that climate change will have on that very countryside.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 49 to 52, which are in the group. Amendment No. 49 raises an issue again, but with a subtle difference. We believe that this amendment would improve greatly Natural England&#039;s natural purpose clause. The amendment would replace &quot;conserve&quot; with &quot;protect&quot;. The difference between the two words is crucial; the word &quot;protect&quot; defines an active stance and, in the opinion of the CPRE standing council it makes the legal difference by placing a duty on Natural England actively to protect the landscape. In contrast, the word &quot;conserve&quot; defines a more passive stance, whereby the status quo is kept intact without a really active engagement.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, stated that, although the word &quot;protect&quot; is used in reference to biodiversity, it would not be applicable to landscape. She went on to say that using the word &quot;protecting&quot; in relation to biodiversity would prevent any,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;claims that Natural England should support activities that may enhance biodiversity adversely&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 30/1/06; col. 118.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>She said that she had no intention of weakening that position. But she stated, too, that biodiversity and landscape were on an equal playing field and that one was not more important than the other. So it is not clear to me why they cannot be treated with the same terminology.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Further to this, in the Government&#039;s documents, the necessity is pointed out of using the word &quot;protect&quot;. The Planning Policy Statement 7, published in 2004, in one of its key aims states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;The Government&#039;s objectives for rural areas are to raise the quality of life and the environment in rural areas through the promotion of the continued protection of the open countryside for the benefit of all, with the highest level of protection for our most valued landscapes and environmental resources&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>We believe that our amendment would ensure the future sustainability of the landscape but, in the light of that statement, it seems a sensible addition to the Bill that would join up the Government&#039;s aims in protecting the landscape across the board.

</p>

<a name="60315-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Referring again to the PPS7, and enlarging on it, as it is the Government&#039;s official planning policy, under their key principles on page 7, under 1(iv), they say that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;the Government&#039;s overall aim is to protect the countryside for the sake of its intrinsic character and beauty, the diversity of its landscapes, heritage and wildlife, the wealth of its natural resources and so it may be enjoyed by all&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>It therefore seems curious to us, and to the CPRE, that reference in the planning policy for local authorities should be stronger than that in Natural England&#039;s statutory duty, which I have to say I still find puzzling.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Our next two amendments seek to leave out &quot;in other ways&quot; in one case and, in the other, to leave out,


</p>

<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;supporting rural communities in furtherance of&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Paragraphs (a) and (d) of subsection (2) contain fairly robust aims. I am sure that we would agree exactly what, for example,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;conserving and enhancing the landscape&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>involves. &quot;Protecting biodiversity&quot; or &quot;encouraging open-air recreation&quot; are concepts that we can all comprehend, and some of your Lordships have great skills to ensure that those sorts of plans are implemented.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>After that, &quot;contributing in other ways&quot; seems rather vague and wishy-washy and, I would have thought, difficult to justify. Our suggestion for improvement is twofold: either simply to leave out &quot;in other ways&quot; or to reiterate Natural England&#039;s affinity with the countryside by giving it a duty to support the work of rural communities in improving their social and economic well-being. I am sure that I am not the only one in this House who receives a constant and unrelenting stream of correspondence from people and organisations who consider that I can be of assistance in their efforts to improve social justice and the workings of the DWP, and the performance of a whole range of service providers, including the protection of our small post offices. It is quite clear that all is not well in our villages, small towns and in our countryside. Nor is it at all well, by any means, for there to be the continuing and growing problems of fly-tipping, litter and the flouting of planning laws, which obviously brings additional difficulties.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>We had a long debate on the substance of Amendment No. 52 in Committee. I said then, and I shall say again, that this is perhaps one of the most important amendments&#151;and it is a matter of balance. I was grateful for the wide range of support that I received from noble Lords when we dealt with the matter in Committee. Some noble Lords suggested that our amendment might be more effective if it had been slightly redrafted. Having gone through the record for those days, I have come back with a slightly different wording, which I hope will encourage noble Lords&#039; continued support and perhaps gain support from others.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1265"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1265</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>The amendment is quite clear now. It is only in the event of significant conflict that Natural England would have to prioritise its objectives relating to conservation and the environment. The Minister said in Committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;Instances of irreconcilable conflict between access and conservation are rare in practice&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 1/2/06; col. 258.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>That is the basis of introducing a conflict resolution provision&#151;that it will be used only in those rare instances when Natural England and those other organisations are in a check mate situation. The amendment is emphatically not about giving an environment conservation priority on a day-to-day basis&#151;and I stress that&#151;or in giving conservation automatic precedence or a greater funding priority. I am only well aware that sustainable development is dependent not only on conserving the environment but on the social and economic factors as well.

</p>

<a name="60315-15_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Natural England will be one among many. It is far from the only organisation that will be involved in the process of the decision-making or in resolving conflicts of interest. I am sure that in 99.9 per cent of instances that irreconcilable conflict would associate only with proposals by third parties rather than within Natural England itself. Natural England might be involved as a consultee or a stakeholder in the case of development of a policy or management proposal. The Minister made the point in Committee that no other organisation with statutory duty for conservation had a conflict resolution clause. I suggest that no other organisation has been given such a broad remit.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The Minister mentioned the Environment Agency, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Countryside Agency. When established, however, Natural England will be the sole statutory body for England charged with defending and enhancing the natural environment. It is concerned with all the issues that those agencies cover, and much more. It is precisely because of the contradictory nature of the definition that we believe this amendment is needed.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The EFRA Select Committee suggested that the conflict resolution and policy implementation would be the job of government offices for the regions, yet at present I understand that those offices do not have the capacity to take on this role. The Minister might clarify that for me. In the absence of that support, Natural England, as the Minister has stated, will be the major champion of the environment, and should have the teeth to implement it. Along those lines, the Minister also gave an indication in Committee that he would undertake to put conflict resolution on the agenda in discussions with the Natural England confederation about statutory guidance. For the interest of other noble Lords, I am grateful to the Minister, Jim Knight, who saw me on Monday this week, along with my honourable friend Jim Pace. He indicated that great thought had been given to this situation.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I know the Minister will come back on this, but for the sake of the House I will repeat what was said in the letter sent to me on 13 March on conflict resolution:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1266"></a>

</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>they have given it consideration&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;and concluded that it would meet several of the concerns expressed by noble Lords, while preserving the flexibility and independence of Natural England&#039;s Board which we consider important&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>The Minister should be able to respond to that at this stage.
</p>

<a name="60315-15_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The Minister, Jim Knight, went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;I would stress that the Bill requires draft statutory guidance to be consulted on very widely before being finalised&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-15_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>but he wanted to raise this issue with me. Subsequently the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, has spoken to me, and I understand that circumstances have slightly altered. In fairness to him, and also to Jim Knight, I should make the House aware that I was made aware, at 3 o&#039;clock today, that perhaps there is a change of heart. However, I hope that setting out why we think our amendment is important reflects the position we find ourselves in at this moment. I end up by having supported my noble friend in his amendment, and spoken to the other amendments standing in my name in this group.

<a name="60315-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </b>   My Lords, I stand to support Amendment No. 52. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising the letter from Mr Jim Knight which was also copied to a number of us with an interest in this issue. The letter, dated 13 March, also kindly gave us a draft text of guidance that could have dealt with the issue of conflict resolution, and indeed was very much in line with the position I proposed in Committee, which I hoped the Minister was taking away. I was therefore pleased to see a copy of the letter, though I was a bit downcast when I learnt, round about 5.35 tonight, that the letter had been passed over and was no longer the Government&#039;s intention. I know a week is meant to be a long time in politics, but it appears that two days is now a pretty long time. I am confused about what the Government&#039;s position on conflict resolution will be. I understand that we are not to expect that guidance will be forthcoming on this issue and so I want to talk to the substantive issue of the amendment, which would not have been necessary if guidance had been promised.
</p>

<a name="60315-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>I will use the briefing that many of your Lordships will have received from the Country Land and Business Association in relation to this amendment. The association gave an example where it thought it would be inappropriate for there to be guidance or anything on the face of the Bill saying that conservation and landscape should take precedence in extreme circumstances where there is no means of reconciling them and they are of a serious nature. It took the strange example of a person running a tourist attraction in an SSSI who wanted to develop visitor facilities in the midst of the site, the construction of which would be detrimental to the provisions of the SSSI. The association went on to say that if the amendment were adopted, Natural England would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1267"></a>

have no possibility of allowing that development to go ahead. It said that there might be perfectly good grounds for allowing it to go ahead and that,

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;creating a couple of jobs and bringing in a bit of money for the landowner which could be reinvested in the area, may well do more for achieving the general purpose than a refusal&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I remind your Lordships that SSSIs are a very small proportion of the land surface of this country. They are the jewels in the crown of nature conservation, the most priceless and irreplaceable parts of our natural heritage. This briefing was equivalent to saying that you might carve a bit out of a Vermeer or a Picasso so a few local artists would have some canvas to paint on to keep them from going to the wall. That is not quite what we are looking for as the steer for what the Minister at another time called the &quot;trenchant champion&quot; of the natural environment, but it is a good example of the sort of pressure Natural England will undoubtedly face on a daily basis, and shows why the Minister needs at least to give it guidance, if not to put a conflict resolution clause on the face of the Bill. I know he will say that he has already said, I think on Second Reading, that protected sites will of course take priority, but it is clear that there will continue to be debate about what takes priority when economic development and conservation and landscape are in conflict with each other.
</p>

<a name="60315-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>I would have been extremely happy if the Minister had underpinned his wish that Natural England be a trenchant champion of the natural environment by giving it the sort of guidance that it was indicated to us on Monday would be given. Now that it will not be given, there is a real need for Amendment No. 52, and I hope the noble Baroness will divide the House on this.
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="60315-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Cameron of Dillington: </b>   My Lords, I too rise to talk about Amendment No. 52, and I am afraid I would like to oppose it. When we discussed this issue in Committee, I was totally agnostic on the subject. I was duly persuaded by the arguments of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and others who supported her. I was drifting along, waiting to be persuaded back into my state of agnosticism by the Minister&#039;s reply. However, it was the speech of my friend and fellow Cross-Bencher, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, that suddenly tipped the balance for me. She mentioned that if a conflict clause had existed for the relevant body, it would have been impossible for the funicular railway to have been built up the Cairngorms.
</p>

<a name="60315-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>That set me thinking. I love mountains, and I think there is nothing more uplifting than to stand at the top of a mountain to look down at the valleys or glens below. If I had to choose one mountain where the old, the infirm, the disabled and the very young should be able to have that uplifting experience, I would choose Cairngorm. In my view, Cairngorm Mountain is already environmentally prejudiced by the fact that it has skiers and mountaineers all over it in winter and&#151;in the case of mountaineers&#151;for most of the summer. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1268"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1268</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

It already has ski lifts and its slopes have been cosmetically altered, shall we say, for skiers. It already has road infrastructure; it already has a thumping great big car park halfway up the mountain; and it already has the Sheiling restaurant to give meals and shelter from rough weather to skiers, both winter and summer. Furthermore, there are thousands of jobs around Aviemore that depend on this particular very longstanding tourist attraction being open for as many days as possible in a year. When I say longstanding, I mean that I first went skiing there 48 years ago. I admit that the Cairngorm Mountain is indeed slightly environmentally worse off on account of the funicular. In the context of the hundreds of Munros in England and Scotland, however, it would seem fair to let this already slightly, or quite, environmentally damaged mountain suffer the fate of being chosen to allow as many people as possible to stand on the viewing platform and look down the slopes below.
</p>

<a name="60315-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Now, if my noble friend Lady Young and I were on the committee deciding whether to permit this funicular, I am sure we would have a very good discussion. I am equally sure that, with her diplomatic prowess and powers of persuasion, I would probably get handbagged and lose the debate. The point is that I do not believe it is any business of Parliament to predetermine that decision for us. There could be many hypothetical examples where there might be minor environmental downsides on a local scale which, with a conflict clause, could be used to achieve some fairly perverse decisions.
</p>

<a name="60315-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>I strongly support the independence of Natural England and the CRC. But I believe that both we and government have to be bold and allow them to make their own decisions without trying to second-guess them in advance. That is why I do not believe that this conflict clause&#151;even expressed in its new, moderated terms&#151;is a very good idea.

I am not sure that I agree with my noble friend Lord Cameron on the Cairngorms, but he makes a point. I was quite happy with the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment when I saw it on the Marshalled List at the beginning of the week. It seemed to me that she had got it about right and that she had got the point about irreconcilability. Irreconcilability is the point. If you have something and you want something else, these things may be mutually incompatible. There is a question about the Cairngorms that one might argue on that front. But I thought that the noble Baroness had got it about right, including the magic word &quot;irreconcilable&quot;. Then, this morning, I got a copy of the letter from Jim Knight to the noble Baroness and I thought there was something to be said for a bit of flexibility in what is a difficult issue. So I was most interested in what the Minister was going to say. Now I hear from others, who obviously know more than I do about what is going on, that the letter seems to have been withdrawn. Whether the noble Baroness will press her amendment to a Division tonight rather depends on what the <br>&nbsp;<br>

Minister will say. It may make sense to press it not tonight but at Third Reading. It is not easy when you receive a letter in the morning and then find, by half past six in the afternoon, that it has apparently been withdrawn or that something else has happened.
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="60315-16_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I could make a general point. When we have a group of amendments, Members are expected to speak only once prior to the Minister speaking. I know that at least two noble Lords have got caught in this trap, having spoken earlier to this group of amendments. Perhaps we could be flexible in this group and rather strict beyond this group.

<a name="60315-16_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, having spoken to the amendment of my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith, perhaps I could now speak to Amendments Nos. 50 and 52&#151;in the name of my noble friend Lady Byford in the case of Amendment No. 50, and the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in the case of Amendment No. 52.
</p>

<a name="60315-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Before doing so&#151;it was an error on my part&#151;I should have declared an interest when I last spoke. I own land in the north of England. Briefly, I have great sympathy for Amendment No. 50 and would support it. However, in exactly the same way that the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, has just expressed it, I have difficulty with Amendment No. 52. This new body, Natural England, will have to decide how best to carry out its responsibilities under the general purposes clause of the Bill. Clearly, Natural England&#039;s brief is principally one of promoting nature conservation. I believe that that is absolutely right and proper. I think it is very important that, notwithstanding Amendment. No. 50, Clause 2(2)(e) includes the opportunity for Natural England to contribute in other ways,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;to social and economic well-being through management of the natural environment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>That will require a delicate balance. Indeed, I supported an amendment in Committee in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, which would have substituted Clause 2(2)(e) with a somewhat stronger socio-economic remit. We felt that there is a danger that some rural economic activities could be unnecessarily compromised by the general purposes clause.
</p>

<a name="60315-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I think I am right in saying that my noble friend Lady Byford supported this amendment. That being the case, it is perhaps a little surprising that she has moved this conflict resolution amendment which would virtually destroy any degree of latitude or compromise in Natural England&#039;s operations. I fully understand and appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment, but sustainable development is not always about conservation of the natural environment in isolation. Economic and social issues are often intertwined and cannot be regarded in isolation.

example, you had a large upland SSSI on which a farmer or a land manager wanted to insert a track that might enhance the actual management of that area with benefits to the nature conservation value of the site, then, under my noble friend&#039;s amendment, I do not think that Natural England would have any option but to say no. So this choice, this delicate balance, which is so vital to the success of Natural England, cannot be compromised. I appreciate that my noble friend&#039;s amendment will deal only with what she described as &quot;significant cases&quot;, but we have all seen it in practice. At a local level, small decisions can suddenly become increasingly significant. So I hope that my noble friend will not press her amendment. I have had the pleasure of working with her very closely on rural matters for many years and I do not think I have ever had a real disagreement with her. However, on this occasion, I am bound to say that if she were to press her amendment, I would have no option but to vote against it.

<a name="60315-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Grantchester: </b>   My Lords, I also speak against Amendment No. 52. Following the line of thought of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, Natural England must be allowed to build its own reputation. It must be allowed to look at every instance on its own merits and decide accordingly. Under the Bill, Natural England is obligated to decide how best to achieve its general purpose, taking into account all the issues. On many occasions, it will naturally take the view that nature conservation is the most appropriate way forward. There is no reason why that should always be the case. That is why it is important that no resolution is put forward that mandates how it should decide each case. I have great difficulty also trying to understand how it will be decided what is irreconcilable on any occasion.

<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="60315-17_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, for digging me out of the hole I had got into by speaking only to the first amendment.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>My name is attached to Amendment No. 50 because, especially for the most deeply rural communities, there will be many occasions on which that power and duty of Natural England&#039;s needs to be strengthened. Because of their remoteness, they will have a lot more to do with Natural England; we have frequently rehearsed the issues of sparsity, and I will not do so now. The sort of wording in Amendment No. 50 is important for the agency.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I move on to Amendment No. 52. I have to admit that I have tussled hard with the issue, and listened carefully in Committee to the arguments. I have a lot of sympathy with the &quot;jewels in our crown&quot; argument of the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone. However, I arrive at the difficulty that some areas have an awful lot of jewels&#151;they tend to be concentrated into some areas. That is fantastic for those areas, but it means that the chances for any social and economic development will be massively reduced. There is no perfect answer to that. It is virtually a free-vote issue, if it comes to a vote. It is not an issue on which one can align oneself except by one&#039;s own best judgment; <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1271"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1271</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I certainly do not see it as party political. On it, we should leave Natural England the freedom to assess every case on its merits. I am sure that every difficult case will be difficult to assess, and the quality of Natural England&#039;s board will very much be reflected by its ability to tussle with such difficult issues. I do not believe that we can legislate on the matter, much as we might like to safeguard the environmental future of our countryside and environment. Therefore, I will not be able to support Amendment No. 52.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="60315-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Greenway: </b>   My Lords, I also oppose Amendment No. 52. I was not present in Committee when we debated a similar amendment, but I made my feelings clear at an earlier stage in Committee when I said that I opposed any effort to write the Sandford principle into the Bill. It is most important that we retain a balance between the different interests, which conflict from time to time. We must also remember that the remit of Natural England covers urban areas as well as the countryside; that would make the amendment more difficult to work with. Things have been slanted slightly in favour of environmental issues as a result of the habitats directive already; that will have to be taken into account by Natural England.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>I have been intrigued to see that a number of noble Lords who have spoken seem to have changed their mind since Committee. I do not know whether that is because of what the Minister said on that occasion, but I have not changed my mind&#151;I still very much oppose Amendment No. 52. My noble friend Lord Erroll, who was here a moment ago, got called away to host a reception but would also have spoken against Amendment No. 52.

<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="60315-17_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, perhaps surprisingly, I would like to give a word of encouragement to the noble Baroness for her amendment. I get worried when I hear people beginning to talk about the need to retain a balance. That sounds to me like the beginning of the end. Retaining a balance really means, &quot;Come on, let&#039;s be reasonable. There are all these economic and other considerations, and we&#039;ve got to give them serious attention&quot;. My experience suggests that there is never a shortage of advocacy for the immediate material economic arguments. If somebody has an economic, profit-making enterprise at hand, they will be forceful and use every device at their disposal to make sure that their case is heard. Therefore, anything that can be done to underline that the intention of the Bill is to keep within our territory this rare qualitative dimension to our life&#151;it is so essential for the psychological and physical well-being of our people&#151;should be there in specific language.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>However, I am not sure whether it would be appropriate to vote on the amendment tonight. The wording of the Bill is pretty explicit. The Minister seems to be demonstrating that the Government want <br>&nbsp;<br>

to give very clear guidance to Natural England about the responsibilities in the future, so I shall listen with great interest to what he says.

<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="60315-17_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   My Lords, I have not had the opportunity to speak very much on the Bill, for reasons that are probably well known, but I would like to address Amendments Nos. 48, 50 and 52&#151;briefly, as a lot has been said already about them.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Amendment No. 52 is about resolving &quot;irreconcilable conflict&quot; and the &quot;greater weight&quot; being,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;given to those relating to the conservation of the natural environment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>As someone who has lived most of my life in rural areas&#151;albeit remote rural areas&#151;I think that, before one gives the amendment approval, one needs to think about the people and the sustainability of the communities. Young people there in particular may not have the opportunity of employment. I have seen instances where initiatives have been blighted and all hope for school-leavers in some communities has gone with the wind. I have a great deal of sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Cameron. I happened to be working in Scotland at the time of the initiatives in the Cairngorms. They were very much a regeneration of that area, because of a great amount of people leaving it. The initiatives were a flagship commitment of the authorities in Scotland at that time.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>We have an interesting situation at the moment with some of the older initiatives. For example, there was an appalling caf&#233; on top of Snowden. I do not know whether I am allowed to mention it, but the Prince of Wales criticised it. He has not called it a carbuncle, but we are having to build a new caf&#233; 100 years after the old one was built. No doubt the new one will not really be appropriate, but it should be a heck of a lot better.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I shall make a couple of points on the other amendments. I strongly support Amendment No. 48, which is on,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;action in the countryside to assist the containment of global warming&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>That is terribly important. There are a lot of aspects that we do not have time to go into, but I shall speak about one. We will have to look in the future for drought-resistant varieties of crops. We can no longer use North Sea gas to produce nitrogen to produce crops. We will have to go into nitrogen-creating crops such as new varieties of clover, which will actually sustain drought problems and increase production in, and the viability and sustainability of, the countryside. We are cutting back on research and development at present. Is that wise? Some of our research stations are going to lose many of the staff working on such things at the moment. There needs to be a great deal of thought on that.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Amendment No. 50 is very important in supporting rural communities in furtherance of social and development objectives. We have to achieve in the countryside the viability and sustainability of our communities as well as of our environment. This series of amendments is extremely important. We can see that there is variable reaction to some of them&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1273"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1273</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

particularly Amendment No. 52&#151;but I would have thought that most noble Lords could subscribe to Amendments Nos. 48 and 50.

</p>




<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="60315-17_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, we have had another excellent debate around the topic of Natural England&#039;s purposes. I take the view that each of these amendments is quite separate from another, dealing with different issues but on the common topic of Natural England&#039;s purpose. I am quite sure that they are not consequential on each other in any way.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>Before I start addressing the matters that have been spoken about so well&#151;it has been an example of the House of Lords at its best&#151;we are all glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, back in his place. We missed him very much in Committee, although I have a feeling that he will make up for that during the rest of our hearings today and next week.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>So that noble Lords know our view, I say straight away that, although we understand and sympathise with many of the points made today, we do not agree that they should be dealt with in the Bill&#151;with one possible exception, which I will come to in due course.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>As I said in Committee, Natural England&#039;s purpose has been carefully drafted to be broad and enabling and to give Natural England the flexibility and independence to champion the natural environment. At the same time, Natural England is given the responsibility to find ways of doing such things so that wherever possible its environmental work also contributes to social and economic goals and, therefore, to sustainable development.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>Having said that, I have heard some powerful arguments since Committee, not least in today&#039;s debate, and the House may be pleased to hear that I am not going to be dogmatic in considering this clause. Let us look at the amendments in turn.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>The effects of Amendment No. 48, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, would be to make it clear that taking action in the countryside to assist in containing global warming was part of Natural England&#039;s general purpose. No one could be more forthright or eloquent on the subject of global warming than the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and for that the House owes him a debt.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>That climate change is a vital issue is a given. Government expect Natural England, in common with all other public bodies, to play an active role in combating those effects. The issue, as the noble Earl, Lord Peel, put it, is whether this would be a remit too far for Natural England.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>However, climate change has a wide-ranging agenda and one in which, frankly, Natural England would not be the lead player. As a key element of the broader sustainable development agenda, climate change would be an important part of the context in which Natural England operates. There is no doubt that relevant action to mitigate climate change could fall within Natural England&#039;s general purpose, but it will approach it from the point of view of an organisation whose functions, powers and expertise lie in environmental management. The items listed in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1274"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1274</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Clause 2, at subsections (2)(a) to (e), are a selection of the things contained within Natural England&#039;s general purpose. The list could be made very much longer, but that would not necessarily increase its value as a means of clarifying the role of Natural England. Our view is that this amendment falls into that category.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Amendment No. 49 is based upon the premise that the change of wording makes it stronger. I am afraid that I cannot accept that. Indeed, I believe that within the current wording Natural England could do all that the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, suggests.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Since the 1940s, &quot;conserve&quot; has been applied to landscape and natural beauty, including wildlife. References in existing landscape legislation to &quot;conserve&quot; and &quot;enhance&quot; have not curtailed the ability of the Countryside Agency to take action to preserve and/or protect landscapes should that be required. A further point is that neither the agency nor its predecessor, the Countryside Commission, have indicated at any time that they have been restricted by the use of &quot;conserve&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Amendment No. 50 would amend Clause 2(e) to make &quot;rural communities&quot; the focus of Natural England&#039;s efforts to promote,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;social and economic well-being through management of the natural environment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-17_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will recognise that the Government are a passionate supporter of rural communities&#151;the noble Baroness certainly is. That is why the Government are setting up the Commission for Rural Communities.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>However, Natural England&#039;s interests are not confined to communities in rural areas. I believe that the rationale here, if not the wording, is something that we can look at further&#151;to give added impetus to Natural England in its work with and for local communities, both rural and urban. If the noble Baroness will allow me, I am happy to take it away and, if I can find acceptable wording&#151;discussing it with her before&#151;then bring back a government amendment on Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>I was grateful to the noble Baroness for her explanation of Amendment No. 51. We were not sure of the rationale for the amendment, unless it was to make clear that Natural England could also promote social and economic well-being through the carrying out of the other strands of its general purpose. While Natural England can and will, in some cases, promote social and economic well-being through its other activities, we do not believe that the current form of wording&#151;which would hence be less restrictive&#151;would rule out a more innovative approach, if that were appropriate.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Amendment No. 52 is, as the noble Baroness said in her speech, very important. We covered conflict resolution in depth in Committee and I do not want to reiterate all the arguments. However, I must begin with an apology&#151;which I do. As promised in Committee, we have considered whether it would be appropriate to guide Natural England on how to deal with conflicts between different aspects of its purpose in the statutory guidance which Clause 15 of the Bill <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1275"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1275</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

allows the Secretary of State to give. In order to assist our discussions tonight, my honourable friend Jim Knight circulated on Monday an example of the way in which this might be done. He said at the end of his letter that it was as an example of how conflict resolution might be covered, not as a draft for approval.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>To give noble Lords time to consider this, it was sent out, frankly, before we had completed our consideration of its merits. I have to tell the House that the conclusion of that consideration is that it would not be appropriate to cover conflict resolution in the statutory guidance. So, the note noble Lords received is no longer relevant to what I am about to say. I apologise for the inconvenience.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Let me start with the core of our response: Natural England will be&#151;the word has been used before, and I say it again unashamedly&#151;a trenchant champion of the natural environment. No one reading the purpose in Clause 2 can be in any doubt, I would argue, that Natural England is an environmental organisation. It is about managing and enhancing places and nature and about encouraging people to enjoy and benefit from them. It will make decisions in the context of sustainable development. Through its environmental work, Natural England will contribute to sustainable development by actively seeking economic and social benefits for present and future generations. Sustainable development cannot be delivered by social, economic or environmental work on its own.
<a name="time_16"></a>

</p>

<a name="60315-17_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>We believe that Clause 2 and the Explanatory Notes&#151;which I have just summarised&#151;provide the right framework for the board of Natural England to decide how to address the diverse range of complex issues which will come to it for decision. As has been said in this debate, it will build its own reputation and it must be allowed to do that. It will be one of the Government&#039;s key advisers on managing the natural environment. We maintain the view that it would not be right to constrain the judgment of the board on the face of the Bill in the way proposed in Amendment No. 52; nor should it be exposed to the threat of judicial review on this ground for every decision that it takes.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>I acknowledge that the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, has significantly adjusted the amendment she brought forward in Committee to refer to &quot;significant&quot;, &quot;irreconcilable&quot; conflicts. I promised to go away and give thought to whether conflict resolution in those very rare situations could be dealt with appropriately in the statutory guidance which the Secretary of State can give to Natural England under Clause 15. Our conclusion, after considerable thought, was that it would not.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>We were looking for a form of words to include in statutory guidance that would, first, not unduly limit Natural England&#039;s independence; or, secondly, not encourage it to pay any less heed to the social and economic implications of its activities and thus <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1276"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1276</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not contribute as fully as it could to sustainable development; or, thirdly, put it at undue risk of judicial review. We were not able to do that to our satisfaction. I recognise that this is a matter of judgment, but that is our firm conclusion.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Returning to our overall aim, we are trying to strike the right balance&#151;for once, I did not completely agree with what my noble friend Lord Judd said about balance&#151;and it is the right thing to aim for. Of course he is right to say that those who put forward economic arguments for change in the countryside do so with great passion, but if I have learnt one thing in my few months in this job, it is that those who put forward an environmental argument do so with equal, if not sometimes greater, passion. So it is a question of striking the right balance between Natural England&#039;s independence to make its own judgments as an expert on the natural environment&#151;something many noble Lords have stressed when discussing other provisions in the Bill&#151;and establishing a clear framework within which it will operate, which is important to its many customers and stakeholders, as well as to Ministers and Parliament to whom it is ultimately accountable.
</p>

<a name="60315-17_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The combination of Clause 2, as drafted, and the Explanatory Notes to which I referred, does the job. On the basis of those arguments, and those that have been put forward during an excellent debate, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment and other noble Lords not to move theirs.

<a name="60315-18_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his full response. I am well aware that we are at Report stage, but I wish to clarify matters with him, otherwise I might not be able to speak again when my amendments are reached&#151;they will either be moved or not moved.
</p>

<a name="60315-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I hope that the Minister will understand&#151;and I accept his apology because these past few hours have been a nightmare&#151;if under those circumstances I need to reconsider the matter. I should make that clear, because if I do not say that to other noble Lords, they will not be aware of it, and when the time comes, the amendments will either be moved or not moved. I also thank the Minister for agreeing to reconsider Amendment No. 50 and bring back an amendment that, I hope, will deal with local communities. I am more than happy with that and am grateful to him. I am only too aware that the Bill deals with both urban and rural communities, and that is part of the dilemma that we face. Perhaps some of us who live in very rural areas get worried that the rurality will be swamped in the whole.
</p>

<a name="60315-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Just to be technically correct, I hope I have made it clear that while I accept the Minister&#039;s explanation, I will need to seek advice, because my colleagues in another place may return to the matter&#151;but I cannot say that at this stage.

We would end up with Members unable to vote&#151;having voted in favour of the first amendment, they may wish to vote against on the second, for example.

<a name="60315-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The Minister was right in saying that global warming is part of the context in which Natural England will work. However, there must be a point at which it is appropriate to start to force this subject into legislation and into the actions of all government departments. In his reply to me, the Minister gave us some hope. I am not sure that he clarified the matter sufficiently, but equally I am not sure that I am so dissatisfied with what he has said that I wish to press the amendment to a Division, particularly at this stage of the evening.
</p>

<a name="60315-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>However, it is only fair to say that it is extremely likely that I will bring back the amendment yet again at Third Reading, because, whether we like it or not, this subject will drive everything. It will drive the country&#039;s economic programme, its energy policies, possibly its budgetary balance and its social programmes in the widest sense, until we get things under control. It is not just a question of this country doing that, it is the major international issue.

<a name="60315-18_para4"></a>

<a name="column_1278"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1278</b><br>&nbsp;<br>




<p><a name="st_172"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment takes us back to research into biodiversity&#151;and other issues&#151;which I raised in Committee. When we debated it, the Minister said that the National Environment Research Council&#039;s decisions on the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology were out for consultation until the middle of February and that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;therefore no decisions have been made&quot;.&#151;[Official Report, 8/2/06; col. 764.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Now that they have been made&#151;and I am sure that noble Lords will have received the very helpful letter of 13 March from Professor Alan Thorpe, chief executive of the Natural Environment Research Council&#151;can the Minister say whether the Government are satisfied with the outcome? I do not think he will be surprised to learn that I still have severe reservations. Although there have been slightly fewer cuts and a very slight increase in funding, meaning that slightly less of the programme will be cut, I stand by many of the arguments I advanced in Committee. Such research is particularly critical at this time. As we face enormous pressures due to climate change and our understanding of the inter-relationship of these things leads us to conclude that more research is needed more urgently than ever, it is particularly unfortunate that such a cut has been proposed.
</p>

<a name="60315-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Other facts have come to light since we debated this in Committee; I have, naturally, carried out further research. It seems that the Select Committee on Science and Technology&#039;s fifth report stated that, following the settlement for science announced in the 2002 spending review, NERC&#039;s income from the science budget will increase from &#163;219 million in 2002-03 to &#163;350 million in 2005-06. The rationale behind this increase was to allow NERC to take the lead in science, the earth&#039;s life support systems, climate change, and so on. Last year funding reached &#163;314 million, but that is still well short of &#163;350 million. Having committed to that budget in 2003, have the Government now decided to make cuts in it. If so, such a position is particularly unfortunate. A breakdown of the funding for the Natural Environment Research Council shows that &#163;8.1 million comes from the UK private sector. I wonder how the UK private sector feels about the proposed cuts and what percentage of the programme that is being cut is indeed funded by the private sector?
</p>

<a name="60315-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a> Finally&#151;and I was not as aware of this when we debated it in Committee&#151;there is the responsibility line for the Natural Environment Research Council, which was set up under the Science and Technology Act 1965, I believe by Royal Charter. I only recently became aware of the difference between that sort of set up and the normal sort of quango we debate in your noble Lordships&#039; House. Under the set up of the Natural Environment Research Council, Parliament is given a much wider overview of what is happening under the council. Indeed, the council&#039;s own website helpfully gives a diagram that shows Parliament sitting at the top, represented by the Secretary of State. The advertisement for the two vacancies on the Natural <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1279"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1279</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Environment Research Council, which appears on its website, helpfully says that the council is responsible to Parliament and other citizens.
</p>

<a name="60315-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>When something is as contentious as this, is there a mechanism that should be employed to refer the matter at least to the Select Committee in order to review the situation? It is surely very unusual that such a body of eminent scientists as have been very assiduous in writing to the press, in contacting us, and talking about this, speak with one voice, so concerned are they about cuts in the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology&#039;s programme. This is of central importance in NERC&#039;s work now, so they are frustrated at having been unable to change the direction of the decision taken. When the Royal Charter refers to Parliament being in prime position with regard to the research council, I wonder what that means, given that there is deep unhappiness over decisions taken. Where is Parliament&#039;s role in making its voice heard? I beg to move.

It is very important that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, has raised this subject and it is good that we should see what can be done about this. The amendment states that:

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="60315-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I take it that this is really a probing amendment, in the sense that the noble Baroness wants to start a short debate&#151;which she has done very successfully&#151;on the Natural Environment Research Council and the decisions it has recently taken. I appreciate that there are strong feelings on this issue and I congratulate the noble Baroness on bringing this to the Floor of the House.
</p>

<a name="60315-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>NERC is an independent body. Decisions of this kind are solely for its council, which is made up of many eminent scientists. The NERC council, as we were told, has published its response to comments made during the consultation that preceded its recent decision. That, and the responses of Defra and its agencies, are all in the public domain. I understand that the NERC council has confirmed its plans to restructure the CEH. It agreed that the original drivers for restructuring&#151;namely, funding only the highest quality science, reducing the trend in external income and ensuring long-term financial sustainability&#151;all remain.
</p>

<a name="60315-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>However, after consideration of the various issues raised within what is described as the &quot;stakeholder consultation&quot; it has made some amendments to its <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1280"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1280</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

original proposals. I understand that these changes will result in up to 40 of the 200 posts at risk in the business plan being saved. A plan to focus staff and research on four of the existing sites at Bangor, Edinburgh, Lancaster and Wallingford is unchanged. There are still plans to close the four research sites at Banchory, Dorset, Monkswood and Oxford. I also understand that to reduce any risk and ensure that critical work is not only maintained but enhanced, the NERC council has revised its funding allocation, adding &#163;1.3 million to the original &#163;15 million per year.
</p>

<a name="60315-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>Defra, for its part, agrees with the importance of placing the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology on a secure financial footing for the future. We welcome NERC&#039;s reassurance that that existing contractual obligations will be fulfilled to the highest standards.
</p>

<a name="60315-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>It is our intention, and the intention of Defra&#039;s agencies, to endeavour to work closely with NERC in the longer term to ensure that the research carried out following restructuring continues to be relevant to, and consistent with, Defra&#039;s priorities.
</p>

<a name="60315-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>We also welcome the amendment of the restructuring proposals to strengthen biodiversity and climate change research areas. I was asked whether Natural England, once established, can provide financial support to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. It is clear that Natural England will have broad powers to enter into agreements with, and fund, other bodies where it is in its interests to do so and where it will help its objectives. However, a decision on whether or not to do so in any particular instance will, of course, be a matter for the board of Natural England.
</p>

<a name="60315-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I cannot help the noble Baroness in relation to Parliament&#039;s role but, for my part, I cannot see any reason why the issue surrounding this decision cannot be raised in the normal way by any Member of another place or in this House, if that is what the Member wants to do. But, as I understand the legal position&#151;I am repeating myself now&#151;NERC is an independent body and the decisions that it reaches are solely for its own council. I do not think that I can help very much further.
</p>




<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="60315-19_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, this is a DTI and not a Defra matter, and presumably discussions do take place between them. What overall responsibility to Parliament or to the DTI does NERC have in the first instance? Presumably there are rules which it must observe. If the Minister could follow that up with a letter, I should be very grateful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="60315-19_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I will do so, of course. I suspect that it has the same relationship with the DTI as other research councils have with that department. Defra has a relationship with it because it does work that we require to be done. However, I will write to the noble Baroness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="60315-19_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply and for the encouragement, as I see it, to pursue some of these issues through a different mechanism. He is right that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1281"></a>

this will probably no longer be the mechanism through which to pursue them. I recognise that the &#163;4.5 million for NERC that comes from Defra is only about 50 per cent of its funding and that &#163;7 million of the funding comes from other sources and other departments.
</p>

<a name="60315-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>There is a very real issue concerning both the external funding, which, as the noble Lord said, is diminishing, and the fact that half of the funding of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology comes from external sources. I do not think that the publicity that has taken place will be helping the case; nevertheless, it is something of which the council needs to be aware. I am fundamentally concerned about this issue. From what I can gather from its website and from historical research, the council seems to be responsible to Parliament, but at the moment I cannot understand what form that responsibility takes and I will pursue it through other, possibly more appropriate, means. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have moved to Amendment No. 72 with considerable rapidity. This government amendment would remove the power for the Secretary of State to authorise Natural England to use compulsory purchase powers to acquire land for experimental schemes.

</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am very glad to have secured this debate on northern Uganda. I am especially grateful to all noble Lords who will be speaking tonight. As we have just heard, each of them will have a very short time; nevertheless, it shows a real commitment that so many wish to take part. The number of speakers reflects the huge expertise in this House on this part of Africa and the concern that people feel about the conflict in the region. I thank all noble Lords.

</p>

<a name="60315-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a> It is now 20 years since conflict began in northern Uganda, yet so little international attention seems to be directed to this problem. That is surprising for a number of reasons. The conflict threatens to destabilise countries around, such as the DRC and Sudan, as well as Uganda itself. But above all, this is a conflict that has taken a terrible toll on children. War can exact a terrible price from women and children. But what has happened in northern Uganda is quite simply on a different level. The deliberate targeting of children is utterly appalling. Whatever the roots of this conflict, there can be no justification whatsoever for the Lord&#039;s Resistance Army targeting children as it has done. I welcome the fact that the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for the five leaders of the LRA&#151;even if it has made negotiation with the LRA more difficult.
</p>

<a name="60315-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>We know about the abduction of children and the way that children flee to towns at night in the hope of finding shelter, so that they are not stolen in the night. How can it be that we are paying so little attention? As Amnesty says:

<a name="60315-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>UNICEF calculates that as many as 25,000 children have been abducted by the LRA for use as soldiers and sex workers since the conflict began. Children&#039;s rights are violated daily. The LRA also targets killings, abductions and rape at the wider civilian population.

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>Will the Minister tell us when he thinks the Secretary-General will report on these matters to the Security Council? Save the Children and Oxfam, among others, told me that this would happen in 12 days&#151;on 27 March&#151;so this debate was timely, but I hear from the FCO that this may not be the case. I spoke to someone earlier, as the noble Lord will be aware. I should like his comments on that.

<a name="60315-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>That report needs to be made; and it needs to be strong and effective. It must not be delayed. Actions need to follow from it. Clearly there needs to be a comprehensive strategy to end the war. Those who have been indicted by the ICC must be apprehended. The Ugandan military and other forces must do more to protect civilians. There needs to be dialogue with other members of the LRA. The Ugandan Government must be clearer that they support effective amnesties for those wishing to leave the LRA. Support has to be given to those who leave to prepare them so that they can best re-enter civilian life. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s comment on all these proposals.

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>DfID is already helping with humanitarian relief, but more will need to be done to assist those now in the camps, and as they seek to leave those camps. They must not be marginalised if a lasting solution is to be found. I note that President Museveni stated last Tuesday that he is preparing to resettle displaced people from their camps, stating that the region is now peaceful. That seemed a little surprising. Do the Government have reason to believe that the security situation in northern Uganda has improved enough for people to be moved out of camps? If so, maybe we can all go home.
</p>

<a name="60315-20_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>This is an extremely complicated situation. The LRA has committed the most appalling atrocities. But this is a conflict which military action alone is never likely to solve. Not only do we need to see all parties seriously seeking a solution, we must make sure that the international community does not lose sight of this conflict. It is by spotlighting the plight of those in northern Uganda that we will surely encourage the action that the international community must now take. In those actions, I trust that the UK Government will take a leading role.

Real appreciation and thanks are due to the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, for giving the House the opportunity to discuss this disturbing issue tonight. It is a highly complex issue. Since President Museveni came to power there have been many rebellions in Uganda. Most have been resolved, but tragically that in the north persists. Brutality and cruelty are grim realities. Ruthless people in the Lord&#039;s Resistance Army viciously exploit and manipulate the situation. But we must not allow ourselves to be so mesmerised by the horror that we fail to recognise the complexity and weaken our resolve to work for the lasting peace for which those who suffer in Uganda so desperately yearn.

<a name="60315-20_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Rehabilitation and counselling for those&#151;especially the young who leave the ranks of the LRA&#151;are priorities that we should support. Reconciliation as pursued by local leaders and the former Minister for the north, Betty Begombe, is a muscular and courageous cause that demands our imaginative and practical co-operation. It is disappointing that President Museveni is apparently so ambivalent on such imperatives himself. They are essential to peacemaking, which is indispensable if stability is to be achieved.

In 2005 DfID made a firm commitment to use conflict assessments in formulating all its country assistance plans. Are such assessments central to decisions about our programme in Uganda? What is DfID doing to ensure that human security considerations are prioritised in decision-making in Uganda? How is that reflected in DfID&#039;s policy towards budget and sector support?

<a name="60315-20_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>The availability of small arms fuels the conflict in the north. Are we therefore doing all that we should to encourage the government of Uganda to make small arms control a key part of their efforts to enhance development and human security? Are we, for example, urging the Ugandan Government to implement the country&#039;s national action plan on arms management and disarmament which is an urgent priority? How are we supporting the implementation of that action plan?

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>If development assistance to Uganda is to succeed, is it not essential to base it on a comprehensive assessment of the peace and conflict dynamics of the country? Together with that, is it not essential to address the failure of successive Ugandan governments to establish appropriate government institutions and arrangements that are sufficiently responsive, inclusive and accountable to the majority of Ugandans? Is it not the absence of those that has resulted in the underdevelopment of the north and which has exacerbated the disastrous conflict?

<a name="60315-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Freeman: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, not only on winning the debate but also on her excellent speech. I find myself in complete agreement with her and I shall not repeat her arguments in any way. Instead I want to make a practical suggestion to help the hard-pressed communities in the north of Uganda that are caught up in the conflict zone. I would be grateful if the Minister would simply draw my remarks to the attention of the Secretary of State for International Development. I do not expect a response tonight.

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>About half a dozen international non-governmental organisations provide water sources in rural Uganda. I declare an interest as chairman of one of them, the Busoga Trust, which has been active for 25 years and has built well over 1,000 water sources. I shall speak briefly on behalf of all the NGOs involved in this important activity. It is difficult, if not impossible, for the NGOs to work in northern Uganda, particularly in the triangle of Gulu, Kitgum and Lira. That is simply because in the past it has been unsafe, although work is continuing in the north-east of Uganda on the Kenyan and Sudanese borders, but not in the conflict zone itself. If those organisations were able, with the help of the security forces, to move north, they could rapidly supply clean water to the villages. I appreciate that bore holes already exist in the campsites where the women, children and the population in general spend the evenings for security reasons. However, I believe work needs to be done in the villages. Clean water transforms village life. It provides health, vitality, and self-confidence. The noble Baroness referred in particular to the plight of the children. The lives of many children are cut short through disease, from drinking foul water.

<a name="60315-21_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness D&#039;Souza: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, for initiating this debate. I too endorse what she has said, perhaps with one exception. From answers given by the Minister in previous debates and to Questions, I would like to acknowledge that the UK is clearly to the fore in negotiating UN Resolution 1653 and in providing support to the NGOs in the area, among other actions. I want to say a little about the important development which is the International Criminal Court mission to investigate the current conflict and to make arrests. I am indebted to Lorna McGregor who initiated a two-day workshop for the International Bar Association with 100 members of civil society organisations, the legal community from the north and from Kampala to discuss the work of the ICC within the national justice system. The preliminary conclusions from the workshop are quite interesting, certainly for conflict resolution work in the north of Uganda.
</p>

<a name="60315-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>There is a feeling that the ICC intervention from the outside may mask the lack of political will on the part of the Government to take decisive action to stop the war. Having failed in this mission, the decision to allow in the ICC was clearly politically motivated. That reflects a wider perception&#151;widespread in Africa&#151;that while the international community is desperately needed, the solutions must heed sovereignty and must come from within.
</p>

<a name="60315-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The workshop also highlighted the failure of the ICC to make equal comment about the abuses, of which there are many, by the armed forces. The displaced peoples&#039; camps are a terrifying experience, especially for women. I am currently taken up with concerns about a young university student, who was rescued from the LRA by army troops only to be raped and abused by government troops during three months in the camp prior to her escape. She is now in the UK with a baby daughter, not knowing whether the baby was fathered by the LRA or the army and is facing possible deportation.

<a name="60315-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>As ever, the resolutions, the statements, the promises and the human rights reports are all necessary. What is even more vital is that the recommendations be implemented.

The UN Secretary-General&#039;s report must be submitted and discussed before the Chinese assume <br>&nbsp;<br>

the presidency at the end of this month, so that the Security Council is in no doubt what its action should be. As has already been suggested and pointed out by the noble Baroness, it is strongly suggested that there be a special high-level envoy appointed. That could happen immediately without any further resolution. It is a matter of a decision being taken and implemented.
</p>

<a name="60315-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>There should also be an investigation into LRA actions, which might be helpful in clarifying how to reduce the violence and there should be widespread understanding by the international community that military action has not yet proved to be the answer, and, therefore, there has to be explicit ongoing support for political mediation and peace-building initiatives.

I shall make two points. First, with the current focus on the flawed election in Uganda as a whole, we should put that in the context of a president who, overall, has done fairly well. In the mid-1980s, I spoke for the opposition on Africa, when President Museveni came to power. Who can forget the atrocities, the insecurity, particularly in the Luwero triangle, the fact that since there has been successful economic developments, and one of the more enlightened policies on AIDS in Africa as a whole with modernisation and stability? Of course, the president has never won over the north, which, in any event, is Obote territory. The electoral geography of the last presidential election showed that the north central area and the north-west were heavily against the president, but he won in the north-east. At the time of the election, he said that the war was largely over. Therefore, it is perhaps right to consider not just the Acholi territory in the north-west, but also other areas such as the west Nile and Karamoja in the north-east.
</p>

<a name="60315-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Here I declare an interest as an adviser to a small British charity which includes two other Members of your Lordships&#039; House, Viscount Ingleby, and the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. The charity is the Christian International Peace Service (CHIPS) which has been in north-east Uganda for 15 years, working for reconciliation between the Karamojong and the Teso tribes. The work is concentrated, therefore, on the border area between the tribes, where there was a massacre during the drought period of 2000. The charity works in agriculture, community and water development and veterinary services with para-vets moving with the cattle&#151;a team composed wholly of Ugandans. CHIPS has identified a number of problems. One is the problem of the definition of internally displaced persons. No one is quite sure how many camps there are. There was a particular criticism of the quality of food provided by the World Food Programme, which is often said to be &quot;bitter&quot;. There were allegations of delays and corruption. By contrast, a notable success has been the work of a small <br>&nbsp;<br>

UK charity, the Teso Development Trust, which distributes food through the Church of Uganda and the Pentecostal Assemblies of God Church.

<a name="60315-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Finally, it is clearly highly administratively convenient for the Government to use the WFP, which reduces costs, but there is a strong body of local opinion that the WFP and, indeed, the national Government, should in part be bypassed because of corruption, and that aid should increasingly be directed to small and highly motivated non-governmental organisations.

<a name="60315-21_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Cox: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for this opportunity to record my concerns about my visit three weeks ago to northern Uganda, where 95 per cent of the population has been herded into overcrowded camps. We witnessed conditions showing why 1,000 people die every week in those camps. We also met some of the tens of thousands of children who had been abducted by the LRA but who had escaped. Their stories have a chilling consistency, and their voices need to be heard tonight. I give just four examples. Florence, 15, was abducted in 2002 and taken to Sudan, given to an LRA commander as his &quot;wife&quot;, and trained to become a soldier. She had to fight and take other children into captivity, treating them as she had been treated. She said, &quot;I became wild, I didn&#039;t care about killing and I possibly became worse than them. If I had met my mother and father I would have killed them. I acted like someone who is deranged. I don&#039;t know how many people I have killed&quot;. She has been told that her parents are dead. Of her seven siblings, four were abducted, and the others were killed in battle.
</p>

<a name="60315-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Richard, 22, was abducted in 1999. When he was with the LRA, he was forced to do three things: to rape a women publicly; to kill another abductee with a hoe; and to throw an abductee down a well. He received injuries from being beaten with a bicycle chain&#151;a punishment for taking too long to push the abductee down the well.
</p>

<a name="60315-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>Irene, 15, was abducted in 2001. The LRA made her kill 10 other children. She slashed them open with a panga knife, scooping up the blood and placing it in her mouth. She has repeated nightmares about the first killing which occurred at dawn. It was the first time she had to drink human blood.
</p>

<a name="60315-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>Monica, 18, was abducted in 2003, taken to Sudan for military training, and given to a commander. She became pregnant and had to give birth with no help at all. She said, &quot;I was just treated like an animal&quot;. She had to go to fight in Uganda, carrying her baby with her. Time and again, she has had to kill. She said, &quot;In a battle, one has to kill&quot;. During one battle near her village, she met a woman whom she knew, and she asked her to take her child, then 18 months old, because she said that she could no longer carry her baby and her gun.

In addition, what are they doing to support international aid organisations to prevent the escalation of suffering and death in the camps, and to offer help to the Ugandan Government to provide the security to enable the people to return to their villages? Finally, what are they doing to encourage the Ugandan Government and international organisations to provide free education for children and young people who have escaped from the LRA?

<a name="60315-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Howarth of Newport: </b>   My Lords, it is an international disgrace that the horror of northern Uganda has been allowed to persist for as long as it has. The World Health Organisation&#151;an organisation not given to facile emotionalism&#151;has described the situation there as a very serious humanitarian emergency, undoubtedly among the very worst in the world today, and possibly the most neglected by the international media and the relief community. It has persisted as a consequence of cynicism and incompetence in Uganda and indifference in the international community. Thousands of UN resolutions have been passed in the past 20 years but, until just the other day, none related to northern Uganda.
</p>

<a name="60315-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The disproportion of this situation is grotesque. Reliable estimates suggest that some 250 LRA guerrillas are keeping 1.2 million internally displaced people in camps and many more exiled from their homes. President Museveni has admitted that he could switch off the war. He keeps saying that he is going to do so, and keeps announcing that he has a plan. But from the record that we have seen, it is impossible to rely on him to take the action that he could other than under genuine, consistent and well co-ordinated international pressure. There is now more United Nations interest and activity, and I congratulate the Government on the part that they played in securing the passing of Resolution 1653. We look forward to the Secretary-General&#039;s report. The MONUC contingent sought to arrest the LRA leaders but, tragically, that effort was botched and the seven Guatemalan soldiers died in horrible circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60315-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>Our own Government have a very special responsibility for Uganda because of our historic presence there. I hasten to say that I know that my noble friend Lord Triesman is deeply personally committed and is working hard, both bilaterally and through the United Nations, to achieve what he can on behalf of the Government. We need the Foreign Office and DfID to act together&#151;I am not always convinced that they do&#151;within the country.

<a name="60315-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>I believe that we must place a very tight conditionality on the support that we give the Government of Uganda. We must use our influence, which ought to be large because of the scale of our aid, to secure better co-ordination. In the north, there is welter of agencies and NGOs&#151;there are some 200 NGOs in Gulu&#151;that are small and under-resourced, with different remits and overlapping accountabilities, and that are tripping over each other. They are staffed by committed and devoted people, but I am afraid their efforts are all too chaotic and they are much less effective than they could be. One of the important proposals of the WHO report last July was for a systematic mapping of need to lead to a rational allocation of resources and, of course, to increased resources.

</p>

<a name="60315-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>I have visited aid projects in Uganda and have met President Museveni and his wife on several occasions. I know of his firm leadership and commitment to his country&#039;s development since the dark days of Idi Amin. One of the very first countries to enter the HIPC process, Uganda is seen as a model of good governance and aid conditionality and an exact ideal of what Africa could be. Unfortunately, we are having to revise this rosy picture. It is not just the LRA; the present crisis owes something to the policies of the government, as well as to those of the rebels, creating protected villages and turning the north into a war zone. Almost its entire population is displaced, and more than 1 million women and children are still living in squalid conditions despite the UN&#039;s best efforts. The LRA has also, as we know, spread its tentacles into southern Sudan. Despite the government&#039;s offer of amnesty, the LRA has dodged every attempt of peacemakers to negotiate. Many believe that the entry of the ICC in this process last October has muddied the waters and, in the view of the Amnesty Commission, has made it even harder for sponsored initiatives, such as that of Betty Bigombe, to succeed.
</p>

<a name="60315-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>The judiciary, on the other hand, has grown in stature as a result of its role leading up to the recent elections. The ICC must not come in as a deus ex machina and give any impression of an alternative system, but must complement national judicial processes wherever possible. Perhaps the UK has a role here. At last, the country is receiving more attention at an international level; the noble Baroness has already mentioned the important but belated efforts of the Security Council. Uganda was mentioned in UNSCR 1653, which at least recognised <br>&nbsp;<br>

that there was a conflict. But will the Minister press the Security Council through the Secretariat to keep Uganda on the agenda by appointing a panel of experts and perhaps a special envoy, which can be done without another resolution?
</p>

<a name="60315-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>In the last moments, I shall mention an initiative in the United States. In the past two years, three young filmmakers there have raised the issue of Uganda&#039;s children through a non-profit organisation called Invisible Children. This organisation has started an education programme in the Ugandan war area, which is partly funded by a bracelet campaign that employs Ugandans. Their documentary is being screened in more than 150 cities across the United States, showing case studies such as we have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. Each screening includes a viewing of the film, a question and answer session and opportunities for ordinary people to become involved in helping the children of Uganda. It is an excellent example which could be repeated in Britain.

But these funds will not leave Uganda; they will go&#151;just over &#163;20 million&#151;directly towards the humanitarian relief effort in northern Uganda. A major element of that humanitarian effort must also be to rehabilitate those young men and women who lost their childhood in the wastes of the Sudanese training grounds provided to the LRA by the Sudanese Government.

<a name="60315-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord St John of Bletso: </b>   My Lords, I join in thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, for initiating this short debate. It is impossible to do justice to this big subject in just three minutes.
</p>

<a name="60315-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>We have heard today&#151;particularly from my noble friend Lady Cox&#151;about the appalling continuing atrocities of the LRA, which has for the past 19 years waged a brutal war against the Government of Uganda, carrying out horrific attacks on villages and squatter camps for the hundreds of thousands of displaced people, particularly the young people. The LRA has said that it wishes to govern the country according to the Ten Commandments. Sadly, it has completely ignored the first commandment&#151;thou shalt not kill&#151;and embarked on a reign of terror, often against the Acholi people whom it claims to represent. The figures vary but I understand that more than 1.6 million people are living in the most desperate conditions, fearing the LRA and still not trusting the government.
</p>

<a name="60315-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>So what can be done? I believe that we must continue to support the government of President Museveni in their continuing campaign to overcome the LRA, either by force or through negotiations. The recent multiparty election was certainly not a shining example of democracy in action and the continuing treatment of the opposition leader remains a cause for grave concern. I support and understand why Britain has attached conditions on aid, but Museveni&#039;s record also shows some remarkable achievements on economic growth, poverty reduction and the prevalence of AIDS. The president has declared his determination to bring peace to the north by committing troops and also engaging in reconciliatory talks. But actions speak louder than words, and several noble Lords have been critical&#151;rightly so&#151;about his lack of action.
</p>

<a name="60315-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>Our Government have actively supported Museveni&#039;s pursuit of peace. We have also supported a broad variety of welfare programmes in the region, including the Ugandan Amnesty Commission and MEGA FM, a local radio station promoting peace. I am sure the Minister, when winding up, will elaborate on our support for the various peace initiatives.
</p>

<a name="60315-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>Her Majesty&#039;s Government have also been a strong ally of the moves to bring the five LRA leaders to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. I trust that that support is being pursued in an energetic and effective manner. I wholeheartedly support the &quot;Break the silence&quot; campaign initiated and co-ordinated by the Church Mission Society in Britain. This campaign has amplified the Northern Uganda Church&#039;s appeal for help and certainly dispelled some of the spiritual fear.

</p>

<a name="60315-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>Of course, more can always be done. In all this activity it should be recognised that this is not just a national Ugandan problem; it is a crisis for the region. The problems in northern Uganda threaten the fragile peace process being pursued in southern Sudan. It is alarming that insurgents from northern Uganda are crossing the border and creating instability in the neighbouring state.
</p>

<a name="60315-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>I believe that a lasting solution to the problems in northern Uganda will be achieved only by a policy co-ordinated by the international community and the respective Governments of Uganda, Sudan and, indeed, Rwanda. Certainly the international community appears to recognise that the conflicts in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes Region are all directly or indirectly connected and that nothing less than a broader regional solution will bring lasting peace and stability to this part of Africa.

<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="60315-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, there are two views on the situation in northern Uganda. One is the view of President Museveni quoted by my noble friend&#151;that the region is now peaceful and that the LRA remnants under Kony are now moving into the DRC, where they hope to join up with Otti in Garamba National Park. He says that people can return to their homes and that he wants the EU to assist with the resettlement. On the other hand, only yesterday three rebels were killed and a party of 100 suspected LRA was reported just over the border in southern Sudan, as the noble Lord has just said. So there is reason to believe that terrorists are still active in the north as well as in the neighbouring countries. Until recently, 40,000 children were leaving their homes every night for protection in nearby towns from abduction and forcible conscription.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Certainly the LRA&#039;s centre of gravity has shifted to the DRC, where it killed eight MONUC troops in January, as has been mentioned. It would be useful to know what the UN is doing to exterminate the killers or to bring them to justice. Have additional UN troops been deployed in the Garamba area and is there effective co-ordination between MONUC and the UPDF? Has MONUC been tasked specifically to arrest the criminals who are wanted by the ICC?
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Though some NGOs have resumed activity in the north since the two aid workers were murdered in late October last year, there is a natural reluctance&#151;this was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Freeman&#151;to venture back into a lawless region. But UNICEF, referred to by my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, is helping to address the problems of women and children living in the camps, while in the Lira district, where there are 350,000 IDPs, Saferworld&#151;of which the noble Lord, Lord Judd, is a distinguished ornament&#151;and its partners are developing a nut export project, employing local women and helping to safeguard them against attacks. Does the Minister agree that, in spite of these efforts, the humanitarian response is not proportionate to the needs of the 1.7 million people living in squalid camps, where 1,000 a week are dying from lack of water, sanitation and healthcare?
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60315-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Can the Minister say how the UN cluster response principle is working in Uganda, which is one of the test cases for the idea? Is the UNHCR capable of undertaking the role of protection cluster lead in Uganda, given that it has no presence in the north, and what additional help can the UK offer now to the rehabilitation of the north generally? Do we consider, in particular, that a north/south road from Juba to Kitgum would help trade and improve security in both regions?

<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="60315-23_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Rawlings </b>  : My Lords, I too would like to add my congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, on securing this debate. Many interesting contributions have come from all sides of the House. It is an increasingly heated situation, especially as the ramifications of the worst drought in 20 years take hold in east Africa. These hardships will only compound what Reuters called the second-worst &quot;forgotten&quot; humanitarian crisis.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>With only three minutes to wind up from these Benches, I can only touch on the main issues surrounding this crisis&#151;a significant blot on Uganda&#039;s success to date&#151;and ask the Minister three questions. First, what discussions have Her Majesty&#039;s Government had with the authorities regarding the claims made by the International Crisis Group that the Ugandan army, while powerful enough to defeat the LRA, has failed to do so due to corruption, abusive behaviour and poor organisation, despite assurances from President Museveni?
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Ninety per cent. of internally displaced persons in the north live in overcrowded camps where water is of such importance, as stressed by my noble friend Lord Freeman. The camps are often accessible only with a military escort. The security situation is such that non-governmental organisations no longer operate outside the main towns. In all of this, the tragedy is the damage inflicted on the children of Uganda. It is vital that they receive an education to provide them with skills and hope for the future. Secondly, therefore, what steps have Her Majesty&#039;s Government taken to put pressure on the authorities to provide a free education for these children?
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I have been unable to cover the many issues raised today. We are faced with an escalating situation that cannot start to be rectified until peace is achieved. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, rightly mentioned the importance of controlling the availability of small arms. In the mean time, there are fears that Uganda&#039;s president may now use his mandate to crush the opposition and take a nosedive into dictatorship.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>I hope that the Minister will repeat what he has said before&#151;that Uganda is a government priority. I hope that Her Majesty&#039;s Government have a plan towards a co-ordinated approach to remove the tarnish from this once shining example of Africa. Thirdly, therefore, will they put pressure on NePAD to encourage full and proper use of the peer review mechanism, to hold the Uganda Government to account over their support <br>&nbsp;<br>

and treatment of IDPs in the north, as well as encouraging action with regard to the International Criminal Court warrants?
<a name="time_30"></a>
<a name="60315-23_time1"></a><h5>8.12 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="60315-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman </b>  : My Lords, I join others in thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and all noble Lords who have participated in a sobering debate.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>I can confirm that ending the conflict in northern Uganda is a government priority and remains so. In a sequence of telling illustrations, the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, reminded us exactly why it should remain so. Many of the issues raised by my noble friend Lord Judd and the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, about small arms, remain part of the general agenda, not just that in relation to Uganda. We believe that an international convention is desperately needed to stop trafficking in such arms.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>For nearly 20 years, the so-called Lord&#039;s Resistance Army has carried out atrocities of unspeakable barbarism and cruelty. Children have been abducted and brutalised, families torn apart, and the insecurity and fear that it has engendered has resulted in about 1.7 million people being sheltered in internally displaced persons&#039; camps&#151;nearly two thirds of northern Uganda&#039;s entire population. No right-thinking person could fail to be moved or angered by the senseless and shameful loss of life and the continued suffering.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Primary responsibility for protecting the people of northern Uganda and bringing this crisis to an end must rightly lie with the government of Uganda. The noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, made the point, with which I agree, that we must continue to support the government there if we want to see growth and development, a spread of democracy and the north embraced in any advances made. That is a difficult proposition, given what is happening.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>In all my discussions with President Museveni&#151;and there have now been quite a number&#151;he has consistently assured me that he is committed to seeing peace and security return to the north. He will not accept that any part of his country is a disaster area. When he makes his statements, he does so in a way that, in face-to-face discussion, would convince anybody. I believe him, but I also believe that he has no proven capacity to turn off the war&#151;to use the phrase that my noble friend Lord Howarth did&#151;because experience tells a different story. Aside from the moral imperative, I accept that it is clearly in his and Uganda&#039;s wider interest to do that, if it could. The continuing insecurity creates a negative perception of Uganda, its government and its army in the international community. It also undermines the economic and development gains made over the past 20 years&#151;impressive as some of them have unquestionably been&#151;the potential for future gains and the security of the wider region.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>However, since Uganda launched Operation Iron First in 2002 with the claim that the LRA would be wiped out in three months, the number of people in the IDP camps has tripled. The LRA&#039;s attacks continue, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1297"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1297</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not just in northern Uganda, but in southern Sudan, and more recently in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. My noble friend Lady Whitaker is completely right to remind us of the spread of this scourge into southern Sudan, with, in the past, the collusion of the government of Sudan. The noble Lord, Lord St John, calls it a regional crisis, which are the right words.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>I am in the paradoxical position of rejecting the claim that President Museveni is not committed to the end of the LRA, though it is clear that that has not been achieved. What are the reasons for the failure of the government of Uganda and its army? A number have been put forward. The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, mentioned one&#151;corruption in the military. Consistent in all these claims is that elements within the Uganda army and establishment have no desire to see an end to that conflict, for reasons of personal profit, and that abuses among the northern population are being sanctioned and perpetrated by some elements. Those are serious and worrying charges. For the sake of the wider credibility of Uganda, and to build trust among the people of the north, these claims need to be subject to a thorough and transparent investigation and charges brought where wrongdoing is found.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>Sadly, questions also surround the capability and effectiveness of the Ugandan army. It is hard not to ask whether it has the capacity for the task. The United Kingdom Government funded a defence review in 2003 designed specifically to deal with these concerns. We believe that full implementation of the recommendations would provide a sound basis to take forward future procurement and training needs. These changes are needed in that army.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>Non-military methods are also needed&#151;there is no purely military solution, as a number of noble Lords have pointed out. That is why the United Kingdom, in co-ordination with other international partners, provided technical, logistical and financial support to the efforts of Betty Bigombe, a former Ugandan Government Minister for the north, to mediate between the parties. The government of Uganda have supported those efforts. They provided the original tasking and agreement without which the talks would not have taken place. Unfortunately, those efforts did not ultimately bear fruit.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Claims have been made that the government of Uganda did not do enough to support the talks once they were established. I have no doubt, however, that the primary responsibility for the lack of a negotiated settlement rests squarely with the LRA. I have been urged from time to time to think of Kony and Otti as people susceptible to argument and the call for peace and decency, but I see no evidence of that. I see a senseless and gratuitous trail of brutality, murder, disfigurement, torture and rape.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, rightly raised the International Criminal Court. The most senior LRA commanders are now subject to warrants from <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1298"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1298</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the ICC. The noble Baroness, Lady D&#039;Souza, was right to say that that does not excuse Uganda from its responsibilities and role in making sure that it acts in northern Uganda, and we will pressure it to do so. Let me deal with the ICC. There can be no impunity for the worst human rights offenders. The place for Kony and Otti is in the dock of the ICC, not in some offered honourable retirement for the acts that have earned them worldwide notoriety&#151;my noble friend Lord Anderson is absolutely right about that point.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>If peace and security are to return to the north, the Ugandan Government, as the noble Baroness, Lady D&#039;Souza, said, need to ensure that those LRA members who are not subject to the ICC indictments are repeatedly alerted to the existence of the Government&#039;s amnesty provisions and given the confidence and reassurance they need to lay down their arms and reintegrate into society. My noble friend Lord Judd also made just such a point. This also means the provision of effective support and assistance in reintegrating into their communities. In a new era of multi-party politics, the elected president, Government and Parliament must address all these concerns.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>In some telling questions, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about MONUC. I believe that MONUC has made a brave and strenuous effort to arrest the criminals wanted by the ICC. It is certainly tasked for that. As we have noted, seven Guatemalan troops gave their lives in recent efforts. MONUC is at full strength under its current mandate. The deployment issues about where it goes and how it pursues criminals must be a matter for it on the ground. But it is a sad fact for the immediate future that the majority of the people of northern Uganda will be dependent on the IDP camps and international humanitarian assistance. My noble friend Lord Howarth also talked about how tragic their circumstances are, and I shall return to that in a moment.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>So while we all wish they were not needed, the United Kingdom is at the forefront of international efforts in this regard, being one of the largest humanitarian donors to Uganda. In 2004-05, we distributed &#163;11 million in humanitarian assistance. In 2005-06, that figure will be more than &#163;20 million. I do not know whether I can easily say that the sums are proportionate, but they are what we believe we can afford in the range of our commitments to the Commission for Africa. Our aid is primarily disbursed through international aid agencies and NGOs such as the WHO and WFP, and helps provide food. As the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, said, more can be done through the NGOs to provide water, sanitation, shelter and protection. I do not rule out the important point made by my noble friend Lord Anderson about a possible contribution by the smaller NGOs in north-east Uganda.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>I say to my noble friend Lord Judd and others on the DfID programme that the majority of the money is delivered, as I think we all know, through direct <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1299"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1299</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

budget support, governed by the Poverty Eradication Action Plan, agreed in partnership with the government of the north. A considerable part of the &#163;70 million that has been put in so far has gone towards education. The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, asked about that. I say to my noble friend Lady Whitaker that because it is direct support, the decisions about whether specialised health services should be provided have been a matter for the government of Uganda, but there is obviously great sense in taking her advice.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>We want to see an end to the need for aid. That is why the United Kingdom is at the forefront of co-ordinating the international effort to assist the government of Uganda in dealing with the LRA. The camps offer only a life of poverty&#151;poor nutrition, no schools, no clothing, no bedding, no healthcare and no sanitation. I have no doubt that they strip the heart out of Acholi society. When I think about why people are still there and why they face this dilemma, I say to my noble friend Lord Howarth that the reason, in my view, is not because somebody has a systematic desire&#151;I do not see much prospect of people being able to go home, given President Museveni&#039;s recent statements&#151;but because there is no competent military way of resolving the problem that has been demonstrated that would carry any conviction.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>I turn now to the United Nations. With concerted support from the United Kingdom, the Security Council Resolution 1653 was adopted in January this year. It is a positive development; it is the first resolution to detail specific action against the LRA and record its pernicious effect on millions of innocent people. It rightly underscores the primary responsibility of governments in the region to protect their populations, and it requested the Secretary-General to make recommendations to the Security Council on how the United Nations&#039; missions and agencies can assist.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>Other suggestions have been put forward in this regard such as the appointment of a special envoy or a Uganda-specific Security Council resolution. Resolution 1653 does a big part of the job; it was a vital step and was supported widely. There was no opposition to the process from China. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, also raised the question about whether there are more developments. I believe that all the developments that have been suggested warrant further investigation. That is well worth doing.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, said, we want these proposals to achieve outcomes. They must not just be about process. If the effort is put in, it should be about outcomes. My honourable friend Gareth Thomas will therefore be attending a conference in Geneva on 20 March on behalf of the Government to consider how our partners in the international community can best focus the international engagement. We do not know the date <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1300"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1300</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that the Secretary-General&#039;s report will be available, but I hope that it will be very soon. I also hope that NePAD will look at Uganda, as the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, suggested. It has quite an extensive programme ahead, but there is no reason why it should not do so.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>A number of points have been made in this short debate. I hope that I have responded to the points about the arrest of criminals and the humanitarian response. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about the UN&#039;s cluster response. The cluster approach is currently being trialled. It is too early to say whether it will help in returning IDPs, but the signs at the beginning are relatively encouraging. We are closely involved, and we will watch what is happening.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>We were also asked whether we are committed to working with the Ugandan Government to build sustainable peace essential to ensuring the rehabilitation of the north. The community needs to be at the forefront of this effort of improving all the circumstances in the north. The improvement of the road network suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, could be a key part of that. I want to look into that in more detail and if there is more information, I will write to the noble Lord to ensure that he is completely up to date. But the principle is strongly agreed among us.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>During this debate, the undercurrent has been that we all need to do more. I could not agree more&#151;the whole of the international community must do more. I hope that I have clarified much of what is happening and what is planned. Right-thinking people and people of any decency in the government of Uganda and the wider international community want to see an end to the LRA&#039;s reign of terror. They want to see the arrest of those indicted by the ICC and the reintegration of the child soldiers that it abducted, maltreated and savaged. Only then will the population of northern Uganda be likely to feel safe enough to leave the camps and return to their homes. I have said that I do not anticipate that that is about to happen with any great speed, and that is a candid assessment of what I see.
</p>

<a name="60315-23_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>We will continue to press the government of Uganda. As I outlined earlier, it is their country, it is their responsibility. These atrocities are on their territory. We will do all in our power internationally to help ensure that peace and security returns to northern Uganda. We will try to make the security assessments that are needed to ensure that we do it successfully. It is not a matter of blundering around but, as my noble friend Lord Judd said, of doing it with precision. Ultimately the Ugandans must take primary responsibility for achieving this. We are willing partners, but it is their responsibility and we must hold them responsible for whether they step up to this task or not.

<p><a name="st_202"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, on 1 February, at col. 293 of <i>Hansard</i>, I questioned the Minister about the funding of Natural England and the use of lottery money to accomplish some of its aims. On 8 February, the Minister provided additional detail, for which I am grateful. We have read the <i>Hansards</i> concerned most carefully, and we still feel that the Minister said that the bodies that would form Natural England spent about &#163;360 million a year. He said that, of that, some &#163;17 million was obtained from the lottery and that that element would be limited to &#163;10 million over the next two years. I cannot be sure whether that means that Natural England will be &#163;7 million short of current receipts in each of the next two years or that the income will take two years to drop from &#163;17 million to &#163;10 million. Either way, I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is a sizeable sum.

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>Natural England&#039;s mandatory duties must be given assured funding. Those duties include review, consultation, standards and advice and the following of general or specific directions. I can in no way estimate what fulfilling those duties will cost, in spite of the figures from the regulatory impact assessment, but I assume that Natural England will be constructed to deliver its mandatory duties. The rest of its duties should be added as and when external funding is found. That could come from government, the lottery, loans or private donations, but it would not be used to fund Natural England&#039;s prime functions.

<a name="60315-24_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, the amendment would require certain areas of Natural England&#039;s work to be funded totally by government grant. Those areas would be any reviews relating to the general purpose; research activities; compliance with UK common standards established by the JNCC; provision of advice to public authorities; and compliance with any direction from the Secretary of State. Although we would expect all those areas of work normally to be funded from Natural England&#039;s core funding from government, we do not categorically rule out the possibility that Natural <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1302"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1302</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

England could utilise other sources of funding. One example may be European co-financing or other EU funding sources such as the LIFE regulation. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, would not wish Natural England to be excluded from applying for such funding. Programmes funded by the lottery have a limited life. It is too early to say whether individual programmes will be replaced.
</p>

<a name="60315-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>We understand the noble Baroness&#039;s concern that Natural England should be properly funded and that it should not be too reliant on, for example, lottery funding for top-up. I can merely reiterate some of the reassurances that I have given previously and highlight the fact that lottery income represents a small but significant element of the current bodies&#039; income. They have not been encouraged by government to seek alternate funding from lottery sources for their core work. Nor will we encourage Natural England to do so once it is established. Rather, those bodies have been able to use their expertise to deliver the lottery distributors&#039; aims, and we have encouraged them to do so. The noble Baroness expressed fear in an earlier debate that money would be diverted from charities and voluntary bodies, but the opposite has been the case. The bulk of lottery money that is given to the confederation bodies, English Nature and the Countryside Agency, is passed on to local communities. Confederation bodies are assisting lottery distributors by making available their grant-giving machinery. In the case of the local heritage initiative, they were successful in attracting more than &#163;1m of private sector sponsorship.
</p>

<a name="60315-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the current position. As she said, that income amounts to &#163;17 million or about 5 per cent of the bodies&#039; total expenditure of &#163;360 million. That does not include EU co-funding of the agri-environment programme or the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund. Much the largest source of income has been the lottery. During the next two years, income is projected to drop to around &#163;10 million, unless it is replaced by sums not yet awarded. The vast majority of that is where the bodies act as a distributor rather than a recipient of funding. I hope that the noble Baroness is satisfied by my response.

<p>

&quot;SUSTAINABILITY DUTY FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES

<br>
(1)   The Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 (c. 45) shall be amended as follows.

(2)   In section 4 (purposes)&#151;

<p><a name="st_210"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, with this amendment we return to the issue of whether the agencies established by the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 should have had sustainable economic development as a core purpose. My amendment suggests that the Act should say that one purpose of an agency is to further the sustainable,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;economic development and the regeneration of its area&quot;,</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>In Committee, we also discussed the issue of rural areas and whether regional development agencies had enough duties. When I looked again at the 1998 Act, I was satisfied that its wording on rural areas was satisfactory. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;A regional development agency&#039;s purposes apply as much in relation to the rural parts of its area as in relation to the non-rural parts of its area&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>If there is still a difficulty over subsection (2) regarding its purposes, it is indeed for government&#151;particularly for Defra&#151;to ensure that the RDAs take their duties with regard to rural areas equally seriously. The 1998 Act does not need amending in that regard.
</p>

<a name="60315-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>I return to the sustainability issue. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, has said that,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;over a number of years a lot of effort has gone into ensuring that sustainability plays an increased part in the RDAs&#039; role&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28/2/06; col. 243.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>If that duty were actually enshrined in statute&#151;ensuring that sustainability played a part&#151;would less effort have gone in? The agencies would understand more fully that it had to play a part. However, there is some good news for the Minister, in that Sir Martin Doughty was speaking at an event in your Lordships&#039; House today on biospheres. In passing and with no reference to this amendment he said how cheered he was by the recent change in attitude that he sensed among regional development agencies. He had had a meeting last week with the chairs of all those agencies and now felt that there was a much greater understanding of the need for sustainability. I had not prompted that discussion nor made my feelings known to him, so I felt that his was a helpful comment to come out of the blue.

Thus I hope that the DTI, when looking at this short debate, will realise that we will not take our eye off the ball. We will continue to look at whether regional development agencies are acting in the interests of sustainability. In Committee I reported on the comments made by bodies such as Sustainability South West, giving many reasons why the regional economic strategy at the moment did not measure up in sustainability terms. I hope that regional development agencies, and whoever is assessing sustainability issues in each region, will take those comments on board and try to improve their performance. Sir Martin indicated this morning that they had tried to make a good first step, and I believe that they need to be further encouraged down that road. I beg to move.

<a name="60315-25_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for the way in which she has moved the amendment. I am not sure what the Minister&#039;s response to it will be, but all through we have expressed our concerns about how the RDAs work and the likelihood that they will have more regard for the bigger urban areas than for the rural areas. So I take the comments that the noble Baroness made.
</p>

<a name="60315-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>I think that this is the only opportunity for me to bring to the attention of noble Lords a particularly important issue. Would this be something that the CRC would deal with? On the issue of affordable housing, some safeguards were put in place in 1992, after a long struggle, which ensured that no more than 80 per cent of affordable housing equity could ever be bought by occupiers of rural shared-ownership houses. That restriction gave landowners, planners and parish councils confidence that those houses would never be sold on the open market. That stayed in place until recently. I understand that, from 1 April, the 80 per cent restriction will be removed straightaway. If that is so, it is a very worrying aspect of an extremely important part of rural life. I was not sure where else I could raise the matter. I have written to the Minister directly on it, but I make no apology for raising it again.
</p>

<a name="60315-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>The issue that my friend Moira Constable raised with Ms Cooper was the right of staircase and rural shared ownership. The difficulty that I find myself in&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, just referred to the need to alert the DTI to the difficulties&#151;is that the matter actually lies with the ODPM. I thought that both examples sat very well with each other. Here we are creating a new body, which Defra is instigating, but it overlaps with two departments&#151;and maybe several others as well. This is a real issue, and my question, in the light of what the noble Baroness said, is whether this is something on which the commission could have said &quot;Stop, this is one step too far&quot;? Is it a Defra matter or a ODPM matter or a DTI matter? Where does it go?

At the end of the day, who has the final say on what the outcome will be? I apologise for raising the matter, but the issue is extremely urgent, because this will happen on 1 April. I gather that, at the moment, unless we can persuade the Minister and he can talk to other Ministers, it is a <i>fait accompli</i> and there is nothing that we can do about it. It will hugely detrimental in the rural areas to housing that we have now and, more worryingly, for housing that we hope to prepare in future.

I had intended to raise the matter under Amendment No. 102, in the name of my noble friend Lord Cameron of Dillington, but, as we seem to have got there already, I may as well say something now.
</p>

<a name="60315-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>I hope that the 100 per cent enfranchisement or purchase right is not in the Government&#039;s mind because, if it happens, it will have the effect of completely abolishing a certain amount of affordable rural housing that exists now. What is even worse, perhaps, it will dry up the supply of new sites on which such affordable housing can be built. Those who own such sites will have no confidence in the system. That will be a serious matter in a large number of villages when there is at present a degree of hope that rural people on less than average incomes will be able to get a house in the locality that they come from or where they have a job and want to be. I hope that the Government take the matter extremely seriously.

<a name="60315-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, I should declare an interest as a former trustee of the Rural Housing Trust. I became aware of this situation only within the last 10 days, and it is as serious as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, have said. It has already been explained that at the moment you can staircase up to 80 per cent of shared ownership, but the other 20 per cent stays in the ownership of the housing association. That means that when you come to sell the property you get only 80 per cent of the value, and in effect the house remains in the affordable social housing sector in perpetuity; it does not go out into the open market. That is the reason landowners are prepared to release land on what are called exception sites at less than market value, because they know no one will ever profit from it and it will always be used for affordable housing.
</p>

<a name="60315-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>I have just learnt from the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, that this proposal may be due to a flaw in the Leasehold Reform Act 2003. It is to happen from 1 April, and the supply of land is already drying up very quickly. I have heard from the Rural Housing Trust, which has a large number of sites, that the landowners are stopping right now, because if this goes through the houses will be sold out into the open market. The first tenant&#151;or the last&#151;will get the benefit of the market value.
</p>

<a name="60315-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The company I was involved with tried to do this. We were prepared to let land go at agricultural value: on an exception site, for &#163;2,000 an acre. The <br>&nbsp;<br>

development value would be &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 an acre. We would be prepared to turn our back on that. We were not going to get development value anyway because it was an exception site; it was an exception to the planning situation. But if we had known that the tenants would end up with development value, there is no way we would have provided the sites.

<a name="60315-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>I wrote today to my right honourable friend John Prescott on this issue, because it involves the ODPM. What is interesting, and I am afraid this involves the Minister, is that the Affordable Housing Commission, chaired by Elinor Goodman, is reporting in the spring, and in a recent Written Answer to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, the Minister commented on that report and said:


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;We would not want to pre-empt the recommendations of the commission&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16/2/06; col. <i>WA 197</i>.]</p>

</p>

<a name="60315-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>That is exactly what this proposal will do. I am sure the recommendation will be to stop this somehow.
</p>

<a name="60315-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>There is the problem of the unintended consequences of the 2003 Act, but that is a different matter. How we deal with that, I do not know, but we were intending&#151;we have just had a word with the noble Lord, Lord Hylton&#151;to raise this question under rural-proofing. This is an excellent example of where the Commission for Rural Communities would have come in on rural-proofing and have pointed out this advantage, just so this issue could be examined in all its aspects.
</p>

<a name="60315-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>There is an ironic aspect to this. In 1992, when I was the opposition spokesman for agricultural and rural affairs, there was a proposal of exactly this nature from Mr John Gummer, who was the Environment Secretary, to allow staircasing up to 100 per cent, and we managed to block that with the help of Tory Peers. We worked together on the issue on both sides of the House. I had lots of help from government Back-Benchers. We blocked the issue then, and I hope we can block it now.

I never for one moment thought we were going to discuss rural housing under this amendment, but since the noble Lord has raised the issue, I take this opportunity to endorse everything that has been said, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Carter. If the abandonment of the right of staircasing goes ahead, and I really believe that this will happen, there is a genuine concern that among landowners and farmers, people who would let land go for reduced values in order to allow for special rural needs housing, the market will dry up. I really hope the Government take that on board. I regard this as a very serious matter.

<p><a name="st_215"></a>
<a name="60315-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, I speak from personal experience, although not specifically in relation to exception sites. We had the good fortune, if one could regard it as such, to get caught up in a major development. There was the usual negotiation over what I would regard as wholly proper gain for the community, as a result of this development. It was a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1308"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1308</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

very large development and part of the price was 200 social houses. We thought that was a perfectly acceptable price to pay. The way it works is that the gross value enhancement is diminished by the cost of those houses to the landowners, who were me and my brothers. We thought that was a reasonable price to pay. The problem was overcoming, in those days, the right to buy. We were quite prepared to give up the value and we accepted that the town should have this benefit. We were not prepared to do it, however, if the first people to move in could live there for three years and then have the complete capital enhancement as a result, because they had lived there for three years and therefore had the right to buy. That was a technical problem, writ somewhat smaller.
</p>

<a name="60315-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>This is precisely the same problem. As the noble Lord, Lord Carter, the noble Earl, Lord Peel, and my noble friend said, if the protection of this social ownership is removed, nobody will be prepared to put their sites into a scheme of this nature in order to provide social housing for their local communities, whatever their need may be. They will feel it is a gross abuse that somebody can move into that property and, after a relatively short period of time, inherit the gross value, which was infinitely greater than the sum for which they originally provided, which is in effect at a sacrificed price. This is a very significant matter and I do not know what the effect of this change will be. If it does happen to go wider than the specific case of exception sites, then it will bedevil the whole construction of social housing on a wider scale. It is common practice nowadays for social houses to be provided on quite a large scale as a large part of major developments. In effect, society gets those houses for nothing, because the landowner sacrifices the value in order to make it possible. Although landowners do have a desire to make a profit, they also happen to have a social conscience that goes with it. That is right and proper in view of social housing.
</p>

<a name="60315-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>Perhaps I may make a slightly acid comment. One of the weaknesses of the development gain/charge which the Government are considering is that it will make what is at present a free negotiation between a landowner and his local communities, as to the gain that the community should get, into something that will be bedevilled by a national charge and that will, heaven help us, go back to the Treasury and not to the local community who generated the development in the first place.

<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="60315-26_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord will agree that he has just given an excellent example of land that had inherent development value. The crucial point about exception sites is that they will never get development value. They are only allowed in by the planners on the basis of social housing and staircasing.

<p><a name="st_217"></a>

To correct what the noble Lord, Lord Carter, said, I point out that the rural-proofing should have been done by the ODPM in its systematic examination of all the legislation made and initiatives taken, to ensure that there are no adverse rural consequences&#151;or, preferably, that there are positive rural consequences.
</p>




<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="60315-26_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   If possible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="60315-26_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Cameron of Dillington: </b>   Exactly, my Lords. I gather that people in the ODPM now realise that they have made a mistake, and wonder how they will deal with it. It seems as though they need primary legislation to deal with it, which is quite serious, but there may be other ways round it. I hope that we can get some sort of statement before 1 April&#151;perhaps it is 3 April&#151;when the measures come into operation. It is a prime example of where rural-proofing could have avoided the whole problem in the first place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="60315-26_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment No. 99 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, who moved it in her customary, short and articulate way. The debate then took another course. It was important that the strong expressions of opinion about the issue were heard, even though it is clearly outside the scope of what we are discussing under the amendment. I am not in a position to be able to answer in an adequate way on the issue. I promise to make sure that my honourable friend Jim Knight, the Minister responsible for rural housing in Defra, has his attention directed to tonight&#039;s <i>Hansard</i> and what has been said tonight in Parliament. I am sure that he is aware of the matter, and I shall speak to him about it myself. I thank noble Lords who have dealt with it.
</p>

<a name="60315-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>The advice that I have received is that the CRC could not stop the situation because it is a housing regulatory matter. However, I confirm that it is exactly the kind of issue that the CRC might in future pursue with the ODPM as a rural-proofing matter, as the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, said. I hope that noble Lords who have spoken with such feeling about it will excuse me if I say no more about it tonight. I shall return to the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60315-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>The noble Baroness will know that, from April last year, regional development agencies&#039; activities have been driven by what is described as a new tasking framework. That framework requires each RDA to <br>&nbsp;<br>

show, in its corporate plan, how it will address the priorities identified in the regional economic strategy for the region, and contribute to delivery of four overarching government PSA targets. One of those overarching targets is sustainable development, a target that we in Defra hold on behalf of government.
</p>

<a name="60315-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>RDAs welcomed the introduction of the strengthened remit for sustainable development and, through their six-monthly reports to Ministers, will provide a summary of how they are contributing to delivery of sustainable development in their regions. That new requirement will be an effective method of ensuring that RDAs not only undertake their activities in a sustainable manner, but contribute to sustainable development in their regions. RDAs are aware of their role in that; I was pleased to hear that Sir Martin Doughty thought that there was genuine interest from the RDAs in that area. In addition to funding sustainable development projects, many RDAs have established environmental management systems, sustainable transport plans and project appraisal tools that help to mitigate the environmental impacts of their operations and activities.
</p>

<a name="60315-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>Although RDAs are already making a significant contribution to the delivery of sustainable development, the steps that the Government have taken to strengthen the framework in which RDAs operate should improve their effectiveness in delivering sustainable developments in the region. Guidance to the RDAs on producing regional economic strategies was reviewed last year to ensure that they and the actions to implement them are based on sustainable development principles, set out in our 2005 national sustainable development strategy.
</p>

<a name="60315-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>I hope that the noble Lady is reassured to some extent, both by what I have had to say and by the meeting she attended earlier this week. Ministers will be looking very closely indeed to make sure that RDAs with any responsibilities carry them out in the manner that Parliament expects.

</p>




<p><a name="st_227"></a>
<a name="60315-27_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>   moved Amendment No. 100:
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>Leave out Clause 17.
</p>




<p><a name="st_228"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, with this amendment we return to the thorny issue&#151;for me&#151; of the Commission for Rural Communities. In Committee I proposed that we could try restructuring the Commission for Rural Communities. I ran two arguments in parallel&#151;that we should restructure it, or not have it. I listened carefully to the comments in Committee and I have now come down firmly in favour of the presumption that we should not have the Commission for Rural Communities.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>Our Benches would be the first to say that rural areas need a strong voice as they are always in danger of being seen as expensive by government. They are seen as expensive to service, peripheral, and a problem. I would not accuse Defra of holding that view because it champions rural areas, but every other department tends to see rural areas as a problem. If those areas are to get a fair deal, then Defra needs to be known as a department for bright and ambitious civil servants, and MPs elected to rural constituencies need to have their voices heard. They and the parliamentary mechanism, such as the EFRA Select Committee, need to be a first port of call when a rural issue comes to the fore. With such in mind, our Benches are viewing how a democracy should work and whether a Commission for Rural Communities would further that sort of aim. The rural advocate and his Commission for Rural Communities&#151;if they are assiduous, bright and energetic, and that is not an aspersion on the individuals taking over the roles because I believe that they are all of those&#151;will inevitably lead a lot of the rural agenda and become the focus for comment on rural issues. I believe that that will diminish the role of those with a democratic mandate.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>I accept that there is a case for rural-proofing and we have just had a brilliant example of why. I was going to use the example in this amendment but now I do not need to&#151;so I am glad for the time saved. But what has the Commission for Rural Communities been saying about the rural housing issue? I have not seen anything that is public and I would be interested to know whether the rural advocate has met with ODPM and, indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister to discuss the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1312"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1312</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

matter. What rural-proofing has taken place and what comments have been made, for example about the proposal by the Department for Work and Pensions to end card accounts in post offices? Those are two enormous issues that will affect rural areas and which have emerged in the past couple of months. I have seen no comment from the Commission for Rural Communities on those. I accept that the commission does not exist yet, except in shadow form, but either it will have to take on this role or, if not, it is hard to see how it can be effective in relation to rural-proofing. Regarding the other issues, I am concerned that the focus is being shifted away from those with a democratic mandate.

</p>

<a name="60315-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>I have a couple of further points. It seems that Defra is moving a little in the opposite direction to other departments because, in terms of quango creation, the government website states that NHS Estates, for example, was wound up as an executive agency; core functions were brought within the department and local functions were transferred to local NHS bodies. Regarding the Ministry of Defence, there is a long list of agencies that have been abolished. I wonder if Defra is alone in not following through opportunities to abolish quangos. I am sure that the Minister can tell me which quangos Defra intends to get rid of.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>I have pondered long and hard over this issue and I have had some impressive representations, including one from Professor Michael Winter who chairs the South West Rural Affairs Forum. He made several useful points as to why he did not feel that the restructuring that I proposed would work. He said that rural affairs forum chairs were different animals than those who would sit on the Commission for Rural Communities and that sometimes there might be a conflict; although he, I believe, does both jobs.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>This is all or nothing. We are not going to see a restructuring of the Government&#039;s proposals for the Commission for Rural Communities; so we will either go for a quango or we will not. We on these Benches believe that the right place for a voice for rural communities lies with elected members, whether they are locally or nationally elected; and it is with that in mind that I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="60315-27_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, we had an interesting debate on this matter in Committee and I am sure that the noble Baroness would agree that the strength of the argument was powerfully on the side of retaining the Commission for Rural Communities. I thought that at the end of that debate that the noble Baroness had agreed that that was the way that the argument had gone&#151;obviously she has changed her mind since. I had hoped that this was a probing amendment&#151;as is mine, which proposes to leave out Clause 85. I have no intention of pressing that amendment, which aims only to obtain some assurances from the Minister on the record regarding the work of the levy boards.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>We had a powerful argument in Committee and there is no need to repeat that now. As I pointed out then and at Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, eventually came round and is now in favour of the Commission for Rural Communities. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1313"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1313</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I repeat the question that I asked at Second Reading and I still have not had an answer: which of the 20 organisations that have lobbied us support the noble Baroness&#039;s proposal not to establish the commission? All the evidence that we have received is that not a single body supports it&#151;perhaps with the exception of the Countryside Alliance. Certainly the NFU, the CLA and all the other organisations are strongly in favour of the commission.

<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="60315-27_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Cameron of Dillington </b>  : My Lords, I will not repeat all the arguments I made both at Second Reading and in Committee. There is no doubt that Defra cannot do the job of the CRC. It cannot criticise its own government or be independent. Neither can local authorities do it; this is a national role which cannot possibly be done by local authorities. I happen to know that the Countryside Agency is doing a lot of work behind the scenes on housing and card accounts, which is how I come to know that the ODPM is aware of the mess over housing. Very often the work of the Countryside Agency&#151;and, in the future, the CRC&#151;will be done behind the scenes. I know from my own experience that sometimes you have to stamp your foot and make a bit of a public scene about it, but very often you are better off trying to achieve your aims quietly, by talking to the relevant people. I will say no more, but obviously I oppose this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="60315-27_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, as the House knows, Clause 17 establishes the Commission for Rural Communities as an independent non-departmental public body, with constitutional functions as set out in subsequent clauses and Schedule 2. Statutory status will enable it to perform its role independently and impartially.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>There was an excellent debate in Committee on 8 February. On that occasion the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, accepted with striking good grace that she had lost&#151;to use, I think, her phrase&#151;this particular argument, and that the CRC would be established by the Bill. The noble Baroness did not for a moment suggest that she had changed her own mind, so there is nothing inconsistent in what she says tonight. Indeed, I can imagine her considering whether there was any prospect of amending the Bill so that its constitution and structure were different, or of not having it at all. The noble Baroness said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>      &quot;It will be tremendous if the CRC does all the things we mentioned&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 8/2/06; col. 694.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>That is the point I wish to make. I want to do my best to reassure the noble Baroness that I am fully confident that the CRC will go a long way towards doing those things.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>We know that the CRC will be a strong independent rural advocate, advisor and watchdog, helping to ensure that the Government&#039;s policies make a difference to people in rural areas. We believe that we are seeing evidence of that already. For example, its staff engaged with the rural public at a recent series of well attended regional seminars to find out more about people&#039;s priorities for rural housing needs. Its very <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1314"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1314</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

recent report, <i>Using the Additional Revenue from Reducing Council Tax Discount on Second Homes</i>&#151;which must have been one of the longest titles of any report there has ever been&#151;was heralded as &quot;hard-hitting&quot; in a high profile press article on 8 March. The CRC is already engaging with its stakeholders, and is recognised as doing so. We know that it will pay special attention to tackling social disadvantage, and to rural areas experiencing economic underperformance.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>We know that it will have rural-proofing at the heart of its role, ensuring that government policies are rural-proofed. In its role as an advocate for rural communities, it will bring a uniquely national perspective and, we believe, a single-minded focus on rural matters, which no other body could provide. That is why we argue that the country&#039;s hundreds of democratically elected local authorities could not perform this national role in the same way as the CRC. All this was said in Committee; we still maintain it.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>I want to offer one piece of reassurance to the noble Baroness, about the CRC&#039;s accountability, once it has been established as an independent non-departmental public body. The CRC, as all NDPBs, will operate within a formal framework of governance, overseen by the Secretary of State, with the support of Defra officials. Its relationship with the department&#151;its paymaster&#151;will be set out in broad terms in a partnership agreement, and its day to day functions will be supported by a corporate plan, management statement and financial memorandum.  Its senior staff will meet regularly with Ministers and Defra&#039;s Permanent Secretary to ensure that everything is running smoothly. It will publish its annual reports and accounts, laying them before both the Secretary of State and the general public and, in doing so, it will be transparent and open to scrutiny. In other words, it will enjoy a position of independence and impartiality, which are both crucial, and that will allow it to make a difference to rural communities.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>The Bill, when it comes into force, will establish the CRC as a new, strong NDPB with advisory, advocate and watchdog functions. This very positive measure will address the needs of rural communities and the people who live and work in them.
</p>

<a name="60315-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>The noble Baroness asked what the CRC has said about the Affordable Rural Housing Commission and whether the rural advocate has met the housing commissioner. The Commission for Rural Communities contributed written evidence as part of the call for evidence from the Affordable Rural Housing Commission. Representatives from the CRC are invited to a meeting of the Affordable Rural Housing Commission on 19 January to discuss that evidence. The rural advocate has been in contact with the commissioner, Elinor Goodman, and has also visited each of the English regions and talked to rural people to find out what they think the affordable rural housing needs are. There is no doubt that affordable rural housing will remain a priority for the CRC and the rural advocate. There is obviously a difference of <br>&nbsp;<br>

view in this House, and it has been fairly expressed both in Committee and tonight. We believe that Clause 17 should be allowed to stand.

<a name="60315-28_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I have to say that I feel even less reassured now. The comments of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, about the behind-the-scenes work and the necessity to stamp your feet and make a fuss behind the scenes to bring about change underlines my argument about why we need to reinforce democracy and have those sorts of discussions in public.
</p>

<a name="60315-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>The Minister answered some of my queries and was therefore helpful. Nevertheless, if the Affordable Rural Housing Commission comes along and has meetings in your area and then the Commission for Rural Communities, which is also very concerned about rural housing, comes along and does the same, people in that area will be entitled to ask what all these different commissions are and how they relate to each other.

<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>In terms of having the potential to raise the quality of life in the countryside, I believe that rural proofing is one of the best introductions to government by government, for a very long time. That is because it covers every aspect of 21st-century living and government&#039;s role therein. If carried out properly by the departments and the agencies, but enforced by the CRC, it can improve the delivery of health, law and order, educational services, transport, all the way through to advice on business, jobs, and so on. But it does need to be enforced, and it is vital that the CRC has the authority to do just that. It needs to be able to point the finger to name and shame, and it needs the authority of Parliament to do so.
</p>

<a name="60315-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>I have no doubt that the CRC already sees rural proofing as one of its major roles. Within the general purposes as currently spelt out in the Bill it would do its best to play a major role. But I want all departments and all government agencies to know that the powers of the CRC to demand&#151;a key word&#151;high standards of rural proofing come directly from Parliament. I want it to be able to say, &quot;We, the CRC, have a statutory duty to demand rural proofing throughout your work. However awkward it might be for you, you cannot just tell us to go away and leave you in peace. We have a duty authorised by Parliament to be here&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60315-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>The Minister said in reply to me in Committee that he thought that the amendments were unnecessary as rural proofing was already at the heart of the CRC&#039;s role and work. I would hope that he would have no real concerns about spelling it out on the face of the Bill to strengthen the CRC&#039;s hand. As I say, there is broad support within the Countryside Agency for my amendment.

<a name="60315-28_time0"></a><h5>9.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60315-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>With my limited knowledge of the inside dealings of these matters, I believe there was a thought at some early stage of the dismemberment of the Countryside Agency that overseeing rural proofing could be left to Defra and one of its Ministers. At any rate, there was a view that that option should be kept open possibly to allow it to happen in the future. I do not believe that view has much support any longer, but it may account for the reluctance, at least in the past, to permit these vital words to slip into the Bill. As I think I have previously explained, it would be entirely unsuitable for one department, Defra, to be looking into the affairs of another. It is important that the job of overseeing rural proofing is carried out by an independent agency, and preferably one which has the authority of Parliament, not just of Defra, to do so. It is of course equally important that someone keeps rural proofing within Defra up to the mark.
</p>

<a name="60315-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>I do not intend to highlight again the myriad examples of the need for rural proofing&#151;we have heard a very good one tonight. We all know they exist, and will continue to exist, across all departments and government agencies. But I would like to repeat what I said last time about sharing some of the misgivings of other noble Lords&#151;particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Miller&#151;about the practical effectiveness of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60315-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>However, effective rural proofing will make a difference on the ground to rural England and the people who live there, across every aspect of their lives. I, therefore, believe that it is important that the CRC is charged by Parliament to monitor rural proofing across government and I ask that your Lordships to support these amendments. I beg to move.

&quot;(b)   sustainable development in meeting the needs of rural inhabitants.&quot;

<p><a name="st_247"></a>The noble Duke said: My Lords, in speaking to Amendment No. 103, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 104, 105, 107 and 108. The drive behind all these amendments relating to the purposes of the CRC is that the word &quot;rural&quot; means people. It is also about landscape, open air, the countryside, farming, and sometimes tranquillity, but essentially it is about people. If the CRC is to have any value, it must express itself from the very beginning in terms of the people it works for and their needs. Rural people live and sometimes work in the countryside, so it is imperative to consider not only their social and economic needs, but the way in which meeting those needs has an impact on the environment.
</p>

<a name="60315-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>The CRC will have to be constantly aware of the interdependence of these three factors, and will have to ensure that its message to relevant persons makes that relationship clear. We have already dealt with the issue of affordable housing in rural areas, so we do not need to say anything more about that, but the CRC has an important role to play in alerting all manner of authorities and the public generally to the needs of rural areas. Perhaps if the wording is adapted in the way suggested, following the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, that will take care of so many of these things. The CRC will do this best if it is enjoined to think in terms of the people who live there.
</p>

<a name="60315-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>Amendment No. 109, the final amendment in this group, relates to areas under environmental pressure. I think that we all know the problems that occur on the east coast, where the history of cliff erosion is well known. Whole villages disappear below the waves. None the less, it is under increasing pressure, which we are told is caused by the south-east of England tilting gently into the sea and by sea levels rising in response to melting icecaps hundreds of miles away. I have also had some distant experience of the south-west and the environmental pressures of the annual holiday traffic, with its attendant litter, congestion, accident damage, and pressure on water supplies. But none of these things is inconsequential. Many of them impose heavy costs on communities that are not robust enough to bear them unaided. Those communities need a powerful environmental champion, whose voice carries weight in the arguments that surround progress, development and the attainment of government targets. I beg to move.
</p>

a very important concept, and if it is important for Natural England to abide by the rules of sustainable development, as I think it should, and if it is important for its board to have to consider the economic and social agendas, it is equally important for the CRC to have to consider the environmental agenda. One of the benefits that the Countryside Agency had over its two predecessors was that it encapsulated the whole principle of sustainable development. Previously, the Rural Development Commission looked after the social and economic aspects, and the Countryside Commission looked after the landscape. They very often gave opposite advice to government, and very rarely co-ordinated their agendas. I thought that various tricks were being missed. But with the advent of the Countryside Agency, the emphasis was on underlining the economic gains to be had from maintaining and promoting our beautiful countryside in national parks, AONBs and elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60315-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>Not only rural tourism but rural business is attracted by the countryside. It was all co-ordinated. Equally, it was about underlining the environmental and social gain of having profitable businesses, managing the countryside and the land and supporting the regeneration of rural communities. So let us make sure that we roll-out sustainable development as a basic principle underlining the purposes of all these bodies. I support these amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_249"></a>
<a name="60315-29_spnew9"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   My Lords, I have some difficulty with the amendments. I was very interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, said but I rather take the view that, given the very clear environmental brief that Natural England is now taking on, it is important that the Commission for Rural Communities should be allowed to concentrate more on the socio-economic dimensions of rural life. Perhaps there should be a clear distinction between the two organisations.
</p>

<a name="60315-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>One could argue that if Natural England became&#151;I am sure that it will not&#151;overbearingly obsessive in carrying out its functions as far as the environment was concerned, rural communities would be looking to the CRC to come forward and act as a form of socio-economic salvation. I understand the movements behind the amendments and the arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, but my gut instinct is that it would be a retrograde step to put too much of an environmental brief into the remit of the CRC. I am rather doubtful about that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_250"></a>
<a name="60315-29_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I associate myself with the comments made by the noble Earl, Lord Peel. We have established that Natural England will have a very clear remit and we are now in danger of confusing the issue and, perhaps more crucially, of confusing the kind of people who we want to serve on the boards of each organisation. They will undoubtedly need different expertise and I should like to be clear about the kind of people we are looking for.
</p>




<p><a name="st_251"></a>
<a name="60315-29_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Duke for his proposed amendments, which seek to clarify the <br>&nbsp;<br>

focus of the CRC in meeting rural needs. He proposes an alternative version of Clause 18(1)(b) in his Amendment No. 103. That subsection gives the CRC a remit to raise awareness of the needs of rural England among public authorities and other bodies and to promote sustainable ways of meeting those needs which underpin our commitment to promoting sustainable development.
</p>

<a name="60315-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>The Bill puts meeting rural needs first and makes clear that meeting these needs should be done by the CRC in ways which contribute to sustainable development. The proposed amendment seems to turn that around, placing the emphasis on achieving sustainable development. To us, that does not seem quite right. The goal of putting sustainable development into practice by integrating environmental, social and economic objectives drives everything that Defra and its agencies do and the principle was restated in the 2004 rural strategy.
</p>

<a name="60315-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>The Bill will give statutory underpinning to this agenda by requiring Natural England, the Commission for Rural Communities and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee to seek to contribute to sustainable development through the functions that each perform. In the case of the CRC, the function it will perform should be the promotion of meeting rural needs, as set out in the Bill, while paying due regard to sustainable development.
</p>

<a name="60315-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>In Amendments Nos. 104, 107 and 109, the noble Duke suggests adding an explicit environmental responsibility to the CRC&#039;s purpose&#151;we have touched on this at previous stages of the Bill&#151;but, rather than have equal regard to the social, economic and environmental pillars of sustainability, the CRC for its part will focus primarily on the social and economic needs of these communities. I can assure noble Lords that the CRC will not, however, be looking at social and economic needs in isolation from environmental issues because a thriving rural economy is inextricably linked to a thriving rural environment. While it will not be responsible for pursuing environmental goals directly, the CRC, we hope, will work to encourage others to consider such issues in a holistic approach to developing sustainable solutions for rural communities.
</p>

<a name="60315-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>In Amendments Nos. 105 and 108, the noble Duke suggests a slight qualification of the CRC&#039;s target audience, as it were, narrowing it to persons &quot;living in rural areas&quot;, rather than the broader &quot;persons in rural areas&quot;. In assessing rural needs, the CRC is tasked with considering the interests of all those who live and work in rural areas, as well as those who visit such areas for recreational purposes. This goes far wider than the focus on just those living&#151;that is to say, resident&#151;in rural areas that seems to have been proposed. I am sure that he would not want the CRC to ignore the needs of the rural tourist industry on which so many rural livelihoods depend and which is susceptible to many factors outside its control. Nor do we believe that the CRC should ignore the needs of migrant workers, who, of course, make a valuable contribution to the rural economy in many parts of England. The CRC must be all about the many <br>&nbsp;<br>

If the Minister in question is part of the Defra team, cannot the Bill just say so? Does the occasion of the transfer arise from another department&#039;s legislation?

<a name="60315-30_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, after the fourth Committee sitting, we wrote to Peers who had spoken in Committee on 27 February with more explanation, among other transfer scheme matters, about how the Secretary of State might need to use the continuing power within Clause 27 to make a further scheme. I reassured noble Lords that the clause would not permit the general acquisition of property held by other public bodies, nor would such a scheme allow the Secretary of State to move assets other than those currently held by English Nature and the Countryside Agency between public bodies in pursuit of achieving government targets.
</p>

<a name="60315-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>In response to a question put by the noble Duke, let me make it plain that &quot;Secretary of State&quot; covers all government departments; it is a single post, occupied by any individual Minister. Clause 27 permits the Secretary of State to make transfer schemes to transfer property rights or liabilities of a Minister of the Crown to Natural England, the Commission for Rural <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1324"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1324</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Communities or a person acting on their behalf, or from the bodies in question to a Minister. Such transfers are intended to cater for the efficient management of property rights and liabilities, and will be related to the setting up of the new bodies. In particular, we envisage that we might need to make a further scheme when something was inadvertently missed in the original scheme on the dissolution of English Nature and the Countryside Agency.
</p>

<a name="60315-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>The ability to make the proposed transfer schemes is required to further the efficient management of property rights and liabilities. The schemes can relate to rights and liabilities affecting staff as well as property. It will be important that where the business need arises, the transfers can be made quickly. Making such subsequent transfer schemes subject to the statutory instrument procedure would add an excessive burden and delay to the process, the principle of which would already have been agreed by Parliament. I have been able to reassure the noble Baroness on some of the constraints on the Secretary of State in those circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60315-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>On Amendment No. 117, powers of direction such as those provided by Clause 38 are very much reserved powers that we hope never to have to use, but are also part and parcel of the safeguards that are normally built into the framework when setting up an NDPD.
</p>

<a name="60315-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>We oppose the amendment because it would allow Parliament to countermand instructions that the Secretary of State had issued. That cannot be right. It would leave the joint committee in the position of not knowing what it should do if a Motion was tabled to annul the statutory instrument.
</p>

<a name="60315-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>A further and arguably more practical consideration is that a delay might result. If a direction is to have value, the joint committee must be able to issue it as soon as the Secretary of State has decided to make it. Given JNCC&#039;s status as a cross-border body, any statutory instrument would need to be considered also by the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. That would again involve further delay in issuing the direction.

In Committee, at col. 763 of <i>Hansard</i>, the Minister said that he expected us to return to this important issue. I said at col. 766 that I would read what he had said. I read the whole debate. I suggested in closing that the issue seemed to have caught the interest of the Committee without the Minister being able immediately to extinguish the fire. On reflection, the quick-fire exchanges at cols. 759 and 762-63, which comprised 17 or 18 different exchanges and snatches of speech, implied what I think the Americans would call a fire-fight. I apologise if I any way provoked it at that late hour.

</p>

<a name="60315-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>I did appreciate better, in retrospect, the points that the Minister made, yet I was still left feeling that the noble Countess, Lady Mar, who only intervened briefly, articulated my point succinctly when she said:

<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>That is another more vivid version of my own expression that &quot;having regard to&quot; is, <i>inter alia</i>, an &quot;amulet against judicial review&quot;. I realise that I am simply repeating the amendment that I deployed in Committee, but let me try again to bridge the gap between the Minister and myself, since I believe that he acknowledges the importance of biodiversity.
</p>

<a name="60315-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>The Wildlife and Countryside Link, which I defined and quoted in Committee&#151;and which supports this amendment&#151;wants public bodies to think about biodiversity. Government have an important role in sending strong signals to these bodies that they too have an important role. The Bill is one way of doing that but it is not just about, as the Minister also said in Committee, preventing biodiversity from being &quot;inadvertently damaged&quot;, which was in col. 760, nor about choosing between different projects, one of which might be good for diversity but bad for other issues, or vice versa, as he indicated in col. 761. It is much more about considering biodiversity from the outset, thinking positively about it and maximising opportunities for it.
</p>

<a name="60315-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>An example of that might be a proposal to build housing: that is a particular issue in some parts of the country. Yet once the decision for a housing development has gone ahead, how it is designed can contribute to furthering biodiversity. To give a specific example, a new village called Cambourne has been developed near Cambridge. The Wildlife Trust there worked closely with the local authority to ensure that biodiversity was incorporated into the design of the development from the outset. That was due to pressure from the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Peterborough and from South Cambridgeshire District Council. The developers themselves employed a team of ecologists on site before the building work started. The new development is interlinked with green space and is now managed by that Wildlife Trust. The area is now rich in wildlife, which can be enjoyed by residents of the development.
</p>

<a name="60315-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>I shall not spell out, at this hour, the lessons that can be learned from this experience but I pay your Lordships&#039; House the compliment of assuming that noble Lords can infer and imagine them, especially the involvement of local people with wildlife in as many ways as possible. Of course I appreciate that the Minister may say that nothing in the Bill prevents that from happening, but I can reasonably say that little in the Bill encourages that to become standard or habitual practice. I realise that there could be other ways of achieving the same ends; a comprehensive performance assessment framework is an important incentive for local authority performance. The Wildlife and Countryside Link would welcome biodiversity being incorporated into that, but the Bill is an important opportunity to send a strong signal&#151;I emphasise &quot;strong&quot;&#151;to local authorities and other public bodies that biodiversity is important.

If the Minister believes that the Government have gone as far as they can&#151;I must inform your Lordships&#039; House that I am not responsible for that noise that has just been occurring&#151;it would help if he could spell out more than he was able to, in Committee, what difference the wording in the Bill will make to progress in this field. It would help even more if he could allow a change by Third Reading to progress further in the direction that your Lordships demonstrated in Committee that they wished to see accomplished. I have sought to avoid the Minister feeling a provocation toward rebuttal, but in the same spirit I would welcome a more positive ministerial response, however brief. I beg to move.

<a name="60315-31_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   My Lords, I want to identify myself firmly yet again with my noble friend, whom I supported in Committee. His point is that local authorities must begin to embrace the concept of biodiversity in a much more comprehensive way. I understand and genuinely appreciate that to have that in the Bill would create difficulties for local authorities and the Minister. Yet the point my noble friend makes is absolutely right, so I hope that the Minister will give a robust indication in his reply that it is indeed Government policy to ensure that local authorities embrace biodiversity much more positively than they have up &#039;til now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_263"></a>
<a name="60315-31_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I have put my name to this amendment. I believe that some local authorities are excellent in practice but, as the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, rightly says, the comprehensive performance assessment at the moment gives no recognition of that important work, so even those authorities that are excellent do not receive the recognition that they should. The environmental part of the assessment was fairly hard-won, because when the CPA started it did not have an environmental area at all. Now it covers areas such as litter collection, and so on&#151;so I think that biodiversity does need to be in there.
</p>

<a name="60315-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>These Benches very often say that they do not believe in duties being imposed on local authorities, particularly when resources do not follow. But I believe that the noble Lord&#039;s amendment, in this case, only asks that they further the interests of biodiversity in so far as is consistent with their functions. I really cannot add anything further to what I said in Committee&#151;that I believe that it is about a state of mind and a way of working. I believe that the noble Lord&#039;s amendment would help that. I do not myself believe that it would be so hard to put it in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_264"></a>
<a name="60315-31_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I support my noble friend in what he is trying to do. I was a little surprised in Committee that we did not get a fuller response, so I am grateful to him for bringing the matter back again today.

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1328</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a better understanding of how one can develop or plan or evolve in a more biodiverse concept. I know the temptation from the Minister&#039;s point of view would be to suggest that if one involves too many people it would take time and that there would be delays on planning and other matters. However, a little bit of forethought in the first instance can bring greater awards at later stages.
</p>

<a name="60315-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>I, too, raise the question, as I did in Committee, whether the proposal involves a financial commitment. I do not see it&#151;and I do not think that my noble friend is moving it in that way; if he is, he may comment on my comment anyway, when he speaks again at the end. But any development that involves local authorities with biodiversity and in how they can help constructively is something that we can support in any case.

<p><a name="st_265"></a>
<a name="60315-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for raising the issue again. He has absolutely nothing to apologise for, except for the mischance that the amendment always seems to come up in what I cannot quite call the &quot;small hours&quot;&#151;but in the &quot;high number hours&quot;, at the very least. I thank him for the way in which he put his case.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>Clause 40 places a duty on all public bodies to have regard to the purpose of conserving biodiversity. In fact, it extends to all public bodies the existing Section 74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 to have regard to biodiversity as far as is consistent with the proper exercise of their functions. This amendment is identical to one debated at Committee and seeks to extend this duty so that public bodies have a duty to further the conservation of biodiversity.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>Let me start by setting out what we want to achieve with Clause 40. This duty seeks to raise the visibility and profile of biodiversity across the public sector, to clarify and consolidate public bodies&#039; existing commitments with regard to biodiversity and to make biodiversity a natural and integral part of the decision-making process. I can tell the House that it is our intention that the expression &quot;have regard to&quot; all public authorities will actually mean what it says, and we shall watch very closely to ensure that all public bodies have regard to biodiversity matters in a way in which they sometimes have not in the past.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>We think that the present wording is sufficient for achieving that aim. As is known, Clause 40 extends a pre-existing duty on Ministers and Government to have regard to the purpose of conserving biodiversity, set out in the CROW Act. In the six years since that duty has been in force, government departments have achieved a considerable amount for biodiversity, as I think the noble Lord said himself in Committee, particularly the Home Office and the MoD.

</p>

<a name="60315-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>The noble Lord also mentioned the Prison Service&#039;s biodiversity action plan and the useful surveys it has carried out on its estate. Let me go a little further and mention the wildlife areas that have been set up in several prisons across that estate, such as hedgerow planting in HMP Guys Marsh and pond creation in HMP Prescoed, and the fact that last year the service <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1329"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1329</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

won the biodiversity category of the Corporation of London&#039;s Liveable City Awards. Similarly, the MoD has made considerable effort to conserve and enhance the biodiversity on its estate through its development of a biodiversity strategy and the establishment of MoD conservation groups.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>We can see other evidence of departments taking action on biodiversity, through, for example, the publication by the ODPM last August of Planning Policy Statement 9 on biodiversity and geological conservation, and the sustainable framework for the government estate which requires all departments to set out how they can contribute to UK biodiversity targets. We believe that demonstrates the success of the duty to &quot;have regard&quot;. By extending the duty within CROW to all public bodies, we wish to achieve similar positive outcomes across the wider public sector.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>The duty will tackle those instances where biodiversity loses out as a result of simply not being considered. It will ensure that public bodies must have considered biodiversity in the normal exercise of their functions. I hope it is reassuring to the noble Lord and the House that Defra is already in discussions with the Local Government Association, the Association of Local Government Ecologists, English Nature, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Wildlife and Countryside Link on developing guidance to support local authorities in implementing that duty, with the aim of outlining local authorities&#039; responsibilities with regard to biodiversity in areas such as providing leadership, incorporating biodiversity into planning and community strategies, management of local authority land holdings and the use of information and data.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>Defra is already working closely with partners including the ODPM and the Audit Commission to develop a robust set of biodiversity indicators that can be used to measure local authority performance in future performance frameworks. The first two stages of that project are complete, and we are about to pilot the approach with local authorities across the country. The indicators will create focus on the issue of biodiversity, clearly signal central Government&#039;s commitment to biodiversity&#151;which I repeat tonight in the House&#151;and create pressure on local authority performance in this area, as the standardised measure allows for transparent comparisons. Those indicators will be signposted in the guidance we publish.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, said in Committee, local authorities can play a greater role in conserving biodiversity. We expect the duty to stimulate a culture change in public bodies and to encourage them to take positive action for biodiversity where it is appropriate to do so. The current wording, supported by relevant guidance, will facilitate that approach.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>There are a number of reasons why we do not think it appropriate to strengthen the duty from &quot;have regard&quot; to &quot;further&quot;. We all share the common desired outcome for public bodies to take more positive action. However, in achieving that outcome, we have to ensure that we do not place undue burdens or costs <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1330"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1330</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on those we expect to deliver it. If a duty is imposed, we believe it could generate volumes of litigation just to find out what the duty means and what its scope is. That would cost a lot to public authorities.

</p>

<a name="60315-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>We also fear that placing a duty on all public bodies to further biodiversity has the potential to cause difficulties and invite legal challenges on the individual decisions of public bodies&#151;in other words, judicial review. I mentioned in Committee an example where public bodies may be faced with decisions, where they are required to further biodiversity, even when it might be at the cost of other important social, economic or indeed other environmental considerations. This is not in line with the principle of sustainable development, where all three pillars must be balanced accordingly.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>We need to include sufficient flexibility for public bodies, which may need to take actions that are biodiversity neutral but further other worthwhile objectives. This is particularly relevant for public authorities, such as fire and police authorities, where it may be difficult to achieve further biodiversity. But it may equally apply to local authorities, depending on the circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>Our fear is that the words &quot;to further&quot; may lead to a situation where public bodies are regularly challenged to demonstrate to what degree they furthered biodiversity in all their decisions. Is this always an effective use of local government resources? I was challenged in Committee, quite rightly, that these cases are purely hypothetical. Of course they are hypothetical, because the Bill is not yet passed. But there are, we think, still real concerns.
</p>

<a name="60315-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>I have listened very carefully to what the noble Lord has said today. I hope that what I am about to offer will be of interest to the House because there is widespread feeling about the principles behind what the noble Lord has said, if not the detail. My offer, generous or not, is as follows, because I realise that Scotland has taken a certain course in this matter. I am offering that we should assess and review the impact of the duty to &quot;have regard&quot;&#151;which is how the Bill is phrased at the moment&#151;within three years of its coming into force. During that period, we can also look at how the duty &quot;to further&quot; has rolled out in Scotland. Following the review, we can assess whether a stronger duty is necessary and appropriate. That may well not go as far as the noble Lord would like me to go, but I hope he recognises it as a gesture in the right direction.

Although not as rigorous as my amendment, Clause 40 does put a duty on a Minister of the Crown, government department and the National Assembly for Wales to have regard to the convention. This amendment is simply to establish whether Natural England is included under this Section. I probably should have included CCW in my amendment, and for that I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, in particular. That was clearly an oversight on my part, but the thrust of the argument remains the same. I imagine that the bodies must be included, as it would be somewhat farcical for such a commitment to be put on a Minister and a government department but not their principal adviser on nature conservation.

<p><a name="st_270"></a>
<a name="60315-33_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, Clause 40 places a duty on Ministers of the Crown, government departments and the National Assembly for Wales to have regard to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. This replaces and reflects the provision on Ministers, government departments and the National Assembly under Section 74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.
</p>

<a name="60315-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>This subsection of Clause 40 has been mentioned in earlier Committee discussions on whether Natural England&#039;s general purpose should make reference to the convention, as the noble Earl said. As previously stated, it is not appropriate to extend this duty beyond government, as the convention is an international treaty which relates to the actions of governments on biodiversity. As part of our commitment to the convention, the Government will invariably look to Natural England to deliver many of the convention&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>

obligations in England, as it will have the expertise and relevant statutory functions to do so. Indeed, as I have outlined before, Clause 41(2) makes it clear that the Secretary of State must consult Natural England before publishing any list of species of principal importance to the conservation of biodiversity.
</p>

<a name="60315-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>I am unable to comment on the point with regard to the CCW and Wales, and know the importance of not going on the hoof about the relationship between the National Assembly and Welsh bodies. I will seek to get the appropriate answer for that.

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1333</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(a)   issue a code of practice in connection with any of the provisions of section 44 or Schedule 2 to the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (c. 48) as applied by section 44(4), and

<br>
(b)   revise or replace such a code.

(2)   An inspector must have regard to any relevant provision of a code when discharging any function under any provision mentioned in subsection (1)(a).


<br>
(3)   But an inspector&#039;s failure to have regard to any provision of a code does not make him liable to criminal or civil proceedings.

<p><a name="st_277"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, as Amendment No. 122 and Amendment No. 130 are similar, I will speak to them together.
</p>

<a name="60315-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>During the recent debate in Committee I promised the noble Earl, Lord Peel, that I would consider suitable wording in relation to authorising inspectors having regard to relevant codes of practice when carrying out their duties. I am therefore pleased that Amendments Nos. 122 and 130 not only provide the mechanism by which the Secretary of State can issue codes of practice relevant to the duties of inspectors, but also place an obligation on inspectors to have regard to any provision of such codes when discharging their functions. My department intends to issue codes of practice to inspectors exercising their powers in relation to the possession of proscribed pesticides and to wildlife inspectors exercising their powers as set out in Schedule 5. The pesticides code will be extended to encompass inspections carried out under the Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 by wildlife inspectors. At present such inspections are not subject to a code of practice. It is appropriate that inspectors must have regard to such codes.
</p>

<a name="60315-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>I believe that these amendments adopt a common-sense approach. I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Peel, for having raised the issues in Committee. I hope that the amendments find the approval of the House. I beg to move.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a>Line 5, after &quot;2&quot; insert &quot;or 10&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_279"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the Government&#039;s Amendment No. 122 allows for the issue of codes of practice covering enforcement powers. We are grateful. Our amendment would simply extend the remit of those codes to the investigative powers to be given to the authorised persons working for the levy boards.
</p>

<a name="60315-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>Over the years we have had considerable opportunity to criticise the way in which the Government have created offences and provided for swingeing penalties&#151;something the noble Lord and I discuss on a regular basis. I acknowledge with gratitude the Minister&#039;s amendment to Schedule 10, which restricts the way in which a Clause 85 order may penalise a defaulter. None the less, we feel that any power of entry into someone else&#039;s domain should be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1334"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1334</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

subject to a recognisable and enforceable code of practice. Such a code has the benefit of conformity to a standard in the way in which things are done. It has the added advantage that the punishments awarded by the courts may be more equable, although we still have a difficulty with the tariffs as laid down in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60315-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>Damaging an SSSI may lead to a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale, but failing to comply with a levy board&#039;s registration requirement could lead to a fine equalling the statutory maximum. The House may be interested to know that this compares with the promise made a couple of weekends ago by the Prime Minister to institute a system of &#163;1,000 fines for those guilty of assaulting NHS staff. I thank the Minister for his amendment and beg to move mine.
</p>




<p><a name="st_280"></a>
<a name="60315-33_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I rise to talk briefly to the noble Baroness&#039;s Amendment No. 123. My understanding is that the intention is that a similar code of practice should apply in relation to the power of entry available to levy boards under Schedule 10, which will now be restricted to business premises only. Indeed, I think she has discussed her amendment with my honourable friend. If such a code is felt to be desirable, then our feeling is that it would be more appropriate to deal with it in Schedule 10, headed &quot;Ancillary provisions relating to boards&quot;, rather than raising it within the scope of the government new clause that fits with Part 3, &quot;Wildlife etc&quot;, and the subheading, &quot;Pesticides harmful to wildlife&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60315-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>Our view is that there are rather different relationships between levy board staff and their levy payers. The board has wide incidental powers which should be sufficient in dealing with such investigative matters. We are now restricting entry so that authorised levy board officers cannot enter dwellings. In my view, such a specific mention of a code within Schedule 10 is not required. On that basis, I invite the noble Baroness either to withdraw her amendment tonight or to raise it again when we come to debate levy boards in Part 8&#151;on Monday, I hope&#151;in the context of my proposed changes to Schedule 10.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a>After Clause 46, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_12"></a><br>
&quot;PROHIBITION OF IMPORT OF EXOTIC WILD BIRDS

<br>
(1)   Subject to the provisions of this Part, if any person imports an exotic wild bird, he shall be guilty of an offence, unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that the trade in that species&#151;


<br>
(a)   does not constitute a threat to the conservation status of that species in its country of origin;


<br>
(b)   does not constitute a threat to native biodiversity in the United Kingdom; or
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1335"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1335</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(c)   does not constitute a risk to animal or public health in the United Kingdom.

<br>
(2)   In this section, &quot;exotic wild bird&quot; means a bird of a species which is not ordinarily resident in, and is not a regular visitor to, the European territory of any member state of the European Union in a wild state.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_283"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in Committee I proposed a blanket ban on the import of wild birds, which the Minister explained was not possible to implement for a number of reasons. So I have change my proposal from a blanket ban to a ban that sets out a number of criteria. An effective ban still remains my ultimate aim. In looking at the practicalities of achieving an effective ban I should mention a couple of points.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>Trade rules allow measures of protection that are proportionate to the problem that they are trying to solve. In this case, the problems caused by the trade are threefold&#151;the risk to the sustainability of bird populations in the countries form which they come, the risks to human health posed by avian flu, and the risks to animal health and biodiversity.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>Regarding the information on whether the trade could be sustainable, the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, who has been involved in bird life for many years through the RSPB, stated in Committee, at col. 34 on 27 February, that over 15 years we pretty much failed to find any way of establishing a sustainable trade.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>At this time of night, I shall not rehearse all the health risks in relation to avian flu, but that still poses a threat. In Committee, the Minister told us that the European Commission was meeting this month to discuss the extension of the ban. He also said that the Commission was arranging a meeting with stakeholders to discuss the possibility of either extending or making permanent that temporary ban. Can the Minister update me on any developments on those fronts and what the timescale is for the consultations, if they have not taken place?
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>Finally, I return to the issue of trade law and whether a ban can be supported, because Article 30 of the European treaty allows national governments to adopt proportionate measures to protect animal health&#151;so there could be a permanent ban on that basis. There have been a couple of cases in the European Court of Justice, where such disputes end up&#151;one of which, no doubt, the noble Earl, Lord Peel, will be interested in, because it concerned grouse. The second case concerned Danish bees, when it was held that the protection of domestic bees was a valid reason for an import ban, due to the threat from an invasive species. That threat might be in health terms or due to escapees, such as the well publicised case of the parakeet in the Richmond area, because such birds occupy an ecological niche that might otherwise be taken by other birds.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1336"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1336</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60315-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>So there are many reasons that the Government could choose to support a permanent ban. That is not impractical and I hope that the Minister will have a reply that will enable me not to press the amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_284"></a>
<a name="60315-34_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I, too, wish to speak on this group of amendments. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, has explained her amendment clearly. Linked to that are my Amendments Nos. 125 and 126, which stand in both our names, to which I shall speak.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>This Bill will, I hope, be an important part of countryside legislation for a number of years. I am sure we all share that view. It is quite possible that some time in the future someone may find a non-native species well established in some remote, undisturbed place. Judging by the comments being made now about American crayfish and mitten crabs, to which the noble Baroness referred earlier, it is conceivable that this new find could well be considered acclimatised and, in effect, to have gone native. The effects of climate change may well accelerate colonisation by invasive species, and it is conceivable that in coming decades, many flora and fauna will move house to the United Kingdom. Anchoring this clause to a specific date will strengthen it and make it relevant for many years to come.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 126, this amendment has changed subtly since Committee. I would like to focus the amendment on the seed trade, something which was nearly not considered; I think everybody thought of animal trade or insect trade. It no longer reads


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>&quot;the marketing, sale and introduction of wild bird species&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>Instead, it simply reads,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a>&quot;the marketing, sale and introduction of wild species&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>I address the current problems of hybrids and cultivars, which are being traded in the seed trade without adequate description. A central problem is that the introduction of hybrids, cultivars and their derivatives poses a serious threat to biodiversity by eroding genetic diversity. The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, explained that there are provisions in law to add hybrids to Schedule 9, as mentioned in paragraph (b) of the clause this amendment applies to. Yet I was disappointed by part of that response, in which the noble Baroness seemed to sideline a real issue. The noble Baroness said that any species could be added to Schedule 9, but added later:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a>&quot;There is currently no prohibition under Section 14 of the 1981 Act from planting hybrids in the wild or from causing them to be grown there&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 27/2/06; col. 60.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, asked a series of questions about how EU and UK regulations coincide. The noble Baroness asked if the same rules applied across the whole of Europe, or simply to the UK. Having checked the Defra website on plant breeders&#039; rights, under its &quot;Plant varieties and seeds&quot; section I found the following, rather confusing information:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1337"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1337</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a>&quot;The UK, however, allows UK Plant Breeders&#039; Rights to be suspended whilst Community Plant Variety rights are exercised, which allows UK rights to be re-invoked if Community Plant Variety rights are terminated&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, said that she would write to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, on that question, but unfortunately I was not quite sure of the outcome of that. I ask the Minister if she is able to give any firm indication as to when provisions will be made to tackle invasive plant species. The amendment would not&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, stated in Committee&#151;restrict the code of practice; rather it would widen the criteria. The clause presently states that the Secretary of State,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a>&quot;may issue a code of practice relating to&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>the following criteria. The list of those criteria, therefore, is not exclusive, but suggestive. This amendment would be an effective way to start tackling the problem of invasive plant species.
</p>




<p><a name="st_285"></a>
<a name="60315-34_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, I will begin by speaking to Amendment No. 124. We accept that the sustainability of the current trade in wild birds is a matter of considerable public concern. It is very difficult for the UK to take action addressing these issues in isolation from the rest of the EU. There are provisions that enable the UK to introduce stricter domestic measures on wildlife trade, but they raise complex legal issues that require careful consideration.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>At best, this measure would be difficult to enforce, given the free circulation of goods within the EU. At worst, the measure could result in infraction proceedings by the European Commission on the grounds that it is contrary to the provisions of the treaty or that it contravenes WTO rules. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, the European Commission is already looking at these issues in the light of the threat from avian influenza, and the import of all wild birds into the EU has been suspended until 31 May as a precaution.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>The Commission has also been asked to consider whether there are grounds for extending the ban on a more permanent basis. For that reason, we feel that it would be premature for the UK to introduce any stricter measures with respect to the importation of wild birds, pending the development of a wider EU position on this matter.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>The UK is of course very concerned about the levels of mortality among some imported wild birds and we have already asked the Commission to look into this. Officials have already met the three relevant directorates general to discuss these issues and have hosted a round-table discussion with key stakeholders to examine the impact of trade bans on illegal trade and livelihoods.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>In the meantime, I should point out that CITES, which is implemented within the EU by means of European Council Regulation 338/97, already provides a robust mechanism for protecting some 1,700 bird species considered to be at risk from unsustainable trade. Action has been taken in the past to suspend trade or impose quotas with countries that fail to implement CITES properly, and we will continue to support such action in the future.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1338"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1338</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60315-34_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>The European Commission also has powers under Article 4.6 of Council Regulation 338/97 to make regulations to prohibit the import of other species for which trade is considered unsustainable or where there is a threat to native biodiversity. These powers have already been used to prohibit the import of the ruddy duck and the American bullfrog into the EU, and we are currently considering using existing powers in the regulation further to prohibit the keeping of these animals within the UK.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>We also have domestic legislation in place to deal with threats to native biodiversity. Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it an offence to release or allow to escape into the wild any animal, including birds, that is not ordinarily resident in, or a regular visitor to, Britain. Supplementary to these existing provisions, Clause 49 of this Bill also includes provisions to regulate the sale of non-native invasive species.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>The timetable for consultation on the bird ban in the EU is in the hands of the Commission. It is awaiting an opinion from the European Food Standards Agency on the impact of bird trade on animal health and welfare and it is expecting a report in October.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>We believe that it would be premature to adopt an additional tier of regulation on top of the existing controls on the trade in exotic birds. Such overlapping legislation is likely to be confusing to traders and enforcers alike. We believe that we should have consultation before such a measure is taken and we want to await the outcome of the current deliberations within the EU.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>Nothing that I have said on Amendment No. 124 should be taken as minimising the strength of feeling of which we are aware not only in the House but among the British public.
</p>

<a name="60315-34_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>I shall seek to respond to the amendments spoken to in this group by the noble Baroness.

<a name="60315-35_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I apologise to the House. It was a complete oversight on my part. I would have said more about the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. I unfortunately got my papers the wrong way round, but I am happy if the Minister wishes to deal with them now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_287"></a>
<a name="60315-35_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, I assumed that we had an ad hoc grouping and was quite happy about it. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, need not apologise.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>Clause 50 provides a power for the Secretary of State to issue codes of practice relating to non-native species, or to approve such codes issued by others. The purpose of the codes is to inform and educate people so that they do not cause problems for our native biodiversity by inadvertently allowing non-native species to establish themselves in the wild. They provide guidance on how to avoid committing an offence, of releasing or allowing the escape of non-native animals, or planting or causing non-native plants to grow in the wild.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1339"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1339</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60315-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>Amendment No. 125 would set the clause&#039;s commencement as a baseline date so that codes may be issued or approved by the Secretary of State for any animals that were not ordinarily resident or regular visitors to GB at that date. That would mean that such codes could be issued in relation to any animal which became established in the wild after that date, and which was not listed in Schedule 9 to the 1981 Act. An example would be chipmunks. I admit that my grandchildren are trying to find out where the chipmunks are in the wild because of their Chip & Dale, but they have not found them.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>Under the terms of Clause 50 a code could be issued on how such animals should be kept in captivity. There has recently been a number of sightings of chipmunks in the wild. In time, they could become self-sustaining, and as a result would be considered to be ordinarily resident. That would mean that the Secretary of State could not issue a code for the keeping of chipmunks under Clause 50. Unless and until the species was listed on Schedule 9, the amendment would allow her to do so without such a listing.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>At first sight it looks attractive, but we consider the appropriate mechanism for dealing with non-native species, which become established in the wild, is to list them on Schedule 9, which will ensure that further releases remain illegal. That would also bring them back within the scope of Clause 50(1)(b), and additions to the schedule can be made by the Secretary of State at any time.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>Amendment No. 126 is similar to one tabled in Committee, and seeks to add an alternative category for which such codes may be issued. The new category for which the Secretary of State may issue or approve a code of practice is for the marketing, sale and introduction of wild species, hybrids and cultivars derived from hybrids, including those considered indigenous or naturalised to Great Britain, as well as those considered not ordinarily resident. Any plant, including hybrids, can be added to Schedule 9. A consultation on additions to Schedule 9 will be published before the summer.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>Amendment No. 126 would widen the scope of animal and plants to which codes may relate, and specifically includes wild species&#151;an uncertain term that is open to wide interpretation&#151;hybrids and cultivars of hybrids. Following our debates in Committee, I am assuming that that is to ensure that cultivated species of hybrid plants are covered, and from what the noble Baroness said, I think that that assumption is right.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>We consider that hybrid animal and plant species are already covered by Sections 14(1) and (2) of the 1981 Act, and therefore also by Clause 50. Most animal hybrid species are not ordinarily resident in the UK, and so will be caught by Section 14(1)(a) and subsection (a) of the list in proposed new Section 14ZB(1). Hybrid animals that are ordinarily resident can be listed in Schedule 9, as sika deer hybrids have been, and so would be covered by Section 14(1)(b) and subsection (b) in new Section 14ZB accordingly.

</p>

<a name="60315-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>In relation to plants, there is nothing to prevent hybrid plant species being listed in Schedule 9 so that they are covered by Section 14(2) and subsection (b). Finally, you will note that new Section 14ZB(c) permits the issuing of codes in relation to descriptions of animals and plants included in subsections (a) and (b). We believe that this could include hybrids and cultivars of those species. We think that this is the appropriate and simplest course to take.

<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>I understand that the noble Baroness&#039;s intention is to prevent the inadvertent introduction of hybrids of native plants, such as Spanish bluebells, which are hybridising with our native bluebells and transforming our native woodland. There is currently no prohibition under Section 14 of the 1981 Act on planting hybrid bluebells in the wild or from causing them to grow there.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>We believe, however, that our current legislation is adequate, because, as explained above, any plant, including hybrids, can be listed in Schedule 9 and, therefore, fall subject to Section 14. A review of Schedule 9 is currently being undertaken and a consultation on proposed additions and deletions is likely to be published in the next few months.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>The amendment also widens the scope of Clause 50 to include those species that are considered indigenous or naturalised. Presumably these are included so that codes may be issued in relation to species which are considered to have become ordinarily resident but are not listed on Schedule 9, for example, rabbits.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>I have tried to cover this as rapidly as I can. There is much more that I could add. I would like to take the opportunity to write to noble Lords who have shown an interest.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>In practice, codes of practice issued by the Secretary of State will be targeted at vectors of introduction rather than specific species&#151;for example, the code published last year was targeted at the horticultural sector; this year&#039;s code will be targeted at the exotic pet trade, and a future code will be aimed at transportation routes.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 127, which has not yet been spoken to.
</p>




<p><a name="st_288"></a>
<a name="60315-35_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I can clarify the position. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has not had a chance because I was out of order in trying to move my amendment. I do not know whether she wishes to speak to Amendment No. 127. We have not had a chance to debate it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_289"></a>
<a name="60315-35_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, because of the groupings, I have spoken only to my amendment. It would be clearer if I made my reply to the Minister&#039;s reply, without now trying to go into all the other issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_290"></a>
<a name="60315-35_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, I shall try to be brief. I apologise. There will be many cases where we want to issue codes relating to non-trade activities, such as the cultivation, breeding and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1341"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column 1341</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

keeping of species, hybrids and cultivars. We would not want to imply that codes could not be issued in relation to those.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>We appreciate that the intent behind Amendment No. 127 is to make those people who fail to comply with the code of practice issued or approved under Clause 50 liable to criminal or civil proceedings. That would elevate the codes to a status that we believe is totally inappropriate. Most introductions are not deliberate and these codes are intended to guide rather than to legislate. I draw a parallel with the <i>Highway Code</i>. Much as failure to comply with many of the provisions in those codes is not an offence in itself, it may be used as evidence in court proceedings under the Traffic Acts to establish liability. Failure to comply with a Clause 50 code may be used in court as evidence of whether a defendant can come within the terms of the defence of taking reasonable steps, and exercising due diligence to avoid committing an offence under Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. I hope that that will reassure the noble Baroness with regard to Amendment No. 127.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>I apologise for detaining the House at this hour, but there is great interest in this, and I will write to noble Lords if I have left out anything that would be of additional help. I hope that the noble Baroness will not need to press her amendment to a vote.
</p>




<p><a name="st_291"></a>
<a name="60315-35_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for the fullness of her reply. I shall start with the last point first. She is absolutely right about the codes, but it would be a very serious matter if someone did not abide by the exotic bird code, for example, and introduced bird flu that affected all our poultry flocks and possibly also human health. As she said, there are lines that can be followed.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>On the substantive amendment, the Minister mentioned that certain decisions would be taken at EU level by October. I hope that the Government will <br>&nbsp;<br>

press for the ban to stay in place at least until October, pending a more permanent decision. She also mentioned the movement of goods as a reason why we could not impose a permanent ban, but I believe that it is accepted more and more that live birds and live animals cannot be treated simply as if they were any other moveable goods. The case law that I quoted when I moved the amendment leads me to believe more firmly that there will be a separation between what is and is not reasonable. I encourage the Minister and her department to consider the developments of case law that would enable us to look to a permanent ban where we believe it to be in the interests of animal health or national biodiversity. I believe that the law is beginning to recognise that live creatures are different.
</p>

<a name="60315-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>There are a couple of myths which the Minister needs finally to dispel. One is that the trade in imported wild birds can be regarded in any way as sustainable. The second is that CITES species are in some way adequately protected. I do not want to repeat those arguments at this hour, but will say merely that there is not enough scientific evidence to assess the impact of the trade on CITES species listed in Appendix 2. I believe that every NGO in the business would accept that, as, I hope, would her department.

</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60315-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </b>   moved Amendment No. A14:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 251, line 1, leave out subsection (4).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The noble Lord said: I thank the Chairman for congratulating us on our stamina; we are only just getting going.
</p>

<a name="60315-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>This amendment in part touches on the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, in the previous group, which we discussed yesterday evening, led by Amendment No. A10. We have taken a slightly different approach, which is to strike out the whole of Clause 526(4) on a probing basis. We do so because we argue that the clause needs to be redrafted if it is to achieve what we believe the Government want to achieve. First, the exemptions in this subsection and subsection (5) would not include the directors of the company if they were not also employees, as they are neither,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;persons already connected with the company&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>under subsection (4)(a), nor eligible to participate in an &quot;employees&#039; share scheme&quot; as defined in Section 743 of the Companies Act 1985, which is not being repealed.
</p>

<a name="60315-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>There is a further problem. If the company&#039;s articles permit certain transfers to non-members&#151;for example, intra-group, or to family members and trusts&#151;can the requirement that the offer cannot properly be regarded,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;as being calculated to result . . . in securities of the company becoming available to persons not already connected with the company&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>be satisfied? One issue is that closely held companies with pre-emption rights disapply these with regard to family trusts as a means to maintain family ownership by bridging the generation gap. Trusts may be set up for one reason or another and the pre-emption rights are disapplied as far as those are concerned.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC468"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC468</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60315-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>What is the meaning of &quot;calculated&quot;? The Minister was very helpful about that in our discussions last night, when he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> defines &#039;calculated to&#039; as &#039;designed or suitable, intended&#039;&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/3/06; col. GC462.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>There is not a huge difference between us, so we will not advance this much further. Our question is whether there needs to be an intent on the part of an existing member to retain the shares, which the company has to have warranted to it, or whether the fact that the articles include committed transfer provisions is sufficient to satisfy the &quot;calculated&quot; test, which is feasible since the shares are offered subject to the articles of association. Moving on from &quot;calculated&quot;, what about the definition of &quot;connected&quot; in the family trusts example that I have used? That is important, as these circumstances are prevalent in the case of family and closely held companies.
</p>

<a name="60315-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>A third and final argument exists if the articles contain standard pre-emption rights on transfer. If the offer round is not taken up, the shares can go to third parties. Obviously, to protect the rights of a vendor shareholder, the articles will often permit external transfers if internal transfers cannot be fulfilled; otherwise the vendor would effectively be locked in because of the nature of the articles. Again, does this satisfy the &quot;calculated&quot; test, or is it a subjective test at the time of the share issue? This does not sit with the concept of the absolute presumption introduced in Clause 525, which we discussed earlier in the group of amendments beginning with Amendment No. A1. These are practical issues which have been raised with us by City practitioners. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain further the practical implications of the operation of Clause 526(4). On a probing basis, we seek to remove it for the time being. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60315-36_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Like subsection (3), this subsection is derived from Section 742A of the Companies Act 1985. It creates an exemption for offers to persons already connected with the company. This recognises the way in which private companies may grow organically. It makes it clear that offers to family members are not to be regarded as offers to the public. Such offers are unlikely to be public offers in any event, but the subsection creates an exemption for offers to members of the company, employees and debenture holders. We believe that directors will be persons connected with the company if they are members or employees. I would have thought that that would routinely be the case, as in existing law. These could amount to a very large number of people, but nevertheless this would not be treated as an offer to the public, provided that the particular requirements are met.
</p>

<a name="60315-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>In order to make an offer to persons already connected with the company using the exemption in subsection (4), two particular requirements must be met. The first is that, if the offer is made on terms allowing the person to whom it is made to renounce <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC469"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC469</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

their rights, those rights may only be renounced in favour of another person so connected. This refers to where an offer is made, giving someone the right to take up shares or debentures, but allowing that right to be transferred to another person. That is not just about, as indicated in the discussion that we had yesterday, preventing there being rights to transfer the shares; it is also a question of what consent was planned at the time the offer was made.
</p>

<a name="60315-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>This right may be valuable if it is a right to an allotment of shares or an issue of debentures at a discount to their current value. But subsection (4) is an exemption for offers made to persons already connected with the company, and so if the right to take up the offer is transferable, it should be transferable only to someone else who is already connected with the company. Section 742A of the Companies Act 1985 currently imposes the same requirement.
</p>

<a name="60315-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The second requirement is that the offer cannot properly be regarded, in all the circumstances, as being calculated&#151;this amendment seeks to probe the definition of &quot;calculated&quot;&#151;to result, directly or indirectly, in securities of the company becoming available to persons not already connected with the company. We see that as an objective test. It replaces the provisions of Section 742A of the Companies Act, which treated an offer to persons connected with the company as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving it, unless the contrary was proved. &quot;Connected&quot;, as I tried to outline in some detail yesterday, is an objective test, and I refer the noble Lord to <i>Hansard</i>. I hoped to deal with the matter as clearly as I was able. The purpose is to ensure that the exemption is not misused to make shares available to persons falling outside the exemption. We therefore believe that the subsection is necessary, and I hope that the noble Lord will not press his amendment. If I have not dealt with each of the points that he raised, perhaps he will prompt me again and I will endeavour to do so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60315-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. He was able to clear up most of my points. There were two that he did not address, but it may be necessary for us to have an exchange of correspondence on those, as they are quite detailed. The first was family trusts. He talked about family members, which was clear, but a trust is of its very nature independent of a company. It will have independent trustees and it may be used for tax planning purposes. Would that be a &quot;connected&quot; company?
</p>

<a name="60315-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Secondly, if there were pre-emption rights and the shares were offered around but were not taken up because the existing shareholders did not want to take them up, is the person therefore locked in, or can he go outside as the articles permit? Or, at that moment, is he then making an offer to the public? If that is the case, the shareholder in a private company is at a disadvantage, if the only people who are permitted to buy the shares are those who already hold them or who are connected with those who hold them already. That <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC470"></a>

is unlikely to maximise his price. If he was not to maximise the price, they would have been taken up in the first place.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60315-37.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60315-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   In relation to the pre-emption rights, the answer should be that so long as the existence of the ability to sell outside in due course if those pre-emption rights were not taken up was not an integral part of what was planned when the offer was made, it should be okay under the definition that it cannot properly be regarded in all circumstances as &quot;calculated to result&quot;. Obviously, if that was part of the thinking at the time, that would be a different matter. That is why the objective test has to be applied. If I am advised that I need to say more on that I will write to the noble Lord. On the issue of trusts, under subsection (6)(e) a person who is connected with the company includes a trustee when they are acting in their capacity as such in relation to a trust of which the principal beneficiary is any of the persons named elsewhere in that subsection. That would cover the position of a trustee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60315-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful for that last answer, which was very clear. The first answer is encouraging. Clearly, if one is a major holder of shares in a company, one may find oneself in a position where, when one sets out, it is unlikely that the existing shareholders will have the capacity to absorb or take up the whole of one&#039;s shareholding. That may present a problem. The Minister was able to give me at least two-thirds of a loaf, and on that basis I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>We now come to a series of amendments on issues that affect a number of practitioners in the corporate world, both merchant bankers and company lawyers. There has always been an issue among company law practitioners and corporate financiers about the exact number of individuals to whom an offer can be made without its being treated as being made to the public.
</p>

<a name="60315-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. A17, in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Sharman, is to use this legislation to clarify the position so that there can be some alignment of the various legislative positions governing the offer of securities to the public. In practical terms, this is a real issue when people are raising money. The various legislative requirements <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC471"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC471</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

are imprecise on exactly how many people an offer document can be sent to without that constituting an offer to the public.

</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60315-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My name is not attached to this amendment but, wearing my past practitioner&#039;s hat, I think that there is a great deal of merit in having a definition in the Bill. I grew up with lawyers saying, &quot;About 50 is the number you can use&quot;. But, if you asked, &quot;Is 49 all right?&quot; they would reply, &quot;Well, it depends&quot;. If you asked, &quot;Would 51 put me in the clink?&quot; they would reply, &quot;Oh&quot;, with an intake of breath. At a very practical level, this is an important part of providing funding for the junior end of British industry, because this is where business angels and all sorts of people get involved. There is an argument for trying to achieve a number on which people can rest with safety. The present uncertainty benefits no one except, possibly, the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, professionally in the subsequent cases that flow from it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60315-37_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I start by reiterating a point on which we touched yesterday. Certainty can be achieved in these matters by having a public rather than a private company. I imagine that, if in doubt, the noble Lord would advise his clients to do that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60315-37_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   If they can afford it.

<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60315-37_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Of course, but if they are concerned about uncertainty, that is one solution. However, I shall try to help on other matters as well.
</p>

<a name="60315-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>We touched in an earlier amendment on the possible interplay with financial services legislation, but perhaps I can go into further detail on how we see the connection. Let me start by explaining why we have not aligned the meaning of &quot;offer to the public&quot; with financial services legislation. The Company Law Review considered the case for aligning the company law prohibition on offers to the public by private companies with the concepts used under financial services law. It was initially in favour of fully aligning both sets of legislation to avoid confusion. However, in its final report, it stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;Closer examination of the nature and purpose of these two different sets of legislation revealed that this would undermine the distinction between public and private companies and create more problems than it solved. Thus we do not propose the full alignment of the prohibition on private companies offering their shares to the public&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>It went on to recommend that the prohibition on private companies offering their shares to the public should remain, with a power for the Secretary of State to prescribe detailed exceptions to the prohibition by statutory instrument, and that those exceptions should draw on what were then the POS regulations to the greatest extent possible. Going back in time, the financial services provisions were of course originally taken from the Companies Acts and then adapted for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC472"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC472</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

financial services purposes; they have now been adapted further in the light of European requirements in respect of securities law.
</p>

<a name="60315-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>In financial services law, these provisions are used in relation to the marketing of securities, whereas in this Bill we are looking at what it means for the nature of the company. This has led to understandable differences. The structure of the exceptions under the Financial Services and Markets Act&#151;which I think is where the 100 comes from&#151;is very different from the provisions in the Companies Act. For example, the exceptions under Part 6 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 relating to the requirements to produce a prospectus are concerned with the size of the offer or the persons to whom it is made. They do not look at whether it is calculated to result in shares becoming available to the public, or whether it is made with a view to there being an offer to the public.
</p>

<a name="60315-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Many of the exceptions are widely drawn when compared with the vast majority of private companies. For example, a prospectus is not required if the total price for the shares being offered does not exceed &#8364;100,000, or if the offer is made to fewer than 100 persons. That might, for example, be 100 merchant banks. It is clear that such large exemptions, when viewed from the perspective of what a company can do, would have a significant effect on the public offer prohibition.
</p>

<a name="60315-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>In contrast, under the companies legislation, what is important is whether there is a sufficient connection between the private company and the people to whom the securities are being offered, of the kinds recognised by subsections (4) and (5). Subsection (4) creates an exemption for offers to persons already connected with the company. That recognises the way in which private companies may grow organically. Within these requirements, the current definition has the flexibility to take into account the circumstances of the offer and the identity of the persons making and receiving it. It is our view that this flexibility should be preserved.
</p>

<a name="60315-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>For example, an offer to some 23,000 members of a credit union has been held in Australia not to be an offer to the public, whereas it has also been said that an offer even to just two persons might be an offer to the public, depending on the circumstances. As we have already discussed, we do not consider that private companies should be offering their shares to strangers or to the unconnected general public, even if it is just 100 of them. The amendment does not acknowledge the flexibility of the current law and would significantly erode the public/private distinction.
</p>

<a name="60315-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>However, we very much recognise that there is a need to ensure that any differences which emerge between the terms used for different purposes are justified. I can assure noble Lords that we very much intend in this context to keep an eye on the interrelationship with securities law as it develops. Therefore, I am not able to give certainty on a maximum/minimum number of people, because it <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60315-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   I understand the comments made by the Minister. However, with the benefit of experience, I do not think that the Government&#039;s answer really deals with the point. The fact is that, if you have a private company which wishes to raise money from external shareholders and you ask a law firm, a firm of accountants or a firm of merchant bankers to advise you on how many people can become shareholders without crossing the line so that the offer becomes illegal, you will get a five, six or seven-page memorandum advising you about what you can do.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Given that we are attempting to simplify company law, it seems to be a mistake by the Government not to respond, because the situation arises all the time in the arena. In effect, the Government are saying that they do not want to make any change to the current law in this area. That is fine. It will provide a lot of fees to lawyers, to bankers and to accountants, but it does not actually help to resolve the issue, because the Government are leaving us with the current relative state of uncertainty.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, says, if you are a private company and you want to raise some money, you will end up with an answer that you can probably have 49 shareholders providing the money, or maybe you can stretch it to 50. Is there actually any logic in that? The noble Lord says, &quot;Well, the answer is that you can always become a public company&quot;. There are often reasons why people do not want their company to become a public company&#151;cost is one of them. I am disappointed with the noble Lord&#039;s answer.

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. A24 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. A25 and A27 in the group. These amendments touch on a new issue regarding the range of remedies available to a private company that has contravened the prohibition on making offers to the public. Clause 528 provides a member with the right to seek a court order either under the clause itself or under Section 459 of the 1985 Act if the company contravenes the prohibition on a private company making a public offer. Along with my noble friend and the Law Society, I think that there seems no particular purpose in prescribing the order that the court must make in proceedings under Section 459. One of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

advantages of the section has always been the breadth and range of remedies available. We see no reason why that should not be continued in the new legislation.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The purpose of Amendments Nos. A25 and A27 is to broaden the range of remedies available to the member of a private company that has contravened the prohibition on making offers to the public. Clause 529 as drafted provides the court with the power to require a company to re-register or to order the compulsory winding up of a private company that has contravened the prohibition on offering securities to the public, but of course an order for winding up the company if re-registration is impracticable is likely to result in a forced sale of assets and may operate against the interests of the shareholders. So when shareholders have been misled into participating in an unlawful offer to the public&#151;if the Government do not accept the previous amendment, it will, in those cases, be unclear whether the shareholders have been misled into participating in an unlawful offer to the public because of the uncertainty that arises&#151;it seems harsh that they should bear the worst of the consequences of the company&#039;s default. The purpose of the amendments is to suggest that other remedies should be available to the court including, in appropriate circumstances, the ability to require repayment out of capital. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60315-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My name is attached to Amendment No. A26 in this group, which covers the same point as that of the last of the amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. It concerns the lack of breadth of opportunity for remedy, which is an issue that has been raised with us by the UK share association. Clause 529 sets out the alternative courses open to the courts if a company acts in contravention of the prohibition. However, page 147 of the Explanatory Notes states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;This clause applies where a private company breaches the prohibition on offering securities to the public. It enables members, creditors or the Secretary of State to apply to the court for an order for the re-registration or failing that, winding up of the company. This is a new procedure which will enable members, creditors or the Secretary of State to enforce the public offer prohibition&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Something new is being introduced here, which has caught our attention. As the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, points out, it may or may not be in the best interests of the luckless members or creditors of a company if the court is given no alternative to winding up a company, which might not be able to be registered as a public company.

<a name="60315-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>There could be cases where the strict terms of Clause 526 are breached in a quite minor way. Accordingly, the court should have discretion in the course of action that it pursues, other than having to order a company to re-register or to wind up. Therefore, our amendment follows the line followed by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. It seeks to remove the word &quot;shall&quot; from line 24 and insert,

<a name="60315-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I am wholly opposed to this idea. I do not think that the court ought to have discretion in these circumstances. The amendment is a <i>carte blanche</i> invitation to litigation, which ought to be discouraged. It does not happen just like that: certain steps have to be taken beforehand. In those circumstances, the amendment is misconceived.

<a name="60315-38_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   Does the noble Lord accept that we are simply trying to reflect the current position? We are asking that the current position should be maintained. This is not a new provision on our part.

<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60315-38_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I understand the position that the noble Lord has taken. But, as we discussed yesterday, this is&#151;dare I say&#151;slightly on the theoretical side. We are talking about a situation where a company has a minor breach. It cannot re-register as a public company for one reason or another. If the Bill continues in its present form, the company will have to be wound up. The court has no discretion. Let us imagine that the noble Lord is a shareholder in this company when it is wound up and its assets are then put out for distress sale. The market value or the real value of those assets may not be realised because everyone knows that the company is the subject of a winding-up order. That cannot be in the best interests of any party to this sad affair, let alone to the benefit of British industry and commerce as a whole.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60315-38_spnew9"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 528 enables members, creditors or the Secretary of State to apply to the court for an order restraining a private company from carrying out any proposed contravention of the prohibition on offering its shares or debentures to the public. It aims to prevent the company, by civil action, from carrying out proposals breaching the public offer prohibition.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>However, where the private company has already contravened the prohibition, Clause 529 enables certain members and creditors or the Secretary of State to apply to the court. If it appears to the court that the company has breached the public offer prohibition, the court must make an order for the re-registration of the company as a public company, or, if it appears to the court that the company does not satisfy the requirements for re-registration, and that it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC476"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC476</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

impractical or undesirable to require it to do so, an order for the compulsory winding up of the company. This is the new enforcement procedure for breaches and proposed breaches of the public offer prohibition. It replaces the criminal offence currently imposed in Section 81 of the Companies Act 1985.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>There is another way in which the public offer prohibition can be enforced, which is the mechanism that the first two amendments in this group seek to remove. If in proceedings brought under Sections 459 or 460 of the Companies Act 1985 it appears to the court that the company is proposing to breach the public offer prohibition, or has breached the public offer prohibition, it must make the orders required under Clauses 528 or 529, as the case may be. That provides another means of enforcement that, crucially, is not dependent on an application being made specifically under Clauses 528 or 529.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Section 459 of the Companies Act 1985 allows any member of a company to petition the court on the grounds that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a way that is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of its members generally, or of some part of its members. Section 460 likewise allows the Secretary of State to petition the court on those grounds. If the court is satisfied that the petition is well founded, it may make such order as it thinks fit for giving relief in respect of the matters complained of. It is possible that a Section 459 or 460 application could be brought where a private company proposes to make a public offer of securities which would be unfairly prejudicial to the interests of some members, or where the company has already made such an offer which is regarded as prejudicial to the interests of some members.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Where a private company proposes to contravene the prohibition, it should be restrained from doing so. If the company has made an offer to the public in breach of the prohibition, it should be required to re-register as a public company. The remedy should be clear and consistent. Uniform implementation would be frustrated if the court did not necessarily make a restraint order, or a re-registration order, on a petition brought under Sections 459 or 460 of the Companies Act 1985, whereas it would be required to do so following an application under Clauses 528 or 529, which is why they are aligned. This requirement will not restrict the court from making any other order on a petition brought under Sections 459 or 460 which it sees fit.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The amendment in respect of line 24 confers discretion on the court as to whether it makes any order at all following a breach of the public offer prohibition. We do not agree with that. Where the court is satisfied that there has been a breach, the company should face the consequences. The amendment at line 27 takes a slightly different approach by expanding the court&#039;s discretion as to what those consequences might be. In those cases where the court concludes that the company does not meet the requirements for re-registration as a public company, or that it is impractical or undesirable to require it to take steps to meet those requirements and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC477"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC477</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

re-register, the amendment would give the court a discretion to make such other order as it considers appropriate in place of an order for the compulsory winding up of the company.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I emphasise that subsection (3) sets an order for re-registration as the default. As the private company has done something that only a public company should do, re-registration as a public company is the appropriate remedy, along with the additional requirements that that entails&#151;for example, increased disclosure requirements. It is only if the company does not meet the requirements for re-registration, and it is impractical or undesirable to require it to take steps to do so, that the court must order the compulsory winding up instead. We recognise that this is a significant sanction, but I emphasise that this is only where re-registration is not a realistic option. Like the criminal offence it replaces, it is intended to be a deterrent.
</p>

<a name="60315-38_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>We are not sure why the noble Lord thinks that it is very onerous to re-register as a public company. In our view, it is entirely appropriate if a company wishes to offer its shares more widely. As we discussed yesterday, the distinction between private and public companies is important, not least for our obligations under Community law. We do not believe that it is desirable that this distinction should be eroded. We therefore believe that the remedies provided are appropriate. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment. I recognise that this does not provide the flexibility that he requires, but for these sanctions to be effective we think that we have got the right balance.

<a name="60315-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   Before the noble Lord decides what he is going to do with the amendment, I wish to ask the Minister a question. Does he agree that there is a difference between Clauses 528 and 529? Clause 528 concerns &quot;proposing to act&quot;. That is an <i>ex ante </i>action. I understand that; it is the post-event that is so difficult. The Minister made a good case on why one needs to have strong potential deterrence where a company is proposing to act. My concern is where a company finds that it has done something <i>ex post</i> of a minor nature and it is then left in this very difficult circumstance that, no matter how minor, the court has no discretion to get the company off the hook on which it may inadvertently have impaled itself.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>

<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60315-39_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   One of the issues is the question of numbers. We might find that we have a number which subsequently might not apply. We are talking about businessmen whose lives comprise running companies. They may go to a reputable firm of solicitors, investment adviser or investment bank and get advice on what might happen, but then subsequently find that they have exceeded the permitted number. They have not sought to impale <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60315-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I stress again to the noble Lord that there is no number which is allowed. We do not think that that is the right way to approach these tests, as we discussed earlier.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60315-39_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   There are actually two separate groups of amendments here. On the first one, Amendment No A24, I shall need to read the Minister&#039;s arguments. I thought that he said that the substance of the amendment is already dealt with in the law and that the court has other remedies available. As I say, I shall read what he said in <i>Hansard</i> and think about it.
</p>

<a name="60315-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>As regards Amendments Nos. A25 and A27, the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, put the case extremely well. The point that we are trying to make&#151;which does not seem to be taken on board by the Government&#151;is that in these circumstances where you have a private company in which there are a number of shareholders, there is a difference of interest between the company itself and the shareholders. If shareholders for whatever reason, rightly or wrongly, have been induced to invest in the private company&#151;and it will not be the shareholders who have contravened the law regarding private or public; it will be the directors of that company, probably advised by their merchant bank, their firm of lawyers or their firm of accountants&#151;we are concerned that the clause is over-prescriptive in terms of the remedy.
</p>

<a name="60315-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The Minister says that it will all be very easy and that all the board of directors has to do is to re-register the company as a public company. However, it may well be that they cannot, because they do not have the money to do so. There is a cost involved in re-registering as a public company. The company may well have no particular asset value because all the assets are in goodwill and therefore it has a value only on a going concern basis. I do not see why the clause has to be so prescriptive that there is only one remedy available&#151;either the private company re-registers as a public company or it has to be wound up. I cannot understand why the Government are not prepared to say that the court can have discretion regarding what available remedy may be used.

We are actually changing the law here to make it stricter than it has been until now. Perhaps the Minister can give us an example to show that in the past there has been a gap which has not been filled by the law, and say why the present powers have not proved to be adequate. I know of no examples where we are trying to provide a remedy for a breach made in the past.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>

take seriously what the Government have to say. However, there is uncertainty because the Government were not prepared to accept our earlier amendment regarding clarification on the number of shareholders in a private company to whom an offer can be made. Under the law if it is implemented in this form, there will always be uncertainty as to whether a company is or is not lawfully a private company and thus whether or not the offer to shareholders is lawful. I hope that the Government will think about the points that the noble Lord and I have made. In the meantime, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60315-39_spnew7"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Before the noble Lord does so, I should like to emphasise again that under the existing law, this would be a criminal offence. That is being changed. Further, certainly in the generality of cases, I struggle to understand why re-registration would not be possible, particularly if one is postulating circumstances in which a company is raising fresh capital from a range of people who may not be existing shareholders. It certainly would not be the norm that they would not be able to re-register. Obviously we will reflect on the points that have been made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60315-39_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   The answer to the Minister is straightforward. It is quite likely that, where companies have raised money, it will take a considerable time to establish whether the offer to the members of the public was valid or not valid, because of the uncertainties. By the time that moment is reached, the company has no money to re-register as a public company. That scenario is very likely to occur. In those circumstances, all we ask is this: should the only remedy available be that the company is wound up? That may not be in the interests of the shareholders who, in those circumstances, would be the innocent victims of the actions of the directors. We do not think it right that the only remedy should be that of winding up the company. For the time being, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

In particular, the directors may be held jointly and severally liable with the company for any loss or damage caused to the other party to the transaction as a result of the company failing to meet its obligations. In addition, the company and every officer of the company who is in default commits an offence.

The amendment is required to reinstate the penalty that is currently prescribed in Section 117(7) of the 1985 Act and corrects an omission in the drafting of the clauses in Chapter 2 of this Part. The amendment also reunites the criminal sanction with the civil penalty that is currently prescribed in Section 117(8) and ensures that the consequences of a company acting in contravention of Clause 531 can be found in one place. The proposed amendment to Clause 531&#151;that is, Amendment No. A28&#151;is a consequential amendment, which is required as a result of Amendment No. A30. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>that is, pounds sterling for the UK&#151;because of EU legislation. Our submission is that Article 6 of the Second Company Law Directive does not say that, as the Minister will be aware. The directive states that a minimum capital shall be subscribed, the amount of which shall not be less than 25,000 ECU. It does not require or state anywhere that the minimum share capital is to be prescribed in a particular currency. It would certainly be convenient for some companies if their authorised share capital could be denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling. Those who know my noble friend Lord Sharman, whose name appears first on the amendment, will not be surprised were he to suggest that the most obvious example would be the euro. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60315-40_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 533 retains the current requirement, contained in Sections 117 and 118 of the 1985 Act, that before a public company may do business, a minimum share capital, known as the authorised minimum, must be subscribed. There is the same minimum share capital requirement where a private company re-registers as a public company under Part 7 of the Bill or under Section 43 of the 1985 Act.
</p>

<a name="60315-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>This implements Article 6 of the Second Company Law Directive, which requires public companies to have a minimum share capital of not less than 25,000 ECU, which the noble Lord referred to. The directive goes on to lay down how the equivalent of 25,000 ECU in the member state&#039;s national currency is to be calculated. As noble Lords will be aware, the ECU was replaced by the euro with effect from 1 January 1999. While the directive does not prescribe that the minimum share capital requirements for a public company must be met in the member states&#039; domestic currency, in Re Scandinavian Bank Group plc, Mr Justice Harman took the view that Article 6 seemed to require EU member states to impose on public companies incorporated within the EU a minimum share capital in their own national currency.
</p>

<a name="60315-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I accept that the note on Clause 533 might have been better expressed, but I do not think that it is misleading. The sentence that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, referred to is a quote from the Second Company Law Directive, which was before the euro was invented. The first sentence sets out the current position.
</p>

<a name="60315-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>The Government are not aware that there is any particular demand for the authorised minimum to be denominated in the sterling equivalent of another currency on registration or re-registration. The approach taken in the Bill, therefore, assumes that on registration or re-registration as a public company the minimum share capital requirement should be satisfied in sterling.
</p>

<a name="60315-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>There does not, however, appear to be anything in Article 6 of the Second Company Law Directive that requires the authorised minimum to continue to be denominated in sterling once a public company has been registered or re-registered. Clauses 578 to 584 of the Bill therefore contain new provisions that enable <br>&nbsp;<br>

both public and private companies alike to easily redenominate their share capital from one currency to another. Those provisions enable a public company to redenominate all of its share capital, including the authorised minimum, into another currency of the company&#039;s choosing as soon as the company has been registered or re-registered. The practical effect is that you could end up denominated in whatever currency you chose. I hope that that goes some way towards addressing the noble Lord&#039;s concerns.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60315-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   That is certainly an interesting point. As I understand it, the Minister is saying that the company could, as long as it had denominated its share capital in sterling to begin with, immediately re-register with currency denominated in&#151;

<a name="60315-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The noble Lord said: Although this seems to be a technical point, it raises an issue of considerable importance to public companies. Those of us who sit on the boards of public companies will be aware that it is absolutely normal practice at every annual general meeting for a resolution to be passed pursuant to Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 relating to the authority of the company to make certain allotment in certain circumstances. That is absolutely common practice. The concern is that there are no transitional provisions to deal with companies that have those resolutions in the current year or in the period before this Bill comes into effect.
</p>

<a name="60315-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>To summarise the position, Clause 534 prohibits the exercise of any power to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for shares except in accordance with Section 535 or 536, as they will be. A number of companies&#151;virtually every public company unless it happens to have its annual general meeting on the day on which this provision comes into effect&#151;will have authorities that they have taken under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985. One way of dealing with that would be to exclude from the scope of the Clause 534 prohibition any allotment pursuant to a valid Section 80 authority granted before Clause 534 came into effect, so allowing an orderly run-off of old allotment authorities in the same way as I understand the 1980 Act&#151;for those of us who remember it&#151;contained a saving provision for pre-emption procedures operative before 1982.
</p>

<a name="60315-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>      This is a transitional point. It may seem to be a point of detail, but it is a point of significant practical difficulty for companies in the 2006 AGM season. I attended a board meeting yesterday at which we approved our notice of meeting containing the normal Section 80 authority. The meeting will take place in April. It would be helpful to have reassurance from the Minister that transitional provisions will deal with the problems that I have just described. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60315-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Generally speaking, the directors of an existing company&#151;that is, a company formed prior to the date on which the Bill comes into force&#151;may allot shares, or grant rights to subscribe for shares or to convert any security into shares, only if they are authorised to do so by ordinary resolution of the company&#039;s members or by the articles of association.
</p>

<a name="60315-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>As has been explained, the requirements for any authority to allot shares are currently set out in Section 80 of the 1985 Act. This provides, among other things, that an authority given under Section 80 must specify the date on which it will expire. This date may not be more than a period of five years from the date on which the authority is given, although the authority may be renewed for further periods of up to five years. In addition, Section 80A of the 1985 Act contains a relaxation for private companies from the requirement to state the date on which the authority given under Section 80 will expire. Where a private company has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC484"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC484</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

availed itself of this relaxation, the directors may be given an authority to allot shares for an indefinite period or for a fixed period of the company&#039;s choice.
</p>

<a name="60315-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Clause 534 replaces the provisions in subsections (1), (2), (9) and (10) of Section 80 of the 1985 Act. It provides that the directors of a company may allot shares, or grant rights to subscribe for shares or to convert any security into shares, only in accordance with Clauses 535 and 536, as has been recognised. A director who knowingly and willfully allots shares in contravention of the provisions of Clause 534 commits an offence. The allotment will, however, remain valid. For completeness, I should explain that Clause 535 deals with the power of directors to allot shares in a private company that will have only one class of share after the proposed allotment, and Clause 536 deals with the power of directors to allot shares in all other cases.
</p>

<a name="60315-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The question has been posed as to what happens to an authority to allot shares given under Section 80 of the 1985 Act when the Bill comes into force. It will clearly be important to make transitional arrangements for existing companies in certain circumstances. In particular, there will be a need to make provision for companies that are conducting their affairs in reliance on provisions in the 1985 Act which are repealed by the Bill. I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising this matter, and, indeed, to the Law Society for considering the issue.
</p>

<a name="60315-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>The Government are not, however, convinced that we need to make arrangements such as those proposed in the amendment. Noble Lords will see that the Government have tabled an amendment to Part 36 of the Bill, which will address these concerns. Amendment No. A272 will ensure that there is continuity of the law and that existing companies are not left in any doubt about what is required of them. Therefore, while I have sympathy with the intention behind the proposed amendment, I think that we should address any remaining concerns that the noble Lord may have when we reach Part 36. I reiterate the point made earlier in Committee that the general principle behind the Government&#039;s thinking on the issue of transitional arrangements is that, wherever possible, we want to avoid existing companies suffering unnecessary disruption to the way they currently operate as a result of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="60315-41_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. I understand him to say two things: first, that this matter should be dealt with under Amendment No. A272, after Clause 882, which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury; and, secondly, that he accepts the general principle on this point that Section 80 authorities should continue through. When we look at Amendment No. A272 on this point, we need just to ensure that the transitional arrangement is in place. I have not yet looked at Amendment No. A272. On current progress, I had assumed that I would have to do that after my summer holidays; I thought that it would be a bit premature to do so now, because I might have forgotten it by then. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60315-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>This issue has been raised with us by Travers Smith. We are putting forward two alternatives. I thought about degrouping them, but going over the same issue twice would be unhelpful to the Committee and would slow matters down. So Amendment No. A32 and the motion whether Clause 535 should stand part fit together, as do Amendments Nos. A35 and A214. Both sets seek to achieve the same goals, but as mini-groups they are mutually exclusive and are being put forward as alternatives for the Government to consider. Either Clause 534 should be amended and Clause 535 struck out, or Clauses 535 and 762 should be amended.
</p>

<a name="60315-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The carve-outs in Clause 535 from the requirement for shareholders to approve share allotments under Clause 536, and under Clause 543 from the statutory pre-emption rights, are both based on a private company having only one class of shares both before and after the allotment. We have been advised that the &quot;one class of shares&quot; test has been introduced probably in order to deregulate share issues for private companies with simple share structures and without a diverse shareholder profile. But we wonder whether this is the right approach.
</p>

<a name="60315-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>First, we see no reason why a company with, for example, ordinary and preference shares should not be prevented from issuing more ordinary shares without specific shareholder approval if the issue would not be prohibited under the terms of the rights attaching to the preference shares or otherwise by the company&#039;s articles. Equally, there are many private companies&#151;for example, private equity-backed companies&#151;that ostensibly have a single class of shares, but where complex additional rights for particular shareholders may be set out in the shareholders&#039; agreement or attached to debt instruments. We accept that by virtue <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC486"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC486</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of Sections 128(1) or 380 of the Companies Act 1985 such rights may of themselves give rise to a separate class of shares, but it is often unclear in practice whether rights attach to a shareholder personally or to the shares that he holds. That is particularly true in the case of private equity companies. In future, it would be necessary to look to the tests set out in Clause 762 to determine whether a separate class exists, but this test as drafted is very general and would not be of much assistance in cases of doubt.
</p>

<a name="60315-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>We argue that a more sensible approach is to deregulate in their entirety share issues for closely held private companies and to permit all private companies to elect into the current shareholder approval regime, as now replicated in Clause 536, if the shareholders wish to prevent dilutive share issues. If the test in Clause 762 is to retain its importance in terms of the rules on allotment and pre-emption in spite of the observations that I have just made, it would be helpful if Clause 762 were more explicit about the circumstances in which a separate class of shares will be deemed to arise, perhaps by reference to rights notified under Section 128 of the 1985 Act, as amended.
</p>

<a name="60315-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Also, Clause 535, in combination with the abolition of authorised share capital, will mean that for private companies with only one class of shares there will be no statutory limitation on the powers of the directors to allot shares other than the pre-emption conditions. In order to avoid dilutive share issues, some companies will wish to introduce some limitation on the directors&#039; powers to allot shares. A query arises as to whether, if such a limitation were to appear in the company&#039;s articles as envisaged by Clause 535, or in a shareholders&#039; agreement to which the company itself was a party, the limitation would constitute an unlawful fetter on the company&#039;s statutory powers following the Russell v Northern Bank Developments case. It would be helpful if the provision could make clear that such a restriction will be valid, notwithstanding the outcome of the Russell case. These are two alternative options for tackling a problem that we have been told exists, and therefore in the first instance I beg to move Amendment No. A32.

</p>

<a name="60315-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Amendment A32 is concerned with Clause 534, which provides that the directors of a company may allot shares only in accordance with the provisions of Clauses 535 and 536. The proposed amendment seeks to take private companies out of the statutory controls on the allotment of shares completely, unless the company decides to opt into the regime.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC487"></a>

</p>

<a name="60315-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The Government are committed to removing unnecessary burdens on business, particularly in respect of small private companies. Clause 535 therefore removes&#151;for private companies that will have only one class of share after a proposed allotment of shares&#151;the current requirement for the directors to obtain prior authorisation for the allotment from the company&#039;s members, whether through the articles of association or by resolution of the company. The power given to directors in Clause 535 is, however, subject to any contrary provision in the articles of association. This means that, if they wish, the members may restrict the power given to the directors in Clause 535, or prohibit the directors from making a specific allotment of shares, or allotments generally, pursuant to this power, by inserting an appropriate provision in the company&#039;s articles.
</p>

<a name="60315-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The proposed amendment to Clause 534 starts from the premise that private companies are not subject to the statutory regime governing the directors&#039; power to allot shares unless they opt in, either by provision in the articles or by resolution of the company. Thus, where a private company did not opt in&#151;which may be a deliberate decision or, more worryingly, due to inadvertence&#151;the directors of any private company would be free to allot shares, or grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any security into, shares, without first obtaining an authority from the company&#039;s members. It is proposed that this general rule should apply irrespective of the fact that the company may have several classes of share or may have provisions in its articles restricting the power of the directors to allot shares.
</p>

<a name="60315-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The Government consider that this is a step too far. There is a balance to be struck between the interests of the company, its directors and individual members. We believe that the Bill strikes the right balance in requiring the directors to seek prior authorisation from the members where the proposed allotment may affect the balance of rights between different classes of shareholder. In short, we have to draw the line somewhere. Clause 536, therefore, requires the directors to obtain prior authority for a proposed allotment of shares where the company is a private company which will have more than one class of share after the proposed allotment or where the company is a public company. This carries forward the requirements of subsections (1) and (3) to (8) of Section 80 of the 1985 Act in respect of such companies. The requirements in Clause 536 are not particularly onerous for the relatively small number of private companies having more than one class of share. The Government consider that the provisions in this clause do not impose a major burden on business.
</p>

<a name="60315-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>On whether Clause 535 should stand part of the Bill, I have already mentioned that this clause empowers directors of a private company to allot shares or to grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares if certain conditions are met. The provisions in the clause are new. This change recognises that there are benefits to be gained from empowering the directors to allot shares in certain <br>&nbsp;<br>

circumstances, as this saves members and directors alike valuable time when the company is seeking to raise new capital.
<a name="time_4"></a>
<a name="60315-42_time0"></a><h5>5 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60315-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>There is, as I have said, a balance to be struck between empowering the directors to make key decisions about when and how a company raises new capital and protecting the rights enjoyed by existing shareholders&#151;for example, any voting rights or right to receive dividends that may exist. The Government believe that the clause strikes the right balance between those competing interests by enabling the members to restrict or prohibit the power given to the directors in Clause 535 through the company&#039;s articles of association. In addition, the power given to the directors by Clause 535 is subject to the proviso that the exercise of the power should not jeopardise the relative power of shareholders in different classes, <i>vis</i>-<i>&#224;</i>-<i>vis</i> one another: thus it applies only where the company has one class of share and will continue to have only one class of share after the proposed allotment.
</p>

<a name="60315-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>I should add that the provisions in Clause 535 implement a recommendation of the Company Law Review that has been welcomed by the vast majority of interested parties. The clause recognises that, in the case of the vast majority of private companies that have an issued share capital of &#163;1,000 or less, there is no need for the safeguards that rightly apply to public companies and private companies with more complex share capital structures. I therefore hope that the noble Lord is persuaded that the clause is beneficial to the members and directors of private companies alike and that he can agree that Clause 535 should stand part of the Bill
</p>

<a name="60315-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Amendment No. A35 is intended to ensure that where the members have seen fit to restrict or prohibit the power given to the directors to allot shares under Clause 535, by making provision to that effect in the company&#039;s articles of association, such a restriction or prohibition should stand, notwithstanding any common-law rule that may override the articles. As I mentioned, Clause 535 is a new provision and the intention is that a private company with only one class of share may restrict or prohibit the power given to the directors in this clause through the company&#039;s articles.
</p>

<a name="60315-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The Government consider that any such restriction or prohibition would be effective in accordance with its terms in the same way as any other restriction on the powers of the directors contained in the articles. Moreover, we are not aware of any common-law rule that would have the effect of overriding the articles in this way. The noble Lord mentioned the Russell case, I think. I have no detailed briefing on that, so perhaps we can peruse it outside the Committee and write further on it, if that is the particular issue that he is probing. We are not aware of any common-law rule that would override the effectiveness of the articles. In the circumstances, the Government see no need to make the amendment to Clause 535.

</p>

<a name="60315-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Finally, Amendment No. A214 would add to the definition in Clause 762 of what is meant by &quot;shares of one class&quot;, which applies for the Companies Acts and is therefore relevant to Clause 535. Clause 762(1) states that shares are of one class,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;if the rights attached to them are in all respects uniform&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Amendment No. A214 would add a further layer to that definition by stating when shares will be deemed to be of a &quot;separate&quot; class&#151;that is, where a company has more than one class of share. It provides that shares would be deemed to be of a separate class if they were allotted with rights requiring registration under Section 128 of the Companies Act 1985.
</p>

<a name="60315-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>We do not consider this amendment to be necessary in determining what is a class of share for the purposes of the Companies Acts. First, the requirement to file particulars of share rights under Section 128 should not be regarded as being determinative of whether there is more than one class of share, as the requirement applies only if the company allots shares with rights that would not otherwise be notified to the registrar of companies&#151;for example, by virtue of an alteration to the articles or by a resolution requiring to be registered with the registrar. Secondly, the obligation to register such particulars under Section 128 does not apply,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;if the shares are in all respects uniform with the shares previously allotted&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>This follows the wording in Clause 762.
</p>

<a name="60315-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>In our view, it is already implicit in Clause 762(1) that, if the rights attached to shares are not in all respects uniform, the company does not have one class of share and must necessarily have more than one class of share. We therefore do not consider it necessary to go further and specify the circumstances in which shares will be deemed to be of a separate class by reference to Section 128.
</p>

<a name="60315-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>In summary, the Government are not minded to accept Amendments Nos. A32, A35 and A214. However, I hope that the Committee is persuaded that Clause 535 is beneficial to the members and directors of private companies and that in the circumstances it will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill. We will doubtless have the chance to revisit the issue of separate classes of shares when&#151;or if&#151;we reach Clause 762 in due course.

</p>
<ul>

</p>

<a name="60315-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to government Amendment No. A33, I will speak also to government Amendments Nos. A41 and A69. The first amendment in the group, Amendment No. A33, relates to Clause 534. It removes the reference to the &quot;deemed allotment&quot; of shares to the subscribers and is designed to achieve consistency with other clauses which refer to the shares being &quot;taken&quot; by the subscribers to the memorandum on formation&#151;for example, Clause 11(3).
</p>

<a name="60315-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Noble Lords will recall, however, that, in the context of the debate on Amendment No. 113, the Government agreed to consider whether the Bill should be amended to clarify whether the shares that are taken by the subscribers on formation are deemed to have been allotted to the subscribers. In light of the conclusions that we arrived at in relation to that opposition amendment, it may be necessary to revisit the reference to the subscribers&#039; shares in that context also. I therefore put down a marker that we may need to return to this provision at a later stage, but for the moment we consider that this provision should be drafted in a way that is consistent with the terminology adopted in the current draft of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60315-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The second amendment in the group, Amendment No. A41, relates to Clause 545, which replaces subsections (2) and (3) to (5) of Section 95 of the 1985 Act. Clause 545(1) carries forward the provisions of Section 95(2) of that Act, which refers to &quot;equity securities&quot;. The amendment is required to achieve consistency with the terminology used in that section. Amendment No. A69, the third and final amendment in the group, relates to Clause 562. Like the first amendment in the group, it is designed to achieve consistency with other clauses&#151;in particular, Clause 270, which prescribes the procedure for circulating written resolutions. Amendment No. A69 substitutes the formulation &quot;served on&quot; for the words used in Clause 270: namely, &quot;sent or submitted to&quot;. These are minor amendments to improve the drafting of the Bill, which I hope will receive the Committee&#039;s support. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>after the word &quot;shares&quot; on line 35. It is possible that a company&#039;s articles of association may permit the issue of more than class of shares, but that, in fact, only one class of shares has been issued. Given the considerable power that this section gives to directors, one would expect it to apply in circumstances where only one class of shares has been or can be issued. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="60315-43_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 535 empowers the directors of a private company to allot new shares in a company or to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into such shares without the need to obtain prior shareholder approval. This power may be exercised only where the company has only one class of share, as we discussed previously, and the noble Lord&#039;s amendment seeks to clarify what is meant by this reference by providing that it is immaterial whether the shares are issued or unissued for the purpose of satisfying the &quot;one class&quot; test.
</p>

<a name="60315-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The problem that the Government have with this proposition is that in future there will be no such thing as unissued share capital, as the memoranda of companies formed under the Bill will not contain a ceiling on the number of shares that such companies are authorised to allot. This means that, for a company formed under the Bill, all the company&#039;s share capital will comprise issued shares, so the clarification that the noble Lord seeks will be unnecessary. If a company has only one class of share, which by definition will be issued shares, the directors will have the power to allot further shares of that class under Clause 535. If, however, they wish to allot shares of a different class, they will need to obtain an authority from the company&#039;s members under Clause 536.
</p>

<a name="60315-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>This answer of course does not address the question which we thought this amendment might be probing&#151;that of existing companies which may have authorised but unissued share capital on the date that this provision comes into force. However, we think that it would be confusing to suggest in the Bill that the power given to the directors by Clause 535 extends to any part of an existing company&#039;s authorised share capital that remains unissued at the time this clause comes into force.
</p>

<a name="60315-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I realise that this leaves the matter of the transitional arrangements that may need to be made for existing companies with authorised but unissued share capital that want to allot shares pursuant to the authority contained in Clause 535. As I said in relation to an earlier amendment, the Government are considering the arrangements that will be required to apply the provision to existing companies. For now, however, I should like to reassure the noble Lord that wherever possible we will ensure that transitional arrangements for existing companies cause minimum disruption to those companies.

I fear that as I embark on the technical explanation, we shall be interrupted by the Division Bell, but I shall make a start. In looking at Clause 535, which at first seems very straightforward, the combined brain power has come up with at least five difficulties. Amendment No. A34 is designed to meet those difficulties. I shall list the potential problems and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>

<a name="60315-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>First, we suspect that it needs to be made clear that the implementation of these proposals will not allow directors to exercise the power to allot shares to the extent that doing so would contravene an authority conferred under Section 80 that was subsisting on the day the new clause came into force. It would seem on the face of it that this clause would do that.
</p>

<a name="60315-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Secondly, there is an obvious lacuna. Subsection (b) states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;except to the extent that they are prohibited from doing so by the company&#039;s articles&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>There does not appear to be any reason why authorities also conferred by an ordinary resolution should not be covered by the prohibition. Why should the prohibition be only in the company&#039;s articles and not in an ordinary resolution that has been passed by the company?
</p>

<a name="60315-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>As an aside, there is an issue where the company&#039;s articles&#151;or, if this amendment is accepted, an ordinary resolution&#151;have contained an authority to allot shares up to a specified maximum. Does that constitute a prohibition against allotting shares beyond the scope of that authority, as defined by the words &quot;prohibited from doing so&quot; at the top of page 255 of the Bill? That is a technical, but important, point.
</p>

<a name="60315-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Third, by limiting Clause 535 to private companies with a single class of share, and repealing Section 80A of the Companies Act 1985, it appears that shareholders of private companies with more than one class of share&#151;

<a name="60315-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   As I was saying before the Division Bell, the wise heads of the Law Society have come up with five concerns about what seems, on the face of it, to be a simple clause. I had finished two of them and will start again on the third.
</p>

<a name="60315-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>By limiting Clause 535 to private companies with a single class of shares only and repealing Section 80A of the Companies Act 1985, the Bill will mean that shareholders of private companies with more than one class of shares will no longer be able to give the directors an authority to allot shares up to a stated maximum for an indefinite period, which they can currently do under Section 80A. This obviously gives private companies less flexibility than at present and nobody can think of an obvious reason why that should be the case.
</p>

<a name="60315-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Fourthly, in general terms, Clause 535 should perhaps be amended to retain the current flexibility of private companies. Otherwise there will, at least, be the need for a transitional provision allowing directors to continue to allot shares, pursuant to an existing Section 80A authority. I have no doubt, in view of the Minister&#039;s answers to previous questions, that Amendment No. A272 will be prayed in aid on that point. When we get to that amendment, the myriad advisers behind the Minister will presumably remind him that this is another clause that must be included in the ambit and effect of Amendment No. A272.
</p>

<a name="60315-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Fifthly, those transitional provisions will be needed to deal with references not only to existing articles of association&#151;which are relatively easy to deal with in an amendment to the Companies Act&#151;but to shareholders&#039; agreements and other contractual documents on authorised share capital, which will have been put in place to deal with the regulation of private companies. That is, in practice, a fundamental point to practitioners. We must ensure that there is clarity not only on those articles of association, but on those other agreements and contractual documents&#151;I think that is a home win&#151;on authorised share capital.

<a name="60315-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   There are a number of elements to this amendment, some of which relate to transitional measures; notably, the effect of a subsisting Section 80 authority on the directors&#039; power to allot shares following the coming into force of the Bill; and others which purport to extend the circumstances in which the power of the directors to allot shares may be constrained. On the former, the question of what happens to any authority given to the directors of an existing company to allot shares under the 1985 Act, and which is subsisting at the date that the Bill comes into force, is important. I am grateful that this point was raised in the context of these provisions.

<a name="60315-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>It is important that things done in reliance on provisions in the 1985 Act which are repealed by the Bill continue to have legal effect. As was anticipated, Amendment No. A272 will achieve this; I hope noble Lords will accept that amendment when we come to it. There is therefore no need to carve out an exemption to the general authority conferred on directors under Clause 535 to reflect a subsisting Section 80 authority.
</p>

<a name="60315-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>While it is not referred to in the amendment, I will touch on Section 80A of the 1985 Act, as the Government are aware that certain parties are concerned that, in one respect, the regime under the Bill is slightly more restrictive for private companies that have, or will have, more than one class of share after the proposed allotment than is the case under the 1985 Act&#151;one of the five points of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. Section 80A contains a relaxation for private companies from the requirement in Section 80 to state the date on which an authority to allot shares will expire. Under Section 80(4), the authority may only be given for a period not exceeding five years, although it may be renewed for a further period of up to five years. Section 80A allows private companies to fix a definite date, or grant an authority for an indefinite period. In order to avail themselves of this relaxation, the members must pass an elective resolution under Section 379A of the 1985 Act. Section 80A will be repealed along with Section 80.
</p>

<a name="60315-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The Government accept that, in simplifying the law for companies that have only one class of share, we have lost some of the flexibility currently afforded to private companies that have a more complex share capital structure. This is the quid pro quo for streamlining the rules for the vast majority of private companies on the register, which are likely to be small and have an issued share capital of &#163;1,000 or less. It is unlikely that such companies will have, or want to create, more than one class of share.
</p>

<a name="60315-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>Where a private company will have more than one class of share after the proposed allotment, the members of such companies will continue to be able to give the directors an authority to allot shares for a period of up to five years and may extend this authority for a further period of up to five years at a time. The requirement to extend the period of the authority is not especially onerous, and the Government are not convinced that there is a need to reintroduce the relaxation currently contained in Section 80A.
</p>

<a name="60315-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>As I have said, Clause 535 confers a power to allot shares on the directors of a private company, but that power is constrained to the extent that the members may restrict or prohibit this power in the company&#039;s articles. The noble Lord&#039;s amendment would enable the shareholders to prohibit the directors from allotting shares by passing an ordinary resolution to that effect. This would lead to confusion as to the extent of the directors&#039; authority to allot shares. In the absence of a statutory requirement, there is no obligation to file copies of such resolutions with the Registrar of Companies, and so third parties would <br>&nbsp;<br>

not be put on notice of such a fetter on the directors&#039; power to allot. The consequences which would flow if the directors were to make an allotment in breach of such a resolution are also unclear. The requirement for any restriction on the directors&#039; power to allot to appear in the articles avoids these criticisms, and we do not therefore consider it helpful to permit the directors&#039; authority to allot to be restricted by a simple majority of the shareholders.
</p>

<a name="60315-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The amendment also extends the exception from the directors&#039; general power to allot to cover cases where the allotment would be &quot;inconsistent&quot; with:

<a name="60315-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>This is misconceived. Clause 535, unlike Section 80, is not drafted in terms which require the directors to be given an authority before they may allot. The directors are authorised by virtue of Clause 535, and the only exception thereto is if the articles restrict that power, so the clause approaches the matter from the opposite direction, if you will. Consequently, subject to the point which I made earlier regarding the continuing effect of a subsisting Section 80 authority, the amendment&#039;s reference to &quot;authorities&quot; does not fit with the construct of the clause.

In a sense, the detail of the key transitional provisions is yet to come, but I enunciated the principle behind our position earlier.

Therefore, it seems illogical that they should be restricting it to the maximum number of shares. Obviously, if they issue shares at 1p as opposed to &#163;1, there are 100 shares at 1p or one share at &#163;1, if my arithmetic is correct.

</p>

<a name="60315-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to provide flexibility to vary the interest rate payable by directors on any money that they are personally liable to repay, when money is not repaid after an allotment of shares when the issue has not been fully subscribed. Clause 537 refers to the interest rate specified under Section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838, and we understand that it is currently 8 per cent, having last been fixed in 1993. It is only a discretionary rate for judgments, and clearly it seems very high in the light of interest rates which, I am sure the Minister will accept, have been low as a result of the macroeconomic policies pursued by his Government. We would have thought that the present rate of 5 per cent should probably remain, but it would seem sensible that the Secretary of State in the circumstances should have the power to vary it by statutory instrument. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60315-45_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 537 applies only to public companies. It prohibits the allotment of shares offered for subscription unless the requirements set out in subsection (1) are met. If the requirements are not met, the company must not allot the shares and must repay all the money that it receives from the applicants for the shares. If the company does not repay the money within 48 days after the making of the offer, the directors become liable to repay it with interest.

</p>

<a name="60315-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The amendment would give the Secretary of State a power to make regulations varying the interest payable by the directors. At the moment, Section 84(3) of the Companies Act 1985 fixes the interest rate at 5 per cent, as has been recognised. We consider it undesirable for the Bill to impose a fixed rate of interest. That is why the change has been made to set the interest payable at the rate for the time being specified under Section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838. Again, as has been referred to, the rate of interest on judgment debt is currently at 8 per cent. The rate of interest is reviewed from time to time, and is capable of change by an order made under Section 44 of the Administration of Justice Act 1970. It was last changed in 1973, when interest rates were a lot higher than they are currently.
</p>

<a name="60315-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>We recognise that the current rate of 8 per cent could be viewed as high when compared to the Bank base rate, and Her Majesty&#039;s Courts Service is currently reviewing the judgment rate in the light of the Law Commission&#039;s report <i>Pre-Judgment Interest on Debts and Damages </i>of 2004. I will certainly draw what has been said by noble Lords in today&#039;s debate to the attention of Her Majesty&#039;s Courts Service. As the interest rate will change whenever the rate set by the Judgments Act changes, we do not consider it necessary to take a specific power just to change the interest rate applicable for the purpose of the clause. I hope that will satisfy the noble Lord.

company are offered for subscription and payment is to be made wholly or partly otherwise than in cash. The first two lines of subsection (4) are taken without any change from the equivalent part of Section 84(4) of the Companies Act 1985. The amendment would replace those words with a slightly different formulation, but without making any substantive change to the operation of the provision. The question is whether the amendment is a drafting improvement. There is a difficulty with it.

<a name="60315-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The clause applies where there has been an offer for subscription of shares of a public company. The amendment refers instead to &quot;shares subscribed&quot;. It is less accurate to refer to &quot;shares subscribed&quot; because the whole point of the clause is that the shares should not be allotted unless the requirements of subsection (1) are satisfied. These requirements focus on the offer either that the issue is subscribed for in full or that the offer is made on certain terms and those terms are met. Subsections (2) to (4) set out what happens if the shares being offered for subscription are prohibited from being allotted because the requirements of subsection (1) are not met.

For example, in these two clauses there are references to &quot;prescribed information&quot; in line 10, and &quot;prescribed particulars of those rights&quot; in line 27. The Bill gives no indication of what that information is likely to be, or should be; simply that it is &quot;prescribed&quot;, presumably by the registrar. For example, in <br>&nbsp;<br>

I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="60315-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 539 replaces Section 88 of the 1985 Act. As now, within one month of an allotment of new shares in a limited company, the company is required to make a return of allotments to the Registrar of Companies. A return of allotments made under this clause must be accompanied by a statement of capital, which is in essence a snapshot of a company&#039;s total subscribed capital at the date to which the return of allotments is made up. This statement includes prescribed particulars of the rights attached to each class of the company&#039;s shares. Such information is currently required to be filed under either Section 123 of the 1985 Act, which relates to increases in authorised share capital and which is repealed by the Bill, or Section 128(1) and (2) of that Act, relating to allotments of a new class of shares and which will be repealed as a consequential amendment.
</p>

<a name="60315-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Currently, Section 88 provides that the return of allotments must state the number and nominal amount of the shares comprised in the allotment, the names and addresses of the allottees and the amount, if any, paid or due and payable on each share. In addition, where the shares are allotted as fully or partly paid up otherwise than in cash, the company must deliver the contract that it has with the allottee, or prescribed particulars of that contract if it is not in writing, to the Registrar of Companies.
</p>

<a name="60315-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>In framing those provisions we have sought to address the concerns expressed by the Law Society regarding this latter requirement. We accept its point that contracts may contain commercially sensitive information which the company would not normally want to disclose. Following discussions with the Registrar, the Government have concluded that there is no need to continue with this requirement, so Clause 539 does not require companies to provide the Registrar with a copy of the contract where shares are allotted for a non-cash consideration.
</p>

<a name="60315-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Clause 539 does not set out the detail of the information which must be included in the return of allotment. Instead, the Secretary of State has the power to prescribe by statutory instrument the information which must be included in the return of allotments. This follows from the definition of &quot;prescribed&quot; in Section 744 of the 1985 Act, which will continue to apply for the purposes of the Bill. It is this provision which is the subject of the amendment. It is envisaged that such information will include, as now, details relating to the shares allotted and the identity of the allottees. It will also need to include details of any consideration received in respect of shares which are allotted as fully or partly paid up otherwise than in cash due to the removal of the requirement to file a written contract.

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Clause 540 requires unlimited companies to make a return of allotments to the registrar where the directors allot a new class of shares. That reflects current law; that is, the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of Section 128 of the 1985 Act. The reference to the return of allotments containing &quot;prescribed&quot; particulars of those class rights, which the noble Lord&#039;s amendment seeks to remove, is again a reference to the power which the Secretary of State has to prescribe such information by statutory instrument. It is envisaged that such information will mirror the information relating to the rights attaching to a class of shares required to be included in the statement of capital which, as I have said, must accompany a return of allotment made by a limited company.

<a name="60315-47_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  Subject to some exceptions under Section 89(1) of the 1985 Act, a company proposing to allot shares must offer those shares to existing shareholders first&#151;that is, on a pre-emptive basis. The statutory pre-emption provisions are very important and the basic principle behind them, which is unchanged by the Bill, is that shareholders should be able to protect their proportion of the total equity of a company by having the opportunity to subscribe for any new issue of shares for cash.
</p>

<a name="60315-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Section 90(6) of the 1985 Act provides that the offer to shareholders must state a period of not less than 21 days during which the offer may be accepted and that the offer may not be withdrawn before the end of the period. Clause 542 gives the Secretary of State the power to vary the time period for the acceptance of pre-emption offers or rights issues upwards as well as down, but regulations made under Clause 542 may not prescribe a period of less than 14 days for the acceptance of pre-emptive offers. The clause amends Section 90 of the 1985 Act by inserting the power I have referred to into that section.
</p>

<a name="60315-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Clause 542 implements a recommendation of the Company Law Review, which was also endorsed by the recent Paul Myners&#039; review. I should perhaps also add at this juncture that in his review of pre-emption rights, Paul Myners concluded that a shareholder&#039;s right to pre-emption is a valuable one which should not be removed or eroded, while at the same time acknowledging that there are situations where some disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights is necessary.
</p>

<a name="60315-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The amendment would enable the Secretary of State, in regulations made under Clause 542, to specify such conditions as to the acceptance of pre-emptive offers by existing members as the Secretary of State may see fit to specify. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State may make regulations under Clause 542 only if a decision is taken to vary the time period for the acceptance of pre-emptive offers from 21 days. If, for example, 21 days is considered to be too long a period in that it is seen to be having a detrimental impact on the ability of companies to raise new capital, the power may be exercised to reduce the period to, say, 14 days. The amendment appears to extend that power and could be used either to require companies to take extra steps to ensure that existing members were able to take up the pre-emptive offer if they wish to do so or to stipulate conditions that members must satisfy before they may accept the offer.

</p>

<a name="60315-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>To be clear, this is about conditions relating to the members taking it up, not to anyone giving permission for the shares to be allotted. This is on conditions of members. Clearly the powers conferred on the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC503</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Secretary of State under Clause 542 do not go that far, but I am not convinced that they should. In particular, the Government can see no reason for imposing further conditions on pre-emptive offers than those that already exist such as would justify the extension of the regulation power in the clause. In those circumstances, the Government are not minded to accept the amendment tabled by the noble Lord.

<a name="60315-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments is concerned with the disapplication of pre-emption rights for private companies with only one class of shares. This is the first of a series of issues on which we have been briefed by Rosalind Nicholson, a barrister specialising in this rather technical area of the law, at 4 Stone Buildings. The clause effectively places restrictions on companies with more than one class of shares. What is the obvious, or logical, reason to confine the powers under the clause to companies with only one class of shares? Simply, the amendments would widen the remit of the clause and extend the potential powers to all private companies, thereby adding flexibility for private companies as a whole. That is achieved by the two amendments to lines 27 and 29 on page 258. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="60315-47_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The provisions in Clause 543 are new. They are required as a result of the changes introduced by Clause 535, which empowers the directors of a private company with only one class of share to make an allotment of shares or to grant rights to subscribe for shares or convert any security into shares. In these circumstances, there is no requirement for the directors to obtain authorisation from the members&#151;that is, a resolution of the company&#039;s members or authorisation in the articles of association&#151;before they may allot such shares.

</p>

<a name="60315-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Where the directors propose to make an allotment of shares pursuant to the power given to them in Clause 535, the provisions of Section 89(1) of the 1985 Act, which require shares to be offered on a pre-emptive basis to existing shareholders, will apply to the proposed allotment unless the directors are given a further authority under Clause 543 to disapply statutory pre-emption rights.
</p>

<a name="60315-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>Section 95 of the 1985 Act sets out the provisions that allow a company to disapply the operation of the statutory pre-emption requirements in Section 89(1) and to allot shares for cash on a non-rights basis. The method of disapplication depends on the nature of the authority to allot shares granted to the directors under Section 80. Clauses 544 and 545 follow the format adopted in Section 95 by linking the method of disapplication to the authority to allot shares granted to the directors under Clause 536, which replaces Section 80.
</p>

<a name="60315-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Clause 543 applies only to private companies that will have only one class of share after the proposed allotment. The amendments proposed by the noble Lord&#151;that is, Amendments Nos A40A and A40B&#151;would broaden the scope of the clause to cover the scenario where a private company has more than one class of share after the proposed allotment.

<a name="60315-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Provision for the disapplication of pre-emption rights in companies that will have more than one class of share after the proposed allotment is already made in Clauses 544 and 545. Those clauses apply where the directors have been given an authority to allot shares, or grant rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares under Clause 536, which applies to private companies with more than one class of shares. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="60315-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I hope that I have reassured the noble Lord that we have not forgotten about private companies which will have more than one class of share after a proposed allotment. To summarise, there are two powers to allot shares here. One is for private companies that have only one class of shares; they are covered by Clause 535. Under those circumstances, directors can allot unless the articles forbid. All other companies are covered by Clause 536, where companies can allot shares only on the basis of articles or resolution. Clause 543 relates to Clause 535, and Clauses 544 and 545 relate to Clause 536.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="60315-47_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am certainly grateful to the Minister for that very full response. I believe that the core of his objection to the amendments is that they are not necessary. We shall need to read carefully what he has said to see whether, on mature reflection&#151;I shall not try to shuffle Clauses 535, 542 ad 543 around while I am on my feet&#151;we agree with that. Of course, if we do we shall not bring the measure back, but if we feel that there is further juice in this orange we may return to it at a later date. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The Minister may argue that including the articles in the amendment goes further than the current law. That is true, but we argue that it is just as reasonable for the articles to specify this as it is for a resolution.

<a name="60315-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Why have the relevant words been missed out in the reformulation? We think that is important. What is the Government&#039;s thinking on that? I beg to move.

<a name="60315-48_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, where the directors of a company are authorised to allot shares in a company, pursuant to an authority given to the directors by the company&#039;s members under Clause 536, the directors may be given a further power to modify statutory pre-emption rights in respect of a proposed allotment of shares. This requires a special resolution of the company&#039;s members or authorisation in the articles of association.
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Clause 544 sets out the conditions that must be met where it is proposed that the directors should be given this further power to disapply statutory pre-emption rights. Under the provisions of the clause, the members may empower the directors to disapply statutory pre-emption rights entirely, or to apply those rights with such modifications as the directors may determine. I should explain that Clause 544 applies to public companies and to private companies that will have more than one class of share after the proposed allotment.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC506"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC506</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60315-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>The proposed amendment would make it clear, in the body of Clause 544, that where it is proposed that the statutory pre-emption rights should apply but with modifications, the company&#039;s members, as well as the directors, may determine what those modifications are to be.
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>It may help if I set out the provenance of the Bill&#039;s provisions on the disapplication of pre-emption rights. Clause 544 restates the provisions of Section 95(1) of the 1985 Act and Clause 545 restates Section 95(2) of that Act. Section 95 is derived from Section 18 of the Companies Act 1980, which was introduced to give effect to the provisions on the exclusion of pre-emption rights contained in Articles 29(4) and 29(5) of the Second Company Law Directive.
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The directive establishes, so to speak, a presumption in favour of rights of pre-emption, but recognises that an irrebuttable presumption could cause unnecessary problems for the company and its shareholders. The directive naturally enough requires shareholders&#039; consent to the restriction or withdrawal of pre-emption rights; shareholders&#039; consent is also required for the issue of shares by directors&#151;the two are obviously closely linked in practice. The directive builds on this connection by linking the procedures for restricting or withdrawing pre-emption rights with the procedures for authorising the issue of shares.
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Clauses 544 and 545 contain two procedures whereby a company can disapply or modify the pre-emption rights set out in Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985. As I have already mentioned, these derive from paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 29 of the directive. Both are related to circumstances in which the directors are authorised for the purposes of Clause 536 to allot securities in the company. A distinction is drawn between an authority for a particular exercise of the power to issue shares and an authority for the exercise of that power generally. The directive similarly distinguishes between cases where the right of pre-emption is restricted or withdrawn in a particular case or where it is restricted or withdrawn generally.
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Clause 544 applies where the directors of a company are generally authorised for the purposes of Clause 536. The authority for this provision is Article 29(5) of the Second Company Law Directive. This provides that the laws of a member state may provide that the statutes, the instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, may give the power to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;to the company body which is empowered to decide on an increase in subscribed capital within the limits of the authorised capital&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The relevant &quot;company body&quot; under Clause 536 is the board of directors. This is as far as the directive permits us to go, so we are unable to accept an amendment to extend Clause 544 in the manner which the noble Lord seeks.
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>That said, where the power to disapply statutory pre-emption rights is linked to an authority to allot shares given under Clause 536, the authority itself may be expressed to be conditional or unconditional. We <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC507"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC507</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consider that members may impose conditions on the allotment by the directors which may impact on the application of the pre-emption provisions. Such conditions should bind the directors with regard to any allotment made pursuant to the power.
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The Committee will, of course, be aware that the provisions of the Second Company Law Directive only require to be applied to public companies and yet Clause 544&#151;as does the current Section 95(1)&#151;applies to both public and private companies. We are not aware that the current provisions as they apply to private companies have given rise to difficulties in practice such as to necessitate a parallel regime for such companies.
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I should also add that Section 91 of the 1985 Act contains a wide-ranging power for private companies to exclude the provisions of Section 89 and Sections 90(1) to (5) in their articles of association. That is retained under the Bill, so we consider that no further statutory exclusion from the pre-emption rights is necessary for private companies. The words,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;as may be specified in the resolution&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-48_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>are covered in Clause 545(1)(b).
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>In summary, we consider that we are constrained by the Second Company Law Directive for public companies and that Clause 544 goes as far as it can in the power which may be conferred on the directors to apply modified pre-emption rights. For private companies, we are not convinced that the proposed amendments are necessary.
</p>

<a name="60315-48_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>When you cut through all that, the answer is simply that that is what the Second Company Law Directive enables us to do.

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>there is no intention on the Government&#039;s part to change the law, but that the Government&#039;s hand is being forced by the Second Company Law Directive. Therefore, there is no underlying sinister intent&#151;if I may use that phrase&#151;through the omission of those words.

<a name="60315-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. A43 concerns Clause 545, &quot;Disapplication of pre-emption rights: directors acting under general authorisation&quot;. This is a probing amendment; a search for information. It is noted that Clause 545(5) to (7)&#151;the subsections that our amendment seeks to leave out&#151;preserve the requirements currently set out in Section 95(5) of the Companies Act 1985 for the directors to circulate a written statement justifying a non-pre-emptive issue of shares. The European Commission is understood to be close to introducing amendments to the Second Company Law Directive, Council Directive 77/91/EEC, by means of a directive published in final form on 21 September 2004, to withdraw the obligation on directors of public companies to circulate such a written resolution. Presumably, the requirement for a written statement in Clause 545(5) to (7) will be excluded if Directive 77/91/EEC is amended before these provisions come into force. I seek confirmation from the Minister that this interpretation is correct. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60315-49_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Where the directors of a company have been given an authority to allot shares under Clause 536, they must have regard to the statutory pre-emption provisions, which require companies to offer their shares to existing members first; that is, on a pre-emptive basis. As I said, statutory pre-emption rights provide important protection to existing shareholders. They enable such shareholders to protect their proportionate investments in the company by giving them the right to subscribe for any new issue of shares for cash. The Bill, like the 1985 Act, recognises that there are circumstances where it would not be in the company&#039;s interests&#151;in the interests of the company&#039;s members as a whole&#151;to offer shares to existing members first. The company may, for example, need to raise capital quickly. Therefore, there may be insufficient time to observe the formalities which are laid down under the statutory pre-emption requirements. That is particularly so where the directors are aware that the existing shareholders do not wish to subscribe for further shares. Following the approach taken in the 1985 Act, the Bill, therefore, carves out a number of exceptions to the general rule that existing members must be given the first bite of the cherry.
</p>

<a name="60315-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Clause 545 is an example of one such exception. It enables the members of a company to resolve to empower the directors to make a specified allotment of shares as if the statutory pre-emption provisions did not apply. A special resolution of the company&#039;s members is required, but the resolution may not be proposed unless the directors have made a recommendation that this power should be given to them. The directors are required to set out their reasons for making such a recommendation in writing and must provide details of the amount payable in respect of the proposed allotment, which must be justified by the directors. Moreover, a copy of the directors&#039; statement must be circulated to every <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC510"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC510</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

member of the company with the notice of the meeting or, if the resolution is to be passed in written form, with the written resolution.
</p>

<a name="60315-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The latter provision restates the provisions of Section 95(5) of the 1985 Act. As the noble Lord anticipated, it also implements the requirements of Article 29(4) of the Second Company Law Directive which provides that the right of pre-emption may be restricted or withdrawn by decisions of the general meeting, in which case the administrative or management body shall be required to present to such a meeting a written report indicating the reasons for restriction or withdrawal of the right of pre-emption and justifying the proposed issue price. The amendment would remove the requirement for a directors&#039; report. As I have explained, the requirement for a directors&#039; report stems from EU law. Although the Second Company Law Directive applies only to public companies, it would not be beneficial to have two regimes, one for public companies and one for private companies, running in tandem.
</p>

<a name="60315-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Moreover, Section 91 of the 1985 Act, which is retained by the Bill, permits a private company to exclude the operation of Section 89(1), Section 90(1) to (5) or Section 90(6) to allotments of equity securities by providing for the exclusion of the operation of those provisions in the company&#039;s memorandum or articles of association. That is, a private company may exclude the requirement to have a rights issue under Section 89(1); the requirement to make an offer in the manner dictated by Section 90(1) to (5); and the requirement to keep the offer open for the period dictated by Section 90(6). That option means that a private company wishing to disapply Section 89 need not rely on, and therefore will not have to comply with, the provisions of subsections (5) to (7) of Clause 545 where it has excluded the relevant provisions on the application of statutory pre-emption rights in their articles.
</p>

<a name="60315-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I should say that a proposal is being considered by the European Parliament. It appears that amendments to Article 29, from which the provision is derived, have been dropped. I hope that that reassures the noble Lord that the conditions prescribed in subsections (5) to (7) of Clause 545 are necessary for public companies, but do not pose any particular problems for private companies, for the reasons that I have outlined.
</p>

<a name="60315-49_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. We are slightly guilty in this; we should probably have talked to officials about the purpose of our inquiry, which was rather narrower than that which they have now addressed in the Minister&#039;s speaking note. I could have spared them the trouble of responding in detail to subsections (5) to (7), when our point was a narrower one about whether the provision has any future because of potential changes to the Second Company Law Directive. We are now told that it does because the directive will not be changed in the way that our information, published in final form on 21 September 2004, suggested. If that is now dead, the provision will have a long life and, as such, we are content with it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
&quot;OFFERS TO SHAREHOLDERS TO BE ON PRE-EMPTIVE BASIS

<br>
(1)   Subject to the provisions of this section and sections (Communication of pre-emption offers to shareholders) to (Savings for company&#039;s pre-emption procedure operative before 1982), a company proposing to allot equity securities (as defined in section (Definitions for sections (Offers to shareholders to be on pre-emptive basis) to (Saving for company&#039;s pre-emption procedure operative before 1982))&#151;


<br>
(a)   shall not allot any of them on any terms to a person unless it has made an offer to each person who holds relevant shares or relevant employee shares to allot to him on the same or more favourable terms a proportion of those securities which is as nearly as practicable equal to the proportion in nominal value held by him of the aggregate of relevant shares and relevant employee shares, and


<br>
(b)   shall not allot any of those securities to a person unless the period during which any such offer may be accepted has expired or the company has received notice of the acceptance or refusal of every offer so made.


<br>
(2)   Subsection (3) below applies to any provision of a company&#039;s memorandum or articles which requires the company, when proposing to allot equity securities consisting of relevant shares of any particular class, not to allot those securities on any terms unless it has complied with the condition that it makes such an offer as is described in subsection (1) to each person who holds relevant shares or relevant employee shares of that class.


<br>
(3)   If in accordance with a provision to which this subsection applies&#151;


<br>
(a)   a company makes an offer to allot securities to such a holder, and


<br>
(b)   he or anyone in whose favour he has renounced his right to their allotment accepts the offer,


<br>
subsection (1) does not apply to the allotment of those securities, and the company may allot them accordingly; but this is without prejudice to the application of subsection (1) in any other case.


<br>
(4)   Subsection (1) does not apply to a particular allotment of equity securities if these are, or are to be, wholly or partly paid up otherwise than in cash; and securities which a company has offered to allot to a holder of relevant shares or relevant employee shares may be allotted to him, or anyone in whose favour he has renounced his right to their allotment, without contravening subsection (1)(b).


<br>
(5)   Subsection (1) does not apply to the allotment of securities which would, apart from a renunciation or assignment of the right to their allotment, be held under an employees&#039; share scheme.


<br>
(6)   Where a company holds relevant shares as treasury shares&#151;


<br>
(a)   for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), the company is not a &quot;person who holds relevant shares&quot;; and


<br>
(b)   for the purposes of subsection (1), the shares held as treasury shares do not form part of &quot;the aggregate of relevant shares and relevant employee shares&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_97"></a>The noble Lord said: There are a large number of amendments in this group: Amendments Nos. A44 to A50. They concern a pretty chunky set of new clauses.

I comfort myself with the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC512</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

thought that at least I shall reduce the length of the Marshalled List as a result when we pass by this group. We have spoken about this issue several times before. The issue is that of consolidation&#151;more precisely, the lack of it in parts of the Bill. It has been brought to our attention independently of our efforts to promote consolidation by City corporate lawyers.
</p>

<a name="60315-50_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Part 18 re-enacts, as amended, Sections 80 to 88 inclusive and Sections 95, 97 and 98 of the Companies Act 1985. Sections 89 to 94 inclusive and Section 96 are to remain in the Act. Our practitioner advisers say that the provisions in the Companies Act 1985 on allotment and pre-emption are among the most frequently consulted sections in the entire Act. The depth of some of the technical amendments that we have discussed this afternoon shows that that is not an unreasonable statement.
</p>

<a name="60315-50_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>Having some of the provisions in the Companies Act 1985 and others in the Company Law Reform Act 2006, as I assume that the Bill will become, is surely a recipe for confusion. This group of amendments inserts the missing sections and, as such, is aimed to provide greater clarity at no cost. I hope that the Minister will appreciate that our interest in achieving that greater consultation is not an academic exercise but is sought by those who will be using the Bill when it becomes law. I hope that he will see the benefits in that consolidation. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60315-50_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   First, we do not regard this as an academic exercise. We want to achieve as much consolidation as possible, but I hope that I can explain why we have come to this position.
</p>

<a name="60315-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>I shall speak to Amendments Nos. A44 to A50. The amendments would insert seven new clauses into the Bill that reproduce without amendment Sections 89 to 94 and 96 of the 1985 Act. Those sections form part of a discrete group of provisions which deal with the matter of pre-emption rights. The provisions have survived the Bill relatively intact, save for the fact that we have taken the opportunity in the Bill to reinstate the 1985 Act provisions on the disapplication of pre-emption rights contained in Section 95. I shall come to that later. The question of restatement is not without its difficulties. There are arguments for and against any proposed restatement. Part 18 is intended to strike a balance between the various competing views on the issue in the context of a particular section or group of sections of the 1985 Act.
</p>

<a name="60315-50_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>It may be helpful at this point for me to outline the general approach that we have taken in the Bill to restatement of the 1985 Act provisions on share capital. Where a particular provision or group of provisions has been subject to substantial piecemeal amendment we have taken the view that, in most cases, it is better to restate it in the interests of greater clarity. Where we have not found it necessary to amend a particular provision or group of provisions, or where there have been only minor changes, as a general rule we have taken the view that the relevant section of the 1985 Act should remain intact&#151;again, in the interests of clarity.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC513</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60315-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Where we have decided to restate, that has in turn often led to changes in the drafting from that which is used in the current section, to reflect the drafting approach taken in the Bill as a whole&#151;for example, as regards the general layout of the Bill and the structure of individual clauses. The Committee will be aware that that approach has prompted questions, such as have already been aired in this House, about why the drafting has changed and whether the intention is that the restated provision should have a different legal effect to the provision of the 1985 Act that it replaces. In the interests of avoiding creating uncertainty, we have therefore tried to resist restating for restatement&#039;s sake. The main consideration here has been whether the benefits of a proposed restatement outweigh the risk that the restatement may be interpreted as making a substantive change in the law when that is not the intention. Obviously, this is not a precise science and the process has necessarily been one of judgment.
</p>

<a name="60315-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The Committee may wonder why we have restated the provisions on the day&#039;s application of pre-emption rights currently contained in Section 95, but not the rules on the application of pre-emption rights. In a nutshell, that is because the former provisions are currently framed by reference to the authority to allot shares under Section 80 of the 1985 Act. Section 80 will be repealed by the Bill and replaced by the provisions in Clauses 534 to 536. It was therefore necessary to reframe the provisions governing that disapplication of pre-emption rights so that they fit with the new provisions relating to the authority of the directors to allot shares contained in Clauses 535 and 536.
</p>

<a name="60315-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>By contrast, the provisions relating to the application of pre-emption rights are not amended by the Bill and, in the circumstances, we think that the difference in treatment is justified. As I said at the beginning, this is not an academic point but, equally, it is not a precise science and the process has necessarily been one of judgment. We have made that judgment.

<a name="60315-50_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful but a little disappointed that we did not have further movement on that. First, it is absolutely correct, and it was the intention, that these new clauses were the same as the sections in the 1985 Act. That was not the purpose; the purpose was to have everything in one place. As I heard the Minister describe it, the reason for moving some clauses into this new Bill and not others was where they had been amended along the way and therefore various layers of amendments had been added to them, but, where there had not been, the clauses were to stay in the original Act.
</p>

<a name="60315-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>I found that disappointing and strange. For the Minister to say that if the Government were to move the rest of the sections into this Bill it somehow might imply some change in the law, I did not find that credible.

said, &quot;No, we don&#039;t mean any changes at all&quot;. That is fine. So it would be perfectly simple for him to say, &quot;We have moved these clauses up. They are in here. No change is intended&quot;. A practitioner would then have a series of clauses covering the whole of this subject. This is a sad answer more than anything else, because I think that we could have done something to make this complex and frequently consulted part of the law, in the words of the original press release, &quot;more accessible&quot;.

</p>

<a name="60315-51_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>This is a small amendment, which could only occur to the eagle eyes of the lawyers who advise me. The clause deals with restrictions on the amounts of commissions, discounts and allowances that can be given for the issue of shares in a company. Subsection (5) reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;It is immaterial how the shares or money are so applied, whether by being added to the purchase money of property acquired by the company or to the contract price of work&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="60315-51_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The phrase &quot;purchase money of property&quot; is infelicitous drafting. The purpose of the amendment is to substitute &quot;price&quot; for &quot;money&quot; in that line, not only because of the infelicity of the drafting but also because money, to the extent that it has a meaning, implies a cash payment, and, as the Minister will be aware, there is no reason why this purchase price of property would not be satisfied other than in cash. Clearly, the intention of the legislation is to catch that as well. I hope the Minister can agree that this is a sensible amendment. I beg to move.

<a name="60315-51_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The amendment would replace the reference to &quot;purchase money&quot; in the second line of subsection (5) with a reference to &quot;purchase price&quot;. This is because the company&#039;s payment for the property might not be in cash. Subsection (5) is not intended to be comprehensive, as the words &quot;or otherwise&quot; at the end of the subsection make clear. It does not attempt to set out all the ways in which a commission might be given. It simply reinforces the need to look at the substance, rather than the form, of any transaction which may involve a commission, discount or allowance.

The Companies Act 1985 did not allow this either, and questions have often arisen as to how to best achieve this within, or&#151;perhaps a better phrase&#151;in the absence of, a statutory framework.

I have just given, they pass a resolution to consolidate the 100 10p shares into 10 &#163;1 shares, and then sub-divide the 10 &#163;1 A shares into 100 10p B shares. So it is up and then down again.

<a name="60315-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>Other practitioners seem to argue that this is unnecessary and advise on an ordinary resolution to convert the A shares into B shares of the same nominal value, which has no statutory basis in the Companies Act 1985. Conversion of shares from one class to another is common, particularly in private companies and private-equity backed companies, for example, to reallocate the apportionment of exit proceeds in an agreed manner.

<a name="60315-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>So these two amendments would insert a statutory basis for this useful procedure. It is argued to us that it may have become a common practice to do it in that way, but, actually, the law requires a much more elaborate raising up and then sub-dividing down again, and the opportunity should be taken in the Bill to simplify things. These two amendments are intended to do that. I therefore beg to move.

<a name="60315-51_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I shall deal with Amendments Nos. A52 and A57. Amendment No. A52 concerns Clause 550. The clause prohibits a limited company from altering its share capital, except in the ways permitted under the Bill and under those provisions in the 1985 Act relating to alterations to a company&#039;s share capital that are retained.
</p>

<a name="60315-51_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>Clause 550 is not concerned with alterations in the rights attaching to shares, but with acts that affect the level and nominal value of the company&#039;s share capital, whether that is by way of increased reduction, subdivision, consolidation or otherwise. It is not concerned with the rights. Subsection (3) points forward to Clause 551, which is the subject of Amendment No. A57. Clauses 551 and 553 are concerned with alterations to the nominal value of the company&#039;s share capital, in the sense of its subdivision into shares of a smaller nominal amount or its consolidation into shares of a larger nominal amount, or the reconversion of stock into shares. Those provisions restate in part Section 121 of the 1985 Act.
</p>

<a name="60315-51_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>The proposed amendment to Clause 550(3)&#151;Amendment No. A52&#151;would enable a company to convert shares of the same nominal value from one class to another, being shares of the same nominal value, subject to the procedure in Clause 551. That is by ordinary resolution of the company&#039;s members. Amendment No. A57 would enable companies to vary the rights attached to their shares using the procedure in Clause 551. I am picking up on the noble Lord&#039;s example of A and B shares. I think that just calling shares by another name is one thing, but if it involves a change of rights, I am not sure why you would have A and B shares without there being different rights attached to them in some way. That would not be permitted under these arrangements.
</p>

<a name="60315-51_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Clause 551 prescribes how a company may subdivide or consolidate its shares into shares of a different nominal amount. It does not deal with a variation of class rights. The procedure for varying class rights attaching to shares is set out in Clause 556, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC517"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC517</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which inserts a new Section 125 into the 1985 Act. I do not propose to go into the detail of the provision, but I should explain that under the new Section 125, the rights attached to shares in a particular class may be varied if the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class consent in writing, or a special resolution is passed by the holders of shares at that class. A requirement for the consent of a three-quarters majority of the class in question operates to protect the members of the class against changes which would have a significant impact on their position.
</p>

<a name="60315-51_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The procedure laid down in Clause 556 is necessarily detailed, as a variation of class rights may result in a change of the relative power of one class of shareholders vis-&#224;-vis another.
</p>

<a name="60315-51_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>In conclusion, the Government consider the amendments to be misconceived. Currently, shares of one class may not be converted to another simply pursuant to an ordinary resolution of all the members. Such a measure would severely undermine the current protections afforded to holders of different classes of shares.

<a name="60315-52_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister. Of course I perfectly understand that we are not discussing rights attached to shares here. What we are trying to get at is that there may be an agreement between a company with two classes of shares which have different rights attaching to them, and the holders of class A shares are perfectly happy and wish to convert their shares into B shares. It is not a question of them being sold something; they want to do it. That is a matter of agreement. At present, we are told, to do that you have to go through a very elaborate procedure for consolidating into different values, and then subdividing it again, because the only way that you can comply with the requirements is by means of conversion&#151;subdividing or consolidating.
</p>

<a name="60315-52_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>We say: &quot;We are not varying the rights in any way, but if it is understood and there is agreement between the shareholders that they want to convert, why are we going through this consolidation and subdivision exercise?&quot;. To which other people say, &quot;No one is doing it anyway; they are just going ahead and doing the straight conversion in the absence of any statutory framework&quot;. This is a practitioner issue of trying to regularise a situation and recognising practice, which will not in any way undermine or change the rights of any shareholders.

talking to people who practise the law in this area, because there are things such as the private equity exit where by agreement the investors, the managers, share the proceeds and therefore conversions take place, often following a shareholder agreement.

I will set the scene for the four amendments by providing a short summary of the clause that we seek to amend. Clause 550 prohibits a limited company from altering its share capital except in the ways permitted under the Bill and under the provisions in the 1985 Act relating to alterations to company share capital that are retained. The clause is intended to constitute an exhaustive list of the ways in which a company may alter its share capital, whether under the Bill or under the 1985 Act, and the first and second amendments in the group are required to achieve that policy objective.

<a name="60315-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Amendment No. A53 incorporates a reference to a reduction of share capital in connection with a redenomination of share capital into subsection (4). Amendment No. A54 incorporates a reference to the power of a company to purchase shares in pursuance of an order of the court under Section 177 of the 1985 Act into subsection (5)(b). Amendment No. A55 removes the reference to Part 11 of the Bill from subsection (5)(b)(ii). On reflection, that reference is misconceived and its inclusion may cause confusion. Part 11 enables a member of a company to bring a derivative action&#151;I am not sure whether I need to explain this as it was debated extensively at the time&#151;to pursue a remedy on behalf of the company. The Government cannot envisage any circumstances in which the court would order the company to purchase the members&#039; shares pursuant to such an action. Moreover, Part 11 does not confer a power on the court to make such an order.

<a name="60315-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Amendment No. A56 incorporates a reference to a compromise or arrangement made by a company with its creditors and members under Section 425 of the 1985 Act into subsection (5).

Clause 551(3) seems to require a two-stage process; that is, shareholder approval, followed by a board resolution to exercise the power so granted to the company. Existing Section 122(4) of the Companies Act 1985, which this clause replaces, effectively eliminates the need for the board resolution to exercise the company&#039;s powers. The existing route in Section 122(4) of the Companies Act 1985 is more efficient. There appears to be no reason to depart from it, as this clause does as currently drafted.

Clause 551(4)(c) seems to envisage the possibility of an element of conditionality being introduced into a resolution under Clause 551(3); that is, as the &quot;specified circumstances&quot; may or may not arise.
</p>

<a name="60315-53_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>To be clear about the Government&#039;s thinking, it would be helpful if the Minister could give an example of what &quot;specified circumstances&quot; might be. If it is not the intention to have an element of conditionality, the provision should make that clear. However, if that is the intention, there should be a provision for a further filing as per Clause 78(2), which dealt with conditional changes of names by companies. The amendment follows the path of assuming that conditionality is intended, and provides that notice must be given to the registrar on the fulfilment of the conditional circumstances. That is the background to the wording that we wish to put at the end of line 10. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="60315-53_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Clause 551 prescribes how a company may subdivide all consolidated shares into shares of a different nominal amount. Amendment No. A59 appears to restrict the ability of a company&#039;s members to authorise an alteration of the company&#039;s share capital under the clause, where the company wishes to exercise the power at a specified time or in specified circumstances. In particular, it appears to provide that a resolution passed under subsection (3) would only give the company the authority envisaged in subsection (4) if the resolution, or possibly notice of the exercise of the power in question, is delivered to the registrar of companies.
</p>

<a name="60315-53_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Where a company makes any alteration to its share capital, that is a matter of public record, and it is clearly important that provision is made for appropriate notice to be given to the registrar.

Clause 552. That replaces a similar requirement to notify the registrar contained in Section 122(1)(a) and (d) of the 1985 Act. It requires a company to give notice to the registrar within one month of the exercise of the power to subdivide or consolidate the shares. Criminal liability for any failure to comply with the procedural requirements as to notice is retained by Clause 552(4). The Government consider that the criminal sanction provides sufficient incentive to the company and its directors to ensure that the requirements as to notice are met. Therefore we are not persuaded by the amendment. For the purposes of clarity, the provision is intended to enable conditional resolutions to be passed, which is what the noble Lord sought to clarify.

<p><a name="st_123"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment takes the scalpel to Clause 554, and seeks to replace it; I will not weary the Committee with its wording. This issue was again raised with us by practitioners, and is similar to the points I raised in speaking to Amendments Nos. A44 to A50.
</p>

<a name="60315-53_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>As Sections 120 to 124 of the Companies Act 1985 are repealed and/or restated in this Bill, it seems strange to retain just Section 122 of the 1985 Act as amended, particularly as Clause 552 and Section 122(1)(a) both cover the same ground. It would be far clearer if Section 122 were restated, as amended, as Clause 554. The amendment seeks to give effect to this. Aside from a consolidation, the reasons for and purposes of which I will not repeat, there is one change in this amendment from the wording in the Bill or, as an alternative, the Companies Act 1985&#151;the addition of subsection (1)(g):


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;converted issued shares of one class into issued shares of another class with the same nominal values&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60315-53_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>That simply makes provision for the conversion of shares, as we discussed in Amendments Nos. A52 and A57, even though the Government did not like those either. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>Where a company makes an alteration to its share capital in any of the ways listed in Section 122 of the 1985 Act as amended by the Bill, it is required to give notice of the alteration to the Registrar of Companies in accordance with the provisions of that section. However, much of Section 122 is replaced by various provisions in the Bill, and will be repealed. For example, Clause 552 replaces Section 122(1)(a) and (d) in respect of the procedural notice requirements, where there has been a subdivision or consolidation of a company&#039;s share capital. In addition, the power to convert shares into stock will be repealed by the Bill, so the reference in Section 122(1)(b) to the obligation to notify the registrar following such a conversion will fall. The power to reconvert stock into shares is contained in Clause 553, together with an obligation to notify the registrar. So, similarly, the reference in Section 122(1)(c) to the reconversion of stock into shares will fall.
</p>

<a name="60315-53_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Clause 554 amends current Section 122 to update the notice requirements for those provisions of that section which remain; namely, the provisions which refer to an alteration of capital in connection with the redemption of shares contained in Section 122(1)(e), which were a cancellation of the company&#039;s share capital otherwise than in connection with the reduction of capital contained in Section 122(1)(f). The change introduced by Clause 554 is that, in future, a statement of capital will be required where the company gives notice under Section 122 of an alteration to its share capital in the circumstances to which I have referred.

<a name="60315-53_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>Where a company fails to comply with the procedural notice requirements, it, and every officer of the company, is in default and commits an offence. The amendment restates Section 122 of the 1985 Act, as amended by Clause 554, save that it includes a new subsection, as was referred to, to reflect Amendment No. A57, which seeks to make a conversion of shares from one class to another, subject to the procedure for alterations to share capital in Clause 551. Presumably, the intention of this amendment is to bring the provisions amending Section 122 together and put them in the Bill. I see that it is.
</p>

<a name="60315-53_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>The amendment does not, however, take account of other changes to Section 122; in particular, those made by Clauses 552, 553 and 733, and Schedule 4 to the Bill. These changes are required because the Bill makes substantive amendments to the ways in which a company may alter its share capital. For example, it will not possible for a company to create new stock in future, and the notice requirement in Section 122(1)(b) is therefore spent. The Government do not consider the addition to the restated Section 122, relating to class conversions, appropriate, as we have just discussed.
</p>

<a name="60315-53_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>This has been a detailed explanation of the Government&#039;s reasons for resisting the amendment. I think it was necessary, and I hope that it has been helpful. I should add that the vast majority of people who have reasons to look at provisions in company law do not refer to the statutes themselves, but company law textbooks such as <i>Butterworths</i>. Such <br>&nbsp;<br>

That is a neat introduction to the amendments that I will initially be speaking to: Amendments Nos. A61, A67, A80, A81 and A85, which are grouped together. I will come to the last four in a moment.
</p>

<a name="60315-54_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>The purpose of the amendments is clear. We are not advocating any change in the law, just a movement of provisions within the framework of the Act. We accept, although we have lost the argument, that this is not a full consolidation, but it incorporates amendments to the Companies Act 1985. It seems sensible that users of the Act should not have to rush off to enrich the pockets of my noble friend in purchasing legal textbooks to check different parts of the Act and determine the extent to which a particular provision has been amended.

offences&#151;those provisions be moved from Schedule 4 to the main body of the Bill. This reasoning applies to Amendments Nos. A61; A67, which amends Clause 559; A80, which amends Clause 567; and A85, which amends Clause 573. Clearly, if these amendments are passed, consequential amendments would need to be made to Schedule 4. If Amendment No. A61 were passed, paragraph (5) of Schedule 4 would need to be deleted, because it is replaced by that amendment. If Amendment No. A67 were passed, paragraph (7) of Schedule 4 would need to be deleted. If Amendment No. A80 were passed, consequential amendments would be necessary to delete paragraphs (14) and (15) of Schedule 4. Lastly, if Amendment No. 85 was passed, paragraph (16) of Schedule 4 would need to be deleted. This is not a change in the law. We seek simply to consolidate the offences in the main section.

The changes in Schedule 4 clarify the wording of the offences in the 1985 Act and, in some cases, introduce substantive changes such as whether a company or its officers, or both, may be guilty of an offence.
</p>

<a name="60315-54_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The amendments to this group of clauses would shift the provisions set out in paragraphs 5, 7, 14, 15, 16, 32 and 33 of Schedule 4 into Clauses 554, 559, 569(1), 569(2) and 573, and Schedule 3. As has been explained by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, they aim to ensure that where the Bill makes two amendments to a single provision in the 1985 Act, they should be set out in one place in the Bill. The Bill does not currently do this because all amendments related to offences in the 1985 Act are set out separately in Schedule 4. While I understand the intention behind the amendments in the group, I find the argument for keeping all of the amendments to the offences in the 1985 Act together in Schedule 4 more compelling. As currently drafted, Schedule 4 provides a comprehensive list of amendments to those offences in the 1985 Act which remain. Any person who is interested in these amendments need look no further than Schedule 4. A choice needs to made here and we believe it right to collect the offences together in Schedule 4. I now forebear from making any further reference to textbooks.

Clearly there needs to be a transitional provision to permit a variation of class rights pursuant to the procedure laid down in Section 125 where the variation is by extraordinary resolution at a separate general meeting of the holders of the relevant class and the meeting is convened before the clause comes into effect. I hope that this is just another matter to be dealt with under Amendment No. A272. It is another to add to the list to ensure that it is covered in the list of transitional provisions. I beg to move.

<a name="60315-54_spnew5"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   For the sake of completeness, I will go through the note, but the noble Lord is right in his conclusion. New Section 125 provides that the rights attached to a class of shares&#151;for example, a right attaching to a class of preference shares entitling the holders to a preferential dividend of 10 per cent&#151;may be varied only with the written consent of the holders of at least three-quarters in nominal value of the shares of that class or by a special resolution passed by the holders of the class. That is, however, without prejudice to any other restrictions on the variation of the class rights.
</p>

<a name="60315-54_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>The effect of that is that, where the articles of association prescribe a more onerous regime for the variation of class rights, that more onerous regime must be complied with. For example, the articles may prescribe that the holders of 90 per cent in nominal value of shares in that class must consent to a variation. That differs from existing Section 125, which contains complicated provisions which provide that the relevant rule governing a variation of class rights depends on the origin of the class rights and whether any specific provision has been made for their alteration.
</p>

<a name="60315-54_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>Under existing provisions there are circumstances in which a company&#039;s articles may prescribe a less onerous regime than the statutory scheme.

<a name="60315-54_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>We understand that it is rare for the articles to make provision for a lower majority than 75 per cent of the holders of shares in the class. In the interests of simplifying the law in that area, we do not propose to retain an equivalent provision to Section 125(4). That does, however, leave open the question of what provision, if any, should be made for existing companies whose articles specify less onerous conditions for a variation of class rights. The concern is that such provisions may still be subsisting at the time that new Section 125 comes into force.
</p>

<a name="60315-54_para15"></a>

We are advised that companies often wish to do this in practice. It would be helpful if the statute could make it clear that that is possible. The amendment proposes wording that is intended to clarify that issue and to give companies the flexibility so to act. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="60315-55_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   This amendment is concerned with the conditions that should apply to a variation of class rights in companies having a share capital. New Section 125 of the 1985 Act, inserted into that Act by Clause 556, provides that the rights attached to a class of a company&#039;s shares may be varied if, and only if, the holders of at least three-quarters in nominal value of the shares in that class consent to the variation or the class members pass a special resolution. It prescribes the minimum requirement for a variation of class rights, but the provisions of new Section 125 are subject to the qualification contained in subsection (3) that this statutory scheme is without prejudice to any other restriction on the variation of rights.
</p>

<a name="60315-55_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The qualification in subsection (3) has two important effects. First, if and to the extent that a company has adopted a more onerous regime in its <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC528"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column GC528</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

articles&#151;for example, by requiring the consent of the holders of 90 per cent of the class&#151;the company must comply with the more onerous regime. Secondly, if and to the extent that the company has protected the rights attaching to any class of shares&#151;for example, by making provision for the infringement of those rights in its articles under Clause 23&#151;that protection cannot be circumvented by a variation of class rights under new Section 125.

</p>

<a name="60315-55_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lord would amend the qualification in subsection (3) of new Section 125. It would enable the members of a company to make provision for less as well as more onerous conditions to apply to a variation of class rights than those prescribed in a statutory scheme. Thus the amendment would, for example, allow a company&#039;s articles to require the consent of a simple majority of the class. While I note that existing Section 125 permits a company to adopt in its articles less onerous provisions regarding the variation of class rights&#151;a 75 per cent majority of the class&#151;the circumstances in which it can do so are somewhat constrained. For example, if the rights are attached to the memorandum, the provision must have been included in the articles at the time of the company&#039;s original incorporation and the variation may not be connected with the giving of an authority under Section 80 or with a reduction of share capital under Section 135.
</p>

<a name="60315-55_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>When considering the subject of variation of class rights, we took the view that the provisions of Section 125 were unduly complicated, in that they set out a number of permutations which depend on: first, the origin of the class rights, whether they are contained in the memorandum, the articles or elsewhere; and, secondly, whether any specific provision has been made for their alteration. We therefore sought to simplify the provisions and, in doing so, considered that there should be imposed a minimum requirement for a 75 per cent majority of the class in question. We are conscious of the fact that, according to legal commentators, companies which opt to include provisions in their articles prescribing the mechanism for a variation of class rights tend in any event to replicate the statutory requirement, which means that the option to adopt less onerous requirements is rarely taken.
</p>

<a name="60315-55_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>We consider that a variation of class rights is a serious matter. Such a variation may reduce the power of one class of a company&#039;s shareholders in comparison with another and, in the worst-case scenario, may amount to a fraud on minority shareholders. I hope therefore that noble Lords will agree that it would not be desirable to reduce the protection offered by new Section 125. I hope that that addresses specifically the inquiry of the noble Lord.

</p>

<a name="60315-55_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving government Amendment No. A64, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. A66 and A200. At present, where a company does not have a share capital, the question of how members&#039; rights may be varied will depend to a large extent on whether provision for this has been made in the memorandum or articles of the company. In future, where it is proposed that there should be a variation of members&#039; rights, it will be possible for this to be done in accordance with the provisions of new Section 125A of the 1985 Act. As for the existing provision for variation of shareholders&#039; class rights, this new section provides a comprehensive code for the variation of class rights in companies without a share capital. This new section is inserted into the Act by Clause 557.
</p>

<a name="60315-55_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>The procedure for varying members&#039; rights under new Section 125A is comparable to the procedure for varying class rights in companies with a share capital. In particular, there is a minimum requirement as to members&#039; consent. As a general rule, members&#039; rights may be varied under new Section 125A only if three-quarters of the members of the class affected consent in writing or if a special resolution of that class is passed. Provision similarly needs to be made for members to object to the variation by analogy with the provision for shareholders. The clause inserted into the Bill by Amendment No. A66 inserts new Section 127A into the 1985 Act and amends Section 127 of that Act. New Section 127A sets out the procedure that must be followed where there is an objection to a variation of members&#039; rights. It enables members amounting to not less than 15 per cent of the members of the class affected to apply to the court to have the variation cancelled and it gives the court the power to confirm or disallow the variation if the court is satisfied that it would unfairly prejudice the members of that class.

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>Amendment No. A64 is a paving amendment for Amendment No. A66. Noble Lords will realise that this is a complex area of the law, but I have tried to outline some of the considerations that apply where there is a variation of members&#039; rights. I trust that noble Lords will agree that, where there is a possibility that a class of members may be unfairly prejudiced by a variation of their class rights, the members affected by the change should have the right to object.

Companies limited by guarantee, which since December 1980 cannot be formed with a share capital, may for example have different classes of members with different voting rights. Currently there is no statutory provision governing the variation of such rights, which will therefore depend to a large extent on whether provision has been made either in the memorandum or articles for their variation. Subsection (2) refers erroneously to &quot;holders of shares&quot; and not to members, as it should. Similarly, subsection (5) should refer to the rights of a class of members rather than to &quot;rights attached to a class of shares&quot;.

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>The noble Lord said: When we debated government Amendment No. A55, I explained that the reference to Part 11 of the Bill in Clause 550 was misconceived. The same point applies equally here. However, before I turn to the substance, perhaps I may clarify a point that may be the cause of some confusion. The clause erroneously refers to the provisions on derivative actions as being in Part 10 of the Bill, whereas of course everyone knows that they are set out in Part 11.

The Government cannot envisage any circumstances in which the courts would make an order under Part 11 that would impact on and amount to a variation of members&#039; rights.

<a name="60315-56_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Pensions: Occupational </h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60315-56_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions Reform (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

</p>

<a name="60315-56_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>In her report published today, the Parliamentary Ombudsman has found that some of the information issued by the Department for Work and Pensions and the then Department of Social Security on the security of occupational pensions amounts to maladministration. She has made a similar finding with regard to a decision made in 2002 on the calculation of the minimum funding requirement for salary-related occupational pension schemes. The Government do not accept these findings.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The Government recognise the hardship and distress faced by those people who have lost all or part of their pension when their pension schemes have, or are being, wound up. That is why it has set up the Financial Assistance Scheme, with &#163;400 million of public money. But, having carefully considered the ombudsman&#039;s report, the Government do not believe that it makes a sustainable case that maladministration occurred or that these losses were the responsibility of government. In the Government&#039;s view, the responsibility for the schemes rested with the companies whose schemes have, or are being, wound up and with the trustees who, with the benefit of professional advice, were responsible for protecting members&#039; interests.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>In respect of the ombudsman&#039;s specific findings the Government do not consider that any of the named leaflets or quoted statements could have formed a proper basis for scheme members&#151;still less trustees who were professionally advised&#151;to assess the security of their individual pension schemes. The leaflets were general and introductory in nature. They were not a full statement of the law. They made both those points clear. In addition, the Government believe that the report fails to demonstrate that decisions taken by individual scheme members were influenced by the information which the Government did, or did not, make available.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>So far as the 2002 decision on the minimum funding requirement is concerned, the Government believe that they acted wholly responsibly in implementing the recommendation of the actuarial profession which had received the backing of the Government Actuary&#039;s Department.

</p>

<a name="60315-56_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>Against this background, the Government have considered carefully the ombudsman&#039;s first four recommendations&#151;which involve considering whether to restore the lost pension rights of affected scheme members, making consolatory payments and apologising to scheme trustees. As the Government are   unable to accept the findings on which those <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS96"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column WS96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

recommendations are based and do not consider that it would be in the wider public interest for tax payers to fund all lost pension benefits, they do not believe that it would be appropriate to take the action suggested.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>The Government do, however, accept the ombudsman&#039;s fifth recommendation with regard to reviewing the time it takes to wind up a defined benefit pension scheme. Work is already under way in this area.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Sexual Health and HIV</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="60315-56_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Caroline Flint) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>We are today issuing our response to the third annual report from the Independent Advisory Group on Sexual Health and HIV (SHIAG) published in October 2005 and a copy has been placed in the Library. The response is also available on the Department of Health website at www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/12/10/44/04121044.pdf. Copies of the SHIAG report are also available in Library.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>The report&#039;s recommendations are grouped under four main headings: delivering improved services; developing new services; enhancing professional skills promoting sexual health and wellbeing in the 21st century.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>To deliver improved sexual health services, we have included sexual health as a key National Health Service priority for the coming year. This priority is being supported by the department at a local level with the majority of extra funding announced in the <i>Choosing Health</i> White Paper for sexual health being dispersed over the next two financial years.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The publication <i>The NHS in England: The operating framework for the NHS for 2006&#150;07 </i>highlights as a priority for action &quot;sexual health and 48-hour access to genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics&quot;. Faster access to GUM services means that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) will be treated more quickly and therefore the risk of their spreading or complications developing will reduce. This will help to drive STI rates down to much lower levels, meaning better health for individuals and better value for money for the taxpayer and the Government.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Faster access to GUM services will involve a renewed focus on modernisation and re-engineering of all sexual health services including those in reproductive health and in particular in contraception. It signals the need to continue to do more in the community and develop a range of settings for sexual health services. This has been further reinforced with the our recent White paper <i>Our Care, Our Health, Our Say</i>, which fires the starting gun on the development of better community based and more patient-centred services across the board, and indeed the White Paper makes specific reference to sexual health as an important area for these developments. This will go <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS97"></a>

hand in hand with the work we are doing on training in support of the Faculty of Family Planning and Reproductive Healthcare.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>To date, we have made some solid progress. Already 49 per cent of patients are accessing GUM services within 48 hours, and in some areas, the percentage is significantly higher. Gonorrhoea rates, which are acknowledged as the best indicators of overall STI rates, measured in GUM services are decreasing. This is a welcome indication of progress being made.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>The chlamydia screening programme will help drive down the rates of chlamydia, the most common STI in both men and women. And crucially it will help to reduce the incidence of infertility, which can occur by leaving chlamydia untreated, and will ultimately save the NHS over &#163;100 million per year in treatment.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>The roll-out of this world-leading programme is well advanced, targeting those most at risk of infection&#151;under 25 year-olds. To December 2005 nearly 150,000 screening tests have been carried out and numbers <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS98"></a>

<b>15 Mar 2006 : Column WS98</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

screened are rapidly increasing. By 2007, the screening programme will cover the whole of England in line with the commitment in the <i>Choosing Health</i> White Paper. As part of this work, a new innovative pilot programme should help to help reach young people. The key drivers of the project are wider and easier access to screening services in order to provide quick and easily available screening options. We have contracted with Boots to evaluate the potential of retail pharmacies as chlamydia screening venues. This was launched in all its London pharmacies in November 2005.
</p>

<a name="60315-56_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>Our ambition is to mainstream sexual health as far as possible. Every part of society needs to be involved in the effort to improve sexual health. Indeed, while the Government have clearly prioritised this issue, it is not just about Government action but also about a range of organisations and in particular, it is about individuals taking responsibility for their own sexual health. It is only by doing this that we will fully achieve good sexual health and the world-class health services, which we are aiming for.

<a name="60315w01_wqn0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What support they offer to farmers and the wider farming industry for the dissemination of information on innovative farming techniques.  [HL4415]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="60315w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  The Government recognise the importance of ensuring that the farming industry remains dynamic and innovative. Viable and sustainable businesses are crucial to the prosperity of the countryside. In the <i>Rural Strategy 2004</i> Defra made a commitment to providing rural businesses with access to appropriate business support and training. Since then, we have worked with partners from central, regional and local government on a number of projects to help rural businesses get the help and advice they need.
</p>

<a name="60315w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>Building on work under the learning, skills and knowledge programme (LSK), Defra continues to work with the Sector Skills Council for the environmental and land-based sector (Lantra) on the provision of, and demand for, skills training and development for rural businesses. Lantra is developing a competence framework for the land-based sector and will be piloting this within selected sub-sectors. We are also working with Lantra to develop a mechanism for recognising skills gained through experience as well as formal qualifications attained.
</p>

<a name="60315w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>Some of the support offered to farmers and the wider industry for the dissemination of innovative farming information include:
</p>

<a name="60315w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>The National Non-Food Crops Centre (NNFCC), which is sponsored by Defra, develops products, processes and technologies from agricultural materials and acquires and disseminates the latest information on non-food crops, technologies and markets to farmers and the wider farming industry, as well as to all other relevant stakeholders throughout the supply chain. The centre&#039;s purpose is to provide a single, independent and authoritative source of information on the use and implementation of non-food crop products and technologies in the United Kingdom. The NNFCC can also provide farmers with advice and guidance on contracts and procurement issues.
</p>

<a name="60315w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>The Farm Business Advice Service is helping farmers to consider options for the future of their business. The current service was launched on 21 October 2005. Funded by Defra, it is available to farmers claiming the single payment scheme in England until March 2007.
</p>

<a name="60315w01_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>The rural enterprise scheme (RES), which forms part of the England rural development programme, can provide support to farmers for good quality, <br>&nbsp;<br>

sustainable diversification projects to help businesses respond to new economic opportunities available in the rural economy, beyond agriculture.
</p>

<a name="60315w01_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>The vocational training scheme, which also forms part of the England rural development programme, provides funding for vocational training activities that contribute to an improvement of the occupational skill and competence of farmers and others involved in farming (including horticulture) and forestry activities and their conversion (that is, diversification).
</p>

<a name="60315w01_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a>As ERDP is coming to an end, the last application date for the RES and VS is 30 June 2006. We are currently consulting on a successor scheme for ERDP.

However, given the increasingly multi-disciplinary nature of research and the way that information is held on research funding, this is likely to be an underestimate as social science routinely complements natural science within projects.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_26"></a>Further to the Written Answer by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Rural Affairs, Landscape and Biodiversity, Mr Jim Knight, on 11 January (<i>Official Report,</i> Commons, 626W). what steps they have already taken to obtain guaranteed status for Gloucester Old Spot pork and bacon; and what they plan to do to obtain compensation for the 18-month delay in the European Commission&#039;s response.  [HL4587]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_24"></a>
<a name="60315w04_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  The application process for obtaining traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) status for products such as Gloucestershire Old Spot pig meat involves two stages. The first stage involves an assessment by Defra that the relevant requirements for registration are fulfilled. This assessment was completed in early 2004 and officials concluded that the application was justified and met the requirements of the EU regulations. The application was therefore forwarded to the European Commission for its consideration (the second stage of the process). As Written Answer (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 2043W) stated that we are still waiting to hear the outcome of the Commission&#039;s deliberations and have been in regular contact with the Commission to chase up progress.
</p>

<a name="60315w04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a>I share the concern of the applicant group about the long delay. However, there is no provision under the EU protected food name scheme to enable compensation to be obtained for such delays.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_31"></a>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Davies of Oldham on 14 February (<i>WA 157&#150;64</i>), what action they are taking to reduce the percentage increase in cost estimates in Highways Agency targeted programme of improvement schemes; and, in particular, whether (a) any staff have been disciplined over these increases; (b) they have provided more funds to meet the extra costs; (c) schemes have been delayed as a result of such cost increases; and (d) Ministers have expressed concern about these increases.  [HL4468]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_29"></a>
<a name="60315w04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The Highways Agency is continuing to work closely with the supply chain to drive down costs of construction across the whole of the targeted programme of improvements (TPI) and is taking a far more realistic view of .the likely final costs of projects. The programme is subject to external cost pressures, including rising energy prices, which have driven cost inflation above the retail price index in the road construction industry. The agency continuously reviews its forecasts of scheme costs and the reported increases record updates in estimates for schemes during their planning phase, not over expenditure under construction. Rigorous processes for cost control are in place. The agency scrutinises thoroughly individual potential cost increases and a review of the impact on the overall programme is undertaken, together with an independent evaluation of value for money, to inform the decision whether or not to continue to take the scheme forward.
</p>

<a name="60315w04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a>No agency staff have been disciplined over scheme cost increases. The agency&#039;s project teams are working hard to identify and .manage the risks of potential cost increases in advance of any final commitment to construct the scheme.
</p>

<a name="60315w04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a>The Highways Agency is continuing to deliver its agreed programme, as set out in its 2005&#150;06 business plan, within the funding levels agreed in the 2004 spending review. The level of funding agreed in the 2004 spending review took account of the fact that some schemes were subject to cost increases. Within the Highways Agency&#039;s total budget envelope, individual scheme budgets are adjusted to reflect increases in scheme costs, subject to the satisfactory completion of the necessary reappraisal and approval procedures.
</p>

<a name="60315w04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_26"></a>There has been no significant delay to schemes as a result of cost pressures. Progress of the TPI is monitored through a progress point system where points, up to a maximum of 100, are awarded upon completion of various events during the delivery of a scheme. Each year business plan targets are set for progress points, representing 95 per cent. of what the agency is expecting to deliver. The agency met its progress point target in 2004&#150;05 and is on course to do so again in 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<a name="60315w04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_27"></a>The agency&#039;s chief executive meets regularly with the Department for Transport board and Ministers to consider and review cost pressures and the resultant <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60315w05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The child and working tax credits are part of the tax system, so the rules regarding the treatment of maintenance payments for tax credit purposes follow the same rules as those for income tax. As maintenance payments are exempted from income tax in the hands of the person receiving them it follows that they are disregarded when calculating the amount of tax credits to which the claimant is entitled. The Government decided that the treatment of maintenance received in the tax credit rules should follow the income tax rules.

<a name="60315w07_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  The Government support Turkey&#039;s application to join the EU and welcomed the opening of accession negotiations on 3 October 2005. This was made possible by the progress which led the European Council to agree in December 2004 that,

<a name="60315w07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_36"></a>Before accession, Turkey will be required to have met EU standards in the 35 chapters of the <i>acquis</i>, as well as the political criteria. Advancement in negotiations will be measured against Turkey&#039;s progress. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary raised the need for further reforms, including on the freedoms of religion and expression, when he visited Turkey in January.

<a name="60315w07_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  The latest available information released by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) showing students who had applied by the mid-January deadline disaggregated by age, gender and socio-economic group is given in the tables.

come   in. The next UCAS press releases will cover applicants who have applied by the end of March (usually around 80 to 85 per cent. of final applicants) and by the end of June (around 90 to 95 per cent). The socio-economic figures (which show decreases of 6 per cent. for classifications 1 to 3 and 5.6 per cent. for classifications 4 to 7) do not fit with the overall decrease of 4.5 per cent. as there has been an increase of 1.2 per cent. in the    number of applicants whose socio-economic background is not known. But the proportions of English applicants to UK institutions from the standardly-defined higher and lower socio-economic backgrounds were unchanged from 2005: 69 per cent. of applicants to UK institutions came from socio-economic classifications 1 to 3, and 31 per cent. from classifications 4 to 7.

<p><a name="wa_st_47"></a>
<a name="60315w07_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  The Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006 have not yet been laid in Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60315w07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_37"></a>It is important to note that it is already an offence to burn waste in some circumstances. Section 2 of the Clean Air Act 1993 prohibits emissions of dark smoke from the open burning of material on industrial and trade premises, subject to certain exceptions, and provides for a maximum fine of &#163;20,000. Section 20 of the 1993 Act prohibits emissions of smoke from chimneys of properties in smoke control areas and provides for a maximum fine of &#163;1,000 on summary conviction. If the area is not a smoke control area, it could be a statutory nuisance offence under Section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
</p>

<a name="60315w07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_38"></a>The change to Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act will make it an offence to treat, keep or dispose of household waste within the curtilage of a dwelling in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health.
</p>

<a name="60315w07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_39"></a>Local authorities have powers to taken action against offenders but it will be for local authorities to decide how this power is used, in line with local enforcement policies.
</p>

<a name="60315w07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_40"></a>In addition to the previous public consultation and national press releases, when the change is made, Defra will encourage the Local Government Association to send out an alert to its local authority members announcing the legislative changes.

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_55"></a>Whether the Waste Management Licensing (England and Wales) Regulations 2006 implements a European Union Directive; and, if so, which directive.  [HL4524]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_48"></a>
<a name="60315w07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The Environment Agency is the competent authority for the waste management licensing regime. However, waste collection authorities have powers to take action against illegal waste disposal or &quot;fly-tipping&quot;. Under the voluntary fly-tipping protocol agreement, local authorities focus on the smaller incidents of illegal waste disposal whereas the Environment Agency deals with larger, more serious incidents.
