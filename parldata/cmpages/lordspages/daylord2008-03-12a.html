<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether the central government in Afghanistan are the most cost-effective channel for humanitarian aid and reconstruction.</p>

The Peace Dividend Trust conducted a study and estimated the local economic impact of aid spent through government systems to be more than four times greater than aid spent through international contractors or even non-governmental organisations. The United Nations in Afghanistan has a mandate for humanitarian aid and at present we believe it is best placed to deliver this.</p>

Of course, I agree with her that the Afghan Government are the main channel of assistance but with $2 to 3 billion dollars flowing into this country every year, there is a limit to government capacity and to what they can absorb. Does she agree that donor co-ordination is essential at this time? Money is coming in unco-ordinated from many different sources. Does she further agree that we need to give more long-term funding to civil society organisations so that projects such as the national assistance programme, which has been very successful, can be secured and become an example for other projects?</p>

I assure him that while we will continue to help through the Afghan Government structures the 18,000 community development councils with building schools, health clinics and other things, we believe that we need to engage further with NGOs. He is absolutely right that they face huge constraints and we need to support them as much as we can. As regards the donor co-ordination that he raised, we believe that the UN has potentially a far stronger role to play in that.</p>

<p><a name="08031248000406"></a>Given that there is a danger of losing hearts and minds as we lose the security battles there, what proposals do the Government now advocate to try to put this situation right and to bring peace and cohesion at local level?</p>

Afghanistan is still one of the poorest countries in the world. However, real progress is being made in parts of Afghanistan. Five million children are going to school, 2 million of whom are girls. The economy is growing and 82 per cent of people now live in districts where they have access to some basic healthcare; in 2001, the figure was 9 per cent. So some progress is being made. However, the noble Baroness is right that we need to have local schemes on the ground that really help people. Through the national solidarity programme there are 31,000 small-scale projects to improve clinics, schools, water supplies and electricity generation. Half a million families, comprising ordinary people such as shopkeepers, tailors, farmers and builders, are engaged in microfinance, which enables them to take up loans and start building small entrepreneurial organisations.</p>

The UK Government, through DfID, the FCO and other government departments, make help available to NGOs. Part of that help will be training. We are directly helping Womankind, empowering women in Afghan society, which is very important. We are helping the Halo Trust, which looks at demining, another very important area. I will get back to the noble Lord on the religious aspect.</p>

They seem to do the farm work, growing their own crops and tending animals. This was all very much destroyed by the Taliban. Rather than just grow poppies, they need to grow other things.</p>

Empowering and supporting women is important. Hardly any girls were in school before 2001. Under the Taliban it was illegal to educate young women, so it is important to support women. Seventy per cent of those receiving small microfinance loans, on which we touched earlier, are women. That is very important and we will continue to support women.</p>

Does she accept that aid which is not passed through government can have the effect of undermining the Afghan Government when we should be strengthening them? If there is a problem with capacity in the Afghan Government, surely the answer is not to change the way we give aid but to give more of it to strengthen governmental institutions.</p>

He said that the current numbers would be unsustainable in coming years when he looked at resources. Since then, he has publicly said that he would expect any fall to be very small. As I say, there are more than 140,000 police officers now compared with 127,000 in 1997.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08031248000418"></a> Clause 191, page 134, line 34, leave out &#147;presumption&#148; and insert &#147;discretion&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80312-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08031248000111"></a>The noble Lord said: I am pleased to see that the Bill retains the interest of your Lordships, even though we are in the eighth day of Committee. We move to the part of the Bill&#151;Clause 191&#151;that relates to the disclosure of information about convictions of child sex offenders to members of the public. Noble Lords will recall that as long ago as 2000 there was a campaign to introduce Sarah&#146;s law, as it was called, into this country to mirror, or perhaps to follow, Megan&#146;s law in the United States.</p>

<a name="80312-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08031248000112"></a>It is interesting that the report commissioned in 2006 by the NSPCC on the impact of Megan&#146;s law in the United States found that there was no one single version of Megan&#146;s law but that there were many different variations of community notification. The laws were given legitimacy by assumptions about the nature of sexual offending, but there was little empirical evidence that community notification had had a positive effect on preventing reoffending and protecting children.</p>

<a name="80312-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08031248000113"></a>It was found that the level of registration of sex offenders in the United States had fallen since the implementation of Megan&#146;s law. In this country, the level of notification of sex offenders under the Act is 97 per cent. In the United States, only 80 per cent of sex offenders comply with registration requirements and, in some areas, since Megan&#146;s law was introduced the registration is as low as 50 per cent. Furthermore, in the United States, efforts to locate offenders again after they have gone missing are limited and ineffectual. That gives rise to the concern that we share on these Benches that compliance with the registration requirements in England and Wales will also fall if offenders are constantly moving and hiding themselves to avoid their details being accessed.</p>

<a name="80312-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08031248000114"></a>There are other problems. In this country, 80 per cent of children subjected to sexual assault will know their attacker, and in a high proportion of the cases it is a family member or a friend. Wider disclosure of the details of sex offenders would, we argue, lead to the identification of a previous victim where that victim is their child. There is also evidence that victims of intra-familial abuse may be deterred from reporting crimes because of fears related to community notification.</p>

<a name="80312-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08031248000115"></a>In this country, the Sex Offenders Act 1997 created notification obligations for persons convicted of certain offences to inform the police of their address and their changes of address. The current position is that there is multi-agency involvement in sex offender  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1518"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>notification concerning offenders who present a risk to children. If information is received by the agencies concerned that an offender represents a significant risk, for example, to a specific school, further notification may take place, but it is a matter for discretion. Following a risk assessment review, it may currently be felt necessary to inform the head teacher of the risk. Such disclosure takes place only with the authority of the local multi-agency public protection panel. That is the current system.</p>

<a name="80312-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08031248000116"></a>Clause 191 introduces measures concerning the disclosure of information that create a presumption of disclosure about the conviction of sex offenders to members of the public. The notification scheme clearly goes far beyond that envisaged and created by the Sex Offenders Act 1997. The responsible authority under the clause must consider whether to disclose information about the conviction of sex offenders to particular members of the public. As I have said, there is a presumption of disclosure: if the responsible authority has reasonable cause to believe that the sex offender poses a risk, disclosure is necessary to protect a child or children from harm. The presumption exists whether the person to whom the information is conveyed asks for it or not. It is also subject to conditions, which are not spelt out in the Bill. It may be a condition that you would not be able to tell your neighbour. It would be a very odd way of protecting children if information is passed to person A in order to protect the children of person A but they are prevented from passing it on to person B next door in order to protect their children. The conditions potentially impose at least a moral responsibility on the person to whom the information is disclosed to convey that information to others.</p>

<a name="80312-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08031248000117"></a>In any event, how are these conditions imposed on disclosure to be enforced? Let us suppose that a person who receives the information breaks the conditions under which it has been given. Does that create some form of criminal offence, civil liability, or what? It is not at all clear. It may be that the Government envisage passing on to a parent details of a sex offender&#146;s convictions, saying, &#147;You may not pass it on to anybody else, act on it or do anything against the individual with the convictions. We are just telling you&#148;. That does not seem to be a very useful provision.</p>

<a name="80312-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08031248000118"></a>We propose in our amendments to replace the presumption of disclosure with a discretion on the part of the authority concerned to pass on information. We also propose that the presumption in new Section 327A(4) as inserted by Clause 191 should not arise,</p>
<ul><a name="08031248000606"></a>&#147;whether or not the person to whom the information is disclosed requests the disclosure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031248000407"></a>If there is to be disclosure to an individual, the very first condition should be that that person seeks it because they have fears for their child in relation to a person. Those are the proposals in our amendments. I beg to move.</p>

As an old&#151;and I mean old in every sense of the word&#151;juvenile court chairman of many years, one went through the whole procedure of sending children off to approved schools.

I venture to suggest that we share the same overall aims for the clause. We wish to ensure the effective protection of children from sex offenders while wishing to guard against the perils of inappropriate and unduly widespread disclosure, for the reasons that have been given by a number of Members of the Committee. Those aims are also shared by the organisations and agencies   


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1520"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which we consulted during the review of the protection of children from sex offenders, the conclusions of which, including the recommendation to introduce a statutory duty to consider disclosure, were welcomed by those organisations.</p>

<a name="80312-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08031248000127"></a>In direct answer to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, this is not Megan&#146;s law. It builds on the existing practice of controlled disclosure, and we took account of the NSPCC representations during the review and the passage of the Bill. It might be useful to give the example of an offender who is convicted of sexual assault against a child and becomes subject to the notification of requirements imposed by the Sexual Offences Act. That would place him under the management of MAPPA. The offender meets a new partner&#151;a single mother with young children&#151;and subsequently moves in with her. Under the notification requirements, he is obliged to inform the police of his new address, which he does. This being brought to the police&#146;s attention triggers a risk assessment as part of the MAPPA process. It is identified that the offender poses a risk to his partner&#146;s children who also reside at his new address and under the new duty imposed by this Bill, the MAPPA responsible authority is under a duty to consider disclosure. MAPPA has identified that there is a risk to children and concludes that disclosing information on this risk to his new partner is necessary to protect these children from serious harm. Disclosure is made in accordance with all the relevant principles to ensure that this is done sensitively and in a planned and appropriately managed way, taking account of all the risks, including to the offender. I put that in just to give a flavour of the way this  would apply.</p>

<a name="80312-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08031248000128"></a>We acknowledge that there are concerns about the nature of this clause, motivated particularly by the fear that it may lead to disclosure of information in inappropriate circumstances or to an unnecessarily wide extent. I wish to emphasise that this is not our aim. Our aims, as we made clear in the review, are to extend the use of controlled disclosure where it is an appropriate and necessary response to a risk of serious harm to a child or children to ensure that there is consistency&#151;consistency is important&#151;in the practice of disclosure and to ensure that the decision to disclose results from a formalised and auditable process. When these provisions were debated in another place, there were some concerns about the liability imposed on MAPPA authorities, for example in circumstances where they decided against disclosure. Consequently, I think it would be helpful for me to make it clear that the amendments to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which Clause 191 will introduce, are not intended to impose liability on the MAPPA authorities for breach of their statutory duty to consider disclosure in accordance with these provisions or for a failure to disclose, despite the presumption applying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08031248000129"></a>The amendments we have tabled maintain our overall aim but seek to address concerns that aspects of this clause, as currently drafted, could lead to inappropriate levels of disclosure. The amendments tabled by the noble Lord and the noble Baroness appear to be motivated by similar concerns but would have the effect of undermining the need for a consistent approach  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1521"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the practice of controlled disclosure and would also remove safeguards against inappropriate disclosure. Amendment No. 175 seeks to provide the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements authorities, commonly known as MAPPA, with the discretion to disclose information about convictions of child sex offenders to members of the public. These authorities already have this discretion and use it where appropriate in accordance with the statutory guidance. This amendment therefore would not provide further assistance to the MAPPA authorities in determining the circumstances in which information should be disclosed. Providing such assistance with the aim of ensuring consistency is the purpose of Clause 191.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08031248000130"></a>Amendment No. 176 seeks to remove the whole of subsection (4) of new Section 327A of the 2003 Act. Government Amendment No. 176A will remove subsection (4)(b) but we wish to retain subsection (4)(a), which indicates that the presumption to disclose arises whether or not the person to whom the information is disclosed requests the disclosure. It is important that the Bill makes it clear that the presumption to disclose does not depend on a request being made by a member of the public and that this clause relates to the proactive consideration of disclosure by MAPPA authorities while they are discharging their general duty to co-operate in the management of child sex offenders. I wish to emphasise at this stage that Clause 191 does not grant any new right to the public to receive information automatically on request.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08031248000131"></a>With regard to government Amendment No. 176A, the MAPPA responsible authorities already disclose to those who are not related to the child at risk, such as head teachers, landlords and leisure centre managers and it is intended that the presumption to disclosure should apply to any member of the public where disclosure to them is necessary to protect the child, whatever their connection to the child. However, as the paragraph was only intended to clarify the position rather than encourage the authorities to introduce significantly more widespread disclosure than occurs currently, we are prepared to remove this paragraph from the Bill.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08031248000132"></a>Amendment No. 177 would remove subsection (5)(b) of new Section 327A which provides that any MAPPA responsible authority, when making a disclosure, will be able to place conditions on the recipient to prevent that information being disclosed to others. Such conditions may well be necessary and the ability to impose these conditions will be an important safeguard against the inappropriate dissemination of information. It is necessary therefore to retain this aspect of the clause. If there is a breach of conditions in keeping information confidential, there is no specific penalty&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, raised this&#151;provided in the clause, but an action can be brought for breach of confidence in the civil courts. This may result in an injunction being made. Existing communal penalties could also be available if it was felt that that was appropriate. This is mainly to put a block on people so that they understand that they should not just talk loosely about this. That is the prime reasoning  behind it.</p>

However, we have tabled government Amendments Nos. 175A and 175B in order to address these concerns and to make clearer the circumstances in which the presumption will apply. Our amendments have been developed in consultation with the NSPCC and Barnardo&#146;s, and address concerns that they have raised with us during the passage of the Bill. The NSPCC and Barnardo&#146;s support these amendments and we are grateful for their contribution.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08031248000134"></a>If government Amendments Nos. 175A and 175B are agreed by the Committee the presumption to disclose would arise only if a child sex offender managed by a MAPPA responsible authority in a particular area poses a risk in that or any other area of causing serious harm to any particular child or children, or to children of any particular description, and the disclosure of information is necessary to protect the particular child or children, or the children of that description. This is a reasonable basis for such a presumption and will help to ensure that the MAPPA authorities have a clearer indication of the circumstances in which disclosure should be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08031248000135"></a>Government Amendment No. 177A is a technical amendment to amend Schedule 34, which inserts new Schedule 34A into the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It will ensure that a service conviction for an attempted or other secondary or inchoate child sexual offence is relevant for the purposes of defining a child sex offender, and determining what convictions should be disclosed under the presumption.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08031248000136"></a>I reiterate that the NSPCC and Barnardo&#146;s have welcomed our amendments and they oppose Amendment No. 177. I hope that the noble Lord, the noble Baroness and other speakers will consider that our amendments address their concerns. We are not able to amend the Bill precisely as they would like, because to do so would undermine key aspects of the intention of this clause, but we believe that our amendments move in the same direction as they would wish. I hope that our amendments will persuade the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08031248000422"></a> Clause 191, page 135, line 22, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08031248000423"></a>&#147;( ) Where the responsible authority makes a disclosure about any child or young person below the age of 18 under this section&#151;</p>
</ul>(a) the case must be referred to the local children&#146;s safeguarding board and the decision to disclose taken in conjunction with them, and(b) a management plan must be drawn up to include a risk assessment of the consequences of disclosure for the child and steps to address these.&#148;
<a name="80312-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08031248000159"></a>The noble Baroness said: I would like to acknowledge that the amendment is supported by the NSPCC, Barnardo&#146;s, the Lucy Faithful Foundation and the NCH. It expresses our view that there are inadequate safeguards for those children who commit sexual offences against other children. Our concern is based on the inappropriateness of using adult-focused legislation that, in terms of disclosure, treats young people as adult sex offenders.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08031248000160"></a>In our early debates on Part 1, which concerned the bulk of measures regarding young people, many noble Lords spoke about the appropriateness, or otherwise, of recognising that young people, by virtue of their youth, should be treated differently. Our desire to see a difference in treatment between adults and young people is not simply based on age alone. As we know, large numbers of young people who encounter the criminal justice system come to it from backgrounds of great disadvantage, including factors such as learning difficulties, behavioural problems, domestic violence, sexual abuse or essentially having the misfortune to come from a dysfunctional family.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08031248000161"></a>In the case of sex offenders, even if such factors do not figure as mitigating ones in their defence, their moral and emotional development may be such that they do not, or cannot, rationalise about their wrongdoing and the harm that they may have inflicted on the other child or young person. Therefore, they may be extremely vulnerable and the interventions employed by the state in regard to their crime require a different approach from that needed for adults.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08031248000162"></a>I turn to some key factors about young people who display sexually harmful behaviour. First, there are concerns about the scale of the problem. According to the charities which support the amendment&#151;and I have mentioned them&#151;we do not know how many children display sexually harmful behaviour. It is likely to be underreported by parents, carers and professionals working for children because a great deal of harm can come from simply suspecting a young person of something that they may not be able to validate or prove. Moreover, there is no central method of data collection on young people who sexually harm. Research from criminal justice statistics shows that between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of all alleged sexual abuse involves young perpetrators. I understand that approximately one-third of sexual offenders in contact with the criminal justice system each year are adolescents.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1526"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80312-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08031248000163"></a>We have the profile of young people who display sexually harmful behaviour, and we know that in terms of this profile a significant proportion of service users across programmes are described as having a learning disability. I have already touched on that point, but it is worrying that we do not know what the parameters of the problem are. We find that the majority of these children and young people have been or are being sexually, physically and/or emotionally abused themselves.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08031248000164"></a>Furthermore&#151;and this is particularly pertinent to the clause under review&#151; consistent findings indicate that the majority of children who display sexually harmful behaviour do not go on to commit sexual offences as adults. In other words, where there are interventions in the aftermath of committing these offences, there is every hope that the behaviour might be changed. In fact, the success rate for interventions among young offenders is higher than that for adults. </p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08031248000165"></a>Moving on to specific concerns about the use of disclosure in relation to children and young people, we understand that the current MAPPA guidance makes no reference to the disclosure of an offender&#146;s details where the individual is under the age of 18. We consider this to be a significant shortcoming. We believe that safeguards must be in place when disclosure of information about children is made, including specific guidance. The consequences of disclosure can be devastating for children and can lead to bullying, harassment, discrimination and the loss of future opportunities. It may be counterproductive to disclose the offence details of young people where the offending is in the past and where they have received treatment and have been assessed as no longer presenting a risk. Disclosure after rehabilitation can only lead to harm and may bring little future risk deferral. Children have a much greater ability to develop out of their offending behaviour and disclosure may mitigate against change by labelling and stigmatising them.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08031248000166"></a>I turn now to the proposals for the four pilot programmes that will deal with adult sex offenders. Even if the pilot studies are successful, we nevertheless wish to be reassured that there would have been an empirical demonstration that the system can operate safely in relation to adults before it is extended to children and young people. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08031248000167"></a><b><a name="80312-0003.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08031248000723"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> I accept the spirit of this amendment and acknowledge the particular issues that arise when a MAPPA authority is considering the disclosure of information on the convictions of a child sex offender who is under the age of 18. The noble Baroness is right that this often concerns people who have been abused themselves over prolonged periods and who are extremely vulnerable. It is important that the welfare of young offenders is taken into account in these circumstances, but equally I know we all accept that the risk posed by young sex offenders to others still needs to be managed.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08031248000168"></a>The processes established by the existing duty to co-operate under Section 325 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 ensure that such issues will be considered and assessed. In particular, social services and youth offending teams are under a duty to co-operate with  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1527"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1527</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>MAPPA and will normally be expected to attend MAPPA meetings. Their involvement will help to ensure that the particular needs and welfare of the young offender are discussed when MAPPA decides whether to disclose information on that offender&#146;s convictions to a member of the public.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08031248000169"></a>Any young person who becomes the subject of a disclosure would have been referred to MAPPA by the youth offending team who would be responsible for the management of that particular case and involved in the decision and the ongoing risk management plan. MAPPA does and will consider the children&#146;s interests, as required by Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Youth offending teams should be involved in any disclosure decisions and  the existing legislation clearly envisages MAPPA managing young offenders. Any young person who becomes the subject of a disclosure would, as I say, have been referred by the youth offending team.</p>

<a name="80312-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08031248000170"></a>While I accept the intention of the amendment&#151;I discussed this in some detail with my team&#151;I did not feel it necessary to require the involvement of local safeguarding children&#146;s boards. The noble Baroness has spoken very eloquently on this point and I would like to think further about it. Perhaps we can arrange a meeting before Report. I might possibly be convinced but I do not want to have unnecessary legislation in the Bill when this has already been covered. On that basis I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

While we understand that the youth offending teams would bear in mind mitigating circumstances in making a decision about disclosure, we welcome the Minister&#146;s idea of considering this matter further and going into some examples that we might have of how the system would operate. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08031248000181"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving the amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 177AF.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08031248000182"></a>We have moved on to Clause 194, and&#151;in this rather extraordinary Bill&#151;from sex offenders to tobacco sales. I think that the noble Lord will be familiar with the three groups of amendments which I shall deal with because they were discussed in another place. The British Retail Consortium and the Association of Convenience Stores have also been in touch with the department to put their concerns to it. They have also briefed me and suggested the amendments which I now raise.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08031248000183"></a>Clause 194 brings in new powers to take away the licence to sell tobacco from shops if they persistently sell it to underage people or commit other tobacco offences. We have no objection to that. These probing amendments are designed to tone down the strength of the proposals and bring in some safeguards.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08031248000184"></a>Currently, when the offender has been convicted of a tobacco offence, he can have his licence taken away if he has also committed other tobacco offences within the previous two years; that is, if this is the third offence in two years. The first group of amendments, Amendments Nos. 177AA and 177AF, suggest that it would be fairer to the individual accused of such offences if he could be notified after the first time that some such offence had been committed. We think it vital that the retailer or his staff are provided with the opportunity to address the breakdown in their internal procedures that has allowed the sale of tobacco to underage people.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08031248000185"></a>It is bad practice and possibly counterproductive to allow the situation to develop whereby an enforcement officer could withhold information about an offence having taken place so as to pursue a prosecution and a sanction later. In the interests of natural justice it would be fairer to the individual if he was told, &#147;We believe that you have been selling tobacco inappropriately to young people&#148;&#151;or whatever the relevant wording is for such a tobacco offence&#151;&#147;Tighten up your procedures so that it does not happen again. I have to warn you that if it does happen again, or twice more, on the basis of &#145;three strikes and you&#146;re out&#146;, you might lose your licence to sell tobacco&#148;. I hope that the noble Lord finds that a fairly simple concept to grasp. I beg to move.</p>

There is a lot of sense in the probing that the Conservative Front Bench is undertaking in this amendment. I am sure that this measure would pose less of a problem to larger retailers as they have more personnel overseeing this area and many more policies in place. However, we are concerned about small shopkeepers. Although they should not break

We should bear in mind that they often comprise one-man bands trying to do a thousand different jobs. This is a necessary probing amendment. We certainly support it more than we do one or two others that we shall discuss shortly.</p>

<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="08031248000187"></a><b><a name="80312-0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08031248000728"></a>Lord Graham of Edmonton:</b> I declare an interest as an officer of the All-Party Parliamentary Retail Industry Group, which is supported by the retail consortium of which the Co-operative movement is a member. I have a declared interest there which I readily admit.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08031248000188"></a>One has to bear in mind that the representations that have been made, for instance by the retail consortium, represent 90 per cent of retail sales in this country. The Government should explain why they are not prepared to give due weight to, or why they should put aside lightly, the views of a body of that size. I am told that the relevant figure in connection with the Association of Convenience Stores is over 30,000. The noble Baroness on the Liberal Benches rightly pointed out that it is comparatively easy for the very large supermarkets, if they are found guilty of enabling these sales, to subject the individual who is alleged to have agreed to the sale in question to some stricture. However, as regards a small business&#151;of which there are still very many&#151;one has to be reasonably fair.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08031248000189"></a>The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, strikes me as sensible. Retailers are sensitive about their responsibilities as regards the sale of not only tobacco but alcohol. I hope the Minister will comment on comparability of treatment in these matters. I understand that guidance is to be issued on how effect will be given to this. The Minister will be well aware that guidance has no relevance in law; it is guidance. Therefore, some trading standards officers may operate under the guidance and some may not. Then you have a situation where small shops which trade fairly and legally fall by the wayside for one reason or another and are not treated in the same way as other retailers.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08031248000190"></a>I am certain that the law-abiding small trader whose attention is drawn to a dereliction will be quick off the mark to put it right, because his livelihood is at stake. Tobacco sales figure much larger for some shops than for others, but tobacco accounts for a sizeable proportion of sales even in big supermarkets. The Minister needs to take account of that. As far as I am concerned, the Government are right to respond to the general public&#146;s plea that something should be done about the sale of alcohol and tobacco, but they also have a responsibility to recognise that it is sometimes not the fault of the retailer.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08031248000191"></a>Dawn Primarolo, the Minister for Public Health, has said that there is little evidence that the underage purchasing of tobacco is widespread. If it is not widespread, it is present. It is right that government should bring forward some sanction. I have no disagreement with the two manners under which the retailer is punished. Two of the three strikes which  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1530"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1530</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may be applied may come at the beginning of the two-year period, and the other might not take place until towards the end, but the whole of the two-year period is under review. That is inequitable and unfair. </p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08031248000192"></a>The Minister should take from this debate the genuine desire of the retail industry not only to comply with the law but to help the Minister to make good law. Invariably, most retailers are not only good citizens but good members of the community and the public. They do not want to see rogue traders deliberately and underhandedly aid and abet the purchase of tobacco by the underage&#151;or even by those of age who purchase for the underage&#151;and get away with it. I support the amendments in general and look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="08031248000193"></a><b><a name="80312-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08031248000729"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords who spoke to Amendment No. 177A, which draws attention to the provisions on the sale of tobacco. The Government believe that more needs to be done to tackle the problem of underage smoking. Children still have far too easy access to cigarettes. In a recent survey, less than a quarter of 11 to 15 year-olds who tried to buy cigarettes from small shops found it difficult to do so. We need to do more to educate young children in this regard, but we also need to do more to encourage retailers to comply with the law on the age of sale and prevent the sale to children and young teenagers of a product which, as the Committee well knows, can cause lifetime addiction, disabling illness and, too often, premature death.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08031248000194"></a>That is why we have introduced Clause 194&#151;to enable magistrates to impose orders on retailers prohibiting the sale of tobacco for up to one year for persistent flouting of the law and restricting the sale of tobacco to people under the minimum age of 18. These orders are intended only for the most serious cases, let me make that clear. There will need to be three proven instances of breaking the law before trading standards officers can apply for a banning order. At least one of these must be a conviction that supports the application for the order. That will mean, in practice, that such an order will affect only those retailers who repeatedly flout the law and have been proven to do so through failed test purchases supervised by trading standards officers.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08031248000195"></a>The point has rightly been made that the vast majority of small retailers are law abiding and perform a wonderful service for their local communities. Of course, it is for trading standards in the various local authorities to apply the law as they see fit. They are advised by their local authority body, LACORS, to do so with a light touch and not always to move to prosecution at the very first instance. That is why we intend that the noble Lord&#146;s objective should be achieved in comprehensive guidance on how trading standards should respond to this particular wrong. Although my noble friend Lord Graham makes a point about differences in trading standards between different areas, we hope the guidance will be accepted by trading standards across the board,</p>

If a legitimate retailer has trained his staff not to sell tobacco to people under 18, he will have a legitimate interest in knowing whether a rogue member of staff has breached the law. We understand why the amendment has been tabled and why it proposes a notification requirement. We support the introduction of such a requirement but believe that it should be delivered through guidance and not in the Bill.</p>

If the proposed guidance provides for that, it will partially meet the point, because trading standards officers will in practice be advised by the Government to immediately inform the shopkeeper that there has been a dereliction. That would go some way towards what we want.</p>

Certainly our view is that it should go close to saying that there should be early notification to retailers if it is thought that they have sold to underage children. We believe that working through guidance will allow time for consultation on the details of notification requests and provide for a more flexible process than a statutory notification requirement would.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08031248000200"></a>The amendment proposes an unrealistic and expensive obligation on trading standards that could divert some of their limited resources from their core functions, which is to prevent the sale of tobacco and alcohol to young people, one of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. We think that an absolute duty to notify within 14 days would impose an obligation to trace and contact everyone performing a management function for a premises. That could be very difficult, expensive and impracticable to fulfil. It will not always be possible to identify and contact everyone working in a management position for a tobacco retailer within 14 days of an offence being committed; sometimes they are at one remove, but at big stores they could be much removed.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08031248000201"></a>We think that guidance is a much more appropriate way of addressing this issue. It is also not common to put this sort of amendment into primary legislation. I therefore hope the noble Lord will be satisfied with the offer and undertaking I have given.</p>

The noble Lord and I know perfectly well that the problem is more likely to apply to the smaller shops. Getting hold of their management would be relatively easy. Getting hold of the management of a large supermarket is also pretty straightforward&#151;one just goes into the supermarket and asks to see the manager. That is another matter.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08031248000205"></a>I am grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s offer of guidance. I still do not understand why this matter cannot be dealt with in statute. As the statute currently stands, it would be possible for an over-zealous trading standards officer, no doubt trying to meet some target probably imposed by central government, to build up his record by not notifying the shop about the offence being committed. In due course, that shop would find itself prosecuted on the third occasion, not aware that it had committed offences on earlier occasions.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08031248000206"></a>The noble Lord says that those offences will have to be proven offences and that, in most cases, there had been a conviction. However, he also made it clear that there could be occasions when there had not been a conviction; that is, when he was tried for the third offence, they could show that he had committed offences on the earlier occasions. It would be more satisfactory, and more in keeping with natural justice, if the shop was notified on the first occasion so that it could improve the training of its staff and ensure that such offences do not happen again. I am sure the Minister will agree that, in the main, it is better to pursue an educative approach of that sort rather than add to the number of those acquiring criminal convictions when there would have been no need to do so if the proper approach had been pursued earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08031248000214"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 177AC to 177AE. These amendments relate to the second point that I wanted to make about dealing with the sale of tobacco, which is the length of the reference period and the length of the ban. First, on the length of the reference period&#151;three offences over two years&#151;I understand that in broadly similar legislation relating to the sale of alcohol the reference period is not two years but three months. It seems only fair that the same rules should apply to both. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08031248000215"></a>Similarly, on the length of the ban, one year is a heavy sentence, especially for some of the smaller shops, a large proportion of whose turnover will be from the sale of tobacco. It may be helpful to give the figure that I have from the British Retail Consortium and the Association of Convenience Stores, because the noble Lord, Lord Graham, mentioned it. On average, 22.3 per cent of the turnover of such stores can be made up of tobacco sales, so this sanction would be a hefty one to impose on them.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08031248000216"></a>I add one other, purely personal, argument, although I do not suppose that it will receive much support from the noble Lord. It is perfectly legal to smoke tobacco, but he is also imposing an inconvenience on the smoker himself, who may want to buy from a particular store that has lost its licence. To impose the sanction on that store for a year rather than three months seems to be rather overdoing it. I beg to move.</p>

The ban is to be imposed only after persistent offences and in a way that is very clear for members of the public, but how are the public to know that a ban has been imposed? I see nothing in the Bill about notices having to be issued. Will it just be left to the shopkeeper to say that a ban is in place? Three months is a difficult period, because it is just about long enough for the public to know that there is a ban before the shop is able to sell tobacco again. If the shopkeeper persists and offends again, there will be another three-month ban. The Government are more correct here in going for a more understandable period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08031248000218"></a>I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Henley, says: it will be a huge burden on shopkeepers who fall foul of the law, albeit that they have knowingly transgressed that law, as will be the level of fine, which we shall discuss shortly. I want to check how the Government arrived at that tariff for this offence. In legislating about this, we are talking about children, but there is still a bit of a schizophrenic attitude in society in general&#151;I am not suggesting that it is here this afternoon. The view is that smoking is very bad but, on the other hand, the Treasury and the shopkeeper must still be allowed to profit from it. Adults are still allowed to smoke if they want. I think that we are half way through an evolutionary process and it is right that we should take some time over it.</p>

<a name="80312-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08031248000219"></a>I emphasise the need for more money to be spent on education, so that the children do not go to the shops in the first place. That is where local authorities come in. Enforcement will come down to LACORS. Trading standards officers are a bunch of people for whom I have tremendous admiration. They have a pretty unenviable job. Usually, they tread a fine line in trying to enforce things and doing so with the consent of the community, whether on the sale of tobacco or on other things. In the regulation of markets, it is difficult to keep the retailers onside. In this case, education must be the front line and I would expect local authorities to take that to heart. These measures will always be a last resort.</p>

Of course, the amendments were tabled out of legitimate concern that the new measures should be implemented fairly. However, I hope to persuade the Committee that, while the amendments have obviously been tabled for the best of reasons, they would seriously undermine the aim of the new orders, which is to deter unscrupulous retailers from selling tobacco to children and young people aged under 18. This is a serious sanction for a serious breach of the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08031248000221"></a>Amendments Nos. 177AB and 177AD would reduce the maximum penalty for persistently flouting the law and selling tobacco to under-18s from a one-year ban on selling tobacco to a three-month ban. That would have the unfortunate effect of removing the deterrent against unscrupulous retailers selling tobacco to children. If the maximum penalty were only three months, an unscrupulous retailer might consider that he could afford to risk a restricted premises closure whereby the premises would be closed for up to three months for the sale of tobacco, after which he might resume business and continue to sell tobacco to people under the minimum age. While we appreciate the potential impact of a lengthy order on retailers, we are determined to deter all shops, whether large, small or medium, from selling tobacco to young people.</p>

<a name="80312-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08031248000222"></a>Of course, the orders will be reserved for serious cases where the law is persistently being flouted. Twelve months is the maximum period for a ban on the sale of tobacco, not the minimum or the guidance period. Magistrates will determine the actual length

It is perhaps common sense to say that the 12-month period is likely to be reserved for the most serious cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08031248000223"></a>Amendments Nos. 177AC and 177AE would reduce, from two years to three months, the period over which persistent breaches of the law on selling tobacco to under-18s have to be demonstrated. Before an order is given, at least three tobacco offences must have been committed over the two years up to the date of the order. In practice, offences relating to the sale of tobacco to under-18s are typically demonstrated through test purchasing for compliance with age of sale for tobacco, undertaken by trading standards. On average, such test purchasing takes place for each tobacco retailer about once or twice a year. Also, it will take some time from the commission of an offence to the date when the magistrates&#146; court considers the order.</p>

<a name="80312-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08031248000224"></a>The amendments would reduce the period over which that persistent sale must be proven to such a short period&#151;from two years to three months&#151;that the proposed orders would not be usable. Given that test purchasing takes place only once or twice a year, it would simply not be possible to demonstrate that three offences had taken place over a three-month period. We think that the two amendments would kill off the legislation. New orders would become entirely ineffective; they would become a laughing stock. I hope that the noble Lord will reconsider his amendments and be kind enough not to press them this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08031248000225"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has twice mentioned the primacy of education for young people. On behalf of the Government, I agree that it is absolutely crucial. National communications campaigns, which she will know about, have been highly effective and are continuing. They encourage people of all ages to stop smoking&#151;of course, it remains legal for adults to smoke if they choose to do so&#151;and they outline the dangers of smoking to people&#146;s health. The noble Baroness will know that there is a lot of education going on for young people; there can hardly be too much. We agree that it is the primary way of stopping young people smoking&#151;certainly not the measure that may or may not be proposed in the next amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08031248000410"></a>I hope that that has been deliberate in omitting cigarette papers because there is a very particular position for young people who play musical instruments. Cigarette papers are very useful for drying the keys of flutes, clarinets, saxophones and other woodwind instruments during a concert. Apparently, they dry them better than anything else, so musicians will often slip a cigarette paper in a damp key to it get to function better. I hope that parents and, indeed, music teachers would be able to buy cigarette papers for such purposes and would not be committing an offence because it is in the interests of children&#146;s education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08031248000238"></a>Although I do not want cigarettes sold in any way to young people&#151;we know the danger for young people in starting smoking&#151;if they acquire a criminal record they get labelled and stigmatised later on. I have some concerns about giving to a teenager who may be at an experimental stage a criminal record that sticks on their file for life. They have a record of an offence and I am concerned about the issues involved with joining a group of people who have a criminal record. There may be an unintended adverse consequence from a proposal that is designed to stop young people getting cigarettes.</p>

We do not want to criminalise more young people. The amendment talks about buying tobacco on behalf of individuals aged under 18; people who are just 18 might be doing that for their younger friends and we will have a swathe of criminals before we know it.</p>

The more you tell young people not to smoke, the more they do it, especially if teachers do it. I am therefore a little cynical about that. It is extremely difficult and we must struggle with it.

The problem is not easily solved. We would have a lot of new criminals of 18 and 19, which we probably do not want. I do not know what the Minister will say.

However, the evidence, which is not mine&#151;it goes much wider than that&#151;is that if you tell young people simply not to do something or make it criminal, such as speeding, they tend to still do it. Indeed, it is sometimes much more exciting to do it. When you tell them why they should not do it, they start to take notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08031248000250"></a>Before I deal with the amendment, I shall come back to the alcohol point that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, mentioned in our debate on the previous amendment. Alcohol test purchases are much more frequent than tobacco test purchases, so three months is reasonable for alcohol, whereas it would not be reasonable for the much less frequent test purchases of tobacco.</p>

<a name="80312-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08031248000251"></a>Amendment No. 177AG would make it a criminal offence for someone under 18 to buy or attempt to buy tobacco, or for an adult to buy or attempt to buy tobacco on behalf of someone under 18. We believe that criminalising young people who attempt to buy tobacco is not the best way to go about reducing the number of children who smoke, and is not in the best interests of young people themselves. It is far better to discourage children from smoking in the first place and to help young smokers to quit than to criminalise them. Our aim is to do everything possible to discourage young people from wanting to smoke by promoting, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has just told the Committee, the health benefits of not taking up the habit when young. It is also important to try to help children who have taken up smoking&#151;there are many of them&#151;to quit. To achieve this, we are encouraging young people to get help from the NHS Stop Smoking Service. We are also making available nicotine replacement therapy to teenagers on prescription.</p>

<a name="80312-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08031248000252"></a>Nor do we think that making an offence of purchasing tobacco by someone under 18 would be likely to be effective. I was delighted to see those who have quite rightly complained many times during this long Committee at the Government for introducing new offences, or for not doing enough to decriminalise young people&#146;s behaviour, get to their feet. I would have been disappointed if the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and many others in the Committee had not got to their feet to make the points that they have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08031248000253"></a>We have heard time and again in Committee that the welfare of the child must be at the heart of the youth justice system. The Government have received support where they have sought to divert young people from the formal court system through measures such as the youth conditional caution. The message has been loud and clear from all sides of the Chamber that, where possible, we should aim to ensure that young people are kept out of the youth justice system and that minor offending does not escalate. Frankly, creating an additional relatively minor offence which would criminalise large numbers of young people would hinder these aims and would not necessarily be very effective. In practice, prosecuting authorities properly do not favour prosecuting children for minor offences unless absolutely necessary because criminalising young people often does further damage to their prospects. The noble Earl was right when he said that on this issue the Government were solidly against the amendment.</p>

<a name="80312-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08031248000254"></a>Public consultation supports our position on this amendment. In the summer of 2006 there was virtually unanimous support for raising the age for the sale of tobacco to 18. Most respondents felt that it was fair for the onus to be on the retailer for ensuring  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1540"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1540</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that children and young people under 18 do not purchase tobacco. As everyone knows, the law changed on 1 October 2007. Research carried out by the Department of Health since the introduction of the age change shows that most retailers and teenagers, including 16 to 17 year-olds, support the change. We recognise that the problem of under-age smoking is a complex issue involving various factors, not just the supply of tobacco to children and young teenagers. That is why the education programme that we have talked about is so important.</p>

<a name="80312-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08031248000255"></a>I turn to what the noble Lord himself identified as the more interesting part of his amendment&#151;the issue of whether to criminalise the proxy purchasing of tobacco by adults for children. Buying tobacco for a young person is plain wrong but there may be difficulties with enforcing such an offence were it to come into being. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, raised a most interesting point about something which would happen in practice a great deal. It would cause many problems for the prosecuting authorities and for families. New laws should generally be grounded on a solid evidence base. We are not aware of any hard evidence that the proxy purchasing of tobacco is a common practice. We know it takes place but surveys tend to show that the most regular smokers under the minimum age usually obtain the tobacco themselves by buying it from shops. I hope I give some comfort to the noble Lord by saying that we will keep the last part of what he has suggested under review&#151;no more than that&#151;and return to it if, as the years pass by, there is evidence of a real problem of adults buying tobacco on a young person&#146;s behalf. So we do not reject out of hand that part of his amendment but, as for the first part of the amendment, I am afraid&#151;in the now no doubt famous words of the noble Earl&#151; &#147;No, please not&#148;.</p>

As I made clear earlier, I am always rather loath to introduce new offences in government Bills. After that experience I will refrain from introducing any new offences for some considerable time. I acquired one fascinating piece of information from the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, about the use of cigarette papers, which incidentally would be covered in Clause 194&#151;page 139, line 29. My amendment merely replicates what is in the Bill. Perhaps the Government would want to look at the sale of cigarette papers in their own drafting of Clause 194. However, having acquired that information, the best thing that I can do is, on behalf of all flautists, saxophonists and others, beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08031248000259"></a>The noble Lord said: With this last non-government amendment, we are very nearly at the end of Committee stage of this Bill. I must congratulate my noble friends on the Front Bench on timing the discussions of these clauses on tobacco control on national No Smoking Day. The fact that that has gone otherwise unremarked in this House indicates the success of the measures in the Health Act 2006. There are one or two veterans of that campaign&#151;one on one side and a couple more with me&#151;who are applauding the legislation which went through and which is proving to be such an enormous success.</p>

<a name="80312-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08031248000260"></a>The indications are that the prevalence of tobacco smoking is generally falling. However, as we have heard in these very interesting recent debates, there is still a substantial problem of smoking by under-age children, which is what I would call them. They are certainly young people and the number of young people who have their first experience of smoking as a child is very high. We must remember that if your first experience of smoking is as a child, the likelihood is that you will stay smoking, because 82 per cent of adult smokers say that they started smoking as teenagers.</p>

<a name="80312-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08031248000261"></a>We also know that there are huge numbers of under-16s who successfully buy cigarettes. Something like half of under-16s bought cigarettes during 2003. Yet&#151;this is the reason for my amendment&#151;there were only 117 prosecutions in England and Wales for selling cigarettes to under-age people. As we have heard, there are around 65,000 tobacco retailers and I have a concern about the measures in the Bill on this subject. If the number of prosecutions is so small, it will be difficult effectively to implement these very important provisions, which I wholeheartedly support. Unless we know what the impact of those orders is, how will the Government monitor how successful they are?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08031248000262"></a>A number of organisations have written to me and I was told about a Nottinghamshire trading standards response. It said that the orders in the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="08031248000610"></a>&#147;will in reality not prove much of a deterrent for retailers bent on selling tobacco to minors. At present, it is understood both by trading standards officers and retailers that the majority of magistrates do not treat this breach of the law particularly seriously when cases go to court&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031248000411"></a>These comments worry me, as they suggest that the very people who are charged with tackling under-age tobacco sales&#151;the trading standards officers&#151;are seriously concerned about how much adherence to the law there is. We should remember that proper enforcement of under-age sales would protect retailers&#151;we have heard a lot on behalf of them today&#151;who abide by the law and would help to clamp down on the sale of smuggled cigarettes.</p>

<a name="80312-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08031248000263"></a>The lack of seriousness with which adherence to the law is taken is highlighted by the disparity between how licensing differs for tobacco products and other items with a minimum age of sale of 18, such as alcohol and fireworks, the sale of which are subject to licensing. Fireworks account for approximately 1,000 injuries per year, which is, of course, far too many. But in the UK, around 114,000 people die from smoking-related illnesses each year. There are strong arguments for introducing a similar licensing system for the sale

A number of countries, such as Spain, Greece, Poland, Hungary, Belgium and Italy, have such licensing systems. It was put to me that perhaps we should discuss an amendment to introduce a positive licensing system of that sort. Certainly, organisations such as ASH, Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation and the Royal College of General Practitioners&#151;as well as, interestingly, a major tobacco manufacturer that has written to me&#151;all say that they would prefer a positive licensing system requiring a retailer to apply for, and to be granted, a licence to sell tobacco. That, however, is for another day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08031248000264"></a>Today, I seek the Committee&#146;s support for a simple amendment to give the Government and Parliament the opportunity to monitor the success of their policy in discouraging underage tobacco sales. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08031248000266"></a>However, I am puzzled by the wording at the end of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. It refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08031248000611"></a>&#147;tobacco offences being committed against persons under the age of 18&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031248000412"></a>Supposing that one were to substitute &#147;alcohol&#148; for &#147;tobacco&#148;; if you heard somebody talk about an alcohol offence being committed against someone under 18, you would assume that that referred to drunken yobs launching unprovoked assaults on innocent teenagers. Such wording would not, however, be used to describe somebody selling a can of lager to those teenagers. Would it not be simpler if the noble Lord&#146;s amendment referred simply to preventing tobacco or tobacco products being sold to persons aged under 18?</p>

I was struck by the YouGov poll that showed such widespread public support&#151;I think that it was 87 per cent&#151;for the idea of a licensing regime for tobacco. That would be logical, as being licensed means that your staff are trained in requiring ID cards, assessing people&#146;s ages and all that comes with that. When we think of the training in food handling needed for even a small shop to sell just a couple of food items&#151;the certificates on food handling, and so on&#151;it is extraordinary that when we come, as the noble Lord said, to selling a product with far greater health implications, one could walk in as a shop assistant and just sell it over the counter.</p>

<a name="80312-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08031248000268"></a>There are many implications behind what the noble Lord says. As for the retailers, if we are to move forward by working out the best way of doing this in conjunction with both them and trading standards officers, then this is a practical way to progress that argument.</p>

In your Lordships&#146; House, we sometimes feel that we could do with feedback on how some new legislation is working. Perhaps we should formally collect the data. At the moment we put down Questions only to find that people have to scurry around trying to pull data together from lots of different sources. If this amendment were accepted, it would allow prospective collection of data that would then allow reporting back. That would be much less costly than a series of parliamentary Questions put down in a year&#146;s time, with people scurrying around to pull data together.</p>

If we have those in a year&#146;s time, we may want to extend it a bit longer than that. However, initially, it will provide a helpful check on what will have been achieved at that stage. Of all the figures on the age at which you start smoking and the damage it does to you, the one that sticks in my mind is that, if you start smoking before the age of 15, your risk of lung cancer is at least doubled. That alone should make us think twice, if not four times, about any of these areas. I backed the rise in the age for purchasing tobacco from 16 to 18 so I very much support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08031248000273"></a>However, it is the fashion that has to change. We all know that teenagers spread fashions among themselves and that it is still very fashionable to smoke among many of them. That is why our education process, although useful, is not the end of the story. The teenagers themselves have got to change their minds about what it is fun and cool to do. At the moment, it is still cool for many to smoke. I hope that, gradually&#151;through government measures, what is said in Parliament and, above all, through what is written in teenage magazines&#151;the fashion will change. Then, we shall scotch the problem, but not until then.</p>

Today, the concept of the medical profession advising people to have cigarettes is incomprehensible. Things have changed enormously. There is merit in what the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, said, but we must go on solely by persuasion, persuasion, persuasion. I think it is a filthy habit but do not see why people should not do it. We must try and persuade them not to.</p>

<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="08031248000275"></a><b><a name="80312-0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08031248000767"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Faulkner for his amendment and to all noble Lords who have spoken to it. I pay tribute to my noble friend for his constant work on this subject over many years. He talked about today being No Smoking Day. It is also Budget Day and measures have been taken on this that should also please him. He made a good point about retailers&#151;quite rightly, we have had important debates on them. However, every time a retailer sells tobacco to under-18s, it is an offence to law-abiding retailers who do not. Therefore, it is for their benefit as well.</p>

<a name="80312-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08031248000276"></a>We recognise that noble Lords are legitimately concerned that this proposal should be delivered in an effective and fair manner. I remind the Committee that we take the problem of under-age smoking very seriously. Noble Lords should have no doubt that we are working hard to make this policy a success.</p>

<a name="80312-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08031248000277"></a>Before addressing the amendment itself, I should like to say a few words about positive licensing. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, made some interesting points in that regard as did my noble friend in moving his amendment. Two years ago we consulted widely on this issue, and the majority of respondents supported a negative licensing system. While we agree that there would be some specific benefits in having a positive licensing system, as outlined by the noble Baroness, there would be additional bureaucratic burdens on local authorities and retailers that would outweigh those benefits. A positive licensing system would require prospective tobacco retailers to apply for a local authority licence before they could sell tobacco products, and retailers found to be persistently breaking the law on underage sales would have their licences removed either on a temporary or on a permanent basis. Under the negative licensing system that we are adopting, retailers are free to sell tobacco but can lose their right to do so under a court-imposed order.</p>

<a name="80312-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08031248000278"></a>This is not a closed subject, of course, but for the moment we think that we are right to go down this path. A negative licensing scheme creates a powerful incentive for retailers to comply with the law on the age of sale without requiring a new and extensive bureaucracy to support it. However, I have no doubt that this debate will continue.</p>

<a name="80312-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08031248000279"></a>This amendment would require the Government to report to Parliament within a year of commencement about the effectiveness of arrangements preventing the illegal sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 18. No doubt noble Lords would bring their customary thoroughness to scrutinising the effectiveness of this policy, but we are not sure that the amendment is an

As the noble Lord, Lord Monson, said, one year is not a realistic period in which to judge the effectiveness of the new system. Noble Lords will recall that the threshold for applications for the new orders will be high: at least three proven instances of non-compliance with the law, at least one of which must be a conviction; and even if a retailer has flouted the law, it will take some time to reach the threshold, particularly if fair and adequate notice is to be given to that business. An order can be made only where three episodes of non-compliance are demonstrated over a two-year period. As I have already told the Committee, the law is not expected to come into force until April 2009 so the result of a review in 2010 would suggest that the new orders were not being used a great deal for the obvious reason that compliance with the law is judged over a two-year period. I do not think that that would be of great assistance to the House in scrutinising this crucial area of policy.</p>

<a name="80312-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08031248000280"></a>However, we understand very well the concern that lies behind the amendment. While we do not think that an inflexible statutory requirement to report to Parliament in a set period would be the best way forward, we believe that noble Lords should have access to full information about the success of this policy. I can therefore assure the Committee that the Department of Health intends to monitor these new measures carefully and report back to Parliament once their effects have become clear. Given that the period over which compliance is judged is two years, it is unlikely to report before 2011, but of course that does not stop noble Lords and Members of another place bringing up this subject in the mean time, which no doubt they will do.</p>

<a name="80312-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08031248000281"></a>The types of information to be covered by the report might include the number of restricted premises and sales orders imposed, the number of prosecutions under the 1933 Act and the number of fixed penalty notices for the sale of tobacco to people under the minimum age. It might include the prevalence of smoking among young people, the number of those under the minimum age who attempt to buy tobacco from retailers, and the difficulty they encounter in making a purchase. That is reported annually in smoking, drinking and drug use surveys, as well as the number of failed test purchases. So I hope that the information that my noble friend is concerned that we should discuss will be before Parliament, but a year from April 2009 is too soon for the data to be as useful as they might be. For these reasons, and thanking him for the amendment, I would ask that he withdraw it.</p>

However, in view of the undertaking that my noble friend has given about a review after two years, I do not intend to do that.</p>

It causes social mischief and creates a health hazard. The message has to go out from the Department of Health that this is unacceptable and that the department wants to see it stopped. Unless we can deal with the problem before people become addicted to this dreadful drug, the prevalence of tobacco will continue to be at a high level. In thanking everybody who took part in the debate and taking on board the assurances given by my noble friend, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08031248000309"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a government amendment to put right something that was not done as it should have been in the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. It is the Government&#146;s policy for the Advocate General for Northern Ireland to exercise superintending powers over the Serious Fraud Office in Northern Ireland following devolution of justice matters. The amendment gives effect to this policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08031248000310"></a>I should take a minute to set out the background. The Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, which some noble Lords present will remember well, prepared for the devolution of criminal justice matters in Northern Ireland by providing for the appointment of an Advocate General for Northern Ireland who would assume responsibility for matters relating to prosecutions that would not be within the competence of the devolved Administration. We intend that the office of Advocate General for Northern Ireland should be held by the Attorney-General for England and Wales for the time being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08031248000311"></a>Prosecution matters in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are, of course, currently the responsibility of the Attorney-General. The 2002 Act makes provision for the responsibility for prosecutorial matters in Northern Ireland to be removed from the Attorney-General and given either to the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland or transferred to the Advocate General for Northern Ireland. However, the superintendence of the work of the Serious Fraud Office in Northern

<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1557"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1557</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the first use of the powers conferred on the National Assembly for Wales under Section 95 of the Government of Wales Act 2006. This enables the National Assembly for Wales to seek legislative competence from the UK Parliament to make a new category of legislation, Assembly measures. These measures will be scrutinised by the National Assembly, just as Parliament scrutinises Bills.</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08031248000344"></a>The 2006 Act includes a number of safeguards to the interests of UK Government in conferring legislative competence on the National Assembly. For example, measures made by the National Assembly have effect only in Wales and only in respect of the scope of the competence conferred. They cannot remove or modify functions of Ministers of the Crown without the consent of the relevant Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08031248000345"></a>On 5<sup></sup>February, the National Assembly considered and agreed the draft order that is before this House and which, subject to the agreement of this House this afternoon and that of the other place next week, will give the Assembly the power to pass measures in the area of additional learning needs in Wales. The draft order will confer further legislative competence on the National Assembly in education and training, an area that has been largely devolved for many years. Welsh Ministers have wide-ranging powers across the spectrum of education and training, including in relation to schools, nursery schools, universities, further and higher education institutions and special educational needs.</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08031248000346"></a>The National Assembly also has legislative competence in many areas of education and training, conferred through framework powers in parliamentary Acts, as set out in Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006, the latest version of which is attached to the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies this draft order. Policy in this area of education has been developed in Wales on a collective, all-party basis; indeed, the draft order originated as a result of the report and recommendations of the National Assembly&#146;s former cross-party Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills Committee. The draft order also reflects recommendations made by the Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales.</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08031248000347"></a>The principle of different educational provision is already well established in law and in practice in Wales. This draft order will enable the Welsh Assembly Government to bring forward measures for special educational provision for children, young people and adults with additional learning needs. It is also important to acknowledge the opportunities that this draft order offers to cover all age groups for lifelong learning, so that adult learners in the community, adult, work-based, further education and higher education sectors may also benefit.</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08031248000348"></a>The proposed order was considered by this House&#146;s Constitution Committee, the Welsh Affairs Committee and a committee of the National Assembly for Wales. The scrutiny process has provided members of these   


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1558"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1558</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>committees and other interested parties, organisations and constituents with the opportunity to comment, question and suggest amendments. All the recommendations arising from the final reports of these committees have been carefully considered and the draft order laid before the House today reflects the outcome of that consideration.</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08031248000349"></a>Under the devolution settlement, the National Assembly has responsibility for special educational needs provision in relation to education and training, but without the legislative powers for it to legislate to change fundamental aspects of provision in this area. At present, the National Assembly has no powers to legislate to strengthen the status of the code of practice for special educational needs in Wales to ensure compliance. The current SEN code of practice provides practical advice to LEAs, schools and other key stakeholders on how to carry out their statutory duties in this area. It is, however, considered to have only weak legal force, as LEAs only have to have regard to it. This contrasts with similar guidance for social services, where established law means that authorities are expected to complywith such guidance.</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08031248000350"></a>There is also no statutory basis by which the National Assembly can consider making the current formal assessment of statementing less prescriptive. Although the Welsh Assembly Government have powers to make regulations about the operation of the statementing process, they are unable to make more fundamental changes to the structure of the statutory process, as this is enshrined in primary legislation. While it is too early to suggest in detail what changes might be necessary, this fundamental weakness was highlighted by the National Assembly&#146;s former Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills Committee in its policy review of the statementing process. It called on the Welsh Assembly Government to seek the necessary powers to secure full legal competence for such statutory assessment arrangements.</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08031248000351"></a>A further limitation on a statutory level is that the National Assembly currently has no power to alter the range of individuals with the right to appeal to the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales, including the right of appeal for children with sufficient understanding to exercise that right, in addition to the right of appeal for parents and carers. The Children&#146;s Commissioner for Wales strongly urged that the Welsh Assembly Government should consider providing a right of appeal for children. He saw this as being particularly consistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which underpins all the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s policies for children and young people. At present the right of appeal is limited to parents and carers of children and young people whose cases have been before the tribunal. It is important that there is opportunity for public consideration of such issues and that widespread consultation with key stakeholders takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08031248000352"></a>The granting of legislative competence on additional learning needs will enable the National Assembly to carry forward its policies and make a real difference to the lives of those Welsh learners, enabling them fully to participate in the many

By and large we support its whole thrust and our queries&#151;or perhaps criticisms&#151;are about the detail. There was some debate in another place over the definitions involved; overall, the order lacks a certain amount of focus. It is drawn up too broadly to enable it carry out a specific function, which is what it is meant to be doing.</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08031248000355"></a>It might interest the noble Baroness, if she does not know already&#151;I have asked her whether the Government will at some stage look at the Government of Wales Bill&#151;that there are now 13 different ways of legislating in Wales.

<a name="80312-0008.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08031248000356"></a>One of the key definitions is that of disability. I understand that the committee in another place recommended that disability should fall in with the description of the World Health Organisation. I believe&#151;I have tried to find my way through all this&#151;that that was discarded by the Welsh Assembly and the description of &#147;disability&#148; is still open in this order. There is also a question about the amendment to the 2006 Act. At the start of the order there is a phrase which leaves us completely in the air. I had intended to quote it and ask the noble Baroness how she interpreted it but my tag marking it has come off. I cannot find it; I apologise.</p>

As a matter of historical significance, it is the first legislative competence order to go through the National Assembly and we welcome that from these Benches. The focus is of course on special educational needs. I want to raise two issues. The first, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, involves the definition of disability and the second concerns transport, particularly to places of higher education.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08031248000359"></a>The chairman of the Assembly Committee on SEN&#151;this involves legislative competence in particular&#151;is concerned about the definition of the word &#147;communication&#148;. The opportunity has been missed to define it more clearly. The provisions focus on the word &#147;communication&#148;, which, I discovered from reading some of the speeches made in the Assembly when it was considering the LCO, is the subject of some controversy.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1560"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1560</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80312-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08031248000360"></a>The Assembly had a function of scrutiny, which it carried out, and it focused on the definition of disability. As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, there are different views on the word &#147;communication&#148; and whether it should be included in the order. The Welsh Assembly Government assume that the phrase &#147;physical or mental impairment&#148; automatically includes a communication impairment, but the National Assembly for Wales committee disagrees. The Welsh Assembly Government and the Welsh Affairs Committee of the other place think that the wording in the order is sufficient.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08031248000361"></a>The Assembly was lobbied by a number of organisations. I have no doubt that they want to live in a perfect world and cannot always get what they want. I refer to the views of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapy on the order. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_183"></a><a name="08031248000600"></a>&#147;We have been disappointed that the Welsh Assembly Government did not include communication impairment in the LCO as recommended by the Assembly Committee ... Communication impairment is a difficulty in decoding or understanding what has been said and a difficulty in expressing oneself through the spoken word, for example a word finding difficulty, a chronic form of the &#145;tip of the tongue&#146; sensation we have all occasionally experienced, which can go unrecognised and unsupported. Everyone has heard of dyslexia, &#145;word blindness&#146; for the written word ... Few have heard of dysphasia, &#145;word blindness&#146; for the spoken word&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80312-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08031248000362"></a>The royal college makes the point that two or three children in every classroom have communication impairment and 6 per cent of the population as a whole has communication impairment. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_184"></a><a name="08031248000601"></a>&#147;Those people have no special rights to support their impairment&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031248000413"></a>at present. It states that there are means to improve the situation for those people, but that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_185"></a><a name="08031248000602"></a>&#147;Children using alternative means of communication such as sign language do not have the right to ask their school for help to let them use their special form of communication&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031248000414"></a>It then mentions the whole problem of and their difficulties in communicating. It also makes the fascinating point that 70 per cent of people in prison have those sorts of problems. That means that we are talking about something extremely important.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08031248000363"></a>I want to make one or two other points, which relate to paragraph 12 of the explanatory document&#151;I thank the Minister for providing all these documents. That refers to a geographical limit to Assembly measures. It imposes a prohibition on Assembly measures having effect other than in relation to Wales. I agree totally with that as a matter of principle. However, in practice, there are some difficulties. Some children from Wales with special educational needs have either to attend or reside in establishments in England. I cite my experience as a Member of Parliament for a constituency, Brecon and Radnorshire, which has a very long border with England. This is a cross-border issue, in fact. We had a big problem in Shropshire with children from Powys going there and the same standards not being applied in Shropshire as they were in Wales. I would like the Minister to comment on a situation where a child, though normally resident in Wales, is not able to receive the good treatment and instruction included in this order because they are in an establishment in England.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1561"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1561</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80312-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08031248000364"></a>I am certainly not satisfied with how far the settlement for devolution in Wales has gone so far, in that it is a hybrid. As a Member of Parliament, one could approach the organisations and the local authorities, in Shropshire for example, and communicate the problem. I note that in the order Assembly Members are not allowed to do that. In fact, the Assembly Members have responsibilities for SEN, so there is a problem, which I would appreciate the noble Baroness commenting on.</p>

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="08031248000365"></a><b><a name="80312-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08031248000787"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> My Lords, I rise to strike a slightly more optimistic note than that already struck. I would like to celebrate today because this is the first such order to come before us since we took the legislation through to allow this. In my view, the scrutiny process has worked well; it is consistent with recognising the unique needs of people in Wales and it extends the competence of the National Assembly for Wales to meet those needs. It seems eminently sensible that the provision for those with special educational needs can be appropriately addressed, as recommended by the review of the committee in the National Assembly for Wales.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08031248000366"></a>The order will ensure that those with special educational needs are protected from discrimination, and it also gives a right of appeal. It will remove the anomaly of the wriggle room that educational authorities have had, which has been confirmed in case law, to get out of spending on those with special educational needs.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08031248000367"></a>I turn briefly turn to the scrutiny process. My view is that it has proven its worth. The Welsh Affairs Committee&#146;s recommendations on the draft Order in Council, on the provision of travel arrangements for those in higher education and the extension of that to cover those under-twos in nursery, have been incorporated. That process revealed the further problem of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Therefore, it has also resulted in modification of the legislative council order to allow provision for those diagnosed with a progressive health condition, such as a brain tumour, before the disability is manifest, rather than them having to wait until it is manifest and then be assessed. By that time, their disability has usually progressed further, and they are always playing catch up in relation to their needs.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08031248000368"></a>The iterative process has worked well, too. Not all the recommendations from the Welsh Affairs Committee have been taken up. As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, the committee recommended that the WHO definition of disability should be used in the order, but that definition is very broad and neither Parliament nor the National Assembly for Wales have any control over it, so it becomes a catch-all.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08031248000369"></a>The problem is that there is no specific definition for the types of disability that the Assembly may need to pass legislation for. Disability and need vary widely across the whole group, which is extremely heterogeneous. No specific definition is included in the order; that seemed to be the right decision because it leaves the National Assembly for Wales with some leeway and flexibility for the different situations that will arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08031248000370"></a>The other recommendation from the committee related to the problem of communication, which was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth. The Welsh Assembly Government have taken the view that the words &#147;physical or mental impairment&#148; are in fact a catch-all. Those terms will include communication. I agree with that decision, and I will explain briefly to the House why I think it is helpful to have it as a broad catch-all.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08031248000371"></a>Conditions such as dysphasia are due to a problem with central processing. We do not yet have very sophisticated imaging techniques to use widely on everyone presenting with word blindness, but I think that we will before too long. My guess is that we will find that within the speech area of the brain there is altered physical processing and that the physiology is not working as well as it should for one reason or another. Speech therapy can retrain the plastic brain&#151;there is plasticity in neurones&#151;to reform connections and to develop and find compensatory ways around a problem. That term &#147;physical&#148; would encompass it. Similarly, deafness is &#147;physical&#148;. You might want to say that because the dysphasia is in the central brain it would come under the catch-all phrase &#147;mental&#148;. I even have a concern about trying to separate &#147;physical&#148; and &#147;mental&#148; too widely, because I think that it is just that the science has not advanced enough for us to identify the physical component of the condition that manifests itself as a mental disorder.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08031248000372"></a>As communication is absolutely key to all issues around consent in society, it is important that anything at all that impairs the ability to take in, process and weigh up information is considered, as well as anything that impairs the ability of a person to simply communicate. That is why it is helpful to have the much broader framework and not to separate it out as a separate class under the name of &#147;communication&#148;.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08031248000373"></a>I hope that other noble Lords will join me in celebrating that a process&#151;namely, the Orders in Council procedure&#151;that we set up, and about which many were sceptical, has indeed been shown to produce an order that should be fit for purpose for Wales.</p>

It is wordy, but it is historic, and it is a first. It is a development arising from the context of the 2006 Westminster legislation that required London and Cardiff to work closely together and to trust each other. In itself, it is a straightforward order; it is bespoke and it is in coherent terminology. Of course, it is not law-making as such, but it grants a competence, and it is for the Welsh Assembly Government and the Assembly to make law and, in this instance, for local education authorities to implement it. That is the pathway, and it is full of good intent. It certainly demonstrates the collaborative capacity of Whitehall, Westminster, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Welsh Assembly to work together. Surely, it augurs well for the future.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08031248000375"></a>I rather think that an order entitled &#147;Constitutional Law Devolution, Wales&#148; is pointing to considerable future increases in the constitutional  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1563"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>powers of the Assembly. I do not think that we should underestimate the long-term consequences of such orders. There are consequences for British governance and for our British constitution, as well as for our country of Wales.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08031248000376"></a>Devolution in Wales and in Britain is getting more substantial by the day. I heard Professor Anthony King say the same in these buildings yesterday. Parliamentary power is being devolved across all of Britain. In the debating Chamber of your Lordships&#146; House one may consider where it might it lead and where it will end. Certainly, devolved Government in Wales is here to stay&#151;it will not go backwards.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08031248000377"></a>One recollects the difficulties encountered in the first referendum in 1979, which was lost. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, who is in his place, probably knows every nook and cranny of Welsh legislation for a whole generation. He was on the winning side then and I was on the losing side. The second referendum was secured by the narrowest of margins in the late hours, and it was the traditional narrow swing.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08031248000378"></a>I support the principal purpose of the order. It surely presages the much-needed reform of children&#146;s special educational needs in Wales. Our Minister in Cardiff, Jane Hutt, has a commitment to those with such needs and she is conscientious in her approach. All of us in public life know that our schools are under unique pressure to deliver on standards and targets. There have been advances but still the child with special educational needs in Wales&#151;and elsewhere&#151;often loses out. I dare say that none of us here can adequately imagine or quantify the miseries of the parents of such children; they will always worry. The Assembly is clearly determined to act.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08031248000379"></a>I hope that the good intentions of this order are transmitted into practical advantages for every Welsh child with special educational needs. The Explanatory Memorandum, which is helpful, certainly gives that impression.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08031248000380"></a>Finally, as the years pass, I expect the Welsh Assembly to accrue stronger powers. I do think it is fanciful to envisage genuine law-making powers in Cardiff within a decade. I am far from being sure whether the Mother of Parliaments foresaw that prospect, but here we are. The daily lives of the Welsh people are increasingly decided by the Welsh Assembly; I refer, for example, to the fields of housing, education and training, health and transportation. I cannot be sure what that means for Members of another place. I dare say that they have considered carefully the legislation. One thing is certain: the order certainly aims to do good.</p>

<a name="08031248000381"></a><b><a name="80312-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08031248000789"></a>Lord Roberts of Conwy:</b> My Lords, I, too, have been mainly interested in the process and passage of this first order under Part 3 of the Government of Wales Act 2006, which will enable the National Assembly to legislate and pass Assembly Measures relating to specific aspects of education and training. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, I think we have reason to be pleased with the pioneering procedure that has been followed, and I trust that equal care and diligence will be taken with similar orders that come before us in future.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1564"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1564</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80312-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08031248000382"></a>This historic first order, although the substance is important in its educational and disability context, arose from legislative shortcomings found by the Assembly in the course of an in-depth examination of special educational needs. The subject matter was selected not, I am glad to say, for political or media impact but by policy considerations, and I commend the promoters for their integrity and restraint. Neither does the choice of subject suggest that there is an overwhelming demand in the Assembly and in Wales for a major programme&#151;a veritable flood of legislation that can be met only by a referendum bringing Part 4 of the Act into operation and by full legislative powers for the Assembly. However, that may be a mistaken impression. I am told that there are more orders like this one on the way.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08031248000383"></a>The order was subject to rigorous and effective scrutiny not only by the Assembly committee that dealt with it but by the Welsh Affairs Committee in the other place and by our own Constitution Committee. All this is admirably summarised in the very adequate documentation accompanying the presentation of the order. Of course, it all took time. The first draft was laid before the Assembly committee on 12 June last year, and I am sure that it will be June this year, at the earliest, before we have an Assembly measure to achieve the order&#146;s objectives. Perhaps the Minister will assist us on the timing.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08031248000384"></a>The question of the precise nature of the Assembly measure to be presented haunted the minds of some of the participants, notably Alun Cairns of the Conservatives and Janet Ryder of Plaid Cymru, in the Assembly&#146;s hour-long debate on the order on  5 February. We too have asked similar questions about the propriety of giving legislative competence without knowing precisely what it will be used for. It is clear that the more detailed knowledge we have of proposed measures, the easier the passage of orders allowing them will be. However, what impressed me about the Assembly debate was the appreciation of the Minister, Jane Hutt, of the value of the process of examining the order as, &#147;our opportunity&#148;&#151;that is, the Assembly&#146;s opportunity&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08031248000612"></a>&#147;to demonstrate our maturity and confidence to handle these new powers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031248000415"></a>Jane Hutt paid tribute to Eleanor Burnham, who chaired the first scrutiny committee, and described it and her collaboration with the Welsh Affairs Committee in further scrutiny as &#147;a steep learning curve&#148;.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08031248000385"></a>The good quality of the Assembly debate on the order was very reassuring. I do not propose to deal with the points of difference that arose in the course of scrutiny, except to say that they were sensibly and fairly dealt with. I happen to agree with the conclusions, and I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, agrees with me. Others who participated in the ensuing arguments may take a more controversial view when the order is considered in the other place.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08031248000386"></a>I conclude with the request to Ministers at all levels to consider carefully the experience gained in the passage of this first order, to learn whatever lessons

<a name="08031248000387"></a><b><a name="80312-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08031248000790"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> My Lords, like the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, I come to praise this order. I do so because it meets the criteria that emerged from the exhaustive discussions we had on the Government of Wales Bill about how to assess or judge an order. Three elements emerged from those discussions&#151;three criteria to test whether we should&#151;or should not&#151;approve an order. The first is whether there is proper justification for seeking such competence. It has been shown that there is overwhelming justification in this case; it derives from an excellent, painstaking and very sensitive review by the Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills Committee into this difficult, and in many cases distressing, area of special needs. Anyone who has had constituency cases&#151;and many here like myself have had such experiences over 30 years or more&#151;will know what angst and anguish is caused in the desperate search to find what is best for a child, for parents and for the local authority. There is the question of state-maintained schools and mainstream schools versus special schools and the issue of rights and tribunals. The painstaking and excellent work of that Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills Committee review, as summarised in paragraph 7.10 of the Explanatory Memorandum, perfectly justifies the extension of legislative competence into this field. So the first criterion has been qualified and very clearly justified in the best possible way.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08031248000388"></a>The second criterion we agreed during the course of the Government of Wales Bill was that we should not be presented with wide, sweeping orders seeking competence in education&#151;for example, the whole of secondary education or further education. The type of competence sought should be specific and clearly defined so as not to be a back-door method of acquiring legislative competence in the broad sense. This order meets that criterion. Besides the issue of disability, it is very specific and well defined in as much as it is confined to the issue of competence in relation to special needs. Therefore, it passes the second test. The accumulative capacity of the Assembly to legislate in education is pretty formidable. Given the statutory instruments, statutory legislation and framework powers from various Bills, plus this new legislative competence&#151;and that which is in the pipeline on learning and skills&#151;I would be interested to know from my noble friend what in legislative terms does not come under the competence of the Assembly in the field of education and learning.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08031248000389"></a>The third criterion&#151;I remember it being a fundamental issue for many of us&#151;is that we do not want to be presented with these orders without proper prior legislative scrutiny. That scrutiny should be carried out primarily by the Assembly and the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, although this House would have a role of one kind or another. The process by which this order has arrived here is proof that that criterion has been well and truly met. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, was rightly impressed by the work of both the Assembly committee  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1566"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1566</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the Welsh Affairs Select Committee and the response by the Welsh Assembly Government, who made amendments in the light of that process. The Government in Westminster should perhaps take a leaf out of their book. We sometimes unnecessarily dig in heels here. So the criterion of legislative scrutiny before an order reaches us has been adequately and well fulfilled.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08031248000390"></a>Finally, I am a member of the Constitution Committee of this House. It decided that it would accept responsibility for a 12-month experimental period to look at these orders. We intend to use this period purely to decide whether an order is constitutional rather than to look at the content.</p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08031248000391"></a>Defining the term &#147;disability&#148; seems to be the only issue to cause a measure of dissent. I find the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s case, in paragraph 9.6 of the Explanatory Memorandum, for not accepting a WHO definition quite convincing. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_186"></a><a name="08031248000603"></a>&#147;It has concluded that it would not be appropriate for the Assembly&#146;s legislative competence to be determined by reference to a definition that neither Parliament nor the Assembly has any control over&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031248000416"></a>As a passionate supporter of parliamentary sovereignty, I support that sentiment.</p>

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="08031248000392"></a><b><a name="80312-0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08031248000791"></a>Lord Anderson of Swansea:</b> My Lords, I can be brief, as the points that I proposed to make have been made already, particularly in relation to the way in which this order meets the three criteria set out by my noble friend Lord Rowlands. I am happy to join other noble Lords in the celebration. I think that I shall join the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, at the party she talked about. It was good to have her considerable medical experience applied to this order. </p>

<a name="80312-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08031248000393"></a>I welcome the order, but I particularly welcome the process. It is clear that the process in respect of this order has been enormously painstaking and lengthy, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said. Perhaps one should not expect quite such a painstaking series of hurdles in future. In Wales, I suspect that there was always a temptation to be different for its own sake. Clearly, many special educational needs will be the same on both sides of the border. But the joy of the Assembly is that it has been able to experiment and, in a pioneering way, has lighted the path for others, such as with the Children&#146;s Commissioner; it is good that he supports this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08031248000394"></a>Yes, I very much approve of the process. This is a first. This is not big-bang devolution, which many of us would have been concerned about. This is the British way of doing it: step by step and following the process. I believe that the Assembly and others involved have done us a great service. Clearly, we can now look forward to this same process being used in other ways. So, yes, I am happy to join the party.</p>

<a name="80312-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08031248000396"></a>The first question, on the definition of &#147;disability&#148;, was well addressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and my noble friend Lord Rowlands, but perhaps I  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1567"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1567</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may say for the record that the Welsh Affairs Committee recommended that the order should contain a definition of the term &#147;disability&#148; and refer to the WHO definition and that the Welsh Assembly Government should have the power to change the definition should that become necessary. As noble Lords will be aware, however, the term &#147;disability&#148; is omitted from the draft order following careful consideration. The Welsh Assembly Government decided against taking forward this recommendation, as my noble friend Lord Rowlands said. They concluded that it would be inappropriate for the National Assembly&#146;s legislative competence to be determined by reference to a definition that was not within its control.</p>

<a name="80312-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08031248000397"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, asked about the inclusion of travel for higher education learners. As explained in the Explanatory Memorandum, policy in respect of travel to higher education institutions in Wales has traditionally been dealt with by way of grant-making powers, which are provided for in the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. It is not envisaged that that position will change. However, the Welsh Assembly Government have accepted the committee&#146;s recommendation to the extent that a measure could make provision about the travel to and from higher education institutions. I believe that noble Lords have picked up on that example of how valuable the scrutiny process has been.</p>

<a name="80312-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08031248000398"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, also asked about communication. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, eloquently explained why the use of a broad definition could be so much in learners&#146; interests. For the record, again, the Welsh Assembly Government gave that recommendation careful consideration and are confident that the words &#147;physical or mental impairment&#148; would include communication impairment. Indeed, it would appear that to accede to the committee&#146;s recommendation would have had the perverse effect of potentially casting doubt on the generality of the current formulation, which is specifically designed to be all-embracing. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, carefully explained that for us. It would be possible for the Welsh Assembly to pass a specific measure about communication difficulties, if it so wished, with the powers contained within the legislative competency order&#151;or the LCO, as I was going to call it.</p>

<a name="80312-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08031248000399"></a>Cross-border implications, which the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, raised, are also important. Assembly measures, as the noble Lord rightly pointed out, can apply only in Wales and any measure that the National Assembly may make will apply to those in education and training who live in Wales, regardless of where that education and training takes place. If they are placed with an institution in England, it will have been assessed as appropriate for their needs in accordance with Welsh criteria. I hope that it is helpful to put that on the record.</p>

<a name="80312-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08031248000400"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, was indeed celebratory, and I found her illustration of the need  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1568"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 1568</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for a wide, all-encompassing term to be very helpful. I also felt reassured that she was celebrating the process and that she felt the process had worked well. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said that it is important that we should learn the lessons. This is the first order to come through in this way and I feel reassured that your Lordships have welcomed the process and been pleased with how it has worked. During the passage of the Government of Wales Act, there was much concern about how the scrutiny would work. With the help of noble Lords on the Constitution Committee, committees in the other place and the Welsh Assembly, we have been able to put the concept of rigorous scrutiny into practice.</p>

<a name="80312-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08031248000401"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, also asked when we might see the Assembly considering measures following this legislative competency order. It is fair to say that proposals for a measure will have to be considered in the context of all the requests for measures in the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s next legislative programme. However, as I know that the noble Lord was concerned about the time that all of that takes, the First Minister will make a statement on the legislative programme in June&#151;so we will have news on the timing then.</p>

<a name="80312-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08031248000402"></a>My noble friend Lord Rowlands offered us reassurance from the perspective of the Constitution Committee, which I know has worked hard on the criteria by which it will consider these Orders in Council. I am delighted that it is prepared to put the work in on behalf of the National Assembly for Wales and for the successful implementation of the 2006 Act. I am interested that we are already, perhaps, hearing that the National Assembly might be giving lessons to the Westminster Government, and I imagine that that might continue.</p>

<a name="80312-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08031248000403"></a>My noble friend Lord Anderson joined in the celebration, but highlighted what was, for me, an important point; that this legislative competency is being devolved to Wales very much in a step-by-step process. It is about building confidence between all the parties involved&#151;your Lordships&#146; House, the other place, the Welsh Assembly and the Welsh people&#151;through a successful process in which there is rigorous scrutiny, transparency and an opportunity for all those concerned with the question of devolution in Wales to have a chance to have a say and make an input.</p>

<a name="80312-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08031248000404"></a>I will close by saying that the granting of legislative competence on additional learning needs will enable the National Assembly to carry forward its policies and make a real difference to the lives of those Welsh learners, enabling them to fully participate in the many learning opportunities available in Wales. As I said earlier, it will enable the Assembly to consider and scrutinise future legislation in this area and to tailor provision in line with Welsh needs.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000007"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08031254000257"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Brougham and Vaux):</b> If there is a Division in the Chamber, whoever is speaking at the time will be asked to stop and we will adjourn for 10 minutes. Welcome to the Grand Committee on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (Supplementary Provisions) Bill.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000008"></a>Clause 1 [<I>Powers of Secretary of State</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="08031254000009"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08031254000258"></a>Lord Berkeley</b> moved Amendment No. 1:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031254000209"></a> Clause 1, page 1, line 4, leave out &#147;or railway services on it&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000010"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is also in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. Like many of the amendments, it is a probing amendment. It is about the role of the development agreement and seeks advice from the Minister on its point, operation and structure. Getting the development agreement was necessary for the construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, which has been a great success, but I question whether it is appropriate to widen it to cover the operations of either the infrastructure or the operator, Eurostar. An argument could be made about whether the department&#146;s taking some of the functions of the Office of Rail Regulation as they are applied to the rest of the railway&#151;this will come up on other amendments&#151;complies with Article 4 of directive 1991/14 and the Railway Infrastructure (Access and Management) Regulations 2005, SI 2005/3049; I will give its full title only once. The infrastructure manager and the train operator both have financial links to the department. That is because it would be the department, rather than the rail regulator as on the rest of the railway, which would approve the charges for using the infrastructure and the arrangements for access to it.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000011"></a>My understanding is&#151;perhaps the Minister could confirm it&#151;that the Government are selling the UK share of Eurostar and the infrastructure of the high-speed line, which is called High Speed 1 now. They will also sell off some of the land&#151;I do not think that we are really concerned about that. It is clear that the Government are seeking the highest price for these sales. It is in Department for Transport&#146;s interest to sell these companies in such a way that it can say to them, &#147;We are going to be the regulator of access to and ability to charge for use of the rail link, so that will reduce any regulatory risk that you will take when you become infrastructure manager&#148;. It believes, therefore, that it will get a higher price. In other words, the Government will say to them, &#147;You can fix the charges; you&#146;ve got to fix them in accordance with the regulations&#148;. The  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulations allow higher charges for links such as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link under Article 8.2 of directive 2001/14. However, there are certain conditions attached to that. It is probably contrary to the intentions of the EU legislation, if not the actual text, that the regulatory body&#151;in this context, the department&#151;has had a financial interest in the sale of the two companies.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000012"></a>Before on subsequent amendments we go into more detail about the whys and wherefores of where this might end up, I ask my noble friend whether the Government have checked with the European Commission that there is no conflict with EU legislation in this proposed sale of the UK part of Eurostar and/or the infrastructure manager, coupled with the continuing regulatory oversight of the companies sold by the department and the possible financial links between the sale price and the future regulation by the department rather than by an independent regulator. I think that there probably is a conflict. It looks slightly dodgy.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000013"></a>As I shall say in moving many other amendments, the answer is for the complete infrastructure to be regulated, like the rest of the railway, by the Office of Rail Regulation under various sections of the Railways Act&#151;it started off as Section 4 of the 1993 Act, as amended. From my wide inquiries and discussions around the industry, including with people who work for High Speed 1, people would much prefer that proposal. It would be interesting to hear what my noble friend had to say about the role of the development agreement, the sale and whether the Government&#146;s view is that it complies with European legislation&#151;whether they have actually checked with the European Commission. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000014"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08031254000259"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> Amendment No. 2 is coupled with Amendment No. 1. It is on a slightly different issue on which I have quite some comments to make, because it relates to our discussion at Second Reading. The first clause reiterates:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031254000210"></a>&#147;For the avoidance of doubt&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031254000199"></a>the ability of the Secretary of State,</p>
<ul><a name="08031254000245"></a>&#147;to fund the rail link or railway services on it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031254000200"></a>To a certain extent, that is what the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, was talking about. My point, on which I would like to go into a little detail, is that there was substantial concern in another place about the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to subsidise international operators running on High Speed 1. From the clause, that would seem to allow funding of international services through the Channel Tunnel, and potentially therefore services on the Continent. That would clearly be neither acceptable nor desirable.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000015"></a>The Government have sought to reassure those concerned by insisting that the intention is that the power will be exercised only in relation to domestic services in the longer term. In the other place, the Government were insistent that, in any case, the power of the 2005 Act to support services extends only to Great Britain. That apparently means that the Government could not subsidise international operators, even if they were to try. However, the  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister made a noteworthy departure from the usual government stance during the closing remarks at Second Reading, saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031254000211"></a>&#147;Clause 1 gives the Secretary of State the same commercial flexibility to support HS1 as she has for the national rail network, including flexibility to subsidise international operators in the same way as we currently support domestic franchise operators&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031254000201"></a>The Minister went on to mention that it was not the intention of the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="08031254000246"></a>&#147;to subsidise international services through a franchise or any similar arrangement&#148;,&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/2/08; col. 146.]</ul>
<p><a name="08031254000202"></a>but he said that it was possible, which is contrary to other comments made.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000016"></a>What exactly is the intention of the Government? It now seems that direct subsidy would be a possibility, as no mention was made by the Minister of the precluding 2005 Act, which was mentioned so frequently in another place. Therefore, we seem to have moved to a position of intention rather than legislation ruling out direct subsidy of international operators on High Speed 1. It is for this reason&#151;now more than ever, given the apparent confusion&#151;that provisions should appear in the Bill to prevent direct subsidies to such operators. If, as the Government suggest, long-term funding of international operators is not the intention, will they not accept that my amendment would be a relatively minor concession? Until now, we have been told that it will not be possible due to the continuing need to provide historic support in the short term, which we do not disagree with. In the past, of course, Eurostar UK Ltd was provided with rolling stock, lease guarantees and access charge loans. The Government have argued that any amendment would preclude the provision of such historical support.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000017"></a>I have attempted to devise an amendment that would cover this issue. I appreciate that it may not be the most refined amendment in terms of wording, but the inclusion of a caveat excepting any historic support will, I hope, alleviate the Government&#146;s concern. I can certainly see that removing the support in full would be too stark a change, as I said just now. However, given the level of the Minister&#146;s remarks at Second Reading, what is there to prevent the Government having a change of mind and offering a direct subsidy to international operators? If the intention is for Eurostar UK to be fully self-standing over time, Amendment No. 2 will presumably allow for a sufficient and necessary bridge of historical funding.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000018"></a>Although the Government have repeatedly claimed that accepting such an amendment is not necessary, what is to prevent the Secretary of State offering non-direct support in the longer term? Could not access charge lines, rolling stock leases and other such things be offered in the future? I understand that international services are operated on an open-access basis but, as has been demonstrated, support does not solely take the form of a direct financial subsidy. I therefore suggest that my amendment is necessary and would serve to alleviate both the Government&#146;s and our concerns.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08031254000019"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08031254000260"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> I return to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley. It appears that the Bill, which I have heard described as a nasty little Bill in places, simply prepares the ground for the Government to sell assets which have been acquired at public expense. The Government will say that that will be at the best price, but it is in fact a Bill preparing for sale. The Government believe that that sale is on the best terms.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000020"></a>In order for this situation to come into being, the Government have decided that the line will be subject not to the powers of the independent regulator but to those of the Secretary of State. I find it quite objectionable that a railway in this country should not be subject to the powers of the independent regulator. However, it may interest the Minister to know that, in the past 24 hours, I have had lunch with serious bidders for this piece of infrastructure. They are long-term bidders, unlikely to disappear into the dust as fast as they emerge, and interested in buying it to retain it as a railway and fully exploit its potential. They were quite adamant that they would be much happier if it were subject to independent regulation rather than the whim of the Secretary of State, whoever he may be in the future. So if the Government are trying to secure the best price, it can be secured by making the line subject to independent regulation.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000021"></a>Secondly, I draw the report of the European Union Committee on the single market to the Minister&#146;s attention. Although I was not party to that report, I am now a member of that committee and have had a copy of the response from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. In it, the Government say that they believe,</p>
<ul><a name="08031254000247"></a>&#147;that Member States should commit themselves to greater independence for national competition and regulatory authorities, and agree to regular independent evaluation, which could be undertaken by the Commission, to benchmark national competition regimes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031254000203"></a>Furthermore, the document says that the Government would like to see greater regulatory co-operation across the EU:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031254000212"></a>&#147;A flexible regulatory framework will require greater regulatory coordination and consistency coupled with a robust process for reaching agreement on cross-border issues&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031254000204"></a>I submit to the Committee that in fact there is much more likelihood of the Office of Rail Regulation reaching agreement with comparable operators on the Continent than there is of the Government reaching agreements with other Governments, which of course is subject to a good deal of political vicissitude.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000022"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08031254000261"></a>Lord Berkeley:</b> Surely the noble Lord is saying that the Government as regulator of the CTRL would have to reach agreement with the French regulatory authority rather than the French Government. It is Government to regulator rather than Government to Government.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000024"></a>I finish the words of the Minister. He says that, overall, the Government</p>
<ul><a name="08031254000248"></a>&#147;will depend crucially on stronger and more independent national regulatory authorities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08031254000205"></a>We have two Ministers saying entirely different things. They sit alongside each other on the same Bench and we get different solutions from both of them.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000025"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08031254000263"></a>The Earl of Mar and Kellie:</b> I am not sure whether Amendment No. 2, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is a probing amendment. Based on what we were saying in this Room only six days ago when we were considering the benefit of substituting rail service for air, we do not want the Bill to do anything that will prevent the commencement of services, say, from Birmingham to Brussels and Paris. Such services would be a very good thing. I hope the Bill will do nothing to prevent that type of alteration to railway services.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000026"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08031254000264"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> I rise briefly in support of the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and endorsed by my noble friend Lord Bradshaw. I have less expertise than they have, but as I raised the issue of the Channel Tunnel rescue scheme for the new mark 2 company last year, I would appreciate the opportunity to register my anxieties, and I think those of a number of Peers, about the confusion that is arising&#151;a matter that has been expressed already by the mover and the seconder of the amendment.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000027"></a>It was very important for the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, to refer with some emphasis to the idea of a possible conflict with the policy formation of the European Commission on these matters on transport links and railways&#151;it is developing apace in Brussels, as we know&#151;and with the national regulatory authority matrix, which is currently governed by both the Government and the Rail Regulator.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000028"></a>The Government appear to be keen, as far as we can tell, to effect the sale of the infrastructure for High Speed 1 from St Pancras to Folkestone and the tunnel, and the Eurostar service itself. As my noble friend Lord Bradshaw has indicated correctly&#151;and I support this entirely&#151;if the Rail Regulator&#146;s role is removed by this legislation and the Government remain the bureaucratic regulator through the powers of the Secretary of State, that certainly restricts the open market nexus of this matter in respect of any change of ownership. It also therefore makes it more difficult for the Channel Tunnel company mark 2 under Jacques Gounon&#151;mostly with French shareholders now, and in a very successful operation last year in the spring, as we know&#151;to get the best conditions for his company, which is an important matter. There are a number of linking elements and interlocking considerations.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000029"></a>In conclusion, if potential market practitioners and new owners are coming in and saying&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, indicated&#151;that it is much less attractive to have the Government as regulator, there is a taxpayers&#146; interest in the  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government rescinding that possibility in this legislation because they would by definition get a higher price for the sale if it remained in the hands of the UK Rail Regulator, the Office of Rail Regulation. That is an important consideration. There are a number of confusing and conflicting elements here that also link up with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, on a slightly different consideration, and I have some sympathy for his points as well. It is incumbent on the Minister, if he can, to clarify those points before this legislation proceeds further.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000030"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08031254000265"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I was going to offer the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, the opportunity to speak because everybody else has, and I thought he was missing out. This is an interesting group of amendments, and I listened very carefully to the debate. It is not often that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, gets me so interested and excited about his lunching arrangements, but he managed to do that this afternoon. I shall follow his diary with greater interest in future.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000031"></a>Clause 1 makes clear that the Secretary of State's powers to support the national rail network also apply to High Speed 1. It does not create any particular funding obligations, but is a necessary power for any future Secretary of State who might choose to support services on High Speed 1 in a range of different ways. Amendment No. 1 makes it less certain that the Secretary of State is able to provide any support to train operators on High Speed 1. That could, for example, rule out the provision of any subsidies to the domestic franchisee, even if agreed through a competitive process. As a result, the Government cannot support this amendment, and I hope the noble Lord will withdraw it.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000032"></a>Amendment No. 2 seeks to accomplish a similar goal, perhaps by a different route, which is to prevent the Secretary of State providing financial support to train operators, although it is slightly more complicated. This amendment allows the provision of assistance to domestic services with provision for international services excluded, as we understand it. The amendment is aimed at preventing the Government providing any support to Eurostar when LCR is restructured.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000033"></a>I should start by saying that the power the amendment seeks to clarify&#151;the power to support services in the 2005 Act&#151;extends to Great Britain only. The Secretary of State does not have the ability to fund continental train services under existing legislation, making this amendment otiose. In the other place, the Minister made clear that the Government's intentions are to reduce long-term public support for international services and to ensure that they can be run sustainably on a commercial basis. The Government have supported international operations through Eurostar UK's access charge loan and guarantees of the company's rolling stock lease payments, hedging obligations and ability to pay High Speed 1 access charges. For the purposes of this discussion, I am assuming that that is the &#147;historical support&#148; referred to in the amendment, although the drafting is not, perhaps, as precise as it might be.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000034"></a>The Government&#146;s long-term objectives are to reduce or remove those types of long-term support when LCR is restructured and to ensure that the business is able to compete as a sustainable stand-alone entity. However, to pull away any possibility of support is probably unrealistic now and undesirable in the longer term.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000035"></a>Amendment No. 2 would constrain the Government's ability to alter the historical funding structures already in place for Eurostar during the restructuring period. If it became possible to deliver better value for taxpayers or to achieve a higher sale price by reorganising the current support arrangements&#151;for example, by rationalising the rolling stock leases&#151;this amendment would prevent us doing so.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000036"></a>Any changes would presumably fall outside the definition of &#147;historical support&#148;, leaving the Secretary of State unable to continue to provide financial support and stripping value from Eurostar. I do not think noble Lords want to do that. No decisions have been taken on when or how Eurostar will be restructured, and this amendment constrains the Government's ability to take commercial decisions in the best interests of taxpayers.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000037"></a>Understandably, noble Lords used the amendment to raise some questions, particularly about the role of the regulator. I shall try to deal with some of those issues now. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, asked about the definition relating to development agreement. Clause 5 amends the definition of &#147;development agreement&#148; in Section 56 of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996. In addition, the term &#147;development agreement&#148; occurs in four provisions in the 1996 Act, three of which are of a legal and technical nature: Section 21, the duty of the ORR not to impede the performance of the development agreement in carrying out its regulatory duties under the Railways Act 1993; Section 33, the effectiveness of undertakings given by the Secretary of State in the development agreement; Section 40, application of landlord and tenant law to obligations and rights of parties to a development agreement lease; and Section 41, the disapplication of Section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 to a variation of the development agreement. The amendment of the definition of &#147;development agreement&#148; in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 has no effect on Section 6 of the Railways Act 2005.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, asked what the point is of the development agreement. Post-construction, we expect this agreement to include the contractual obligations that the Secretary of State will want to put in place to assist the owner of High Speed 1. Those obligations might include capping access charges at an appropriate level; and ensuring that future access and charging arrangements are consistent with competition and other legislation.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000039"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, also looked at the interaction with the Commission. We shall be seeking state-aid clearance from the Commission in relation to restructuring. It is worth pointing out the role of the regulatory bodies&#151;there has been some  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confusion in the debate on that. The Secretary of State is not the only regulatory body for High Speed 1. The Office of Rail Regulation also has a very important appellate function, which is how it currently operates. One can fairly argue that it is operated to good and reasonable advantage.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000040"></a>I have answered the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, about subsidising international services. It is not the intention of the Bill to do that&#151;only in respect of those international services that occur in the UK. Generally, on the point of the Office of Rail Regulation and the Secretary of State&#146;s role, it is important that there is clarity on key commercial points before any sale process starts. Issues such as the level of access charges will remain with the Government as they will affect the value and the Government will recoup on their investment in High Speed 1. That is a benefit because it enables us to ensure continued investment into the rail network as a whole.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000041"></a>Under the development agreement the Secretary of State oversees access contracts between the High Speed 1 infrastructure operator and train operating companies for High Speed 1 track and stations. Under the Railways Infrastructure (Access and Management) Regulations 2005, the Secretary of State is also responsible for setting a framework for High Speed 1 access charges and ensuring that the charges comply, quite properly, with the requirements of those regulations. The ORR is the appeal body.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000042"></a>It might be worth responding to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, about regulation by the Secretary of State being somewhat whimsical. I do not think it is; we do not see it that way and the Secretary of State certainly does not see it that way. We are trying to ensure that we have a framework for access charges through a contract. It goes without saying that such a contract would not seek to give the Secretary of State open-ended rights to change the access-charging regime. We have to have a disciplined approach.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000043"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, referred to EC advocacy of independent regulation. The EC directive which underpins the 2005 regulation permits the regulatory body of railway infrastructure to be the member state&#151;that is, the Government. It is not uncommon for that to be the case across Europe.</p>

I take the point that the Secretary of State cannot support or subsidise any international services, but would that in any way preclude starting an international train in Birmingham?</p>

The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has identified some clear problems. Article 8 of directive 2001/14 makes it quite clear that there must be no discrimination in access charges between operators. A French operator&#151;by French I mean, say, SNCF&#151;a German operator and a British operator all have to be charged the same amount under these regulations for the same type of train. Whether they are subsidised or not does not really matter. I suspect that they have to be charged the same as for a domestic train of the same capability.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000050"></a>The noble Lord has raised an interesting issue which I shall come on to from the other side of the coin in responding to my noble friend. The Minister said that the Secretary of State needs the ability to give financial assistance to this link and to the train operators through Section 6 of the Railways Act 2005. Of course he could do it that way, but the Secretary of State gives a lot of money to the existing railways, to Network Rail and in subsidising some of the TOCs in a way that does not need special legislation.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000051"></a>I am confused about what my noble friend said about the financial situation of Eurostar. I thought the requirement was to have open access on this network. Leaving freight aside&#151;I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group and I will talk about freight later&#151;Eurostar surely cannot have any more priority for access onto this line than any new operator that may come in. In other words, Eurostar cannot reserve capacity to the detriment of other operators and should be charged the same amount. If there is a financial problem with Eurostar that has not yet been sorted out, it could perfectly well be done by lowering the track access charges and reducing the subsidy to Eurotunnel. There are many ways of doing it. Can my noble friend say whether or not there is going to be open access on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link? If there is not, that would be illegal on my understanding.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000052"></a>Of course, the rail regulator has a role in regulating some parts of the CTRL, and no doubt we will talk about that later. My point&#151;I think that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and some of his colleagues share this view&#151;is that there is no reason why the regulator should not have the same responsibilities as apply to the rest of the network. I am afraid that my noble friend has not persuaded me that the differences between the 1996 Act and this latest Bill cannot be resolved by turning this line into a small part of the rest of the UK network.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000053"></a>Finally, my noble friend says that many regulators in Europe are not independent of government. That is something that the Commission is working very hard to avoid and I think he will find that some regulations come forward from Brussels this year that make it a legal requirement for all regulators to be not only independent of government but independent of train operators and infrastructure managers. Therefore, we may as well draft our legislation in a way that complies with that. I shall be glad to hear his comments.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000054"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08031254000271"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> I am anything but satisfied with what the Minister has said because he has not demonstrated to me what the advantage would be of regulating this rail link differently from any other railway. The Office of Rail Regulation is sufficient in all other cases, so why is it deficient in this one? Is it because the Government hope to get more money?</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000055"></a>I think that the Minister used the word &#147;whimsical&#148; to describe something that I had said, but in fact the word could almost be turned back on his department. Since the department has taken over responsibility for ordering rolling stock, for example, despite being told every couple of weeks that 1,300 new carriages are on the way, there are no new carriages. That has seized up the system when under privatisation it was supposed to be fluid. I am afraid I am anything but convinced by what he has said about there being good reasons, other than perhaps those dreamed up by someone in the Treasury, for including this clause and excepting this link from the generality of rail regulation.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000056"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08031254000272"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I am sure that the Minister did not intend it but I think he has added to the slight confusion among us. It may be wise if he reflects on our discussion today and writes to us. For example, at Second Reading he said that the Secretary of State wanted the flexibility to subsidise international operators but today he has said that that is not true, so he has contradicted what he said at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000057"></a>I believe there is also confusion about what the Bill does to the 1996 and 2005 Acts and how they fit in with this Bill. Perhaps the noble Lord could reflect on all the questions that have been asked today and write to us, setting out with more clarity answers to the arguments that we have put forward. I think that most of us are a little unhappy and uncertain because we have not had the answers that we would like to have had from the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000058"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08031254000273"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> I join the litany of speakers who say that perhaps the Minister has not answered some of the points raised in the debate with the fullness that we have come to expect from him, but there may be various reasons for that. Not least, the position of the European Commission is still unanswered and remains rather open and vague. I agree that at first sight, prime facie, the Bill, be it nasty or neutral&#151;whichever adjective my noble friend Lord Bradshaw may prefer to use&#151;looks eminently like a technical adjustment Bill. However, one has to be careful about  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these things, and it is the Government&#146;s job to be cautious in handling matters because the Bill&#146;s implications go wider than its text. That can be the case with a number of what are seemingly adjustment Bills; they can appear to be technical and reasonable, simply providing for contingent possibilities, and yet they can get the Government and indeed the policymakers on UK railways into difficulties.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000059"></a>There is a wider European scene. The background is the gradual coming together of the high-speed networks of European countries. Britain has lagged behind, but now has at least 110 kilometres of high-speed track, whereas France has 7,400 kilometres. Spain is getting together with Germany; Belgium is getting together with Germany and Holland; and France, Italy and Spain are getting together to create high speed networks. While the Minister is conferring with his officials, he is not necessarily listening to the points made in the debate. From the point of view of the UK taxpayer and the UK national interest&#151;being a laggard country in high-speed railways and thinking about the project for the high-speed line to the north and so on&#151;the best bidder for this sale, if it goes through, of the infrastructure plus London and Continental Railways, perhaps as two transactions, may well be the German railway or other private railway bidders from other countries involved in creating the collective network of high-speed trains. I know the Government have been following that discussion quite thoroughly, and it could be very important to getting the right entity bidding. It is important that we get this right and get the best price for the British taxpayers if these transactions take place. Can the Minister be a little fuller in his answers in the second round of this debate?</p>

<p><a name="08031254000060"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08031254000274"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I think noble Lords are making too much of this. I have checked the record of what I said at Second Reading and I cannot see that there is a contradiction between what I said and what was said in another place, or with what I have said today. Perhaps noble Lords are reading more into my comments and observations than is there. I try to be as clear as I can at all times and do not like to leave confusion.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000061"></a>Let me make a few more observations about open access because I think the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, was trying to suggest that we might be closing that down. Eurostar will be charged the same as any other operator with the same agreement. Eurostar is an open-access operator and would have to release any reserved capacity that it is not using. It is clear that that is the way we expect it to operate.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000062"></a>The noble Lord asked whether Eurostar would have priority on the line. The answer is no. There is nothing in the Bill that changes the nature of the relationship. New entrants are entitled to access the railway in accordance, as I think I said earlier, with the 2005 regulations. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, made a point about regulation by agreement. Other railways are regulated in the same way as High Speed 1. What is proposed is similar to how the Chanel Tunnel and the French railway system are regulated. On the suggestion made earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, that independent regulation would  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>secure more value, that is speculation, but whether or not a contract with the Secretary of State would be less attractive than independent regulation will depend on what the contract states. It is a key document in defining relationships and comes at a cost. There are relativities here. The details of that contract are not yet developed, although some of the key principles, particularly on access charges, are already understood.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000063"></a>We all need to reflect on this discussion. It has been useful. I can see that some noble Lords need more convincing, but there is nothing in what we are doing here that falls outside the scope of what is currently operational and understood. As the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, made clear, it is important that we achieve best possible value because, as I said earlier, that will enable us to continue the high level of investment that we have more generally made in the rail network.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000064"></a>I am not sure whether I can add anything else today. However, between now and Report stage, if noble Lords want further clarification and better understanding of how we intend to secure best value, fulfil our commitments to open access and so on, I am more than happy to facilitate further discussions.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000068"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 1 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="08031254000069"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08031254000276"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I have chosen to oppose this clause standing part of the Bill in order to continue the discussion that we had at Second Reading regarding the development of Waterloo International station. We are of the opinion that the clause should make it explicit for the avoidance of doubt that the Secretary of State is able to fund and develop this vital part of the rail link legacy under the 1996 and 2005 Acts. This is, of course, especially pertinent given that funds are likely to be received following the restructuring and sale.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000070"></a>The decisions about Waterloo International seem to have the air of afterthoughts rather than being timely and properly thought out. In 2004, the decision was taken to move all Eurostar operations from Waterloo International to St Pancras. Part of that deal was to develop the vacant platforms left behind. At that time, Eurostar&#146;s director of communications listed a key benefit of the move as being that,</p>
<ul><a name="08031254000249"></a>&#147;domestic commuters will benefit from faster access into Waterloo and the opening of more train platforms&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08031254000206"></a>Waterloo station sees an estimated 60 million passengers a year, with trains frequently overcrowded and passenger growth set to increase.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000071"></a>I understand that the Government have plans for the station but I have not had a totally satisfactory response to my question as to whether funds raised from the sale of High Speed 1 could be used to address the urgent capacity problem. The Minister explained the Government&#146;s plans as they currently stand more fully in his written response, and I can see from that the costs and timescales of the proposed work. The length of time it will take fully to utilise the asset beyond platform 20 is disappointing. It was mentioned that the timescale for implementation of the project across the south-western network is likely to be 2012 to 2014 due to the twin requirements of rolling stock procurement and platform extension to take 10 and 12-car trains. Have the Government exacting plans in place for platform extension or is the matter to be reviewed in the future? How certain is it that implementation will meet the timeframe?</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000072"></a>The Waterloo legacy has already proven somewhat disappointing and any further changes will serve only to add to this. Given the capacity there, I am looking for a firm commitment from the Government on this matter to ease the lives of commuters from Waterloo. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide this reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000073"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08031254000277"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> There is a danger of course that one will repeat observations made at Second Reading. The capacity at Waterloo has only just been released through the development of St Pancras station as the new international centre. We have been thinking for some while about this and what we would do with the capacity that is there. We have an investment programme which extends into the future, and the noble Lord is well aware of that. This is one of the largest ever investment programmes in developing capacity across the network that we have had in recent decades. I am proud that our Government are taking this forward. There has to be a list of priorities. Of course it is frustrating that we cannot immediately turn the capacity that is there into additional capacity on the network, but it is our intention that platform 20 will come on stream later this year.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000074"></a>As I explained to the noble Lord the last time we had an outing on this issue, certain changes have to be made to track and platform to make use of the other capacity that is there. We shall do that and there is a timescale for it. That is clearly understood. More than that I cannot say, other than that of course the disposal of the CTRL will bring more resources into the department and enable us to expand capacity generally. I do not think there is confusion in our minds about the need to do that; we have made that very clear over the past few months. We are now beginning to roll out the way in which that extra capacity will manifest itself.</p>

I could talk about the Thames crossing and all the revenues from that which go into other things. It would be nice if that money could be invested in our infrastructure.</p>

Increasingly in this country we say that something will happen but it does not happen until five years later. It would be nice if we could keep to a timetable and see Waterloo improved dramatically because of Eurostar moving to St Pancras. There could be a twin win because we would have St Pancras and a better Waterloo. I tabled my intention to oppose the Question that Clause 1 stand part because I wanted another go at this.

Section 16 concerns licensing&#151;it comes from the Railways Act 1993&#151;and requires all network operators to have a licence. It does not seem to apply to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.

These licences contain stewardship obligations,

<p><a name="08031254000085"></a>We have all experienced the regulation of Network Rail, and Railtrack before it, over the years. A network licence and the many sub-documents that go with it are an integral part of the whole operation. I am not sure how that will happen with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link because I do not see it in any legislation. It may be that I have got it wrong and the Minister can put me right.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000086"></a>The amendment would repeal also Section 17 of the 1996 Act. In the case of the rest of the railway, if a customer or operator, be it passenger or freight, wants access to a network, to create a connection or change a station, and the infrastructure manager refuses to reach agreement, the applicant can ask the independent regulator to direct the infrastructure manager to reach agreement, and he can more or less set out the terms. One may say that this does not matter very much for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, but we may want changes and extra connections in the future. If somebody had bought the infrastructure&#151;perhaps the friend of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, or somebody else&#151;and they turned out to be not so friendly, one might need something like Section 17 to make them reach an agreement, forced on by an independent regulator. I do not see that happening on the CTRL and it worries me. The amendment would repeal the two sections en bloc. This would mean that the normal railway regulatory structure applied to the CTRL, which would be beneficial. I beg to move.</p>

On the rest of the railway, the Rail Regulator would be the person who adjudicated when there was a dispute about access. We all hope that many people will want access to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link for various reasons. If the Minister can prevail on his colleagues to scrap the intergovernmental agreement on the Channel Tunnel, there may be other passenger operators&#151;and, I am assured, a number of freight operators&#151;who have plans to link up with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. If the link is extended towards Birmingham, as was suggested by my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie, whoever is in the north of England will no doubt wish to have access. Access is important, and the Rail Regulator has a mechanism

The combined effect of the amendment will be to bring High Speed 1 within the regulatory regime of the Railways Act 1993 so that the operator would require a licence, and all access contracts would be subject to regulation by the Office of Rail Regulation. It would also give rise to the possibility that access charges for High Speed 1 could be set by a periodic review by the Office of Rail Regulation, although to implement that would require amendment to secondary legislation.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80312-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000092"></a>The Government do not consider that High Speed 1 should be subject to full economic regulation by the Office of Rail Regulation under the Railways Act 1993 in the same way as Network Rail is. We have said that on many occasions. We have already had some of that debate this afternoon. We argue that that regime was designed for a different type of asset base&#151;a complex and historical network&#151;and we do not think it is appropriate for a new single line such as High Speed 1. There is clearly a disagreement about that.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000093"></a>We say that instead of that lighter touch regulation under the access and management regulations 2005 in relation to access to and charges for High Speed 1 is proposed. That would operate in conjunction with the contractual controls over the operation of the railway that the Secretary of State has under the development agreement, which are considered to be sufficient to balance the interests of passengers, train operators using High Speed 1 and High Speed 1 itself. There is a similarity, if you like, between a licence&#151;which as my noble friend Lord Berkeley quite rightly described is not there in the same way as it is for the rest of the rail network&#151;and the development agreement, which is a contract and describes those relationships in a similar way to those in the national rail licence conditions. Of course that is a public document. It is clear how it is intended to operate.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000094"></a>The amendment would also result in High Speed 1 being subject to more onerous regulation than currently applies to Network Rail. Both the Office of Rail Regulation and the Secretary of State would have regulatory oversight of the railway&#151;the former under the Railways Act 1993 and the latter through her contractual rights under the development

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000095"></a>We do not consider that this amendment is necessary or appropriate since it would impose an unnecessary burden of regulation. Clauses 2 and 3 aim to ensure that there are clear divisions between what the Office of Rail Regulation does and what the Secretary of State does. The Secretary of State has an important role in regulating High Speed 1. She will maintain oversight of access charging on High Speed 1 because the level and structure of access charges affect the value that the Government will recoup on their investment in any sale.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000096"></a>The Office of Rail Regulation will retain the role it has as the appeal body for any disputes over access to and charges for High Speed 1. That role provides a valuable check that statutory obligations to grant access to the railway on fair and non-discriminatory terms are being properly observed. That right of appeal is very important. As I have said on two or three occasions, the ORR is the appellate body. It can direct High Speed 1 to enter an access contract if at all necessary. I doubt whether that will come to pass but it has that power.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000097"></a>I hope the noble Lord now better understands how we see the relationship and the mechanisms working and why we do not think it is appropriate to use the licensing regime in the way in which he obviously understands it. It is in Section 16 of the 1993 Act.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000098"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08031254000286"></a>Lord Berkeley:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend for that full answer. He mentioned that the contents of Network Rail&#146;s licence were effectively covered by the contract between the Secretary of State and the infrastructure manager. I have two questions. First, does it cover safety and standards, stewardship within the licence holders&#146; network, environmental matters, timetabling and all the other things to do with Network Rail&#146;s licence? Secondly, and most important, is it in the public domain or will it be in the public domain? Network Rail&#146;s contract is very much in the public domain, which is appropriate.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000099"></a>My noble friend referred to Section 17 and said that the ORR can direct High Speed 1 to enter into a contract, but Section 17(1) of the 1996 Act states that it specifically cannot do that. I am not quite sure what that means. Section 17(1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031254000216"></a>&#147;No directions under section 17(1) of the Railways Act 1993 ... may be given to a rail link undertaker in relation to a rail link facility&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031254000207"></a>That is why I have suggested that the clause should be removed.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000100"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08031254000287"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> Basically the noble Lord is asking whether the obligations are the same as in the Network Rail licence. No, they are not identical but they are very similar with many overlaps. The High Speed 1 access contracts do not, as a general rule, require the prior approval of the Office of the Rail Regulation in order to be enforceable. There is one exception to that general rule in the 1996 Act, which relates to those sections of High Speed 1 which connect with the national rail network. The binding  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>access contracts for interconnecting sections of High Speed 1 infrastructure need prior approval from the ORR unless access is to be limited to that part of the infrastructure used for services on HS1. St Pancras is perhaps the most relevant example. A domestic train operator which wants access to St Pancras in order to provide services on the national rail network is likely to have an access contract which will require the approval of the ORR in order to be enforceable.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000101"></a>All HS1 access contracts should be subject to the same regulatory rules, which is what Clause 2 seeks to achieve. As all access contracts to HS1 are subject to scrutiny by the Secretary of State, this change ensures that train operating companies do not need two sets of regulatory approvals for the same access contract. This has no impact on the ORR&#146;s powers in relation to safety which already apply to the whole of High Speed 1 and will continue to do so. Importantly, it is worth noting that High Speed 1 will be subject to a performance regime which should achieve the same or similar objectives for that line in relation to health and safety, environmental performance and so on.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000102"></a>The noble Lord asked earlier about Section 17 and whether it deals with periodic reviews. I did not respond to that, but it does not. However, the Office of Rail Regulation can carry out a periodic review only if there is provision for that in an access contract. Clearly the ORR regulates access contracts which could contain such a provision.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000103"></a>I hope that helps deal with the noble Lord&#146;s confusion. If it does not, I apologise. I may have confused him further, but I hope that I have not.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031254000219"></a>Section 21 of the 1996 Act (duties of the Office of Rail Regulation as to the exercise of regulatory function) is repealed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000109"></a>The noble Lord said: This is similar to the previous amendment but it concerns Section 21 of the 1996 Act and is to do with the powers of the Rail Regulator. As my noble friend said, in the 1996 Act, the Rail Regulator still has powers in relation to the CTRL, but there is one major difference between the regulatory powers and duties in connection with the rest of the network and those in connection with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000110"></a>On the rest of the network, the regulator&#146;s duties basically come under Section 4, which is amended by the Railways Act 2005, but the principle is that he has a duty to promote the use of the network for the carriage of passengers and goods. We debated this  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>matter at length when we considered the 2005 Bill, but that principle still holds good.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000111"></a>Section 21(1) of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996, as amended by the Bill, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08031254000220"></a>&#147;The Rail Regulator shall have an overriding duty to exercise his regulatory functions in such a manner as not to impede the performance of any development agreement&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08031254000208"></a>In plain language, that means a duty to make as much money as possible for the infrastructure manager, which, frankly, is what has happened with the Channel Tunnel. Of course, it is not regulated in the same way and it is owned by a private company, but that company has sought to make the charges as high as possible. That has resulted in there being quite a few Eurostar trains&#151;there would be an awful more if the prices were lower&#151;and very few freight trains, which are more sensitive to price.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000112"></a>The Government should consider very carefully why this link should be different from the rest of the network, where the regulator has a duty, as does the Secretary of State, to promote the railway for the carriage of goods and passengers. However, here the duty is to promote the railway for the financial benefit of the person who has bought it from the Government. I do not think that that fits together very well with my noble friend&#146;s many statements, in which he has said that he wants to see lots of trains on this route and the expansion of the railway and so on, which of course I support. Here, the company buys the link&#151;whether it is with or without the regulator, I do not know&#151;with the expectation that it can make as much money as it likes, and the Government will encourage that because our regulators will be independent but not quite as independent as the independent regulator.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000113"></a>I look forward to hearing what my noble friend has to say about this. It is very serious that on this line, which, one hopes, will be the first of a number in this country, the developer comes first and passengers and freight come very much second. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000114"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08031254000290"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> When the Minister comes to respond, I hope that he will be able to tell the Committee whether he is satisfied with the amount of freight using the Channel Tunnel or whether he believes that there should be more, and, if so, what he is going to do about it.</p>

In the end, people and freight will use a system which is at market price. If it goes above market price, there will be a lot less traffic than would be the case if it were at market price.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000116"></a>I would like the Minster to be fairly explicit in his response as to whether it is the Government&#146;s intention to use this railway line and set prices which are reasonably attractive to both freight operators and passengers, or to set the prices high and squeeze whatever they can out of the people who can pay and, as it were, devil take the hindmost. It is important that this national asset is used for public benefit.</p>

That duty has been in place since 1996. It is still relevant today. If it were removed, it could have an adverse effect on the value the Government would secure for the taxpayer on the sale of High Speed 1. Potential investors might well be concerned that the ORR&#146;s regulation of the national network could have unintended consequences for HS1&#146;s revenues if this duty were removed.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000118"></a>The circumstances where the ORR would have to take this duty into account might include: if a train operator wanted to run international services on parts of the main domestic network; or if a line were blocked because of engineering works, and services on HS1 had to use the domestic network, or vice versa. Without Clause 3 it is possible that either of the two scenarios I have described could occur and, in the case of the first example, that could potentially drive Eurostar out of business. The overriding duty gives the Government and any potential investor in High Speed 1 comfort that its interests will be fully taken into account. It is designed to protect value overall, so, for those reasons, we cannot support the amendment.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000119"></a>In moving his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said that the overriding duty is about making money. We do not quite see it that way. The purpose of the duty is to provide security over stability of income, and not to tie income to any particular level. Access charges will be capped by a contract with the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000120"></a>The noble Lord was concerned about competition. High Speed 1 access charges will be set in accordance with existing and future European rail directives, which are intended to promote competition. High Speed 1 has, as we know, spare capacity which the Government are keen to see used.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000121"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked whether it was the intention to set prices high. It is not. Consultation proposals for international passenger services would substantially reduce access charges. There are currently no proposals for freight access charges, but High Speed 1 is carrying out market studies to gauge the level at which charges should be set to attract freight traffic. I have made it plain in the past that we see that as highly desirable.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000122"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked me whether I was satisfied with the level of freight going through the tunnel. No, I do not think that anybody could be satisfied with the level of freight; we obviously want to see more of it. In the end, of course, it must be a commercial matter for Eurotunnel to agree with freight operators. The Government have already agreed some limited support for freight services generally. I do not think that we are, as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, seemed to think, setting access charges too high. We are setting them at an affordable level, and that is certainly the intention. Obviously, we

First, he just said that we want to encourage international traffic. Will he explain what the Government are doing about the intergovernmental commission? It is using the Channel Tunnel as a drawbridge against this country by setting safety standards that are not set by the Swiss, who have just opened a massive tunnel through the Alps, or elsewhere in Europe. The Government shelter behind saying that it is because of a treaty with France, but treaties can be altered. Everything the Minister said about encouraging traffic comes to nothing unless he deals with that problem.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000124"></a>Secondly, I am sure that the best price will be secured by independent regulation because that is what bidders want. They do not wish to be subject to the whims and fancies of any Secretary of State. They trust the Rail Regulator, whose processes are open. People can go along to hearings, have their say and hear what other people say. It is not like that in Marsham Street, where the doors are locked and what goes on inside is a mystery to us all and sometimes bemuses us. Lastly, the Minister spoke about wanting more freight and said that Eurotunnel comes into the consideration. Eurotunnel has shown its commitment by purchasing locomotives with the object of pulling freight trains. What is needed is access at a price that freight operators can afford.</p>

This Government rescued this project. If it had not been for John Prescott, when he was Secretary of State with responsibility for this, we would not be where we are now with High Speed 1 and this important cross-channel rail link speeded up on the UK side. There has been no lack of commitment from the Government on this project. The noble Lord raised a valid question about the international government agreement. We always look to perfect these things, and discussions continue. It is important that we do as much as we can to encourage better freight use of this line. I cannot be clearer than that. That is where we are in terms of our policy objectives. I understand some of the frustrations experienced by those who quite rightly lobby on behalf of getting more freight on to our network, but we are doing our best.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000126"></a>What goes on in Marsham Street might be a mystery to the noble Lord, but I can speak with confidence when I say that we in Marsham Street are determined to make sure that we get best value from this line. It is a superb piece of rail engineering, and we want to ensure that in future it operates well commercially, in a commercial framework, and delivers what we expect in getting more passengers on to the rail network and, over time, building up and strengthening the freight sector.</p>

Before I withdraw it, which, of course, I will, I remind my noble friend that the European Commission&#146;s proposals already strongly suggest that the body that organises access to a piece of infrastructure and determines the charges should not only be separate from train operators and infrastructure managers but should be separate from the Government. My noble friend said, &#147;This is the way the French do it&#148;. I do not think France is a good example. Rail freight in France has gone down by 40 per cent in the past five years. The service quality is, in parliamentary language, not good and they are about to change it. I think we will find proposals coming from the Commission to make it a legal requirement that the regulatory body across Europe should be totally independent in the future, which I think will be beneficial. I shall be ashamed to have to come back in a couple of years&#146; time to change the regulations or the law because we have not foreseen what the Commission will do.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000130"></a>One of the benefits in the UK is that freight has grown by 60 per cent in 10 years, partly because of government policy. I commend them not just for that&#151;they also rescued the CTRL, which is great&#151;but for having an independent regulator. Having a partly independent regulator in the CTRL does not send the right message to the market. I shall leave the matter there and no doubt we shall return to it later. I shall read what everyone has said with great interest. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

As all the other definitions effectively concern the construction of the link, and as we have already discussed the fact that there should not be a development agreement but that there should be another way of regulating and having licences instead for the link, there did not seem to be much point in having Section 56. However, I am sure that my noble friend will say that many things still need to be included and that it is just a tidying-up exercise following the previous discussion on the development agreement.</p>

A few weeks ago, my noble friend responded to my Written Question about the network statement for the CTRL, which I submit, under these regulations, should have been produced when the first section opened in November 2006. It is now one year and three or four months later: we have seen a draft network statement, but we have not seen anything else. As my noble friend said, the charges are still being discussed. I tabled this amendment because if Network Rail had been a year late with publication of a network statement, it would have been fined &#163;5 million, &#163;10 million or &#163;20 million. The CTRL is a year and a bit late. Is my noble friend going to fine it? What is he going to do about it? It has not got very far with its charging proposals. As he said, it is still discussing the matter. It is good to have the discussions, but why this delay? It again indicates a slightly cosy relationship compared with that between the Rail Regulator and Network Rail, which jolly well does produce its network statement in time. It is a very fine document.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000142"></a>Can my noble friend give me some assurance that, while the Secretary of State is the regulator in this respect, the Government will try to enforce the regulation as it should be so that we get a network statement that is meaningful? The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked why there is no freight on the line. The answer is that the freight does not know how much it is going to pay. How can it start preparing a service if it does not know how much it is going to pay? I rest my case. I beg to move.</p>

Regulation 11 of the Railways Infrastructure (Access and Management) Regulations 2005 requires an infrastructure manager to publish a network statement. That has to contain information prescribed in the regulation, including details of access charges and the procedure for requesting access to the railway. Decisions of the infrastructure manager in relation to the network statement have to be produced in accordance with Regulation 11 and can be appealed to the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000144"></a>We do not think that there is any uncertainty about whether Regulation 29 applies to HS1&#151;it does. For that reason, we think that the proposed amendment is wholly unnecessary.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000145"></a>Furthermore, the addition of these words to Regulation 11 would call into question whether other provisions in the 2005 regulations, which do not contain similar &#147;clarifying&#148; wording, also apply to the rail link. Therefore, the amendment could give rise to doubt rather than avoiding it. I suspect that there is an unintended consequence at the root of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000146"></a>I cannot comment on freight charges. It is not for me to talk about that today; it is a discussion for another time. I understand the point the noble Lord makes. Clearly, the cost of access is a consideration. We had some discussion in the House when we were debating this issue some months ago. The point was fairly made by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and others&#151;as well as the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, who is no longer here&#151;that it is clear that there has to be some movement commercially on that issue; otherwise, we will not be able to achieve better access for freight to the Channel Tunnel, which would be a missed opportunity, as we all agree.</p>

Is this not the point that we have been driving at all along? The Department for Transport is not an efficient regulator, and probably never will be, because it never sticks to the sort of timescale that the Office of Rail Regulation does. A quinquennial review does not mean later in the year or sometime next year; it means five years. We are driving at that preciseness on which business decisions have to be made, and which is being sought by the would-be purchasers of the rail link.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000150"></a>On the issue of network statements, the subsidiaries of LCR responsible for managing the line have network statements.

I do not want to repeat what I have said before&#151;we will all get tired over this&#151;but it will be interesting to see how the charges come out. We have spoken about the return on the investment. The people running High Speed 1 have been helpful over freight and have offered 20 train paths a night in each direction. There has been some debate about how it should have been built and whether it has been built to the design for 300 kilometres an hour or 120, but I think that has been resolved. The key is to get continental gauge trains into Barking, Dagenham and places like that. That would bring enormous benefit to rail freight, assuming, as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said, the Channel Tunnel comes right.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000158"></a>According to the European directive, the charges for freight have to be short by a marginal cost, but there is still to be an allowance for mark-up or financing up to the level of how much the market can bear. It is very interesting, because the regulator is doing exactly the same thing in his review of Network Rail&#146;s access charges. I heard one of his senior people this morning explain how the charging worked. There is a limit to it, which is based on the level of charging that any market sector can bear. The regulator defines a market sector as spent nuclear fuel, coal and things like that, so they are quite constrained. I do not know who will make these decisions for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, because it will not be the regulator; it will be the Department for Transport, taking advice, I presume, from people who want to make as much money as possible on the line.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000159"></a>We have a long way to go on this. I shall not speak further at this stage, except to say that setting the charges will make or break the link. It is surprising that nobody has picked up on the fact that, nearly a year and a half after the link opened, there is no freight on it, even though it is designed for it. Not even rates have been set. I beg to move.</p>

The amendments would change that arrangement so that the charging framework would be set by the Office of Rail Regulation by way of a periodic review. We do not think that HS1 should be subject to full economic regulation by the Office of Rail Regulation&#151;I have made that clear in earlier debates. That regime was designed for a different type of asset base&#151;a historic and complex network&#151;and is not appropriate for a new, single line such as High Speed 1.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000161"></a>Instead, we want lighter-touch regulation under the Railways Infrastructure (Access and Management) Regulations 2005 in relation to charges for HS1, as proposed. It is anticipated that the charging framework will be set by the Secretary of State and will enable the infrastructure manager to recover operating, maintenance and renewal costs from train operators, plus a charge to reflect the level of investment in the railway. That investment recovery charge is likely to be subject to a maximum cap. There are no proposals at present to make the charging framework set by the Secretary of State subject to periodic reviews, although there will be scope for variation by agreement with the infrastructure manager.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000167"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment relates to a slightly different aspect of the regulation of the CTRL. It interests me, because, as noble Lords will know, the Office of Rail Regulation is going through the process, which has taken about two years now, of reviewing Network Rail&#146;s access charges, including how much money it needs to operate and maintain its network in a stable condition. In the last periodic review, it required Network Rail to reduce its charges over the five-year period by 31 per cent, and I think that Network Rail is more or less on line to achieve that. The regulator told us this morning that he was minded to ask for much the same reduction in the next five years. At the moment, Network Rail is not very happy with that and the debate is continuing. This issue is also tied in with how much money will be available through HLOS, as my noble friend will be fully aware.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000168"></a>However, that is not the point. The regulator has found that Network Rail will probably be required to reduce its costs&#151;not its charges&#151;by 60 per cent over 10 years. As the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act and the Bill now stand, the role of setting the infrastructure manager&#146;s costs will, as I understand it from Regulation 13, be down to the Government. Therefore, how does my noble friend think that the Secretary of State will do for this rail link what the Rail Regulator is doing for Network Rail? The regulator is spending two years and putting enormous time and effort into carrying out international comparisons right across Europe and North America to check on Network Rail&#146;s efficiency so that its costs, and therefore its charges and also the amount of money that the Government have to pay, come down. Presumably, under Regulation 13, which concerns infrastructure costs and accounts, the same thing will

The Office of Rail Regulation has a highly skilled and quite well paid group of people. As the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, mentioned, it has spent a large sum of money overseas accurately benchmarking the costs and has then proceeded to enforce its views quite vigorously on Network Rail. Will that really be done by the department? I find it impossible to understand that as it is a very skilled job. To mention another industry, the Civil Aviation Authority has just completed its review of the charges at the London airports. Looking at the way in which Ferrovial&#146;s shares shot up in price yesterday, there must be some doubt, even after all the work that has been done, as to whether it has done it efficiently. Therefore, the department is taking a huge burden on its shoulders, and it is one which I think it may live to regret.</p>

Ancillary to that function, she is also required to make provision to ensure that infrastructure expenditure for HS1 balances with its access charge income, public funding and surpluses from other commercial activities. She must also ensure that the infrastructure manager has incentives to reduce costs and the level of access charges, and she has also to approve the levying of mark-ups charged by the infrastructure manager in accordance with the requirements of the 2005 regulations. In addition, she must ensure that access charges levied by the HS1 infrastructure manager comply with the requirements of the 2005 regulations&#151;notably, as I have observed before, that they are levied on a fair and non-discriminatory basis. The Secretary of State is also able to establish a framework for the allocation of capacity on HS1 but is not required to do so. The amendment would transfer these ancillary functions to the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000172"></a>As I have explained, the Government consider it important that the Secretary of State should retain responsibility for setting the charging framework in order to secure best value in a sale of the railway. On the basis that she will do so, the Government&#146;s current position is that these directly related ancillary functions should also be retained by the Secretary of State rather than be transferred to the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000173"></a>That said, certain of the functions to which these amendments relate are of a supervisory nature&#151;for example, the requirement to ensure that the charges set by the infrastructure manager comply with the  


<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requirements of the 2005 regulations. There may be a case for transferring those supervisory functions to the ORR in view of the expertise and resources that it has in that area. The Government propose to consider this more carefully once the charging framework for HS1 post-restructuring is more certain. That will probably be of some comfort to the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000174"></a>The noble Lord raised the issue of the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to define the HS1 cost base. We do not think that it is an overly complex matter&#151;the asset is far less complex than the historical rail network. We are not sure that the burden will be so great. After all, it is a bit more like a new road. We will, of course, ensure that there are incentives to reduce costs. We see that as very important in this case.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000175"></a><b><a name="80312-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08031254000313"></a>Lord Berkeley:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend. He would be very wise to use some of the ORR expertise for some of this cost checking. I hear what he says; this is a new railway and maintaining it should not be too difficult. However, there are tunnels, bridges and high-speed track, and I suspect that the ORR employs somewhere between 100 and 150 people to look at the costs of Network Rail and work out how to get them down, which is a significant amount of work. I am pleased by what he said&#151;if I understood him correctly&#151;about using some of the ORR&#146;s expertise. This is again something to follow up. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000178"></a>The noble Lord said: We are nearly there. Amendment No. 8 is a probing amendment and is designed to encourage my noble friend to confirm that the nominated undertaker for the infrastructure manager of High Speed 1 will be totally separate&#151;financially, corporately and in everything else&#151;from any train operator that uses it in compliance with the current and expected EU rules and the regulations that we have been discussing at length. I am still interested in who will own Eurostar UK in future, how the sale will be made and how the sale of the infrastructure will be made. Will it be by competitive tendering, by negotiation behind closed doors or what? Is there a timescale for it? This is a tidying-up amendment. I am sure that my noble friend will be able to answer all these questions and confirm that the nominated undertaker will be separate from the train operator. I beg to move.</p>

The Bill is a preliminary step towards the restructuring of LCR's constituent businesses. One of the purposes of that restructuring is to separate those

The first sale anticipated is that of the HS1 infrastructure, which is planned to take place in 2009. As a result of that sale, Eurostar and HS1 will no longer be in common ownership, and therefore the vertical links that currently exist will be removed without the need for legislation.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000180"></a>A key reason for separating LCR's constituent businesses is that they will attract different investors as and when they are disposed of. Whoever the future infrastructure and train operators are, they will of course have to comply with relevant UK and EU legislation, including competition and open access regulations. Of course, it is possible that the new owner of HS1 could have interests in other train operating companies which may run services on HS1. There are existing legislative provisions to address the potential conflicts to which such an interest could give rise.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000181"></a>Specifically, the Railways Infrastructure (Access and Management) Regulations 2005, which implement EC directives in relation to access to railway infrastructure, require that the infrastructure manager and any associated train operator each prepare separate accounts, and that the infrastructure manager responsible for setting charges for and allocating capacity to the railway is&#151;in its legal form, organisation and decision-making&#151;independent from an associated train operator. If it is not, it is required to delegate the function to an independent charging body and independent allocation body respectively. It also requires that there is no cross-subsidy of public funds provided to either the infrastructure manager or train operator.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000182"></a>We consider these provisions are sufficient to deal with the potential conflicts of interest that this amendment is designed to prevent. We seek to achieve what the noble Lord would like to see put in place but we do not think that his amendment is necessary or would give effect to that end. We think we have got it about right.</p>

Another arm of the Department for Transport has been seeking a framework agreement for Crossrail trains of 50 years, and the regulator is suggesting that 30 years is all right for that one. Does my noble friend have any views on how long it would allow Eurostar to have a framework agreement for using the Channel Tunnel Rail Link? I think that he said they would not have a take-or-pay contract, but if I am wrong he could correct me.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000188"></a>What kind of a framework agreement would be planned for Eurostar? The standard on the rest of the railway is not more than 10 years. I beg to move.</p>

It appears to give the Office of Rail Regulation rather than the Secretary of State the function of supervising negotiations between the HS1 infrastructure manager and a train operator to ensure compliance with the requirements of the 2005 Regulations. It would also remove the obligation on the ORR to consult the Secretary of State and take account of her representations before taking a decision on an appeal in relation to HS1.</p>

Having said that, it is recognised that, as I said earlier, there may be advantages in transferring some supervisory roles to the Office of Rail Regulation in the future because of its particular expertise. I gave a commitment that we will consider that issue once restructuring proposals are more certain.</p>

<p><a name="08031254000193"></a>A third change, which I notice is introduced by the amendment, is directly related to the proposal to bring HS1 access contracts within the ambit of ORR regulation. The Government do not consider that that will be appropriate, given that it would result in a situation overlap&#151;or, if you like, dual regulation&#151;by both the ORR and the Secretary of State. We resist the amendment for those reasons.</p>

<a name="80312-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08031254000194"></a>My noble friend asked how long it would be before the Eurostar access framework was in place. We have not taken decisions on that.

The Government encourage applications for appointment from a wide range of candidates&#151;and advertises in national and regional media as appropriate. The final decision, however, is made on merit and the successful candidate will have evidenced the necessary skills and experience required for the role. Where a public body has a particular regional or local focus, every effort is made to encourage applications from the local area. As the report of the New Local Government Network makes clear, the boards of local and regional public bodies&#151;such as primary care trusts and regional development agencies&#151;are already broadly representative of the communities they serve.</p>
