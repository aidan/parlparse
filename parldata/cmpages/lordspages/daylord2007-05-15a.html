Policing of the events taking place in the year is a matter for Merseyside Police, which, like every other police force, has benefited from a sustained increase in funding under this Government.</p>

Is it not true that the majority of police funding comes from central government? Can she explain why the Government were able to give special funding for extra policing for the Commonwealth Games, which lasted for just under a month, but have not made provision for the culture programme, which will last for over a yearand will probably bring about 24 million visitors tothe city?</p>

An increase in total grants of &#163;98 million, which is 45.5 per cent in real terms, has been made since 1997-98. There has been an increase of&#163;85 million, which is 37.6 per cent in real terms, since 2000-01. Moneys were made available in 2002 for the Commonwealth Games because they were a specific special event that took place over a short period of time. In relation to this situation, Merseyside bid for and was, quite rightly, granted special status. That is something for which it should have made proper provision, and I am sure that it has.</p>

Gone are the days when the comedians would joke that if you shouted &#147;Stop thief!&#148; in Liverpool, everybody started to run. The latest crime survey shows that the figures for violent, household and personal crime in Merseyside are lower than the national average. Does she also agree that the problem is not the reality of crime, which has fallen over the past 10 years, but the fear of crime and antisocial behaviour, which is tackled by the presence of police officers on the streets? The European Capital of Culture initiative deserves the support of the Government and the private sector and shouldbe seen as a positive investment in the future of Merseyside.</p>

I commend the wonderful work that has been donein Merseyside by the police. We have seen real improvement and change, which has given us all a great deal of pleasure. I also agree that the fear of crime must be tackled with great vigour. I am very pleased that this Government have been able togive significant, palpable support to the police by increasing their numbers to enable them to be more visible and to do their job.</p>

How can it be right that over the past two years Merseyside Police&#146;s budget has been cut by&#163;12 million, so that the force now has to find&#163;9 million to manage its policing, when Manchester received the figure to which the right reverend Prelate referred for the Commonwealth Games and a further &#163;4.5 million to organise policing for the Labour Party conference that took place there? There is clearly an inconsistency in the way this is being dealt with.</p>

The noble Lord will know that the final force budget for Liverpool is &#163;307.3 million. That is an increase of 3.7 per cent or &#163;10.9 million. The police precept on council tax is &#163;127.53 for band D property, which is an increase of 5 per cent. That money, I am sure, will be properly spent. The noble Lord knows that part of our expectation is that the police force will provide appropriate policing within its budget. Also, Liverpool asked for this honour and was lucky enough to get it.</p>

Merseyside Police Authority estimates that there will be over 20 million visitors, including just over 4.5 million from abroad. This is a prelude to the Olympics in 2012, particularly in relation to safer policing. In light of the difference between the Government and the Merseyside Police Authority, would it not be wise to invite Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary to assess, independently both of the Government and of the Merseyside Police Authority, the actual policing needs in Liverpool and how they could be met?</p>

I reassure him that appropriate steps are being taken to ensure that the necessary policing for the 2012 Olympics is well provided for. Those discussions are already under way. Noble Lords have mentioned the Commonwealth Games, but I remind them that the Commonwealth Games in 2002 took place over a short period of time; only &#163;5 million was granted, although that is a significant sum, but the people were coming to a very small area over an intense period. That is not the case for the celebrations in 2008 for Liverpool. Liverpool has been planning for this for a number of years now.</p>

Victims of rape and other sexual crime can also pursue a perpetrator for damages in the civil courts for the tort of assault or battery. We have no plans to review or change those arrangements.</p>

Why do we not move to the German system, where the state does not pay and where compensation follows civil action, as against the state paying?Surely the trauma of rape requires not state-funded windfalls but counselling services that really help victims.</p>

<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="07051549000030"></a><b><a name="70515-0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="07051549000597"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, a victim of rape should get both compensation and counselling and support. It is not either/or; it is both/and. As the noble Lord will know, it is very important that we make sure that where convictions are made, people can get some kind of recompense for the trauma and injury that they may have received. As for the reasons why people make false allegations, I do not agree that one of the primary objectives is to get &#163;11,000. There may be very serious reasons why people do that, which we need to consider.</p>

Does this not show how wrong it is to have a tariff system of compensation in respect of women who have suffered rape when there areso many variants&#151;so many differences&#151;with regardto the trauma suffered by the victim? Is it not timethat the Government started to increase levels of compensation, which have remained steady, if not diminished, during the past 10 years under this Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer?</p>

The noble Lord will know that the Green Paper was issued in December 2005 to consider the compensation scheme. Having transferred it to the Ministry of Justice, we await our final deliberations, but the ambition is that we have a speedier and simpler system focused on the victim.</p>

He implied that people were making unfair or untrue allegations in order to get compensation. Can the Minister clarify this point? Do you get compensation only if the case is proved; or, as the noble Lord said, can you just make a claim and get compensation without any proof?</p>

However, the basis of the claim is different in a civil case, as the noble Baroness will know. The issue raised by the noble Lord about unfounded claims is important. Where those running the compensation scheme become aware that a claim has been made wrongly, they will seek wherever possible to reclaim the money.</p>

Less than 6 per cent of all those charged with rape are convicted. That means that thousands of women in this country have been raped but will never get any compensation. Also, when does she expect the Government to respond to the consultation on rape, which started in spring 2006 and ended in July 2006? Does she agree that that could form the basis of a wide-ranging debate in your Lordships' House, rather than having a series of monthly Questions on the subject?</p>

I hope that my noble friend will pursue the idea that we have a debate in your Lordships&#146; House; that would be extremely valuable. We seek to support victims of rape in a number of ways, by ensuring not only that there are convictions but that people who are traumatised are given the right kind of support. We have sexual assault referral centres where medical care and counselling can be given very quickly and sympathetically. We have sexual violence advisers, and &#163;3 million has beenput into setting up an adviser system across thecountry to provide essential services for those who have been raped. There is a victim&#146;s fund. To date,100 organisations have received some form of funding. Victim Support also plays an important part. We have tried to ensure in these and many other ways that those who suffer this terrible crime come forward and that we get the convictions.</p>

Over-rides occur in a small percentage of cases; for example, as a resultof the speed of decision-making in Brussels. The Government are committed to minimising the number of over-rides.

First, it has weakened the scrutiny of European legislation. Secondly, it is in clear breach of the scrutiny reserve resolution of 1999. Surely at a time when the majority of our law is now made in Brussels, scrutiny should be strengthened, not weakened, to restore at least some control by our Parliament over EU legislation.</p>

Of course, five months is absolutely unnecessary, but there are circumstances in whichwe work with the scrutiny committee to ensure that over-rides are avoided.

Surely, on those occasions, there could be no question of pressure from other states to get on with the business. The Government had control of the agenda.

An example of an unavoidable over-ride concerns a common position renewing restrictive measures against certain individuals in Uzbekistan, which was agreed yesterday at the General Affairs and External Relations Council. If that had not been done, the sanctions could not have been continued. In such a case, it is very important that the system of over-rides can continue, although we seek to diminish the number of occasions on which there are over-rides.</p>

Therefore, frequently, decisions have to be made in the absence of Parliament sitting.

Therefore we have a better scrutiny record in this House than in the other place. As for the timing of debates, of course, that is a matter for the usual channels.</p>

Currently there are two welfare officers serving in the field hospital in Basra under military command. The chief executive officer of the Defence Medical Welfare Service has recently returned from a three-day visit to the hospital, where he saw at first hand the excellent facilities and equipment that are available in the hospital and, more importantly, the skills and compassion of the clinical team and welfare officers.

All the Minister has to say is, &#147;I accept the amendment&#148;.</p>

I made it clear in my discussions with noble Lords between Committee and Report that I would not be bringing this amendment forward. I made that clear at Report, so there was always the opportunity to come back at this stage. The noble Lord shakes his head, but I recall that we had a discussion about possibilities in which this issue might be raised. Anyway, if noble Lords had felt that they had been misled, I would have been perfectly happyto see amendments today that addressed the issue. Indeed, we have the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. I am quite sure what the outcome of this debate will be as a consequence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07051549000097"></a>This is what I believe I did. I accept completely that the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Hunt of Wirral, and other noble Lords were seeking to ensure that this Bill was even-handed in its approach to the Consumer Panel and the role of the professions. I think that noble Lords accepted, after our lengthy and helpful debates in Committee, that there was a need to create a Consumer Panel. There was no such body; therefore, for the Consumer Panel to be able either to take judicial review or make proper representations, it needed to be set up properly. The concern that was expressed was whether that shifted the weight of representation away from the professions and the legal services to the point at which the Bill was in a sense up-ended. That we did not wish to do.</p>

<a name="70515-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07051549000098"></a>I took away Amendment No. 38. I did not accept it on the Floor, which is what you do if you are an accepting an amendment there and then&#151;but it is reasonable to say that I might not have done that in any event, because I would have had to consult. I took it back and took legal and parliamentary counsel advice on whether the principle behind even-handedness was already in the Bill or not.</p>

The principal way in which the professions can make representations, by the nature of the organisations that they are, and in which they have traditionally sought to make representations, secures them mutatis mutandis. Therefore, my advice was that, were we to insert anything further, we would be in danger of moving the Bill in the other direction.</p>

<a name="70515-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07051549000100"></a>What lies between us is simply that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, with his experience&#151;and no doubt he will be joined by other noble Lords&#151;does not think that we have achieved what I believe we have achieved. Noble Lords will have to make their decision whether we have or have not done so from what I and the noble Lord have said. That is the joy of being in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;it is up to noble Lords to determine. From my perspective, I have sought to ensure that what I agreed to do has been achieved, which was to make sure that the measure was even-handed. It is my contention that it has been achieved. That may not satisfy noble Lords, but I believe that I have not misled the House in so doing.</p>

This group of amendments makes consequential amendments to Schedules 3, 5 and 16 and updates the Law Society&#146;s powers to require information, as I indicated I would do on the last day of Report. I do not propose to go into detail on the consequential amendments, suffice to say that they are necessary in order to make the amendments agreed at previous stages of the Bill work properly. However, I should like to say a little more on the amendments that I committed on Report to table.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07051549000108"></a>Amendments Nos. 20 and 25, for example, are necessary to update the powers of the Law Society to obtain information relevant to an investigation into a solicitor, a recognised body or a manager or employee of a recognised body. Amendment No. 20 allows the Law Society to obtain information from a personwho is not connected to the solicitor or firm under investigation. This is necessary in order to close an existing loophole where information relevant to an investigation would be outside the society&#146;s scope if held by a third party. The power may be exercised only through a High Court order.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07051549000109"></a>The amendments also aim to ensure that investigations are not frustrated by providing for it to be an offence to falsify, conceal, destroy or otherwise dispose of a document which a person knows or suspects to be relevant to the investigation; or recklessly or deliberately to provide information which is falseor misleading in a material particular.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07051549000110"></a>Amendment No. 22 ensures that these updated powers apply effectively to recognised bodies and their managers, employees and interest holders, and that the powers may also be exercised for the purpose of investigating a body&#146;s continuing suitability to be recognised.

She may recall that on 8 May we had a debateabout an amendment which I tabled concerning the relationship between the regulatory obligations in Part 5 and the obligations that any ABS might have to its shareholders.

At the end of her response, the noble Baroness and I had an exchange about the appropriateness of my insisting on the amendment. The noble Baroness said that she was advised by the Department of Trade and Industry that if the amendment appeared in the Bill, it could produce certain conflictual situations. Thereafter, she undertook to furnish me with the DTI&#146;s advice before Third Reading. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07051549000191"></a>&#147;I am more than happy to set out in writing the concerns of the Department of Trade and Industry ...

</ul>
<p><a name="07051549000174"></a>I have not had that in writing. I recognise that I have not tabled an amendment on the matter now but I should be content if the noble Baroness could give an undertaking to your Lordships&#146; House that if the matter cannot be settled now, it will be one to which whoever deals with the Bill in another place will direct their minds.</p>

In a letter to him this week, I said that my officials were in touch with officials at the Department of Trade and Industry and that I hoped to be in a position to comment further at Third Reading, but that if that were not possible, I would write to him again on the issue and that I would be happy to ensure that his concern was dealt with. I have just been given a summary of the DTI&#146;s concerns regarding his previous Amendment No. 435. I could read them out, but I am not sure that it would be of benefit to noble Lords.</p>

It is clear in Part 5 that if there is a conflict between what the shareholders want and what the regulator wants, the regulator will always prevail. At Report stage, the noble Baroness for the first time appeared to raise doubts that the DTI had, in turn, raised with her regarding the outcome of any conflict. There would be extremely serious implications for the operation of the ABS system if there were circumstances in which shareholders could override regulators. Indeed, that would undermine the basis on which the Government and the Opposition parties had been dealing with the Bill.</p>

I am not sure how it fits into what we are doing, but it is important to put it on the record, as the noble Lord said. We were considering an amendment to Clause 169, if noble Lords need to look back at that. That amendment sought to ensure that, in the context of ABS firms, lawyers&#146; duties to comply with their professional conduct obligations would override any other obligations, including their directors&#146; duties to shareholders. We have made it clear that an override provision is unnecessary as long as lawyers and licensed bodies have a statutory obligation to comply with their professional conduct rules. Those statutory obligations are contained in Clause 169 and are reinforced by Clause 88. They

The duties cannot be compromised by other obligations, just as companies and company employees have different kinds of statutory obligations and directors cannot cause breaches of those obligations in the name of their duties to shareholders.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07051549000116"></a>I understand the concern regarding directors&#146; duties to a company and its shareholders, yet we emphasise that those duties are intended to be cumulative with any other duties to which the director may be subject, not in conflict with them. The duties owed by directors in Part 10 of the 2006 Act do not require directors to break the law and could never form a defence to a breach of another legal obligation. Instead, they must be understood in the context of the wider legal framework. Section 172 of that Act, which requires directors to promote the success of the company for the benefit of the members as a whole, is flexible enough to allow for directors&#146; duties and the duties arising under other law to operate harmoniously without any need for specific provision in other legislation.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07051549000117"></a>As noble Lords will know, we have just completed a codification of company law, including directors&#146; duties, in the Companies Act 2006. The DTI is concerned that an override provision in relation to lawyers&#146; duties, such as that proposed by the noble Lord, would risk creating uncertainty in company law and other law to which companies are subject, because it would be unclear as to how directors&#146; duties would interact with regulatory obligations in areas other than legal services.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07051549000118"></a>In other words, the Companies Act recognises that in fulfilling their duties to shareholders, directors of companies must have the flexibility to have regard to a wide range of objectives and to act in furtherance of purposes other than the benefit of the company members, where applicable. It may be taken as read that directors are required to comply with other legal obligations. We do not wish to state that explicitly, because we risk negative inferences for other regulatory legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07051549000119"></a>I am content with that explanation, which I am happy to ensure the noble Lord has in writing. I will also ensure that copies are placed in the Library of your Lordships&#146; House and sent to other noble Lords who have spoken on that amendment and on the Bill. It deals with the fact that there is not an issue of concern; rather, it explains why adding anything further to the Bill could create uncertainty, which I am sure the noble Lord does not want.</p>

Our initial amendment in Committee was softened on Report but we still failed to ensnare the noble Baroness. Despite the period of reflection between Report and Third Reading, we have seen no movement from the Government and so we have retabled our Report amendment.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07051549000126"></a>Part 5 indisputably takes us into new territory. We simply do not know what the impact of alternative business structures will be on access to justice, andthe amendment seeks to ensure that a proper investigation is conducted into the likely impact. The noble Baroness does not like that because, she asserts, it would give too much weight in the decision-making process to one of the eight objectives to which all the regulators must have regard.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07051549000127"></a>My response to that is twofold. First, all the amendment obliges the licensing authority to do is to conduct a thorough investigation into the access to justice implications of the proposal. The obligationis for the licensor to put itself in the picture as thoroughly as possible before testing the proposal against all eight objectives. Within the scope of the amendment, the licensor is perfectly entitled to investigate in as much detail as it thinks appropriate any of the other seven objectives. Secondly, even ifI am wrong about my understanding of my own amendment, there is, in my submission, nothing wrong or unprecedented in Governments requiring decision-makers to give particular or significant weight to a relevant consideration, and, in this case, there is a powerful a priori reason for doing so.

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07051549000129"></a>We have had evidence from noble Lords about the anxieties on this topic of solicitors in various partsof the country. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, spoke about Wales; the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, spoke about Yorkshire and Cumbria; the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, spoke about the anxieties in the West Country; and the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said that he was particularly concerned about rural areas. There is no doubt about this. Perhaps the most compelling evidence came from the former Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. In his capacity as Lord Chief Justice, he travelled the land and became well aware of anxieties among solicitors throughout the country. The fact that there is such anxiety has not been challenged and we have not had proper evidence of the likely economic outcome.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07051549000130"></a>There has been a new development of which your Lordships should be aware. On 9 May, the day after we previously spoke about the matter, the Ministry of Justice came into life&#151;it sprung fully formed from the helmet&#151;and immediately published a manifesto entitled <I>Justice&#151;a new approach</I>. That is relevant because, throughout, it advocates the fact that in setting up the new department the Government are adopting as one of their principles the importanceof access to justice.<I></I>I will give brief citations from pages 11, 15, 16 and 20.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07051549000131"></a>On page 11, the department states as one of its objectives:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="07051549000193"></a>&#147;We will provide access to justice for all: by making help and advice and financial support available at the point of need and at the earliest stage, especially for the most vulnerable&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07051549000175"></a>On page 15, it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07051549000194"></a>&#147;We will promote justice by: ensuring that our justice system is accessible and effective, respected and understood&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07051549000176"></a>On page 16, under &#147;Provision for Justice&#148;, is the important passage:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07051549000195"></a>&#147;An effective justice system is not just about the courts and the judges; it concerns the extent to which the public has access to that system. Access depends on understanding one&#146;s rights and knowing how to go about enforcing them ... Access to justice means making sure that people, and particularly the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society, are able to get the help, advice and support that they need&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07051549000177"></a>All this cries out for having local advice centres and local solicitors who can do exactly that. Finally, on page 20, the department says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="07051549000196"></a>&#147;We will work together with communities to give them a greater stake in how justice is delivered in their area, improving the visibility, accessibility and accountability of justice&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07051549000178"></a>None of that can be compatible with a separate government policy which, if implemented, is likely to have the consequence of wiping out a lot of local solicitors who could give advice. This would appear to be a case in which the Lord Chancellor, wearing his hat as Secretary of State for Justice, wishes to have a unified approach&#151;not one department doing one thing and another bit of the system doing something else. On page 27, the department states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="07051549000197"></a>&#147;Working closely with the other key departments, the Ministry of Justice provides the opportunity to look at the system as a whole; not as a set of constituent parts, but as a consistent, coherent whole&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70515-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07051549000132"></a>The other piece of fresh information that your Lordships should have relates to Germany. We have touched on this subject on two or three earlier occasions. The Joint Committee&#151;I apologise to the House because I should have declared that I wasa member of the Joint Committee under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, I am a member of the legal profession, I was on the Bar Council and I was once chairman of the Bar. The Joint Committee had evidence from the German equivalent of the Bar Council and the Law Society rolled into one. Its evidence brought to our notice that, on the continent, what we were doing would be regarded as unacceptable. It would not be possible for a German lawyer&#151;a Rechtsanwalt&#151;to be a member of one of these new bodies, particularly if it had outside funding.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07051549000133"></a>I raised that point on the previous occasion when we discussed this matter, and the Minister replied:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07051549000198"></a>&#147;Noble Lords talked about the German BRAK. On a recent overseas visit, I heard that the German Parliament is looking to legislate in this direction. The relationship between the reaction of the German BRAK and what is happening in Germany may be relevant to our deliberations, but it looks as if Germany may be heading in the same direction. We will have to find more information because that was new to me, but it appears to be the case&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/5/07; col. 1410.].</p>
</ul>
<a name="70515-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07051549000134"></a>I thought the sensible thing to do was to write to BRAK&#151;the Minister has my letter&#151;to ask whatis happening and what legislation the German Parliament is looking at. The answer has come back, and there are three relevant points. First, a legal services Bill is before the Bundestag; secondly, there is a controversial clause about adding new professions to the list of three with which lawyers may unite; and thirdly, on the point we have been talking about, the external funding, the relevant paragraph in the letter from Dr Dombek, the president of BRAK&#151;which I immediately copied to the Minister&#151;is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="07051549000199"></a>&#147;Regarding the Alternative Business Structures envisaged by Part 5 of the Legal Services Bill it is our understanding that firms authorised to provide legal services could have shareholders from outside the profession like banks and insurance companies. It is further our understanding that the management of such firms must not necessarily be in the hands of a majority of lawyers. The German draft bill ... does not include legislative proposals in this direction. On the contrary, interested parties in Germany have lobbied the government and the political parties to allow third party investments into law firms. However both the Government and the politicians have rejected these proposals as, in their opinion third party investment would be a threat to the independence of the lawyer. Nobody should have the possibility to be able to determine a lawyer&#146;s advice following economic interests. As the BRAK shares these concerns I took the liberty of writing my letter of 26 June 2006 to you and pointing out the difficulties that will arise for Anglo-German law firms in Germany if the firm or the lawyer decides to opt for third party investment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07051549000179"></a>On the basis of this information to the House, there is no indication whatever that the German Parliament is moving in a similar manner, and there is evidence that it is thought to be totally unacceptable to move in any such direction.</p>

From the very beginning of the Bill, I have expressed my opposition to the alternative business structure, drawing, as I do, upon my experience in a small high street firm of solicitors for some five or six years in my youth and my knowledge of these firms while practising at the Bar ever since.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07051549000136"></a>The Government may try to portray the stance of lawyers who believe in the small firm as reactionary, conservative or in their own private interests. That is not the case. Over the decades there has been strong competition between local firms for business. They compete with each other in terms of cost and fees,in efficiency and in providing a service to the communities from which they spring. All that is undermined by the Government&#146;s approach here that we introduce marketing forces; that price is the only thing that matters; and the fact than there may be conflicts of interests within large concerns, whether insurance companies, motoring services of whatever, which can be ignored.</p>

<a name="70515-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07051549000137"></a>We do not believe that that is the right approach. The public are better served by lawyers, who are absolutely independent and who stand against the legislation that may be put forward or government departments where people are seeking to secure their rights to social security, and so on. We are very much concerned that alternative business structures will see this service disappear to be replaced by something that is very much less of utility to the people of this country. I am amazed that this comes from a so-called Labour Government. I am reminded they are new Labour. That is even worse. It is astonishing that it should come from that source. Perhaps it is not so astonishing because I have commented on the authoritarian streak of this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07051549000138"></a>The lawyer stands independent of government to protect the citizen. This Bill, with its suggestion of alternative business structures, without any examination of whether it is necessary or appropriate in a particular area, such as my own area in north-east Wales, undermines the principle of access to justice.</p>

I do not disagree with the case put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. Before becoming a judge I had, like him, the immense privilege of being for many years a solicitor, and thereafter a member of the Bar. That gives one some insight into the immense worth of these two independent professions. Their independence is tied up with their integrity, which is tied up with their reputation for competence, which I think is second to none in the world.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07051549000140"></a>It may be a coincidence that in all countries with comparable situations to England and Wales there have as yet been no moves towards the ABS system. The House I am sure is indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Neill, for the information concerning the situation at the Bundestag.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07051549000141"></a>However, the case does not rest of necessity on the argument put forward with such clear articulation by  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_140"></a><b>15 May 2007 : Column 140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. I do not dispute that case, but it can be put effectively at a much lower level. It is this: business and professional life are entirely different worlds. There are situations where they coalesce and situations where they compete.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07051549000142"></a>Part 5 creates a massive new experiment. That experiment may have the capacity for good, or it may have the capacity for evil, damage and injury to institutions that we hold dear. No one in this House or elsewhere can foresee exactly where it will lead. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Neill, takes the principle much further than that of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, but the case for the two amendments is that Parliament can do one of two things. It can allow Part 5 of the legislation to proceed into the unknown by taking this huge and potentially dangerous step, knowing that the day may come when it may have to reconsider most drastically exactly what has been brought about. The other alternative is prudence and a cautious precept&#151;to place the onus where it belongs; on the advocates of this drastic change. Those advocates should indeed prove their case before Part 5 is implemented. The possibilities are enormous. The potential for evil could be very, very great. Prudence demands the acceptance of the principle of these amendments.</p>

I wholly support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, for all the reasons given. Those reasons have been so very well expressed that it would be quite unnecessary to improve on them. Indeed, I do not think that I could. I also very much support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Kingsland. Within the concept of justice in these circumstances, it must be accepted that a decision must be taken on the proportionate balance of the Clause 1 regulatory objectives considered as a whole. That is the judicial process that has commended itself to your Lordships, as the amendments of my noble friend Lord Kingsland in effect establish a new regime of overarching importance. An amendment to this effect was tabled in my name and supported by my noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral. It was removed from the Marshalled List on the advice of the Public Bill Office. I have been asked why my amendments were not moved. They could not have been spoken to other than on Third Reading. They would have implemented the new regime proposed by my noble friend Lord Kingsland. I thought that I had better explain why they were put on the list and why they were taken off it.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07051549000145"></a>I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, on bringing forward an amendment that is the best of all those that he has tabled.

One of his propositions was that we might, if this proved in practice to be damaging, seek to reverse it by an Act of Parliament. I am bound to say that that would be enormously difficult. If Part 5 goes forward, it will create property rights. It seems to me that, under the provisions of the Human Rights Act, we will find it extraordinarily difficult to embark on a dismantling of this scheme. It is improbablethat we could embark on such a course with commensurate ease. The very difficulty of reversing after we have legislated makes it so much more important that we take our time now and exhaust every possible avenue of inquiry into the potential impact of what is being done.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07051549000147"></a>In the light of the extraordinarily wide range of views that have been expressed on this subject right across your Lordships&#146; House, not once but on a number of occasions, I hope that even at this late hour the Government will stand back from their too certain assertions as to what the consequences will be and recognise that further independent advice would be entirely appropriate.</p>

Noble Lords will know that we have debated at great length in Committee and on Report the value and importance of alternative business structures, noble Lords&#146; concerns about how effectively they might operate and the safeguards that the Government have built into legislation to enable us to stop alternative business structures, to deny them any life without condition and to make sure that we do this in a cautious and step-by-step manner, as noble Lords would wish.</p>

I endorse wholeheartedly everything that he and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said about the importance of access to justice. I am concerned that in putting forward these propositions we must be mindful of dealing with new alternative business structures in a measured way. I am not, as noble Lords fear, seeking to do anything that takes away from our citizens the right of access to justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07051549000150"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, referred to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said. It is very important to make sure that local high-quality advice, perhaps from individual practitioners, is preserved. Noble Lords spoke at other stages of our consideration of this legislation about the need to make sure that the breadth of available advice and support was there. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, once again took us to his area of Wales, where his very real concern is that the rural population should not lose out in any way, shapeor form.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07051549000151"></a>Therefore, there is nothing between us on this. I could not agree more. The question is how to achieve it. My difficulty&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will not be surprised at this&#151;is the danger of ranking different regulatory objectives, thereby changing the nature of what we set out from the beginning in our discussions on Clause 1; that is, making sure thatthe regulatory objectives are properly weighed up, properly dealt with and properly accommodated in any process.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07051549000152"></a>I have made it as clear as I possibly can that it would not fulfil the regulatory objectives if what we saw happen was a removal of good-quality advice services to local people. However, I said that it was important to make sure that in weighing up the objectives we look for high quality. I do not think that this is about low costs; it is about right costs and providing high-quality services that are more easily accessible to people in a modern age. As noble Lords are aware, that may mean providing services in different ways.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07051549000153"></a>There is nothing between us, but I cannot accept the amendment because, from our perspective, it does nothing other than rank the regulatory objectives in a way that does not work for us. I shall not go through them again because I have spoken about them at many other stages of your Lordships&#146; deliberations. We believe that we have the right safeguards in place to ensure that we do not achieve what noble Lords are fearful of. The evil that the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, referred to is not what we are seeking to achieve.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07051549000154"></a>With alternative business structures, we are trying to provide opportunities for the legal professionand those who use its services to develop services in new, interesting and exciting ways, not to take away services from our citizens. It would be against everything that I believe in as a member of the new Labour Government if we wanted to do anything other than to provide the highest-quality services. That is very important to us.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07051549000155"></a>With Amendment No. 13, the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, is trying to do something very important. It would require us to get as much information as possible about alternative business structures before setting off down this path. The trouble is that, unless we do so, we cannot get the information. It is rather a Catch-22 proposition within the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07051549000156"></a>I agree wholeheartedly that we need to be cautious and to do this in a measured way. Indeed, everything that we have suggested about the way we are setting it

Sir David Clementi and the Joint Committee so ably chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, all made these valid points about what we are seeking to do.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07051549000157"></a>We have spoken about examples in Australia. The German example is very interesting and I am very grateful to the noble Lord. I was handed earlier a copy of the German Bill for the noble Lord. The trouble is that it is in German and I am not sure how useful it will be to either the noble Lord or me. The noble Lord&#146;s explanation of what is in the legislation is right. He will know about one of the interesting aspects of what is happening in Germany. In its latest report, the Monopolies Commission, which is a separate, independent advisory board set up under German competition law, dedicated a chapter to the regulation of the professional services in general. It considered four professions, of which legal services was one, and recommended wide-scale reform. It also proposed that non-lawyers be allowed to invest by becoming shareholders in law firms. I am not saying that that suggestion has been accepted by the German Government, but I understand that it will go to the Ministry of Economics, which will respond to itin whatever way it wishes. What is happening in Germany is an interesting development. There is an increasing look across legal services in different countries to see how best to provide them to give high-quality services and to protect the profession.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07051549000158"></a>We agreed on Report that it was important to monitor carefully what happened with alternative business structures and agreed an amendmentbased on what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, recommended, both in Committee and in discussions with me outside the Committee, might be an appropriate thing to do. We agree that it is important to monitor carefully and to come back to Parliament with the result of that monitoring to demonstrate how well it is working.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07051549000159"></a>But we have all the information that there is tobe had. As I have indicated, we have spoken with colleagues in other countries; we are watching what the Monopolies Commission is saying and the legislation in Germany; I have referred to Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner for the European Union, who is also very interested in what we are doing on legal services; and, as noble Lords know, I have spoken in Brussels about what we are seeking to do. There is a huge amount of interest.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07051549000160"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, commented that we are doing this first. I agree. This is because that is what we do; we look at what needs to be developed and, following the great tradition of the way in which Britain has always operated, we think forward about what kind of services we provide.

It is not about destroying that; it is about providing new opportunities that will benefit the legal professions and consumers. As I said, we will do that in a measured way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07051549000162"></a>I must reject the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, because we cannot provide more information, so we simply would not do anything, which is not what I wish to see happen. However, we will ensure that implementation is done in a measured way that enables both Houses of Parliament to see how well it is going. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="07051549000163"></a><b><a name="70515-0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07051549000670"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness. She rejected our amendment on the basis that it would rank the objectives in Clause 1. In my submission, that is not so. All the amendment requires the licensor to do is make a proper investigation of the access to justice implications. Once that investigation is complete, it is then appropriate for the licensor to measure whatever conclusions he has preliminarily reached against all eight objectives, including access to justice, not giving special weight to any one. The obligation in our amendment is to investigate, not to distort, the weighting system.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07051549000164"></a>Even if I am wrong about that, there are, as I said in my opening remarks, many examples of legislation and government guidance where weights are recorded by public authorities. There is no general principle, like equality under the law, that each ingredient fed into a final policy decision should have equal weight. On the contrary, the rule for Governments is discretion. For both those reasons, I am sad to have to tell the noble Baroness that I do not accept the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07051549000165"></a>The noble Baroness talked about Part 5 leading the way in the international community, but it is clear that, in so far as Germany is part of the international community, the Government&#146;s approach has not resonated there. That comes out very clearly fromDr Dombek&#146;s reply to the noble Lord, Lord Neillof Bladen. The German Parliament rejected the equivalent of Part 5 in Germany because, asDr Dombek said, it regarded it as,</p>
<ul><a name="07051549000202"></a>&#147;a threat to the independence of the lawyer&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07051549000181"></a>We have not taken that position in our debate here, but I heard with great interest the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, who, if he did not say so in terms, certainly implied that that wouldbe one of the dangers of implementing Part 5 immediately, without looking at it very carefully beforehand.</p>

<a name="70515-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07051549000166"></a>The noble Baroness is well aware that I do not accept the reasons why the Government oppose my amendment; therefore, I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07051563000017"></a>At Report, not only did we not find an amendment to that effect tabled by the Government but the Minister gave us a number of reasons why an affirmative resolution was not the correct approach. Of those reasons, two were predominant. We were told, first, that an affirmative resolution would take up too much parliamentary time and, secondly, that it was decreasingly the Government&#146;s habit to take this approach.</p>

<a name="70515-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07051563000018"></a>As the Minister is aware, I took issue with both those suggestions. On the first point, the amount of parliamentary time devoted to affirmative resolutions in your Lordships' House is not very demanding. Secondly, far from the practice of delegated measures of this nature falling out of fashion, Governments&#151;and I do not exclude the previous Conservative Government from this criticism&#151;have increasingly relied on the skeleton Bill as an instrument of legislation. So I was not only unconvinced by the Minister&#146;s reasons but in any case felt that they were wholly beside the point. Here we are faced with exactly the situation that we were faced with onthe first amendment tabled this afternoon. The Government had given a commitment to your Lordships' House and, in my submission, they should respect the convention and put the undertaking about an affirmative resolution in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

It is absolutely crucial that the standing of the legal profession should be independent of government and seen to be independent of government. That is strictly related to the merits of this amendment. I do not want to take up the time of the House because surely it is obvious that here we are concerned with a matter of public interest. The service&#146;s exports are worth more than &#163;2 billion a year. The amendment is relevant to quality and the standing of the profession. It would act as a safeguard.

I said that I would take it away. In Committee, I said that it would be a way of giving more confidence to your Lordships&#146; House. My difficulty is that I was unable to pursue the matter for two reasons. One is that it is my responsibility to look carefully at what the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee says.

This powerful committee of your Lordships&#146; House&#151;I am grateful to see the chairman of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in his place&#151;does not require us to do that.

That is what I was trying to say. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee submits its reports to the House but it is for the House to decide the relevant matter. This afternoon noble Lords may decide to change what the committee has suggested and to vote on this amendment, if they wish. However, I was making the point that the Government always listen carefully to the committee and take its views very seriously. Certainly that is my view as a Minister responsible for a number of Bills on which the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has commented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07051563000028"></a>I am not in a position to change from the negative to the affirmative procedure.

I would commend having the right level of primary legislation and the ability to amend it to reflect circumstances&#151;of which this Bill is a good example&#151;because there will be changes.</p>

The Lord Chancellor is given the power to expand or contract the size of the Legal Services Board. This is another part of the Bill that goes to the heart of the independence of the board.</p>

<a name="70515-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07051563000035"></a>It is now stated in the Bill that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor must havethe concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice on the appointment and dismissal of the chairman and members of the board. We have not sought that kind of guarantee in relation to Schedule 1(3) because we felt that the reasons given by the noble Baroness for the retention of that power and the commitment toan affirmative resolution were enough. Without the affirmative resolution, the Government are given dangerously uncontrolled power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07051563000036"></a>However, the core issue is the one to which I referred in Amendment No. 1. The statement was made on the face of the Bill. As a consequence, noble Lords on both the official Opposition and Liberal Democrat Benches did not table amendments to this part of the Bill which they otherwise would have tabled. Although I shall not press this amendment to a vote, I say again to the noble Baroness: just think of the convention on undertakings given by Ministerson the Floor of the House. When the Bill reaches another place, I suggest that the correct thing to do would be for the Government to put the requirement for an affirmative resolution in the Bill.

Paragraph 4 of the scheme gives the administrator considerable flexibility in the treatment of multiple dwellings&#151;rightly so, in my view. After all, the appropriate method of dealing with one eligible person in a block of 100 flats may be quite different from the way that one would deal with an old people&#146;s home with eight residents, all of whom were eligible for assistance.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07051563000065"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister could elaborate a little on how he sees the administrator using his powers. For example, in view of the difficulties that may be encountered with a set-top aerial of the type described in sub-paragraphs 2(6) and (7) of Schedule 3 of the scheme, can the Minister inform the House of the types of assistance that an administrator would be able to provide via a notification under paragraph (2)(b) of Clause 17 of the scheme? As already suggested, it would be of great assistance to the House to have an indication of how far the administrator would be able to go in order to help this category of eligible person. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07051563000067"></a>Of course, the noble Lord has already had one attempt at this amendment. He raised it in Grand Committee as a probing amendment to elicit what help would be given to people who accessed television through a communal TV system. During that debate, he referred to the fact that the Bill makes no provision for people in flats or other types of dwelling that may be affected by a failure to upgrade communal TV systems. It will be recognised that the Bill deals entirely with access to DWP and other data necessary for the smooth and efficient administration of the digital switchover help scheme. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is no mention of the issue that the noble Lord raises.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07051563000068"></a>The noble Lord raised several points, to which I should like to respond. I should like to set out in more detail the challenges of ensuring that communal TV systems are upgraded and the implications of no action being taken. Communal TV aerial systems have been with us since the 1960s and were originally installed to overcome difficulties with individual reception; for example, where a dwelling had no access to the roof for an outside aerial or a poor line of sight to the transmitter.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07051563000069"></a>There is no statutory requirement for landlords to provide access to communal TV systems. There may well be obligations under a lease, tenancy agreement or contract for the upkeep of the system. But, like other communal services, such as lifts, roofs, and so on, the costs of maintenance will normally be covered by rent and service charges, so will be allowablefor housing benefit. Changes to housing benefit regulations from 1 April clarified the position,  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_159"></a><b>15 May 2007 : Column 159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>making it clear that housing benefit covers all types of communal TV system upgrades where system costs can be separated from subscription charges.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07051563000070"></a>We estimate that as many as 4 million homes may have access to a communal TV system&#151;the majority of properties served, of course, are flats. Communal TV systems are mainly found in medium and large-scale blocks of purpose-built flats. It will be no surprise to the House that almost half of London's households are flats, maisonettes or apartments. Of these, a third comprises purpose-built flats and 14 per cent are part of a converted or shared house. Of the 20 districts with the highest proportion of flats, maisonettes or apartments, 18 are in London. Around 40 per cent of private sector flats, excluding leasehold properties, are also in London.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07051563000071"></a>The majority of communal systems in the UK were originally installed to work with analogue and were designed to carry only four or five televisions. They will need some attention if they are to convey the full range of digital services after switchover. In March 2006, the Digital Television Group&#151;the industry standards body for digital TV&#151;carried out work for the DTI to look in detail at the types of problems that uninspected systems might encounter. The report by the group found that the main problem was likely to be the poor performance of many analogue systems in handling digital signals, with insufficient signal passed through the system to ensure a reliable service.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07051563000072"></a>The Digital Television Group report found that at switchover, some existing systems may provide access to limited digital services while others may perform adequately because of the increase in power levels and within the aerial group transmissions. But the age and condition of existing systems is an important factor in determining how well uninspected systems perform post-switchover. It is important to bear in mindthat industry guidance recommends that system components are replaced every 10 years.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07051563000073"></a>The Government&#146;s approach since 2005 has been to ensure that there is a strong and effective evidence base and to ensure that all landlords&#151;both social and private sector landlords&#151;and residents are aware of the issue and take action to upgrade communal TV systems where appropriate. In January 2007, my department published research carried out by the British Market Research Bureau into actions taken by social landlords, local authorities, ALMOs and housing associations. The research found that 32 per cent of social landlords were in the process of completing the upgrade of all affected properties, although a further 18 per cent had made a significant start and were well on their way to completing by switchover. Around half reported little progress.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07051563000074"></a>If we look at national trends in individual households, more than 77 per cent of households have converted at least one TV set to digital, and take-up is still growing strongly. Recent data from the Digital UK/Ofcom tracker survey, which interviews around 2,000 households each quarter, show that take-up of digital TV for people living in flats is more or less in line with the general population at around 75 per cent. There are a number of factors involved,  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_160"></a><b>15 May 2007 : Column 160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but the differences between the two surveys are most likely to be due to an increasing number of residents making their own arrangements for receiving digital TV&#151;for example by satellite&#151;or residents using communal TV systems that have not been checked and which convey some digital services.</p>

<a name="70515-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07051563000075"></a>Of course, we recognise that we need to ensure that more work needs to be done to establish the full picture, but it appears that the apparent slowness of landlords to take active steps is not constraining digital television take-up. That is why we think that progress is being made, but the noble Lord was right to identify that anxiety. However, it is clear that, first, people want to avail themselves of the advantages that digital brings; and, secondly, that through the information flows which are circulating around the country people are becoming increasingly aware that digital is the system of the future and that analogue will be switched off. They are therefore making arrangements accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07051563000076"></a>The help scheme will not cover communal TV systems. That must be the landlord&#146;s responsibility&#151;that is where the obligation lies. However, the scheme will take all reasonable steps to ensure a continuityof reception at switchover and will try to connect toa communal system. At switchover, the power of transmission will be increased. This should give the many flat dwellers an ability to receive digital services on indoor aerials, even if the landlord has not adopted their system. We have evidence of the extent to which the nation is already well aware of the need to switch to digital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07051563000077"></a>The noble Lord has identified an issue relating to communal provision. That is the responsibility of the landlord, but we are optimistic on two counts: that landlords will see it in their interest to provide these services to their tenants; and, secondly, that the strength of the signal may mean that in any case the flat dweller is not dependent on what the landlord provides. I hope that that explanation has reassured the noble Lord and that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07051563000081"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for sending me a copy of the scheme agreement between the DCMS and the BBC. It is extremely helpful and will enable us to have a more useful debate today. My amendment attempts to improve the parliamentary scrutiny that will be necessary in the process.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07051563000082"></a>The Bill allows the Government to make the BBC an arm of the Department of Social Security because it gives the BBC an additional &#163;600 million in licence fee, which the BBC will give to those who need help during the switchover. Such schemes would normally be run by the department and not by the BBC. While the BBC has schemes which help those who are receiving a pension, it has never before gone into areas relating to this scheme. It neither has the resources to do so, nor does it have the competence to do it. That is not its own fault&#151;it has never had to do this before. As a result, the BBC will sub-contract the whole operation to a company to be owned 51 per cent by the BBC and 49 per cent by a mystery bidder who will be responsible for processing and handing out the money.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07051563000083"></a>In normal circumstances, if the Government intended to spend &#163;600 million, there would be parliamentary scrutiny, first, of the rules of eligibility; secondly, of the management of the scheme; and, thirdly, scrutiny of whether it has succeeded. However, Parliament has no chance to debate these rules. The Government have published them, and the Minister was kind enough to put Report off until the agreement was published, but nowhere during this process can we debate them. If there is no amendment to the Bill, the other place will have no chance to debate whether the rules are fair or the criteria, the cost, the implementation or anything else. This is the only chance we have to raise this. That is wrong; there should be scrutiny to see whether the Government have the rules right. My amendment does that.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07051563000084"></a>To reinforce my point, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the scheme agreement. On page 6,Clause 8(1)(b)(i) states:</p>
<ul><a name="07051563000319"></a>&#147;at the relevant time he is entitled to disability living allowance, attendance allowance, constant attendance allowance, or mobility supplement&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000215"></a>We all know&#151;especially those of us who spent some time in the Department of Social Security&#151;that rules and benefits change. They may change before this comes into place&#151;maybe even during it&#151;and, therefore, the scheme agreement will probably have to be amended.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07051563000085"></a>While that is not certain, if one moves on topage 21 of the scheme agreement, it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"></a><a name="07051563000304"></a>&#147;The provisions of this Scheme are conditional on no decision or judgement being made by a competent body in relation to any provision of the EC Treaty or legislation based upon the EC Treaty (&#147;EC law&#148;) in respect of the Scheme which has the direct or indirect effect of preventing or obstructing the operation or funding of the Scheme&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000216"></a>I think that, in simple language, that means the department has not got a clue whether this scheme is  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_162"></a><b>15 May 2007 : Column 162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legal under EU law. We have seen that in some of the Government&#146;s other attempts; for example, privatising the Tote. They put forward a very good scheme, that would have benefited racing, but it was immediately thrown out by Brussels and the whole thing is in total disarray. Quite clearly, the department does not know whether this scheme is legal, and it has not been tested properly in Brussels. The scheme agreement goes on to describe that it would not be a breach and how the Secretary of State can change it.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07051563000086"></a>Page 27 states that the BBC Trust will:</p>
<ul><a name="07051563000320"></a>&#147;ensure that the Scheme is operated in a way that will provide value for money for licence fee payers and will invite the NAO to review the operation of the Scheme at least biennially&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000217"></a>That is every two years, which seems to be not quite enough, although we may discuss that in greater detail on a forthcoming amendment.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07051563000087"></a>Finally, page 26 states:</p>
<ul><a name="07051563000321"></a>&#147;the Secretary of State may amend the Scheme in such a way she considers necessary to ensure that the Scheme complies with competition law and the law governing State Aids, but only after complying with the provisions of this paragraph&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000218"></a>It then, in effect, goes on to provide that if there is any change in the law, whether EU law or the law of this country, this scheme can be changed. Therefore, at any moment, the Government can come along and say to the BBC, &#147;We&#146;ve changed our minds. It&#146;s costing too much&#148;. We know that the Government have a complication about that, because, when we asked how they arrived at the figure of &#163;600 million, the Minister was kind enough to write to me and say: </p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96"></a><a name="07051563000305"></a>&#147;We cannot give more details on the breakdown of costs at this stage ... as this could affect future discussions with potential bidders and the ability of the contracting authority to secure value for money&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000219"></a>That is a nice argument, usually used by government departments when they are unsure of their figures.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07051563000088"></a>At any moment, the Government can come along and say, &#147;We&#146;ve got the costs wrong&#148;. Although the Treasury has agreed that should the BBC spendmore than &#163;600 million, it will make an additional payment, we know that, at the end of the day, the Government will change the scheme. The amount of money could be &#163;600 million or &#163;800 million; we do not know. There is no opportunity for Parliament to debate, amend or have any part in this. There is no oversight or control. It is up to an agreement that the Secretary of State can, in effect, impose upon the BBC Trust, which will be responsible for running this scheme. That is wrong; there should be accountability. I thought this Government believed in accountability. My amendment would ensure that during the operation the Secretary of State must come to Parliament and explain what she is doing and how she is accountable for what we now know is taxpayers&#146; money because the licence fee is now a tax.

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07051563000090"></a>What other circumstances do the Government envisage? Are these the only set of circumstances in which the Government envisage changing the scheme, or are there others? That is very important. I am less concerned about the precise cost, but I am very concerned about the accountability points that the noble Viscount has made. I am concerned above all to know, if we are holding in our hands what purportsto be the digital switchover help scheme that will be effected, in what circumstances it can or will be changed.

He has taken full advantage ofthe publication of the scheme, but I am not surethat this amendment is adroit enough to meet his requirements. I listened fairly carefully to what has been said; I have also looked at the amendment. It would require the Secretary of State to publish a report on the likely costs attributable to the DWP and other public providers of information under the Bill. That seems to be a recipe for additional and unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07051563000093"></a>The DWP is not required to provide a report for data-sharing gateways other than in relation to the disclosure of information. Therefore, I am not sure why it should be required to do so with regard to this information, unless the noble Viscount is indicating that he would like the amendment drafted slightly differently so that it identifies the BBC as the point at issue.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07051563000094"></a>Clause 41 of the BBC agreement requires the BBC Trust to report to the Secretary of State annually on what the BBC has done in complying with its various obligations under the help scheme. The help scheme agreement makes it clear that that report must contain information about the operation of the scheme, including in particular information aboutthe performance indicators mentioned and the performance of the administrators.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07051563000095"></a>I recognise that the BBC Trust&#146;s report covers only the BBC&#146;s activities and not the DWP&#146;s, but we can certainly refute any suggestion that the BBC isnot answerable to this position. Therefore, the amendment throws the whole weight on the DWP as needing to be more in the open. I persist in my point that we do not ask the DWP to produce similar reports for other data-sharing gateways, and I am not sure that the case has been made for this one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07051563000096"></a>We certainly intend that the costs will be treated as scheme costs and borne by the administrator, rather than the DWP. They will fall within the budget set for the scheme and the reports produced by the trust. As noble Lords have said, details of the arrangements have still to be agreed. We have not completed that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07051563000097"></a>In Committee, I was pressed to delay Report until we had published the help scheme, which we have, so the broad contours within which we are working are quite clear. Not every &#145;i&#146; has been dotted nor &#145;t&#146; been crossed about administration, but our current work suggests that costs associated with information sharing for the help scheme will be modest. We do not expect them to be more than &#163;10 million for the lifetime of the scheme. That is because the data will be drawn from existing DWP infrastructure, which does not require much adaptation to facilitate the physical sharing of data for the help scheme.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07051563000098"></a>I freely acknowledge that I do not have full documentation on operational details, but I can respond to the amendment by indicating that the DWP is not involved in significant costs for the scheme. Secondly, the DWP is not asked for that information in any other context; I am not sure why it should be here. I emphasise that the BBC will, in its annual report to Parliament, have to give full details of how the scheme is being operated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07051563000099"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, laid the rather formidable charge that we do not know what on Earth we are doing about the European Commission&#146;s attitude to the Bill. Let me allay the noble Viscount&#146;s anxieties by saying that we have done some work in that area. We think that the scheme will probably be defined as a state aid and will therefore need to be notified to the Commission, but we regard it as certain to be judged as compatible with the common market under provisions of the treaty of Rome dealing with assistance of a social character. That is what the scheme is about.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07051563000100"></a>Platform neutrality is of particular importance in successfully bringing an aid within that exemption. We do not anticipate that causing a delay to implementation. There is a later amendment from the noble Viscount about platform neutrality, to which I hope I shall be able to respond positively, but I trailat this stage the fact that, because of those two considerations, we think that we will be totally compatible with Brussels rules on these matters.</p>

I understand what the noble Viscount says about details, but it will be recognised that the broad structure of the scheme is well in line with the consensus of Parliament on what help there should be for those for whom it is intended. If the noble Viscount will forgive me, I must address my remarks to his amendment and to his extremely interesting questions, rather than to him, but on his very signal point about the European Community I assure him that we are confident of our position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07051563000103"></a>The noble Viscount asked me earlier whether the Secretary of State can arbitrarily change the scheme, but I did not have time to reply before he asked me another searching question. Under Schedule 2(4), the Secretary of State has a right to change the scheme, albeit in very limited circumstances; namely, where the scheme is operated in a way that is incompatible with EU law. Any other changes would need to be made by agreement. We would certainly need to make the scheme compatible with European law. That is regular. We do not think that we will have to make any changes at all, except on the extreme margins, because the scheme&#146;s broad concept falls withinthe criteria laid down by Brussels. I hope that that satisfies the noble Viscount, although I see that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is quite irrepressible, even on Report.</p>

I add my thanks to those of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, to the Minister for making sure that we are debating the Bill on Report with the scheme in our hands. Of course, it has considerable drawbacks for the Minister who can be interrogated on the detail of the scheme during the debate. I am sure that there are downsides from his point of view, but it is extremely helpful for noble Lords to make sure that there is a satisfactory scheme and that we understand what its impact will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07051563000115"></a>This amendment, which I put down in Grand Committee, is a marker designed to show that we still do not believe that the Government have made the case for BBC licence fee payers paying for digital switchover. Why they should pay &#163;600 million from the licence fee, and not the general taxpayer, still eludes us. I rather took that impression from what the  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_167"></a><b>15 May 2007 : Column 167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Viscount, Lord Astor, had to say as well. The way in which the scheme is constructed makes it clear that the BBC, effectively, is unnecessary, except for paying the bill. Nearly everything in terms of the project can be done by the contractor. In fact, the BBC&#146;s press release seems to make a big distinction between policy and project. I shall be asking the Minister more about that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07051563000116"></a>All that the BBC seems to be there for is to pay money to the contractor. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Davies, said that the BBC had to do this because broadcasting technology had changed. Moreover, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_98"></a><a name="07051563000307"></a>&#147;The help scheme will ... be most effective if it is fully integrated with the wider programme of work, which is best done by linking it with the wider responsibilities of the BBC for building digital Britain set out in the new BBC charter and agreement&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/3/07; col.

</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000221"></a>That is rather circular: it is more or less saying that it is because the Government have decided that that is what should be done. I do not think that there was any real, rational argument behind that.</p>

<a name="70515-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07051563000117"></a>It was interesting to hear what the Minister had to say about the rationale for the scheme given to the EU. We have always argued that this is a social assistance programme and that it is appropriate for the Government to pay for it, not the BBC. What argument is being made to the EU in order to get this through the competition authorities? It is &#147;assistance of a social character&#148;&#151;I took down the Minister&#146;s words. I believe that the logic is flawed. I do not believe that I will be able to persuade the Government, especially not with an agreement between the BBC and the DCMS in my hand. It would be only realistic to accept that, but I want the Minister to know that in my view the arguments have not been made correctly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07051563000118"></a>It would be useful for the Minister to explain why there is this distinction between the policy review group and the project board. Certainly to the outside, uninitiated observer, that is not at all clear. So there is that confusion and, even more peculiar, in the lightof that confusion the BBC Trust is set up in this agreement as the adjudicator to decide what functions properly fall on the board side or on the policy side. Again, that is a very peculiar way of doing things. Why is there not an integrated way of doing it? If the BBC is genuinely part of this operation and not simply a pass through to the contractor, why are not the board and the policy review group combined? I think we would all like to know a great deal more about that side of things from the Minister. I begto move.</p>

It was as if we had not had the best part of several years debating the renewalof the BBC charter and this dimension being an important part of it. Not surprisingly for a far-sighted Government, it would have been quite extraordinary if digital switchover had not formed part and parcel of the debates at that time.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07051563000120"></a>I am in a position where, on an issue of quite fundamental principle, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is inviting me to reiterate the government arguments which sustained our position in relation to the charter of the BBC, the situation in relation to the licence fee, the construction of the Bill and the general debate in our community about how we face up to the technological future which beckons with digital opportunities. Believe it or not, I have nothing fresh to say about that.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07051563000121"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, very kindly said that he is unlikely to persuade me. He is absolutely right. But I am as sharp as he is and I think I am unlikely to persuade him. After all, he has just expressed to me why I am going to fail yet again. But if I am obliged to reiterate the arguments, perhaps I may do so in the briefest terms possible in order not to fill the House with reiterative boredom.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07051563000122"></a>We regard digital switchover as a highly significant event in television broadcasting. It will bring a &#147;digital-only&#148; world, with a hugely increased choice for viewers, and there will be a need for help. This is a fundamental change in broadcasting technologyand, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, will recognise, switching off a signal which people at the present time are equipped to receive but will not be unless provision is made in the not-too-distant future, will be a dramatic act. The Government needed to think about this very carefully indeed. Having thought about the implications and how we would deal with them, the help necessary for those people in our community who would need it, and how we would organise the process, we reached the decision that the country&#146;s significant broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation, should take responsibility for this massive change in broadcasting technology.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07051563000123"></a>We first proposed way back in March 2005 that the BBC should be responsible for helping to establish and fund the help scheme. I recognise what the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is saying. He is not convinced by the argument that the BBC should be at the centre of this scheme. We have enumerated on many occasions the reasons for the principled position of the Government on this issue and the noble Lord rightly accepted that we are unlikely to change our minds. The Government are very strong in their commitment to such fundamental principles and rarely, if ever, change their mind. They would change it only when circumstances require flexibility. In this instance, we are committed to the principle that we have reiterated on many occasion.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07051563000124"></a>The noble Lord has recognised that we have now gone a long way down the road of implementing the principle by the agreement with the BBC on the help scheme. I recognise his valiant efforts and I am impressed by his arguments. They are strong, but not as strong as the Government&#146;s.</p>

Essentially, it is a question of where the buck stops. This division of responsibility appears extraordinarily artificial. Why has it been set up in that way and who has overall responsibility?</p>

<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="07051563000126"></a><b><a name="70515-0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07051563000369"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, the Government, of course, are responsible for the overall policy but the BBC is responsible for ensuring thatthe assistance is delivered in accordance with the agreement which has been assigned and is now before us. The project board and policy review group are separate in order to reflect the distinction. The review group is advisory, not executive; and the project board is the executive board. They are merely the mechanics by which the scheme will be operated. As to the BBC fulfilling its obligations under this scheme, as I indicated earlier, the BBC is not free from scrutiny in Parliament and, in its annual report, it will be expected to comment on the implementation of the scheme.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07051563000127"></a>So those are the broad responsibilities of the BBC and I hope the noble Lord will recognise that they are consistent with a carefully thought-out obligation on the BBC, a principle on which we stand and of which, I recognise, he remains critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07051563000129"></a>I am not only critical but sceptical. I think the reason for having a policy review group and a project board is extremely unclear. Although the BBC&#146;s press release claims it is a precondition for its agreement, with the Government responsible for policy and the BBC for delivery of the scheme, it is not a very clear situation. The BBC Trust will act as a kind of referee and so the BBC will decide whether something is policy or whether it is a part of the project, which again is peculiar.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07051563000130"></a>No doubt we will see how the whole thing pans out and whether the agreement works in the way it is intended to, as stated by the Minister. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07051563000134"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment also came up in Grand Committee. It would ensure that those entitled to the help scheme could still receive help if they moved to an area that had completed digital switchover from one that had not yet begun the process. As I explained in Grand Committee, we are concerned that people who are eligible for the scheme could miss out on help just because they have moved or are moving to a new area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07051563000135"></a>I gave the illustration of a partially sighted student who is eligible for help in his university town, where switchover has not yet taken place, but who after graduating gets a job in a town that has completed digital switchover. That student might well fall between the cracks, which would be an unfortunate state of affairs.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07051563000136"></a>The amendment is an attempt to seek assurance about such circumstances. In Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, accepted the philosophy behind it. He said that, in developing the help scheme, the Government wanted to simplify the basic eligibility rules as far as possible, bearing in mind the complexity that can quickly surround social security benefits. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07051563000309"></a>&#147;an eligibility window needs to be tied to the event in each switchover region ... Following discussions with the consumer expert group, we have opted for a date one month after BBC1 in analogue disappears&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/3/07; col. GC 257.]</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000222"></a>That means that people meeting the eligibility criteria but moving into an area after that date will not qualify. The Minister said that they would need to make their own arrangements.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07051563000137"></a>The Minister talked about voluntary networks to be set up by Digital UK and so on. He said that the Government believed that the priority should be to help those affected at the point of switchover rather than people moving into an area subsequently. That was the logic of the Minister&#146;s reply. However, at the end of his response, he acknowledged the harshness of the absolute cut-off point. He said that the amendment,</p>
<ul><a name="07051563000310"></a>&#147;raises some interesting points that we want to reflect on&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/3/07; col. GC 259.]</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000138"></a>I took some comfort from what the Minister said; therefore, I was extremely surprised to see that the scheme contains no flexibility. The cut-off point is one month, as originally stated. That is disappointing. I hope that the Minister has further comments and comfort to give to those who might be affected, who would fall between the cracks and be unable to get assistance in these circumstances. I beg to move.</p>

I recognise his motivation: as he graphically said, people might fall between the cracks and would not receive help. He is concerned that people should be covered as far as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07051563000140"></a>We listened carefully in Committee but, as we said then, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, ought not to exaggerate the number of people in the categories to which he refers. The help scheme is restricted; there will not be a huge number of eligible people. He talked about people moving to a new area after switchover schemes had been completed; but the elderly, for example, have a much lower propensity to move than the rest of the population, for the obvious reasons of their emotional commitment to their home and the disturbance involved in moving. We do not see the potential for the massive social problem that there might be if the scheme applied to the whole population.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07051563000141"></a>The noble Lord will also appreciate the problems arising as a result of the technological basis of the scheme. The help scheme will be implemented on a

The regions will follow the order of switchover. It is not possible to organise the scheme on a basis other than seriatim across the country, as it will take several years to complete. We have tried, therefore, to tie the eligibility period to switchover in each ITV region. In a process that lasts several years, we could not make a more elastic commitment.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07051563000142"></a>The help scheme agreement sets out that the eligibility period begins eight months before the first analogue services in a region cease and extends until one month after the final analogue transmitters in the region are switched off. We have not opted for a single qualifying date in each region, such as six months before switchover; although that would be simpler, it would exclude people who began receiving the qualifying disability benefits some months before switchover. We are mindful of the noble Lord&#146;s point that the scheme should be flexible. The one-month run-on beyond switchover is also important to ensure that people can claim for a short period once analogue services disappear. We recognise that some people will slip through the net, as the noble Lord suggested. The final date on which applications from eligible households will be accepted will be one month after switchover.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07051563000143"></a>Someone moving to a converted area from a region that has not yet converted to digital will not qualify for the help scheme. They will need to make their own arrangements. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, says that that is unfair. As in Committee, he gave examples of what he regarded as its unfairness. However, we will require the scheme operator to have in place infrastructure long after switchover occurs in any one region. It is a big operation and the caravan moves on. Switchover will take place by ITV area. The process will take place over a set period and then the whole operation will move to the next region, as we have clearly identified.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07051563000144"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, says that in a few residual cases&#151;we maintain that there are likely to be few&#151;there should be a continuing function in the region that has already completed the switchover. The cost of that would be significant, and we do not think that it is merited by the likely size of the problem.</p>

<a name="70515-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07051563000145"></a>I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, says and understand his motivation. In an ideal world we would like people to be aware of the system from the day it starts and to be eligible for help at any stage during the process. Indeed, the noble Lord would prefer an extended period after completion to mop up what is left. We live in the real world. This is a big operation, and the vast majority of people will know well in advance that switchover is to occur. They will have time to apply for help and to regularise their position. There is a period beyond actual switchover when they can still apply. It is unrealistic, however, for us to have an entirely open-ended situation. The costs of that would be huge, and we do not believe they are merited by the numbers that are likely to be involved. This is a case where the noble Lord&#146;s principles have to meet the real world. I know that always hurts him,

I am just disappointed, and rather sad, that further consideration could not have been given to the question of &#147;mopping up&#148;, as the Minister said. It is a matter of what is practical and cost-effective. A month seems to be unduly short, but I have no doubt that it will be the Minister and his colleagues at the DCMS who will bear the wrath of the public if there are problems with that cut-off date.

Amendment No. 9 would place a duty on the BBC to provide the National Audit Office with accounts in order for the NAO to scrutinise them and publish an annual report onthe expenditure incurred in the course of disclosing information under the Act. The amendment has been redrafted, taking into account the fact that it would be undesirable to place a statutory duty on the NAO to report on a specific item.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07051563000151"></a>The new Amendment No. 10 would enable the National Audit Office to investigate the BBC&#146;s expenditure under the disclosure of information in the scheme. Importantly, the amendment gives the NAO the power to insist on being given the relevant information. It would have been preferable to be able to require a report on the cost of the scheme itself; however, as the Bill is drafted, that is not possible. Paragraph 5(c) of Schedule 2B of the help scheme goes some way towards that, though I note that there is no requirement or encouragement for the NAO to make available a report. Will that provision stay in the scheme if the scheme is revised?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07051563000152"></a>My noble friend Lord Astor has highlighted on a previous occasion the inconsistency of exempting the BBC in general from scrutiny by the National Audit Office, as that might compromise editorial independence, and the compulsory scrutiny by the NAO of the BBC World Service. Spending &#163;600 million to help the disadvantaged has nothing to do with editorial independence, and not a lot to do with broadcasting. As has been said today and on several previous occasions,

It would be quite wrong for the taxpayer to take the obligation and not have the corresponding benefit if costs are below expectation. I beg to move.</p>

Since then, my noble friend Lord Howard has put forward Amendment No. 10, which is much superior to Amendment No. 9, but as they are a group we can debate them together. I realise, having received a letter from the Minister, that one cannot command the National Audit Office to do something; one can only prod, advise or otherwise encourage it, and that is what Amendment No. 10 does. This is important. Subsection 5(c) of Schedule 2B of the agreement between the Secretary of State and the BBC, which mentions the NAO, does not go far enough. My noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 10 goes further. For all the reasons we talked about on the previous amendment, we must remember that although it is licence fee money, the licence fee is a tax and this is taxpayers&#146; money. It should therefore be scrutinised. I support my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

It has always been my view that the speed at which people are moving to the digital switchover and the way in which the cost of technology is constantly being driven down mean that there probably will be a surplus. If this money is coming out of the licence fee, there is only one place it can go back to if there is a surplus, and that is to the BBC. It cannot somehow be given out to the taxpayer in any other way. That would beto the benefit of the BBC, as it could then use any surplus to improve its programmes.</p>

The logic of what he said in Grand Committee was entirely consistent both with the principle of the previous amendment and with this one. The NAO genuinely seems to have a role to play, in terms of value for money, in this project with which the BBC is entrusted. I am sure the Minister has looked back on what was said, but, in everything but name, this is something that it would be rightand proper for the NAO to carry out. The logic ofthe Minister&#146;s previous speech seems to have been directed towards that.</p>

There is an issue of principle here: the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and some other noble Lords were very keen that the National Audit Office should have pretty well unhindered access to the BBC. We resisted that view at the time of the Broadcasting Bill, we resisted it with regard to the arguments about the charter renewal, and we are going to resist it now. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07051563000159"></a>On principle, we do not think that the National Audit Office should have unhindered access to the BBC because we do not think that that is the way in which the BBC should be accountable to the nation. But clause 79 of the BBC agreement requires the trust to examine the value for money achieved by the BBC in the use of public funds and gives the National Audit Office a key role in contributing to the fulfilment of that obligation. The trust is required to discuss regularly with the Comptroller and Auditor General the scope of its value-for-money audit programme and which individual reviews within that programme would be especially suited to the National Audit Office. The trust must then make necessary arrangements with the National Audit Office or with suitable organisations to carry out individual value-for-money reviews in accordance with the audit programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07051563000160"></a>I understand the pressure for the National Audit Office to have a stronger role. I have listened to those arguments enough in the past, and they have some merit. We have had those debates of principle and they have been settled in far more significant fora than the debate on this Bill, which is limited to a help scheme for digital switchover. We agree that robust arrangements are necessary to guarantee that the right amount of help goes to the right people and we believe that the Bill provides for them.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07051563000161"></a>Clause 41 of the BBC agreement already makes provision for the BBC to publish an annual report about its switchover-related activities, which will include the help scheme. Schedule 2 paragraph 5 of the help scheme agreement deals with value for money and makes it clear that it is the responsibility of the trust to secure value for money in the BBC&#146;s operation of the help scheme. Schedule 2 paragraph 7 of the help scheme agreement requires the BBC to prepare annual accounts, which will of course be published and audited independently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07051563000162"></a>Perhaps I can give the House some solace. The BBC trust has already initiated discussions with the National Audit Office about the arrangementsfor reviewing the value for money of the BBC&#146;s implementation of the help scheme. Amendments to the Bill are not the right way to structure these arrangements. Our view is that arrangements for National Audit Office value-for-money scrutiny of the BBC need to work within the current framework of its regular involvement, as set out in the BBC charter and BBC agreement, about which the House had many long hours of useful debate.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07051563000163"></a>In addition, the National Audit Office may consider the implications of the continuing rolefor the DCMS in relation to determining scheme policy under clause 2 of the scheme agreement. The agreement in no way affects the National AuditOffice right to scrutinise the department&#146;s ongoing responsibilities for the help scheme.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07051563000164"></a>The National Audit Office will play its part within the framework of its responsibilities with regard to the scheme. The amendments would act as a relatively modest Trojan horse but let us remember that the Trojan horse, while not that huge, brought disaster to one of the most significant cities in that part of the world. It is a Trojan horse to indicate that the way in which the BBC should be accountable is through the National Audit Office, and I have no doubt that if noble Lords can find a way, they will bring Ofcom into the frame again, and we will go back over all the other debates in principle that we have had over the past three or four years. I hope that we will not do that today. We have a robust framework in place; the National Audit Office has its limited part to play in that, but the amendments are a considerable step too far. I hope that the noble Lord will accept the argument and withdraw the amendment.</p>

If it were not so, I have not the slightest doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, several supporters from the Back Benches and the redoubtable noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, would be on their feet, seriatim or even together, to attack the Government for having fallen foul of the views of the Delegated Powersand Regulatory Reform Committee and its critical position and asking what the Government were going to do about it. They cannot voice that criticism on this occasion because, in its sixth report of Session 2006-07, the committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102"></a><a name="07051563000313"></a>&#147;This bill is to give legal authority for the disclosure of social security and war pensions information, with a view to maximising take-up under the proposed Digital Switchover Help Scheme. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport have provided a delegated powers memorandum ... to explain the delegations in clause 2. The delegations are not inappropriate and there is nothing in the bill which we wish to draw to the attention of the House&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000223"></a>That was mentioned in Grand Committee, and the House will forgive me for mentioning it again.

The digital help scheme could be changed in the light of what happens at Whitehaven, and the BBC may well be consulted on changes. It would be valuable to include this modest amendment in the Bill to help to ensure that the present commitment to platform neutrality in the scheme is preserved.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_107"></a><a name="07051563000318"></a>Given the timing of Whitehaven, it is possible that there will be no set-top boxes matching the core receiver requirements, so it may be that the scheme operator has to provide boxes currently on the market which most closely match the requirements&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/3/07; col. GC 266.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07051563000225"></a>There is no DTT box currently on the mainstream market that can receive audio description, which is one of the main core receiver requirements. There is a specialist DTT receiver available from Portset that delivers audio description and talking menus, but it has been indicated to those who have briefed me that this product is likely to be prohibitively expensive. However, as the Government have acknowledged, audio description is currently available in Whitehaven via Sky subscription and the Sky freesat service.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07051563000194"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Evans, also said thatthe Government would welcome a DTT audio description solution. It is only fair to point out that the Government were in a position to deliver a DTT audio description solution by commissioning accessible equipment as recommended by the consumer expert group, but they have not done so in time for Whitehaven. Unless the Government can commission a set-top box that can receive audio description before November, blind and partially sighted people in Whitehaven are likely to be offered Sky freesat to be able to receive audio description. There are three reasons why that is not an ideal solution.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07051563000195"></a>First, as was pointed out in Grand Committee, freesat gives access to audio description but doesnot deliver accessible remote controls or otheruseful features such as voice output of channel or programme identification. As the noble Lord, Lord Evans, acknowledged in Grand Committee, better equipment should reduce the level of support visits needed by staff working for the targeted help scheme contractor.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07051563000196"></a>Secondly, it will undermine the principle that there should be one standard equipment offer available under the scheme, designed to meet minimum agreed standards for accessibility as set out by the Government. The position of the Consumer Expert Group is that providing accessible equipment as standard will benefit the maximum number of people while excludingno one.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07051563000197"></a>Thirdly, it will also undermine the Government&#146;s policy of platform neutrality, which the Minister has been eloquent about, in the promotion of digital television.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07051563000198"></a>Organisations such as Sense and the RNIBare seeking the following commitments from the Government: that they will explore all options to ensure that the Whitehaven targeted help scheme delivers a fully accessible box to all help scheme recipients rather than an off-the-shelf, inaccessible box; that if option 1 is fully explored and provednot to be possible, they will discuss with specialist equipment manufacturers such as Portset the possibility of providing blind and partially sighted people in Whitehaven with a solution that provides audio description and some form of spoken menu output&#151;at a minimum, spoken channel and programme identification; or, if those two options are not possible and blind and partially sighted people in Whitehaven are given off-the-shelf equipment that delivers audio description but does not meet the other core receiver requirements agreed by the Government, they must be offered the chance to exchange that for more accessible equipment when it is commissioned by the Government for use in other regions. In Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Evans promised to consider these points. I look forward to hearing more about the Government&#146;s plans in that respect.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07051563000199"></a>Fourthly, equipment commissioned for use in other regions of the country, including borders in 2008, must meet the core receiver requirements. The organisations briefing me have been told that the BBC and the DCMS expect that boxes for the main scheme will fully comply with the core receiver requirements

I hope that the Minister can give some of those assurances, as that has been the entire purpose of moving the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="07051563000200"></a><b><a name="70515-0009.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07051563000389"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. We are finishing on a high&#151;and a constructive&#151;note. The noble Lord has expressed his anxieties about the first stage of digital switchover and the need for reassurance that good progress is being made. I hope to be able to reassure him on that. Whitehaven is not a guinea pig or an experiment. Digital technology is robust and proven and already in use across the country, and switchover is the product of years of planning. What is important is that Whitehaven is the first area in which switchover is taking place, so I am pleased to be able to take this opportunity to reassure the House on the successful work that has been done thus far.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07051563000201"></a>Digital UK wrote to all households in Whitehaven in March and has taken responsibility for claims, and more than 2,000 claims have been submitted so far. Details will be transferred to the operator as soon as the decision has been taken on who the operator should be. So far, four bidders have tendered full bids as best and final offers for Whitehaven. They are: BT, Capita, Eaga and Vertex. It is expected that contracts for Whitehaven will be awarded in June. The tender of the main scheme is being taken forward in conjunction with the Whitehaven procurement. Contracts for the main scheme will not be concluded until December.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07051563000202"></a>On the point that the noble Lord raised about equipment, we are optimistic that the equipment provided in Whitehaven meets or is very close to meeting the core receiver requirement and are confident that audio description on digital for blind people will be available for Whitehaven.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07051563000203"></a>The noble Lord also mentioned the core receiver standard requirements for equipment for the main scheme. The agreement ensures that the equipment for the main scheme must meet minimum requirements and I can give the noble Lord and the Consumer Expert Group that assurance.</p>

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07051563000204"></a>I emphasise that the anxieties that the noble Lord expresses will be at the front of the minds of those involved with the scheme&#151;and Whitehaven is soon upon us. I heard his point about not infringing onthe principles of the scheme with regard to platform neutrality. That is an important consideration, but we feel that progress is being made within the dates thatI identified, with regard to Whitehaven and the contracts for the scheme as a whole. I am grateful to the noble Lord for using this amendment and occasion to give me the chance to update on progress.</p>

Theseare very technical matters and I simply ask that the Minister and his colleagues look carefully at the various options set out in what I have to say, which are directly from those organisations concerned with whether the core receiver standard requirementswill be met in the Whitehaven project. There are considerable anxieties. I am very pleased that the

<a name="70515-0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07051563000206"></a>The answer to a lot of this is to have continuing dialogue with those delivering the scheme in Whitehaven, whichever of the four organisations it may be, and ensuring that it is open for the voluntary organisations that have concerns to be kept in touch on progress on procurement of the equipment. I am not sure that they are fully briefed about the exact progress being made; I am pleased that the Minister believes that the equipment will meet the standards, as that is all that those organisations want. If it does not meet the requirements, there is a very strongcase for substitute equipment being put in place subsequently&#151;and I realise that the Minister cannot give me an undertaking about this. After all, Whitehaven might be the one place where the core standard requirements are not being met, which would be extremely unfair to those partially sighted and others who are the users of that equipment. I hope that the department will consider that point when it comes to procure and deliver the equipment.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07051544000010"></a>Ihave today published two papers on child maintenance.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07051544000011"></a>On 13 December 2006, the Government published their Command Paper <I>A </I><I>N</I><I>ew </I><I>S</I><I>ystem of </I><I>C</I><I>hild </I><I>M</I><I>aintenance</I>. Since publication we have conducted a number of consultation engagements and received around 200 separate responses from stakeholders. The report I am publishing today provides a summary of the views that have been expressed. I am grateful to all who have contributed, and our response shows how the policies have developed as a result of the consultation process.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07051544000012"></a>The Work and Pensions Select Committee published its report <I>Child Support Reform</I> on 15 March this year. I am publishing today the Government's response to the conclusions and recommendations of that report. I am grateful to the committee for their work and analysis, which has made an important contribution to the ongoing development of our proposals.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07051544000013"></a>Our proposals set out a clear way ahead for the child maintenance system. They will help lift many more children out of poverty, and enforce the rights of children and the responsibilities of parents. The streamlined system will offer a better service for clients and be more cost-effective for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="07051544000015"></a><b><a name="70515-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07051544000048"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Rooker):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (David Miliband) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07051544000016"></a>In my Written Statement of 22 February(col. <I>59 WS</I>) I promised to keep the House informed of progress with the single payment scheme (SPS).</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07051544000017"></a>As at 11 May, a total of over &#163;1.2 billion, representing around 80 per cent of the estimated total fund for SPS 2006, had been paid in either full or partial payments to 100,599 (92 per cent) claimants. About 8,500 claimants have yet to receive a payment, the majority of whom have claims under &#8364;1,000. The remaining claims include many of the more complex cases.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07051544000018"></a>In reviewing prospects over the remaining period to 30 June, I have been guided by the aims I set in my Statement of 7 November (col. 716), namely:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07051544000046"></a>&#147;First, we want to maximise payments to farmers that arrive on a timely and predictable basis. That means making full payments where possible and partial payments where necessary.  


<notus-date day="15" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS6"></a><b>15 May 2007 : Column WS6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Second, we want to minimise the risk of late payment penalties and disallowance. Third, we want our decisions this year to help the RPA establish a new and sound footing for the delivery of SPS in the future.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07051544000019"></a>Against that background, I have confirmed with the RPA chief executive that, while it remains very challenging, the agency should remain focused on achieving the existing target of making 96.14 per cent of payments by 30 June and continue to prioritise activity in respect of claimants who find themselves in difficult circumstances. I have also discussed with him additional steps that can be taken to help achieve this. </p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07051544000020"></a>I reported in my Statement of 22 February that some 25,000 cases from 2005 have been identified for review. With new ones identified as others are dealt with, that number now stands at 22,000. Outstanding work to review entitlement values for all these claims will now be undertaken separately from the process of making payments under the 2006 scheme. Any corrections to SPS 2005 and 2006 payments will follow as necessary. The RPA chief executive is taking a number of other steps to further streamline processing of claims.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07051544000021"></a>In the mean time, SPS 2007 application packs were dispatched ahead of the RPA&#146;s internal target and completed forms have been received at a steady rate ahead of today&#146;s deadline. The first stages of processing have also begun. Alongside that work, adjustments to the underlying entitlement data will continue as part of the recovery actions required to provide a more predictable payment timetable for 2007 and to stabilise the service provided by the agency for the 2008 scheme year.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07051544000022"></a>I am very aware of the impact on individual farmers of the payment timetable and the service levels that the RPA currently offers in respect of the SPS. I remain committed to ensuring continued improvements in these areas. My noble friend Lord Rooker and I will continue to liaise with representatives of both the main farming bodies and the banks to ensure a common understanding of progress and issues that arise.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07051544000023"></a>Regular updates on payment progress will continue to be published on the RPA website, including updates on estimated total claimant numbers and total fund values. I will also continue to keep the House informed as necessary.</p>

<a name="07051544000027"></a><b><a name="70515-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="07051544000050"></a>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07051544000028"></a>In my oral Statement on 1 May 2007 (col. 1367) I notified the House that there had been two security breaches of the medical training application service (MTAS) that arose on 25 and 26 April.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07051544000029"></a>MWR InfoSecurity has now completed a full security review of the MTAS system. Action has been taken by the contractor (Methods) to address the weaknesses identified. Both MWR and CESG (Communications Electronic Security Group), the national technical authority for information assurance, have confirmed that appropriate and sufficiently comprehensive action has been taken. The site was therefore reopened last week, restricted to postgraduate deaneries only, to support the next steps in the recruitment process.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07051544000030"></a>Because the investigation has made it clear that criminal offences may have been committed, the MWR analysis and report have been given to the police.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="07051544000031"></a>Following the recommendations of the review group chaired by Professor Neil Douglas, every eligible applicant for postgraduate medical training has now been guaranteed at least one interview for their first preference post. An additional 15,500 interviews have therefore been arranged as part of round 1 and are now taking place. I am extremely grateful to the consultants who have made themselves available for these additional interviews.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07051544000032"></a>The review group met again on 9 May to consider the process of offering posts to candidates who are successful in their round 1 applications. The group agreed that offers for the current round will be managed locally by individual deaneries, on the basis of published MMC guidance.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07051544000033"></a>Offers will be made to successful candidates on a phased basis as interviews for each specialty are completed. Subject to the outcome of the current judicial review, the first offers for hospital specialities in England will be made on or after 21 May 2007, with all initial offers made by early June. This process of making offers will continue until late June 2007, at which time round 1 will close, ensuring that candidates and employers have time to prepare for appointments commencing on 1 August 2007. Given the continuing concerns of junior doctors about MTAS, the system will not be used for matching candidates to training posts, but will continue to be used for national monitoring.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07051544000034"></a>As we have stressed before, not all training posts will be filled in the current round and there will therefore be further substantial opportunities for those who are not successful initially. The review group has agreed that this further recruitment will be locally planned and managed by the deaneries. An announcement of the process will be made shortly. Deaneries are continuing to work with the NHS and the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board to establish what additional training posts will be made available beyond the 23,000 training posts already available across the UK.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07051544000036"></a>I am today launching the Border and Immigration Agency's Illegal Working Action Plan.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07051544000037"></a>The action plan summarises seven key steps to ensure that we do not just stop illegal journeys to the UK, but the illegal jobs which draw illegal migrants to our country. Illegal working hurts good business, undercuts legal workers and creates illegal profits. It also puts illegal workers themselves at great risk. The measures summarised include:</p>
tougher checks abroad;identity cards for foreign nationals;a new checking service for employers;a sponsorship system which will ensure that employers take responsibility for whether their workers comply with the immigration rules;additional resources for a new nationwide enforcement effort;better communication of simplified rules; andpenalties for those who break them.
<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07051544000038"></a>The action plan includes a public consultation on the implementation of measures to prevent illegal migrant working contained in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, specifically a proposed new system of civil penalties and a new criminal offence.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="07051544000039"></a>We pose specific questions for participants and invite wider comments on the Government's plans for the implementation of the legislation. The consultation document is available on the Border and Immigration Agency website www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="07051544000041"></a>The draft Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill is essentially composed of two parts. The first part will establish the Local Better Regulation Office as a statutory corporation and give it powers to help promote consistency and better communication among local authorities and central government, helping them work together to keep the burdens of regulation on compliant businesses to a minimum. Part 2 of the Bill is enabling and will provide a framework for a range of new civil enforcement powers which will allow regulators to respond to non-compliance in ways that are transparent, flexible, and proportionate.</p>

<a name="70515-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="07051544000042"></a>In addition, I am launching a consultation on the regulators' compliance code (the code); this will be issued under Part 2 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. The code sets out a framework for regulators that will encourage them to focus enforcement effort on businesses most likely to cause harm, while improving advice and reducing unnecessary burdens

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="07051544000043"></a>The draft Bill and two consultations are presented as three documents. The first is Command Paper 7803, which contains the draft Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill and Explanatory Notes. The second is the accompanying consultation document, which also includes the impact assessment. The last is the consultation document for the regulators&#146; compliance code. All three documents will be placed in the Library of the House for the reference of noble Lords and copies will be made available in the Printed Paper Office.</p>

To keep these regulations up to date and to maintain their ease of use they havebeen replaced by the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2006 as part of an annual exercise to revoke and remake them.</p>

In cases of doubt, the supplier should contact HMRC's national advice service on 0845 010 9000.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_72"></a><a name="07051545000198"></a>The department's main public-facing service, the customer service centre, has an 020 7210 4850 number. The department also uses a switch board service used under the contract and that is 020 7210 3000. The department's executive agencies, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency also have geographic numbers.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_73"></a><a name="07051545000199"></a>The department funds a wide range of voluntary and charitable organisations, via Section 64 and similar grants, to provide services in connection with healthcare and healthy living. Some of these services include advice telephone lines. However, it is not possible, without incurring disproportionate costs, to identify individual projects and telephone services.</p>
