NATO was doing that work until December and a European force is now doing it for a year. That is a good example not only of European co-operation but of co-operation between NATO and the EU.</p>

Under President Obama the United States will have different priorities in the world; in the future Europe will not be its major priority. We are facing an assertive Russia, a rising China and a shift of economic power to the east. In the face of these circumstances, is not the right reaction from Europe to deepen its institutions of defence and foreign affairs and, if there is no European reaction force, should there not be one soon?</p>

Challenges such as terrorism are ones that Europe and the United States share. It is right that we should work together within Europe. We are a defensive alliance and NATO will remain the centre point of that. In order to make that alliance work I do not think that we need to deepen or reinvent new structures. The example I gave a moment ago of piracy shows that NATO and the EU can work together very closely and very successfully without over-elaborate structures, which I think do not always serve Europe well.</p>

The Government are taking careful note of the report to which my noble friend referred. I agree entirely that the social and emotional aspects of learning are key to a successful curriculum. In fact, as my noble friend is aware, the Government introduced the SEAL programme to primary schools in 2005 and to secondary schools in 2007. SEAL is exactly about developing the concept that she referred to and we know that it has a positive effect on, for example, attendance and behaviour. This is a crucial aspect and many of the schools in the Rights Respecting Schools initiative are working with it.</p>

In fact, the Children&#146;s Society report published this week shows that children today are better educated, better off and much healthier than ever before. However, we are not complacent. We have set out our 10-year Children&#146;s Plan, which has some very ambitious aspirations for children. We will make this the best place in the world for children to grow up in.</p>

I give the example of children who have been sexually abused and who find it extremely difficult to exercise their rights or, indeed, to learn, yet it remains difficult to get proper therapeutic provision for those children to ensure that they can enjoy their rights and follow on their education.</p>

That review was published recently. We have accepted its recommendations and we have set up a national steering group to monitor how we are progressing access to the kind of specialist services that she referred to. The point of the Rights Respecting Schools award is that it is about encouraging children to understand the needs of others, to respect others and to understand their responsibilities.

We particularly welcome the movement on climate change. In the past the United States has quite clearly detached itself from a challenge which we all recognise faces the whole world. We greatly welcome the indications from Hillary Clinton that the United States will play a more positive role in that dimension as well as in the other areas that my noble friend mentioned.</p>

Do they also recognise that our illusion of a unique special relationship with the United States is not shared in Washington? The United States clearly has special relationships with Israel, Canada, Mexico, Japan and a great many other countries. From the other end of the telescope, the relationship looks a little different.</p>

Amendment 54 would omit Clause 75(3). This subsection allows Her Majesty&#146;s Government to amend any law retrospectively. The Minister has pointed out that this clause can be used only within narrow limits and would not be used to amend the safeguards in the Bill. However, subsection (3) refers to subsection (1), which says &#147;amend the law&#148;, so not only banking law but a much broader picture has to be considered. There is nothing narrow about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09020313000067"></a>If there is a severe danger of financial collapse and unforeseen circumstances arise, there is nothing to stop Parliament being recalled and the necessary powers being put in place. That is why there is the power to recall Parliament to cope with unforeseen emergencies. There has been talk about the cost and the difficulties of this, but these are small matters compared with the surrender of democracy that is proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09020313000068"></a>I wondered when reading <I>Hansard</I> whether the Minister and I were discussing the same clause. The Minister justified the inclusion of retrospective legislation by citing the precedents of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 and Section 148 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. The Government&#146;s arguments that these are precedents for Clause 75 are baffling. The examples contain nothing of a retrospective nature. The Minister compared retrospective legislation with the effect on a contract of employment if there was a change in taxation. That is no comparison, because the employee would pay the revised tax rate from the date of the introduction of the new tax, not on previous earnings. I do not think that the Minister was proposing that a poor worker should have to pay a

<a name="90203-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09020313000069"></a>When we debated the clause in Committee, more than one noble and very experienced Lord commented that they had not previously seen such legislation as this clause proposes. The Minister has repeatedly emphasised the need for flexibility to deal with unforeseen circumstances and has not yet justified this massive departure from the democratic processes of this country. The Minister gives assurances about how the legislation will and will not be used. As my noble friend Lord Forsyth pointed out, how can the Minister give assurances when he has no idea what the events will be over which he is giving the assurances? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09020313000074"></a>It was the view of the committee that our constitution does not include an absolute prohibition on Parliament giving the Executive power by order to repeal, disapply or otherwise amend Acts of Parliament, delegated legislation or the common law. However, we believe that constitutional principle requires, first, that any such power should be granted by Parliament only where there is a compelling justification; secondly, that the scope of the power should be limited to the minimum necessary to meet the pressing need of such an exceptional measure; and, thirdly, that any order made should normally be subject to parliamentary control, either by negative or affirmative resolution.</p>

Further, on the basis of the arguments advanced by the Government so far, notably by Ian Pearson, Economic Secretary to the Treasury in another place, we are unpersuaded that this burden has been discharged.</p>

I seek clarification, as does the committee and as he indicated, of the meaning of &#147;desirable&#148;. It seems to me, first, to be as open-ended as a word can be. One is never happy to see words like &#147;desirable&#148; in legislation. Secondly, they are very subjective. Thirdly, many things are desirable. We desire all sorts of things which may not be strictly necessary. One is in a wholly different world when one compares what is desirable and what is necessary.</p>

<a name="90203-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09020313000078"></a>I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad. Many of us in the committee&#151;and by tradition we lawyers&#151;are nervous of anything that is retrospective. But, of course, this is not a penal clause. Had it been a penal criminal clause, we probably would have much stronger views. I reiterate the words of the noble Lord that the committee was not against retrospection in principle. There may be circumstances where retrospection is necessary. Anyone who has listened to what emanated from Davos will be abundantly clear in his or her own mind that some of the great financial geniuses of the world do not know exactly and confidently where they are going. In those circumstances, there may be a need for a clause to ensure that the Government of the day may be able to bring in powers where they are necessary, because we just do not know what is necessary. But I would need great persuasion to accept the word &#147;desirable&#148; in a statute of this kind.</p>

Although retrospective legislation can be acceptable, as my noble and learned friend said, we should not take it lightly. I certainly do not like the idea of it. However, I make it quite clear that I have no love for either the financial geniuses or the bankers who have been running banks in recent months and years, so I would not be opposed to imposing legislation that would help us in relation to what has happened with the banks.</p>

However, the reason why I have not spoken so far in Committee or on Report is that they have gone so far, taking hours and hours, on technical amendments, when there are major issues to consider in relation to what the banks have done. I recognise that this is a large Bill that requires proper consideration, but we have taken all these hours, in Committee and on Report, on detailed legislation, when in practice things have been happening that we should be discussing and debating but have no time to do so.</p>

<a name="90203-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09020313000081"></a>Let me mention one or two issues. There is the question of whether the banks are revising their lending habits. There is the question of whether quantitative easing&#151;sometimes called printing money&#151;should be carried out; some clever geniuses are suggesting that it should, as noble Lords will have seen in the press recently. There is the question of whether we should increase or reduce government debt, as the Opposition want. What is the Government&#146;s strategy for banks? We are told by the FSA that the banks are repossessing on a vast scale: 1,000 houses a week are being repossessed. These are all major banking issues, which we have no time to debate. We are debating only these technical issues and I regret that we do not have more time to discuss the major issues. Having said that, and not wishing to delay the House any longer, I make it clear that I very much agree with what has been said so far. I look forward to my noble friend&#146;s reply.</p>

<p><a name="09020313000235"></a>I say yes to the &#147;necessary&#148;. However, we have had no explanation of why the words &#147;or desirable&#148; are necessary or what they are intended to add. We have had no examples so far. I am a little surprised at why this retrospective power is thought necessary. I am prepared to go along with the fact that it probably is necessary, so long as it is subject to adequate parliamentary control; that question will be covered in our next group of amendments. To go beyond what is necessary is to go beyond the traditions of either House of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09020313000083"></a>A useful work, <I>Craies on Legislation</I>, ninth edition, has recently been updated in a comprehensive and helpful form by one of the parliamentary counsel, Mr Daniel Greenberg. He sets out pretty well all the examples that one can find of retrospection. They are always, quite rightly, tightly confined. In 1999, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, rightly said for this Government that,</p>
<ul><a name="09020313000299"></a>&#147;retrospective legislation should be avoided wherever possible&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/10/99; col. 502.]</ul>
<p><a name="09020313000084"></a>The very broad terms of the clause are in danger of setting precedents and quite expressly depart from the doctrine of necessity. I very much look forward to hearing what the Minister says in response. The noble Lord, Lord Myners, is in the Chamber and I can think  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_560"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 560</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of few people with a better understanding of this. I do not know whether he is answering this debate&#151;I see him modestly shaking his head&#151;but if he does not understand, I do not know who in the Government does. No doubt the Minister who replies will enlighten us.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="09020313000085"></a><b><a name="90203-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09020313000399"></a>Lord Blackwell:</b> My Lords, I wonder with some temerity whether, at this late stage of the legislation, the House and the Government might consider some modest constitutional innovation to deal with the conundrum raised by the amendments. The Government&#146;s case, as I understand it, is that if, late at night in the last knockings of doing some deal, a provision is found in some law that prevents the deal from being done and is not important in its own right, the parties concerned need to be able to get on and do the deal and put it to bed. I understand that. However, if this were corporate governance and it was too difficult to call up Parliament and the whole board, perhaps provision could be made for this by giving power to a sub-committee to take actions on behalf of the board when things need to done quickly and subsequently ratified.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09020313000086"></a>We have no such provision in the constitution, but it would not be impossible to make provision in the Bill for the exercise of this power to be subject to scrutiny by some cross-party Standing Committee of this House, the other House or both Houses, or by a group of privy counsellors or some other innovation. This would simply ensure that there was a constitutional check on the exercise of this power where it was unrealistic for Parliament to be recalled. It would then be possible for that group to decide whether the power was being properly used and whether Parliament should be recalled to debate it if necessary. I know that it is unusual to make constitutional innovations in the course of a Bill, but I simply wonder whether this situation might require some creative thinking.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09020313000089"></a>On Amendment 54, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Howard, on the force of his argument today and last week in Committee. He has been persistent on these issues but he has also been careful about how he has presented his arguments. I am grateful for that. I hope that, in response to this significant challenge from the noble Lord, Lord Howard, the House will, as the debate progresses today and, if necessary, at Third Reading, begin to find that the Government&#146;s position and that of the noble Lord are gradually converging and that there is not a vast gulf between us on these issues. I will, nevertheless, identify why I defend the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09020313000090"></a>I begin with a note of caution. The Government believe that this clause is, as a whole, essential. The Constitution Committee, in its report published last week, stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09020313000253"></a>&#147;We accept that there is force in the Government&#146;s general explanation of the need for the Treasury to have a power to change the law by order&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020313000091"></a>I will come to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, in a moment, when I consider his amendment. I must also note that the Constitution Committee raised important questions about the exercise of power in the public interest, to which I will turn when I consider the amendments. Distinguished members of that committee have already made their representations today. The Government are grateful for the committee&#146;s balanced and serious analysis of this clause, because we all recognise its importance.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09020313000092"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee made no specific recommendation in relation to Clause 75, but certainly urged that the House should scrutinise it closely,</p>
<ul><a name="09020313000300"></a>&#147;so that it might satisfy itself that the rather unusual context for which Part 1 of this Bill makes provision justifies the extremely wide power taken by the clause&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020313000093"></a>The House has certainly scrutinised it carefully. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, who takes great responsibility for that committee, will know how intensive our debates on this were in Committee. He will also appreciate the strength of the representations that have been made today. I realise that there are still areas where the Government need to clarify and explain their position, which is what I hope to do during these debates, particularly on this group of amendments and the next. I apologise in advance for the rather lengthy response that I am obliged to make. This being Report, it is my only shot at convincing the House on these important issues. I have a number of important points to make about the amendments.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09020313000094"></a>Three crucial issues have been raised. First, there is parliamentary procedure. Parliament must be allowed to play its essential role in holding the Executive to account. We have introduced an amendment that strengthens this in respect of Clause 75. We shall come to this when we discuss the next group of amendments. I will not go through that argument in full now, but it will be recognised that the Government appreciate the importance of government accountability. Secondly, the potential to use the power with retrospective effect would be removed by Amendment 54. As the Constitution Committee has noted, retrospective powers are not unprecedented, but the Government must make a  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_562"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 562</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>watertight case for why they are needed in this case. I will come to those points in a moment. Thirdly, there is the question of clarity around how the power will be used. This is a broad power. Noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Howard, have rightly sought assurances that this will not be a power exercised on the whim of a Government. I will provide reassurance about the seriousness with which any Government would use such a power.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09020313000095"></a>We studied the issues carefully. We are aware of the strength of opinion in the House. I hope that it will emerge from our debates today and at Third Reading, should that prove necessary, that the power is more tightly worded and will be fully explained. I must make the position clear. The one thing that the Government cannot do is amend Clause 75 to such an extent that the power becomes unusable; to do so would jeopardise the prospects for a successful bank resolution and thus, in the Government&#146;s view, would be irresponsible. I come again to the point that we must not forget: we are discussing this power in relation to the context in which it would be deployed and the nature of the problem for which it would be used to resolve. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, noted in his remarks in Committee:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09020313000254"></a>&#147;Having read the Treasury memorandum, it is very difficult to see how the operation of the Bill could take place without such a clause&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020313000236"></a>That, of course, is the nub of the Government&#146;s case. The noble Lord went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09020313000255"></a>&#147;Therefore, although we on these Benches have a general aversion to any retrospective powers, without this power and the whole clause, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to effect the rest of the powers in the Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/1/09; col. 1595.]</p>

<p><a name="09020313000237"></a>I think that Members on all Benches will agree that they may be necessary. That sums up the position that I sought to deploy at some length in Committee; indeed, it does so more accurately and succinctly than I succeeded in doing. I thanked the noble Lord for his contribution on that occasion, and I do so again today. However, I am going to ruin the effect of that succinct analysis by going on at some length, but that is the nature of the obligation of speaking from this Dispatch Box.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09020313000096"></a>Amendment 54 would remove Clause 75(3), the provision that provides for retrospective effect. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, has spoken with conviction about the need to remove this subsection, while the Constitution Committee noted the power with a great deal of interest. Its report is balanced and recognises the challenges posed by this kind of power. The committee notes that there is no absolute prohibition on retrospective legislation in British constitutional law or practice. It also notes that retrospective powers are unusual but not unprecedented; in presenting the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, also reflected that position.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09020313000097"></a>My last attempt to try to provide the House with examples of legislation with retrospective elements did not produce quite the convinced response that I would have liked, and noble Lords indicated that I ought to do better. This is a difficult area and none of the examples that I am about to give will be directly comparable, because we are dealing with different pieces of legislation and therefore very different contexts.  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_563"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I insist that context is everything with regard to these powers. However, all the examples demonstrate that such powers can and have been justified in terms of their context and all of them have been agreed in Parliament.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09020313000098"></a>A recent example is found in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008, which overturned the effects of a judgment of the House of Lords on the scope to grant witness anonymity orders in criminal proceedings. The Act was given a qualified form of retrospective effect in that it could, in certain circumstances, apply to witnesses who had given evidence before the Act came into force. This was controversial, but the case was successfully made that the powers were justified in the public interest. There are of course differences between the power under that Act and what will be provided under Clause 75 of the Bill. I do not have the slightest doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Howard, will point that out with some force when he comes to speak, but before he gets the chance to do so I should say that I acknowledge the differences. I am giving an example of legislation that has retrospective effect.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09020313000099"></a>A second example is Sections 3 and 4 of the National Insurance Contributions Act 2006, which contain regulation-making powers enabling retrospective provision to be made. A third example is in Section 431A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The regulation powers in that section enable provisions to have retrospective effect and may amend primary legislation. However, I accept the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Howard, is loath for me to comment on anything to do with taxation in this respect, so the third example is put forward with some diffidence.</p>

<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="09020313000100"></a><b><a name="90203-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09020313000401"></a>Lord Lyell of Markyate:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for giving those three examples, but they are all examples where the retrospective power could properly be said to be necessary. They would not need the words &#147;or desirable&#148; in order to have that power. Can the Minister draw that distinction as to why he needs &#147;desirable&#148; as well?</p>

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="09020313000101"></a><b><a name="90203-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09020313000402"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I intend to do that. It is an important point and I will not sit down without addressing myself to it. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord will allow me to come to that point in time as it relates rather more to the other amendments and not to Amendment 54 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Howard.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09020313000102"></a>All of these powers are different in their scope and purpose. As I said, there must be a compelling public interest case for these powers and the House must consider each on its merits. Therefore, the question the House faces today is whether the retrospective power in this Bill is justified in the public interest. We have had the scrutiny which the Constitution Committee suggested was necessary for these issues. In fact, the scrutiny has probably exceeded even the exceptional standards the House normally presents on issues such as this.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09020313000103"></a>I believe that the public interest case, with respect to Clause 75, is clear. The absence of retrospective powers could jeopardise the chances of a successful bank resolution, undermining the special resolution objectives which are at the heart of this part of the Bill, including  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_564"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 564</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the protection of financial stability, depositors and public funds. The Bill has been produced against a background of considerable difficulty&#151;indeed crisis&#151;within the financial system, with great effects on the wider economy and deleterious effects on our people. Therefore, we should recognise that we are operating within a context where quite significant action needs to be taken.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09020313000104"></a>If I had not anticipated this when the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, supported by my noble and learned friend Lord Morris and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, spoke, I knew that the Constitution Committee would present its position in a critical way with a heavy onus resting on the Government to justify to the House why a retrospective power of such breadth as that which is contained within Clause 75(3) is required. The committee asked the Government to consider whether the scope of the power could be narrowed and to give examples of where the retrospective aspect of the power might be used. I will start by trying to deal with the issue of examples, but I preface my remarks by the obvious point that we are talking about events that will happen rapidly and in relation to which it is not easy for us to give clear identification of what might happen. It is no use quoting from the past. We are trying to anticipate with this legislation the kind of crisis which could occur in the future and to ensure that there are powers in place for the authorities to be able to cope.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09020313000105"></a>The drafting of a transfer order in a fast-burn situation with events moving rapidly may not be perfect. Errors and inaccuracies may creep in. Whether it is appropriate to correct these retrospectively will depend wholly on the facts of the case. If it were the case that the order could not be drafted and action taken rapidly, the very purpose of what the clause seeks to address, in terms of the challenges of a failing bank, could not be achieved.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09020313000106"></a>As I said, it is difficult for me to give instances. However, there may be cases where the parties all intended to achieve a particular effect and have proceeded on the basis of that intention, but looking at the instrument may reveal that the text itself is ambiguous or even wrong. In such cases it may be entirely appropriate to correct the drafting with retrospective effect to ensure that the parties who have signed up to the resolution are indeed in the position that they intended to be in when they gave their agreement. Alternatively, there may be provisions of the law that it would be perfectly proper and sensible to modify, but which are overlooked when the transfer takes place because of the speed at which intervention is required and because of the complexity of the field.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09020313000107"></a>I shall illustrate how difficult that could be with regard to the provisions that relate to the control of undertakings. There are numerous provisions regarding significant changes to the ownership of companies, including provisions that require the prior consent of the regulator to a change in ownership. A share transfer instrument or order is likely to trigger those provisions. The Government would expect to comply with them in full; that would, of course, be their intention. It is not impossible, however, that in a rapid fast-burn resolution of a bank with a novel structure or one that  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_565"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>carries on an unusual range of activities, we might inadvertently overlook such a provision. If we did not have the retrospective power, the directors of the bank, or indeed third parties, could be faced with the prospect that action taken to effect the resolution might lead to them facing a regulatory penalty. Indeed, in some circumstances it could even result in criminal penalties. Some of these regimes could result in contracts not being enforceable or the transfer not being recognised. All this could lead to serious uncertainty about the consequences of the resolution for the parties involved. As we have debated previously, any uncertainty in entering into these developments could seriously jeopardise the prospect of the resolution being successful.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09020313000108"></a>I shall give the House another example. There are provisions of regulatory law that apply in different ways depending on the group structure of the regulated entity. Some regulatory law will aggregate the activities of undertakings in the same group. Were the Treasury to take a bank into temporary public ownership as things stand, the bank would find itself in the same &#147;group&#148;&#151;I use that in inverted commas&#151;as Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley and RBS. We may find that various provisions of regulatory law apply to it in a different way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09020313000109"></a>We are aware of those issues and aim to comply with them in full or, where appropriate, to seek a waiver from the regulator. However, it is possible that a particular bank might raise different issues that had never been dealt with before and we might miss something. Again, there is a risk of regulatory penalty and unenforceable contracts. Contracts entered into by the bank after temporary public ownership could potentially be laid open to challenge as a result of the breach that had occurred. There is a risk that that could threaten the resolution, and the Treasury&#146;s judgment, based on ongoing contingency planning, is that that risk is a serious one.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09020313000110"></a>I appreciate that retrospective provision was not used in the resolution of Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley or the Icelandic banks, but experience shows that there is a clear public interest in being able to respond swiftly to fast-moving events to achieve the special resolution objectives, including protecting depositors and maintaining financial stability, two of the significant objectives of the Bill that establish the context in which these powers are being sought. Indeed, the authorities need to intervene at even shorter notice than in previous resolutions. The difficulties relating to Northern Rock were very well known but a bank failure can occur out of the blue&#151;for example, where an unforeseeable event destabilises the bank. That might occur where trading losses have been concealed by deception and we would not have the warning&#151;limited though it was&#151;that the bank was in trouble in the way that we had with regard to Northern Rock.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09020313000111"></a>Of course the Government do not take that power lightly but the public interest argument for effective resolution of banks is compelling. That would be jeopardised without the retrospective power. I hope that the examples clarify for the House how retrospection might work in practice and that I shed some light on some of the possible consequences if the authorities did not have recourse to that power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09020313000112"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howard&#151;I am all too conscious of the fact that he has the last word on the amendment&#151;might point out that the examples I provided relate to the needs of the authorities to return to issues that they have not been able to resolve successfully at the first attempt. That may be so, but I would point out that the affairs of a large modern bank can be extraordinarily complex. We have to accept that there is a real chance that the authorities may not be able to resolve the problems immediately and perfectly at the first time of asking. If that means only up to the possibility of making a mistake, the Government are obliged to do so, but I believe that it is better to do that now and prepare for the possibility in the legislation than to proceed on the assumption that the Government on every occasion will get it right first time.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09020313000113"></a>I hope therefore that the noble Lord will accept that the Government are prepared to own up to the possibility of fallibility, particularly when dealing at short notice with the affairs of multimillion-pound large and complex financial institutions. I hope that he will also accept that the prudent course of action is to make provision that will enable the Government to confront that reality and to act to resolve it if it proved in exceptional cases to be necessary.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09020313000114"></a>If the noble Lord can accept the case that I have put in the face of his spirited articulation of the principles of parliamentary scrutiny to which he has subjected the clause, I hope that he can withdraw his amendments and give us the basis for further discussions between us before Third Reading on outstanding points of detail.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09020313000115"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 55, which is in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, and which has attracted the support of the other distinguished members of the Committee: the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, and my noble and learned friend Lord Morris. We have considered this proposal to remove the power to make retrospective provision if it is desirable; allowing only that the provision may be made if necessary, which is the burden of the noble Lord&#146;s case. I remind the House that anything done under this power will be in pursuit of the special resolution objectives. In this sense, any use of the power will always be necessary: after all, we are dealing with a crisis situation and crisis provisions operating in a short space of time represented by the special resolution procedure, which is the whole substance of that part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90203-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09020313000116"></a>However, if the power were limited to what is necessary, it would suggest that a retrospective provision could be made only where it would be impossible to effect a resolution otherwise than by making retrospective changes. The examples I have given of when the retrospective power might be used illustrate why the need to change the law, including retrospectively, may involve the evaluation of competing public interests. Such an evaluation may show that the case for retrospective provision is justified in the public interest. If such provision could be made only where necessary, that would prevent the better outcome for the public interest being pursued, yet that should be the guiding principle of a Government in action in this context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09020313000125"></a>The context of the Bill is also unique. I am not in any way, shape or form disparaging the significance of other pieces of legislation for our fellow citizens on which I have commented. However, they scarcely relate to a Bill that is trying to curb the catastrophe which has fallen on the financial system, and through that, on the wider economy and the whole of the country. Therefore, the Bill has particular salience. The powers will be used only to make the stabilisation powers, which are necessary to achieve the special resolution objectives, more effective. We have clearly set down the parameters under which the powers will be used. They are confined to this particular special resolution activity. The power can be used only in support of those objectives. The Bill further establishes that the power will not be used to amend the Bill itself, or the safeguards in secondary legislation made under the Bill.</p>

<a name="90203-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09020313000126"></a>I, of course, accept that the House is straining to accept a wide-ranging power and that noble Lords seek assurances on how it will be used. The Government are therefore considering what guidance may be put into the code of practice on this issue. As the House has already heard, the authorities will be legally obliged to have regard to the code of practice. For the reasons I have set out, I ask noble Lords to withdraw their amendments. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, cited <I>Craies on Legislation</I> as giving useful, helpful and limited examples of retrospection. The author of <I>Craies</I> is the draftsman of this Bill.</p>

While I accept that retrospectivity is indeed an evil, I also accept that there are almost unique situations where it might be a necessary evil. Whereas ministerial order legislation can be utterly despotic, there are circumstances which make it exceptional and necessary. However, I return to the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, concerning the adjective &#147;desirable&#148;. The fundamental flaw in relation to that is double. On the one hand, it is extremely wide. That, of course, is why it does not appear in legislation. It is fatally flawed because of its almost illimitable width. Secondly, it is fatally flawed because it is either a subjective test or a test that straddles the line between subjectivity and objectivity. &#147;That which is necessary&#148; is clearly an objective test. If one wanted to change a situation to a limited degree, one could add &#147;that which is reasonably necessary&#148;.</p>

I do not have a great deal further to add except to make the following obvious point. The Government have indicated that we still have capacity to introduce regulation with regard to the code of practice. We still have Third Reading in which to debate these issues further.

Paragraph (d) says that the Government can make order after order after order. The Government have suggested, in Amendment 107 and the other two government amendments grouped with it, that if they come back and revise the order, it must be in new terms. Let us hope that they are not cynical about that. I support the Liberal Democrats, who I know are very much opposed to that amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09020313000142"></a>It is not right for parliamentary control to be removed. What we have here&#151;subject to agreement on the word &#147;desirable&#148;, there is a good deal of consensus on this in the House&#151;is effectively a strong and very wide Henry VIII clause that allows for retrospection. Now we reach Clause 75(8) and find that we have retrospection without any parliamentary control if the Government so wish. If they lay an order and things are done pursuant to that order, as presumably it is intended that they should be done&#151;banks will be transferred and so on under the special resolution&#151;then they can never be unscrambled.</p>

However, that is not a reason for removing parliamentary control. The Government are, by their own admission and to put it politely, in a fog. They are not sure what to do. It is difficult to believe that something that they do as a result of late-night meetings will suddenly resolve the world financial crisis in a way that cannot be achieved with up to 28 days&#151;or possibly, if it is just before the Summer Recess, three or four months&#151;of consideration for Parliament to come back and approve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09020313000144"></a>I listened carefully to what the Minister said about how there might suddenly be regulatory penalties or unenforceable contracts that would have to be dealt with. However, those examples, for which we are grateful, do not make the point that parliamentary control should be removed. If a perfectly sensible government proposal is to be implemented but looks as though it might incur regulatory penalties, then a new order could be laid to lift those regulatory penalties retrospectively. Unless the House has lost its marbles&#151;to use rather inappropriate language&#151;and the common sense which normally characterises the dealings of both Houses has gone out the window, the regulatory penalty will be lifted or, alternatively, the unexpected unenforceability of the contract will be rendered enforceable, because that is what people had anticipated and it can be corrected. However, it does not require the exceptional powers of subsection (8)(c), which says that the Government can do it and thereafter it will stand whatever the views of Parliament. I seek to avoid that.

Is that the normal way in which an order is made? If it is not, it is an extraordinary constitutional invention. Would my noble and learned friend care to comment on that?</p>

<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="09020313000147"></a><b><a name="90203-0004.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="09020313000426"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, I am not an expert on procedure in your Lordships' House, but my understanding is that the rules governing Report stage are significantly more restrictive than the rules governing Committee stage as regards the extent to which a conversation can take place between Members. If I am wrong, I shall stand corrected; but if I am right, perhaps noble Lords would follow that rule.</p>

<a name="90203-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09020313000148"></a>In Committee I argued in favour of Amendment 57. I could see the argument for including the clause in the Bill due to the Bradford &amp; Bingley precedent, when the Government had to act near the beginning of a very long recess. It seemed to me that the clause, which deals with the secondary consequences of taking a bank into public ownership or one of the other special resolution regimes, should be able to come into force so that the whole deal was done. You would bring the bank into the special resolution regime and, depending on the extent to which you found it necessary, you would make other changes to the law to allow that to happen by, for example, disallowing provisions of the Companies Act, which in certain circumstances you might need to do. It would be sensible to get a statutory instrument out at the same time and to have it in the public domain so that all those involved would know the Government&#146;s intention and the likely outcome.</p>

<a name="90203-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09020313000149"></a>The likelihood of a statutory instrument being voted down by Parliament in those circumstances is very rare indeed. When we do attempt to vote down statutory instruments&#151;since I have been here, we have done so probably two or three times&#151;Ministers tell us that we are behaving in a most irresponsible way and it is the end of the constitution as we know it. For that reason, Parliament is very reluctant to vote down statutory instruments. Therefore, by introducing an instrument under this clause, the very strong implication is that that would be the law. In the narrow circumstances of something happening at the start of a recess or when Parliament is not sitting, it would be useful for all involved in bringing a bank into the special resolution regime to have that degree of certainty.</p>

<a name="90203-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09020313000150"></a>That brings us to paragraphs (c) and (d). I have no doubt that the Minister will confirm this, but I thought on rereading paragraph (c) that we need it because if you have undertaken a whole raft of provisions under the power, you could not turn the clock back just in respect of the secondary provisions, as opposed to the major provision: that of bringing the bank under the special resolution regime. I persuaded myself&#151;I hope correctly&#151;that paragraph (c) was necessary. As for paragraph (d), however, in Committee several noble Lords were appalled at the thought that if Parliament slung it out, the Government could bring it back and back and back. Therefore, I propose that we should just amend paragraph (d) because if Parliament has allowed an order to lapse&#151;which really means that Parliament has voted against it&#151;it is highly unlikely that Parliament would want another order to come forward.</p>

<a name="90203-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09020313000151"></a>The Government's response has been to produce their amendment to deal with the point that they cannot just bring the same order back and back and back by inserting in paragraph (d) the words &#147;in new terms&#148;. That goes some way to improve the position in that it would mean that the Government could not just bring back the same order. I am unclear about two things, the first of which is what &#147;new terms&#148; means. Does that mean that they could just change the odd word? How substantive is the phrase &#147;new terms&#148;? Secondly, in the highly unlikely event of Parliament voting down an order, why would the Government feel confident enough to bring forward any other order under the clause?</p>

<a name="90203-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09020313000152"></a>I am pleased that the Government have moved a bit, but I am still rather curious about the consequences of where they have moved.</p>

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="09020313000153"></a><b><a name="90203-0004.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="09020313000427"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> My Lords, Bradford &amp; Bingley is not a good precedent; I shall try to explain why that is my view. First, on a matter of fact, subsection (8)(a) states that an order may be made. In the case of Bradford &amp; Bingley, the order came in front of Parliament at nine o'clock in the morning and came into effect at eight o'clock in the morning. That was because of the trading, or non-trading, of shares on the market. Clearly, it had to come into effect straight away. So I think that the answer to the question raised by my noble friend Lord Stewartby is that the order has immediate effect. The lapsing is a different matter. That is where we have previously got into the issue of unscrambling. It is impossible to unscramble what was done in the matter of transfer of shares, suspension of their trading on the market and all the other things that follow from that.</p>

<a name="90203-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09020313000154"></a>The other reason that I think that Bradford &amp; Bingley is not a very good example is that the action took place 10 days before Parliament reassembled. It was not right at the beginning of the long recess, it was late in the recess. As we know, when we returned there was immediately the recapitalisation announcement. It may or may not be that Bradford &amp; Bingley was such a serious threat to the financial stability of the market that it was necessary to do that on 29 September. Noble Lords will know that I have had doubts ever since the order was laid about whether it would not have been possible to wait until the recapitalisation scheme and to have included Bradford &amp; Bingley in the scheme, as opposed to taking the action that was taken at the time.</p>

<a name="90203-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09020313000155"></a>I argue strongly to the House that it is not a good idea to proceed on the basis of Bradford &amp; Bingley. Frankly, I am still looking for something that is so unexpected and so difficult that it requires Clause 75(8), although I wholly support the removal of any part of it.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09020313000157"></a>Of course the House has repeated regularly that Parliament must be allowed to play its essential role in holding the Executive to account regarding this proposed legislation. The clause recognises that by making the exercise of the power subject to the draft affirmative procedure. However, as was pointed out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, subsection (8) allows orders to be made under the clause subject to the 28-day procedure. That procedure is designed to cope with matters that have to be dealt with urgently, and in this case, the context is the resolution of a particular failing bank. The order will be used only when absolutely necessary. It is by way of a special provision with regard to affirmative orders, recognising that the Executive must act in certain circumstances and seek parliamentary support afterwards.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09020313000158"></a>The challenge that we are facing is to enable parliamentary scrutiny without compromising the authorities&#146; ability to use the stabilisation options swiftly and effectively. I am aware that noble Lords, like the Government, have sought a number of ways of tackling what we on all sides appreciate is a thorny issue. We have listened very carefully to the representations that have been made during the passage of the Bill. That is why we have brought forward an amendment that we think meets the concerns expressed.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09020313000159"></a>I am not able to accept the amendments before the House today other than those proposed by the Government. One option that was suggested, but not brought forward in an amendment, is that Parliament should be recalled. We rejected that. When we are dealing with a volatile situation, the last thing the country would need is the sense of emergency that is heightened by the recall of Parliament. The debate would be taking place in the middle of complex bank resolution and would be fraught with difficulties about how much the Government could disclose about the transactions that were taking place at the time. It would place enormous pressure on both Houses with regard to how they could effect scrutiny while being in the dark about certain parts of the negotiations. What we need is a process that will allow Parliament to hold the Executive to account effectively, while allowing that the bank resolution procedure can work. Recalling Parliament certainly would not work.</p>

After all, it means Parliament comes back to discuss that issue, and that issue alone. While Parliament is sitting, the judgment of the Houses might be in the form of a Statement. We do have examples of that with Northern Rock in the past, not under the special resolution procedure, but where the Government had to deal with a difficult situation. Of course, the Government give the information that they can give to the House within that limited framework, the two Houses reach their judgment on whether the Executive should continue to act in the way in which they are acting and they make provision for parliamentary scrutiny. The most obvious provision with regard to Northern Rock was that the legislation would end after one year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09020313000162"></a>I hear what the noble Viscount is saying; that the collapse of a bank is likely mightily to exercise the Members of Parliament in the other place and noble Lords. However, the Government would be able to rely on the good judgment of both Houses in terms of how much the Government were pressed to reveal when discussions were ongoing. If Parliament was recalled solely for that purpose, a Statement, which would convey a limited amount, followed by short questions and answers with no further discussion, would scarcely be looked on as an intelligent use of Parliament&#146;s time. A full-scale debate while information was limited would not be in anyone&#146;s interests. That is why we are against it.</p>

Even if Parliament was sitting, an order would have had to have been laid, for example, to suspend trading in the shares. That would have happened before Parliament could have any discussion. So even if Parliament was sitting, it would still be faced with action that had been taken that it would be extremely difficult to unscramble under the 28-day procedure.</p>

I hear the noble Lord, Lord Baker, saying from a sedentary position that it is democracy. We are dealing with, effectively, emergency powers being exercised to deal with a complex and difficult financial situation that puts at risk the whole financial position. To suggest that democracy would mean the full participation of both Houses of Parliament in those deliberations would not be a question of democracy but a denial of the proper responsibility of the Executive to sort things out and then to come to Parliament and account for how they had dealt with the matter. That is democracy.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09020313000165"></a>If the Treasury laid an order and had to wait until it had been debated by Parliament, it would immediately become public that the named bank was in trouble. This could seriously jeopardise the resolution of the issue. For example, it could lead to a run on the bank, while the Government stand helplessly by waiting for the subsequent parliamentary approval. I do not think that the depositors in Northern Rock would have welcomed a position where the Government could give no guarantee to depositors until they had parliamentary approval. What happened was that executive action was taken, and then Parliament debated whether the Government, in the round, had exercised powers properly and to good effect. That must be the reason why we seek to defend the clause.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09020313000166"></a>Before I talk about the detail of Amendments 57 and 58, I will speak briefly about the 28-day procedure, the purpose of which is to allow instruments to be made and to come into force with immediate effect. It is a dramatic parliamentary procedure, but it is there because Parliament has always recognised that certain actions are necessary to be taken by the Executive which it needs to evaluate, consider and make judgments on. If the actions are not taken, the remedies cannot be applied in certain circumstances. That is the whole basis of why the 28-day procedure is different from the normal affirmative order. As we are all well aware,  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_576"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 576</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>28-day affirmative orders are not very common. As the House will appreciate, such an order provides for an enhanced level of parliamentary scrutiny beyond that used in the negative procedure. The order will lapse unless it is approved subsequently.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09020313000167"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, put forward the proposal that the Government might remove paragraphs (c) and (d) of Clause 75(8). We have considered the legal effect of removing these provisions, particularly as some noble Lords suggested that they might bring the matter back on Report. Amendment 57 first seeks to remove paragraph (c). This provision establishes that,</p>
<ul><a name="09020313000303"></a>&#147;the lapse of an order ... does not&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09020313000240"></a>in broad terms, invalidate things already,</p>
<ul><a name="09020313000304"></a>&#147;done under or in reliance of the order&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09020313000241"></a>up to that point. This is not unprecedented. Indeed, it is a standard approach.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09020313000168"></a>The Statutory Instruments Act 1946 makes provision in the analogous circumstances of a negative procedure instrument being annulled by resolution of either House. The 28-day procedure allows orders to be made with immediate effect, followed by parliamentary scrutiny. The authorities could not act if there was a chance that their actions could subsequently be legally invalidated. If we removed paragraph (c) of Clause 75(8), we would not be able to use the 28-day procedure at all.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09020313000169"></a>Let me give an example of what it would mean if paragraph (c) were to be removed. The authorities may need to resolve a bank where a statutory impediment has been identified in relation to the transfer and it needs to be addressed by provision under this clause. First, for obvious reasons the authorities could not lay an order in draft and wait for it to be debated. This would announce to the world that they were preparing to place the bank named on the order into the special resolution regime, which would immediately prejudice the chances of making the regime effective.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09020313000170"></a>Secondly, without paragraph (c) the authorities could not make an order under the 28-day procedure. They would be acutely aware that should Parliament later fail to pass resolutions affirming the order, everything that had been done would be unlawful. Faced with this prospect, the authorities would not be prepared to take the risk. Again, that jeopardises the whole concept of the resolution procedure. In short, the authorities would be simply unable to take the necessary action, which in turn would jeopardise the possibility of effecting a resolution if paragraph (c) of Clause 75(8) should be removed.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09020313000171"></a>The Government also looked very carefully at paragraph (d) of Clause 75(8) because that, too, was substantially debated in Committee. Irrespective of the provisions of this power, as the House will be aware, it would be politically and unconstitutionally untenable for Ministers to behave as if they were repeatedly introducing the same order. I would ask the House to appreciate what the response of Members of either House would be if the Government got past the problem of dealing with legislation by a constant repetition of an order whose procedure is drafted against emergency or crisis or dramatic circumstances. Although we recognise the concern, it would not be practical to remove paragraph (d) and under the Statutory

It is not realistic to think that a Government would use this procedure repeatedly.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09020313000172"></a>Government Amendment 59, which is supported by further government amendments, seeks to establish beyond all doubt that the Government will not bypass Parliament by repeatedly laying identical orders. For the sake of consistency, this issue is addressed throughout the Bill, which is why we have put down government Amendments 107 and 117. The Government need to retain the power to make a further order should one lapse, not least to have an opportunity to address the concerns raised by Parliament, which may not relate to every aspect of the order. It is not the purpose of the paragraph to allow identical orders to be repeatedly laid. We do not think it could be construed in that way, nor is it conceivable that the Government would act in such a matter.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09020313000173"></a>However, in view of the concerns expressed in the House on this point, our amendment seeks to make express what is already implicit, namely that the new order will not be the same as the old; it will not be in the same terms. I hope that it will therefore be recognised that the Government have listened to anxieties about a repetition of exactly the same order being made in the same terms. I am indicating that the Government would have to change the terms of the order to comply with this legislation.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09020313000174"></a>Does that mean, as far the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, is concerned, that all we will have done is change the punctuation or made such a minor change as to be of no significance? We think that the effect of requiring the order to be made in new terms will be that we are not dealing in trivia. The Government believe that this amendment sends a clear signal that, if Parliament declines to approve an order made under this proposal, Ministers will have the opportunity to make a new proposal to Parliament for approval in materially different terms&#151;and those terms would be materially different. We do not think that the Bill should be more prescriptive on this, other than to require in very clear terms that the new order must be &#147;in new terms&#148; in comparison with the old. Accordingly, in due course I will seek to move.</p>

The issue is that we are not laying the same order. Any Government would be obliged to lay a new order &#147;in new terms&#148;. I do not think that it is realistic to ask us to be prescriptive about what that new order could look like, because we are dealing with circumstances that we cannot readily foresee, except in terms of their urgency and seriousness. We do not need to include &#147;material&#148;. The concept of &#147;in new terms&#148; means that the order must be different from the previous one.

Every time an objection is made to the structure of the clause, we seem to be told that the whole financial system will collapse into ruins unless we can do without Parliament. Subsection (8) says in effect that the Treasury, if it thinks it necessary, can make any order that it likes and Parliament can do nothing about it. Parliament can disapprove of the order later, but by that time everything would be done and dusted, so why would we be asked back even to consider it? We could simply have a Motion to discuss the financial system of this country; it would have no more or less power than we have under the clause.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09020313000182"></a>The Minister got close to illuminating the position under Clause 75, particularly its retrospective aspects, when he made the point that you might find that you had ignored some detailed provision about regulatory penalties or some detailed provision that rendered some contract or transaction unenforceable. At the end of our previous debate, I suggested to the Minister that, when you have a glitch of this sort and make an amending order, you can confidently expect that Parliament will be thoroughly sensible and will approve it 99 times out of 100, or even 999 times out of 1,000. However, the clause sets up a structure that is much broader. My objective is not that the Government should not have the power to make the special resolution procedures work&#151;we all want them to work and to work efficiently&#151;but that the procedures should be subject at least to basic parliamentary control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09020313000183"></a>The clause takes a belt-and-braces approach and is completely on the level until the end of subsection (7), which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09020313000258"></a>&#147;An order ... shall be made by statutory instrument, and ... may not be made unless a draft has been laid ... and approved&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020313000242"></a>That is normally what happens. I imagine that that is how the Government will construct the special resolution procedure and that they will want to make subsequent amendments to iron out little details. So long as they are sensible, they can confidently expect the support of Parliament, but they have given themselves the power to do the whole lot without the approval of Parliament. They do not need that. That is contrary to the whole objective of Parliament. The Minister has not addressed that point and I ask him with great respect to think again before Third Reading and not to cut us off now in our debates. If he comes back with a compelling answer, I am quite certain that anyone who may be mildly persuaded by what I am saying will change their mind. I shall certainly feel a great deal more comforted&#151;I think that the House as a whole might, too&#151;so I ask the Minister to do that.</p>

I already indicated, with regard to the formal group of amendments, that we were eager to discuss this further, given the strength of representation on the matter. I accept the noble and learned Lord&#146;s point, but we are debating an affirmative order that is related to an emergency provision, so there is not much room for movement. We have explored these issues extensively, but it goes without saying that I will reflect on what has been said in this afternoon&#146;s debate.</p>

<a name="90203-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09020313000185"></a>I always stand ready to meet noble Lords about these matters. We are not presenting, within this framework, anything particularly exceptionable: 28-day orders are not used frequently, but they have been in existence for well over half a century and they relate to emergency provisions. The Executive must of course be held to account, but it is not possible, in dealing with a bank resolution under these special resolution procedures&#151;we are talking about a highly specific context in which these powers are exercised&#151;for a judgment to be made subsequently that people acted unlawfully and could therefore be found guilty accordingly. The bank resolution procedure could not possibly work like that. That is why we are so firm about the necessity of the clause as it stands. However, I assure the noble and learned Lord that I will meet him at any time, with my officials, to discuss this matter further.</p>

This is a form of words that is used in the Companies Act. I was initially intrigued by the Minister&#146;s description of the rationale for Clause 81 when it was introduced by amendment in Committee. The Minister ended his explanation by saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09020313000269"></a>&#147;Finally, a private sector solution may be more likely on a group-wide than a bank-only basis. This is particularly the case if other non-bank parts of the group are attractive to buyers&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/1/09; col. 1578.]</p>

<p><a name="09020313000243"></a>That rang alarm bells. The scenario is that a successful group has a relatively small bank which is failing. The relevant authorities think how easy it would be to get rid of that small bank if they wrapped it up in those other nice businesses, so instead of expropriating a bank with, say, 500 employees, they take hold of a large enterprise with 10,000 employees. My real life example for the Minister is this: would Clause 81 allow the Treasury to grab hold of Tesco, which since a while ago has held 100 per cent ownership in a bank? The same does not apply to Sainsbury&#146;s. This is my Tesco amendment in another sense, too, and, with a nod to its strapline, every little helps to clarify the nature of this legislation. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, follows on from our constructive debate in Committee on holding companies. It would restrict the Government&#146;s power to take a holding company into temporary public ownership to cases where more than half of the holding company&#146;s business, measured by a number of alternative metrics, is in the bank. I can see the purpose behind the amendment. The noble Baroness seeks to make it clear that the Government would not be able to nationalise a holding company that happened to include a small failing bank. However, that is already provided for in the conditions set out in the Bill, as amended in Committee.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09020313000190"></a>Clause 81(3) provides that the Treasury may take action with respect to the holding company only if the specific conditions for temporary public ownership, as set out in Clause 9, are met. Let me help by repeating those specific conditions: first, the exercise of the power is necessary to resolve or reduce a serious threat to the stability of the financial systems of the United Kingdom; or, secondly, the exercise of the power is necessary to protect the public interest where the Treasury has provided financial assistance in respect of the bank for the purpose of resolving or reducing a serious threat to the stability of the financial systems of the United Kingdom. Moreover, Clause 81(3) requires that it be necessary to take action in respect of the holding company; that is, the holding company cannot be taken into temporary public ownership if the conditions for Clause 9 could be satisfied by taking action in respect of the failing bank alone.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09020313000191"></a>I make it quite clear that these conditions would not be at all likely to be met with respect to a holding company containing a very small bank, as might apply at the moment to Tesco, although I suspect that that bank might become very large, and certainly no other financial institutions in the group, however subservient they might be to the holding company.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09020313000192"></a>That last point brings me to one problem with the amendment. It would prevent the Treasury from taking action where a group contained a failing bank representing, for the sake of argument, 40 per cent of its business, a healthy insurance company representing 40 per cent and a healthy investment bank, if that is not an oxymoron, representing the final 20 per cent. One of the reasons why we have had to take these powers is the complex and interrelated business structure of financial groups. The SRR powers, as they stand in relation to banks, will allow the banks in such groups to be resolved. But there is the risk that resolution of the bank would not prevent contagion to other financial institutions in the group, the failure of which could also pose a real threat to financial stability. Nor would the amendment allow for action to be taken with respect to holding companies that contained multiple banks that might each represent less than half of the group&#146;s business.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09020313000193"></a>Fundamentally, the problem with this amendment is that it seeks to set an arbitrary threshold for the Treasury to be able to intervene and to hardwire this into the Bill. I believe that the approach that we have taken, which provides the Treasury with the flexibility to act depending on whether action is in the public interest, is more appropriate and will lead to less uncertainty and confusion. I hope that this has satisfied the noble Baroness that her amendment is not necessary or appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="09020313000244"></a>However, Clause 13(2), merely talks about the ability to make share transfers. Clause 13(1), which is not referred to in Clause 81, refers to the third stabilisation option and therefore, presumably, would pull in the other powers. Clause 82(1) refers specifically to Clause 13(3), which deals with the code of practice making provision about management. There is no other reference to the code of practice, which implies that the code does not otherwise apply. That is the reverse of what the Minister was suggesting in Committee and the Minister&#146;s officials have suggested subsequently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09020313000197"></a>The various piecemeal references in Clause 82 to odd clauses in Part 1 imply that the holding company nationalisation power is not firmly placed within the special resolution regime and therefore, it is not easy to read across Clause 4 with the objectives or Clause 5 with the code, because of the way it appears to draw in small bits from that part.

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09020313000199"></a>I shall be brief in explaining how this is already the legal effect of the Bill and, therefore, why this amendment is unnecessary. The power to take a bank holding company into temporary public ownership involves the use of the share transfer power. Clause 81(1) of the Bill enables the Treasury to take a bank holding company into temporary public ownership in accordance with Clause 13(2), which provides that temporary public ownership may be effected through the making of share transfer orders. This power to make a share transfer order is, under Clause 1(4), defined as one of the stabilisation powers of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09020313000200"></a>The special resolution objectives and the code of practice already clearly apply to the stabilisation powers under the provisions of Clauses 4 and 5. Accordingly, holding company temporary public ownership, which, as I have described, can only be achieved through the stabilisation powers, clearly attracts these provisions. Therefore, the Bill already has the legal effect that the noble Baroness is seeking. The draft code of practice will, in due course, be updated to include provision about the bank holding company temporary public ownership power. On the basis of this explanation and assurance, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment</p>

It is the same amendment that I introduced in Committee regarding the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. I did not feel that the Minister gave entirely satisfactory answers then, so I have returned to it. In particular, I did not think he recognised the political significance of the need to change the way that the scheme is operated.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09020313000203"></a>My new clause, which would amend the Financial Services and Markets Act, would do basically three things: it would use a bank-brand basis for deposit compensation, with the Treasury defining what that was; it would use a gross balance concept for compensation; and it would set the deposit compensation limit at &#163;50,000 with a Treasury power to raise it. At the moment, the FSA has control over those things. I will not rehearse the arguments that we had in Committee but, broadly, we&#151;and, I think, the Liberal Democrats&#151;did not think that the FSA had been seen to be fleet of foot in the past. It took ages to up the compensation limit to &#163;50,000 and it still has not dealt with the branch bank issue or the gross balance issue, notwithstanding the increased focus in the light of the events of the past year. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, demolished the FSA&#146;s &#147;let&#146;s wait for Europe&#148; line in Committee. All these issues are fundamentally political, but the FSA is not, or ought not to be, political. The Government rightly have no power of direction over the FSA, so Parliament is the right place for decisions of this nature to be made.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09020313000204"></a>Given that the FSA does not have a reputation for speedy responses, we believe it is right that the Government, with Parliament, should be in control of these important issues. We recognise that the FSA has a new chairman who is much respected in your Lordships&#146; House, but he has nearly a decade of attitudes and practices to overturn and make more workable, and this is not necessarily going to be at the top of his priorities. Issues like the levels and nature of compensation have such a resonance that they ought to be handled in an arena such as Parliament. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09020313000205"></a><b><a name="90203-0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09020313000457"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, the purpose of Part 4 is to make a number of changes to Part 15 of the Financial Services and Markets Act, which provides the legal framework for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. As I explained in Committee, that framework already allows the Financial Services Authority to deal in its rules with most features of the compensation scheme, and I am afraid I have to take the same view of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment now as I took then. However, I shall address some of the points raised in Committee and again today, and I hope I shall be able to convince your Lordships that the matters in the amendment are best dealt with by the FSA in its rules.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09020313000206"></a>First, there is the question of the speed with which the FSA can make its rules. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 lays down a process that the Financial Services Authority must follow in making its rules. This process normally involves public consultation so, with the best will in the world, it will take a minimum of three months. In practice, of course, it will take longer if a full and open consultation is to be pursued. One must allow also for internal consideration, informal consultation and discussion papers and consideration of the responses to consultation. I am sure that your Lordships would agree that where Parliament confers wide-ranging powers to make rules on a body such as the FSA, there is real merit in having such processes in place. But the Financial Services and Markets Act also allows the FSA to short-circuit this process if it,</p>
<ul><a name="09020313000306"></a>&#147;considers that the delay involved in complying...would be prejudicial to the interests of consumers&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90203-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09020313000207"></a>It is under that provision that the FSA acted to remove the co-insurance element in the deposit protection rules of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme in September 2007 and to raise the deposit compensation limit to &#163;50,000 in October 2008. I struggle to agree, therefore, with the noble Baroness, who says that the FSA has not always evidenced the capacity to be fleet of foot; or indeed with the observation in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that the FSA had been,</p>
<ul><a name="09020313000307"></a>&#147;dilatory beyond measure in increasing the limit to &#163;50,000&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/1/09; col. 1656.]</ul>
<p><a name="09020313000245"></a>An increase to &#163;50,000 had already been widely discussed, including in the authority&#146;s joint consultation documents on financial stability and depositor protection, which preceded the Bill, while the specific FSA proposal to raise the limit to &#163;50,000 had been known since July 2008.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09020313000246"></a>In the circumstances of last autumn, when ongoing market turbulence meant that consumers appeared to be increasingly concerned about the level of coverage  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_586"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 586</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>available for their savings, the FSA decided that an immediate increase to &#163;50,000, without formal consultation, was in the interests of consumers to reduce any continuing uncertainty. I do not see how the Treasury could have acted more swiftly, particularly if the necessary regulations were subject to the affirmative procedure. Clearly, it would be impossible to move as swiftly with the draft affirmative procedure if Parliament was not sitting.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09020313000247"></a>I accept, of course, that it would make little or no difference in normal circumstances. The Treasury would obviously consult widely before producing a draft regulation. It may even publish draft regulations for consultation before they were laid in Parliament. But normal circumstances are not the problem. I have no doubt that when it comes to unusual circumstances, the FSA is better placed to move quickly and has already demonstrated that it can do so.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09020313000248"></a>On the content of the regulations, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, argued in Committee&#151;and I think the noble Lord, Lord Newby, agreed with this&#151;that some decisions about the compensation scheme were too important to be left to the FSA. They were, as she said today, as much political as technical.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09020313000249"></a>I see the point, but I think that there might be a misunderstanding about the nature of what we might call the legislative hierarchy in the Financial Services and Markets Act. Essentially, the Act provides for the framework for the regulation of all financial services in the United Kingdom&#151;not just banking. Some aspects of that framework are set out in the Act itself; other aspects of the framework are provided in secondary legislation made under the Act.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09020313000208"></a>Detail, on the other hand, is left for the Financial Services Authority to deal with in its rules. So the distinction is not between what is political and what is technical but between what is framework and what is detail. I would also say that the political/technical distinction would be an unworkable basis for deciding what should be in primary or secondary legislation and what should be in the FSA&#146;s rules. What may be political to one person may be technical for another. What was political one day might be technical the next&#151;or vice versa. How many people would have described the deposit compensation limit as political two years ago? And if the deposit compensation limit is political today, why is the investor compensation limit not political? If paying compensation on a per-brand basis is political, why are the eligibility criteria for FSCS claimants not political?</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09020313000209"></a>As I said in Committee, it would be inappropriate simply to put matters relating to deposit-taking in primary legislation. The FSA is better placed in practice, and more logically placed in the FSMA legislative hierarchy, to consult and make rules on these matters, as it is on the other detailed matters in the compensation scheme, and in financial services regulation more generally. I therefore ask, most pleasantly, that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, withdraw Amendment 67.</p>

The Minister referred to the FSA&#146;s view being known since July 2008. The issue was around in 2007. We had to wait for a long time until the FSA actually said that it  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_587"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 587</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be &#163;50,000, and we still do not have it. There is deep frustration with the FSA&#146;s inability to act. This is probably just one in a number of examples of how the FSA operates, and it is probably wrong to focus on three aspects of one compensation scheme when the issues with the FSA are so much bigger.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09020313000211"></a>One hopes that if the noble Lord, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, reads <I>Hansard</I>, for which I do not suppose he has time, he might note that, from what has been said both here and in Committee, the organisation that he now chairs is not held in particularly high regard in a number of respects. I accept that this would not be an appropriate time to make a piecemeal change and, on that basis, I beg leave to withdraw.</p>

<a name="90203-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09020313000213"></a>We have given careful consideration to the points made by the noble Baroness in Committee regarding exemptions from liability for payment system operators acting under direction from the Bank of England.

It is a valuable representation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09020313000214"></a>In Committee, the noble Baroness referred to a scenario in which an operator could be instructed by the Bank of England, under its power to give directions, to continue to allow a failing bank to participate in a payment system even where that bank no longer met the criteria for participation. The point was raised as to whether the operator would be provided with an exemption from the Bank in respect of any liability in damages arising from acting in accordance with the Bank&#146;s direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09020313000215"></a>The power to give directions is intended to provide a tool for the Bank to use in furtherance of the objectives of this part of the Bill; that is, to ensure that  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_588"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 588</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recognised interbank payment systems are operated in a manner that minimises deficiencies and disruptions that could threaten the stability of, or confidence in, the UK financial system, or have serious consequences for businesses or other interests throughout the UK. Therefore, we do not envisage circumstances in which the power would be exercised in the manner suggested by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09020313000216"></a>Given her concern, however, we have sought to address the matter further. The government amendments in this group would confer a power on the Treasury to grant an operator exemption from liability in damages for acts or omissions carried out in accordance with a direction, if this is appropriate in the circumstances. Amendment 68 enables the Treasury to,</p>
<ul><a name="09020313000308"></a>&#147;confer immunity from liability in damages in respect of action or inaction in accordance with a direction&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020313000250"></a>Amendment 115 is consequential, updating the statutory instrument table in Part 8.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09020313000217"></a>We consider that the Bank should notify the Treasury before making a direction so that the Treasury has an opportunity to consider whether it would be appropriate to make an exemption order. As the Bank may need to give a direction urgently in the interests of financial stability, we consider that the order should be subject to the negative resolution procedure. For obvious reasons, it will be important that any exemption is in place at the time the direction is given.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09020313000218"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would give a rather more blanket exemption from liability in damages in respect of actions or inactions taken in accordance with any direction of the Bank. We do not think that such an exemption is appropriate. We have accepted that there is a need to have this power but it would not be appropriate to give an exemption from liability in damages in all cases. For example, if the Bank merely directs that an operator should comply with specific minimum standards in respect of business continuity, no such exemption from liability would be necessary. I hope that I have established the case for the government amendment and that the noble Baroness will not move her amendment.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09020313000222"></a>In Committee, the Government committed to revisiting before Report the penalty clauses of Parts 5 and 6. Having reflected on the comments raised in Committee and by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, we have tabled amendments to address the concerns raised.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09020313000223"></a>I note that the noble Baroness has laid similar amendments. I think it is clear from the nature of our amendments that we largely agree on the basis on which to proceed, but I will explain why I believe that the Government&#146;s amendments are necessary. Government Amendment 70 provides that the Bank of England must prepare and publish a statement of the principles which it will apply in determining whether to impose a penalty and the amount of the penalty in respect of a compliance failure under Part 5. It is intended that these principles will preserve the Bank&#146;s discretion in assessing whether to impose a penalty and the quantum of that penalty but will enhance the transparency of the enforcement regime, which was a focal point of a great deal of our deliberations in Committee.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09020313000224"></a>These principles will no doubt reflect the range of factors that will need to be taken into account in the decision process; for example, the scale of the compliance failure and the seriousness of the consequences arising as a result of the failure, the resources of the payment system and the frequency of the offence. However, in the interests of preserving the Bank&#146;s discretion in preparing and issuing the statement, we do not consider it appropriate to specify in the Bill the factors that must be taken into account by the Bank.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09020313000225"></a>The statement of policy must be published on the Bank&#146;s website and a copy must be sent to the Treasury. This publication requirement is adequate to ensure that the policy is brought to the attention of operators of recognised interbank payment systems and the general public. The Bank must review and revise a policy from time to time, as appropriate. In the interests of fairness, naturally any penalty imposed by the Bank must be in accordance with the published policy at the time that the compliance failure was committed. This offers guidance to operators of recognised interbank payment systems, while maintaining the necessary flexibility for the Bank to impose appropriate penalties in all relevant circumstances. I hope it will be recognised that the Government have responded to anxieties about transparency expressed during Committee.</p>

In Committee, we sought to demonstrate that the banknote regulations will set out the matters about which banknote rules may make provision. The regulations are subject to the draft affirmative procedure, and so I set out the Government&#146;s case that the parliamentary scrutiny to which the regulations would be subject would ensure that there was no inappropriate delegation to the Bank in making banknote rules.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09020313000227"></a>However, we have reflected on the comments made in Committee and, of course, we have noted with great care the comments of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. This amendment provides that the Treasury must specify in banknote regulations a method for determining the maximum amount of penalty that may be imposed by the Bank for a breach of regulations or rules. I hope that this amendment addresses concerns that the Bank could conceivably have been enabled to set unlimited penalties under the banknote rules.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09020313000228"></a>It is intended that the banknote regulations will set out a formula for calculating the penalty to be imposed for under-backing and will make provision in relation to a statement of policy on penalties to which the Bank must have regard when determining the maximum level of the penalty imposed. I should bring to the attention of the House that provision has already been drafted at paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the draft banknote regulations providing that the amount of any penalty must be determined in accordance with a published statement of policy.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09020313000229"></a>Thus, I believe that government Amendment 73, together with existing provisions of the regulations, meet the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Howard, expressed in Committee and in their amendment.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09020313000230"></a>Finally, as regards making express provision in the Bill in respect of the statement of policy on penalties imposed under Part 6, we have conceded that an amendment to this effect is necessary to Part 5 of the Bill, but it is neither appropriate nor necessary in relation to Part 6. I beg to move.</p>

The power in the clause was already very wide when the Government introduced the Bill to the other place in October, but it was intended for financial stability purposes. That was clear from the debates in another place, and that was the basis on which we accepted the power.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09020313000233"></a>In Committee in your Lordships&#146; House, the Government radically changed the scope of the powers in the clause by allowing any Secretary of State, not just the Treasury, to give financial assistance on a very wide basis. That basis is set out in subsection (2). The Minister agreed in Committee that the planned use of this power would go way beyond mere financial stability, public confidence in banking systems and depositor protection.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09020325000001"></a>In ordinary times, we would have said that it was inappropriate to include such a power in the Bill; that if Secretaries of State needed legislative cover for their schemes, they should go and get it themselves. However, as I said in Committee, we accepted that these were not ordinary times and we did want to impede the measures that the Government are taking. We did feel, because of the extraordinary nature of the powers, that they should be sunsetted after two years. In Committee, the Minister pointed out that my sunset clause would not have allowed money to be paid out in respect of obligations entered into in the two-year period, and that this would kill off some schemes currently being introduced, which are based largely on guarantees. I had not intended that effect, and my amendment for Report leaves cover for obligations entered into in the two-year period. The idea is that, if there is a continuing need for financial assistance by one of more Secretaries of State at the end of the two-year period, it would be open to that Secretary of State to bring forward his own legislation. Alternatively, in extremis, the Government could bring forward a one-clause Bill to extend the powers in the clause for a further period. Obviously, if circumstances still merited it, I am sure that both Houses would facilitate the passage of such a short Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09020325000002"></a>If we allow the Bill to contain this clause without further restraint, we will be giving the Government a power to spend what they like, when they like, for ever and a day. Any power, including a financial power,

It did not find favour with the Government, nor with the noble Baroness. However, half a loaf is better than no bread, and this is a little sunset clause. Although it does not go as far as we want, at least it is a sunset clause.</p>

<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="09020325000004"></a><b><a name="90203-0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09020325000029"></a>Lord Stewartby:</b> My Lords, it is indeed a sunset clause, albeit of a limited kind, which I think is needed in a case like this. There are so many different powers in the Bill that the Government, or various arms of the Government, may wish to pursue, that putting a termination date on this part of it seems necessary. Personally, I would have accepted a period of three years rather than two, given the speed at which things change. However, the Bill is unusually complex and has been put together, at great speed, against a background of changing conditions in the marketplace and in activities that are covered by it. While I would be content with a slightly longer period than two years, some termination and restraint on the timing is necessary. Therefore, I favour the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="09020325000005"></a><b><a name="90203-0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09020325000030"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, the purpose of Clause 227 is to provide statutory cover for expenditure incurred under Parts 1 to 3 of the Bill, or in giving financial assistance more generally to benefit financial institutions and their customers, in order to enable the Government&#146;s response to the current difficult economic climate to be taken forward expeditiously. The purpose of subsection (2) is to provide that essentially routine statutory coverage for expenditure for schemes that might be operated by the Treasury or other departments, but which are not directed solely at assisting banks or other financial institutions.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09020325000006"></a>One would normally include this provision in legislation brought in by the appropriate government department. However, these are extraordinary times and the Government have had to move with urgency to bring forward measures, such as the homeowner mortgage support scheme or the working capital scheme, to deal with the situation. That does not mean that the Bill is not about banks and financial institutions. Clause 227 is still primarily about providing statutory cover for the provision of financial assistance in connection with the SRR, or to banks or financial institutions.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09020325000007"></a>Financial assistance provided to banks and financial institutions may also benefit other persons; for example, the customers of banks, a particular industry or part of the economy, or the economy as a whole. Schemes such as the homeowner mortgage support scheme are a good example of this. The scheme provides assistance to banks, but allows them to adopt a more flexible approach to homeowners struggling to make their mortgage repayments. Thus it also assists homeowners. Without subsection (2), there would be doubt about whether mixed schemes of this kind, which facilitate the bank or financial institution in carrying on its business and which also assist third parties, are covered by the provision.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_593"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 593</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90203-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09020325000008"></a>Amendment 75 would limit the scope of such schemes to two years. It would mean that, on the expiry of the subsection, a narrower, technical approach to the provision of financial assistance to banks and financial institutions would have to be taken. Each scheme would have to be closely analysed to determine the &#147;real&#148; beneficiaries of any assistance. I do not see merit in this approach.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09020325000009"></a>I appreciate the concerns behind the amendment. I recognise also that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has sought to address one concern I raised about a similar amendment that she put forward in Committee. I was concerned that a sunset provision in this clause might mean that guarantee schemes might never get off the ground. This new amendment seeks to address that point, and for that I express my gratitude.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09020325000010"></a>However, I still have concerns about how the amendment would operate in practice. As I understand it, the intention is to ensure that obligations entered into before the sunset period expires can be met afterwards, so that schemes initiated before the sunset period expires can continue to run. However, what would happen if, after the expiry of the sunset period, the terms of an existing scheme had to be modified? Would the provision cease to apply? That might depend on the nature and scale of the modifications. A careful analysis would be needed to determine whether this was still the &#147;same&#148; obligation entered into before the sunset period expired, or whether the modifications to the scheme were so substantial that the obligation had become a &#147;new&#148; obligation, not covered by the provision. Such an approach could be difficult to operate, and risk preventing sensible and appropriate modifications to existing schemes.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09020325000011"></a>These are extraordinary times, and the Government must take action, often with unusual haste. I hope, as I am sure does every other Member of the House, that these schemes will not be needed after two years, or will not need to be changed after that time. However, I do not want to promise that at this stage. As I said in Committee, fixing a time limit now would be an unnecessary and unwise hostage to fortune. I hope, therefore, that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, will agree to withdraw Amendment 75.</p>

I am interested in particular in the idea that the legislation would govern any decision to provide assistance to people with mortgages who are in difficulties. I did not understand that that was required in this legislation. The Department for Communities and Local Government runs the scheme, but I did not think that it was restricted to customers of banks under the special resolution regime who might benefit.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09020325000013"></a>If I follow the Minister&#146;s logic, he also said that we require this clause to provide to banks anything that then assists their customers above and beyond normal business, into which category shared equity schemes, which the Government have been promoting for some time, would also fall. So I gently suggest to him that I really do not follow that logic and I am not sure that, in terms of these examples, his explanation is entirely consistent with current and previous practice.</p>

Earlier today, we debated Clause 75 where the Government are taking unprecedented powers and such unprecedented powers are being taken in other areas of the Bill as well. This too is an unprecedented way of getting cover for the kind of schemes which the Minister has in mind. He has turned a financial stability support clause into one which will support any Secretary of State funnelling any amount of money as long as it goes via a bank or other financial institution.</p>

<a name="90203-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09020325000016"></a>The Minister says that he does not see merit in the amendment. From a constitutional position, there is massive merit in the amendment because it restricts the Government to these exceptional emergency powers for a reasonable time. That is a normal thing for Governments to do. We are constantly being faced with the argument that extraordinary times justify all these actions. At some stage that will not work. The Minister's argument about changing a scheme is so minor as not to be worth responding to. If the authority were to run out, obviously the Government would have to take a new scheme and they would not change a scheme to change existing obligations. These are not substantive points, but I accept that the Minister has threatened the House, using the phrase &#147;hostages to fortune&#148;, and the emotive language which the Government like to deploy when trying to get their own way in taking huge powers. On this occasion I shall withdraw the amendment, but it is the last time I will withdraw an amendment of this nature on this Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

My amendments replace the blanket permission in subsection (6) not to reveal the identity of the financial institution which receives urgent financial assistance with a more specific public interest let out which is already contained in subsection (7). Since tabling the amendment, I have noticed that in Amendment 80 the Government have tabled similar subsections to Clause 228 and my amendments should be mirrored there.</p>

We seem to be in a position where the amount of expenditure will be disclosed but the recipient will not. We have to ask ourselves whether that should always be the case. If a bank in trouble is assisted by the authorities, but in the mean time goes, for example, to find people who can raise capital and it puts the deficit in its capital to rights and repays the assistance, one could take the view that that should never be revealed. The fact that someone borrowed from the bank could be revealed but you would never say which bank it was. Alternatively, should we follow the principle that, as soon as it is possible to say that it would not damage the bank or plunge it back into the problem that it had faced originally, its identity should be disclosed?</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09020325000020"></a>I can remember in the early 1990s, when I was at the Treasury, having discussions with the then Governor, the noble Lord, Lord George, and I think the agreement was that when assistance was given by the Bank&#151;they were much smaller banks in those days than we are now talking about&#151;the amount or the identity would not be revealed immediately, but that it would appear in the first annual report of the bank which appeared after six months. However, I cannot remember whether only the amount of the assistance was revealed in the annual report or the name as well. There may be two distinct, subsequent announcements: first, that a scheme has been used and the amount and, secondly&#151;this is what I am seeking guidance on&#151;that a particular bank received help. I suppose the case for doing that would be wanting to judge whether the bank's judgment was correct. The bank may have survived but it may have been rather a foolish thing to have done. Are we entitled to know? Is that as much as Parliament is entitled to know or will we stick, as we have now in Clause 227, and add the requirements in the following clauses on the National Loans Fund that only the amount and the fact of some help is to be revealed?</p>

I should have thought that any such assistance would be a market-sensitive fact which would normally have to be disclosed anyway, assuming it is a public listed company. How would any information which the Government put into the public domain relate to the obligations on the directors and the timing difference between those matters?</p>

Subsections (1) and (2) are fairly routine parts of the Bill. Clause 227(5) is less ordinary. It allows for direct access to the Consolidated Fund in urgent cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09020325000023"></a>This subsection is unusual, but it is not unprecedented. First, there are already what are called Consolidated Fund standing services provided for in Acts of Parliament. A Consolidated Fund standing service is a service where the money to finance the service can be taken directly from the Consolidated Fund rather than being voted first in supply estimates. There is also provision in some Acts for direct access to the Consolidated Fund to meet government commitments where estimates provision is not available. A good example is the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991. But direct access to the Consolidated Fund for expenditure does not mean that it is not subject to proper control, reporting or accounting. No payment may be made out of the Consolidated Fund without the prior approval of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The amounts paid out will, suitably aggregated, appear in the annual accounts of the Consolidated Fund. There will be National Audit Office scrutiny and the Treasury will have to answer to the Public Accounts Committee in the normal way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09020336000003"></a>I fully appreciate, not least as a Treasury Minister, that it is not ideal for anyone concerned with public finances to be told that one cannot be informed about what happened with public money. The plain fact is that some of the schemes or arrangements could not operate or would never be taken up by institutions concerned if there was any chance that their identity might become known. There may be cases where knowledge of public support could precipitate the kind of crisis we were seeking to prevent.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09020336000004"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, that I believe that that applies even in cases where, after assistance was received, the amounts were fully repaid. The disclosure of that fact would raise questions about the structure, efficacy, governance, risk controls, and so on, of the recipient institution. There may also be instances where it is essential to keep payments under a guarantee or similar commitment confidential. As well as a need to be able to delay or dispense with a report on grounds of public interest, we must be able to assure participants in some schemes that we can keep confidential their participation and any payments we have made under any guarantees or similar financial commitments entered into for their benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09020336000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, also asked about disclosure in the Bank&#146;s annual report. To the best of my recollection, the Bank's annual report now discloses that no financial assistance has been provided since a certain date. Obviously, that may well change in the Bank&#146;s next annual report. I am speaking here on the

If I am incorrect in my explanation, I will write to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09020336000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, asked about the obligations that would fall on the directors of a bank if the bank was a public company under listing regimes. I would rather give him a very precise and correct answer, so rather than anticipate the answer, which I am tempted to do, I prefer to take guidance and will write to the noble Lord and copy my reply to others who have spoken to the amendment. I fully accept the point that he makes: if there were an obligation to disclose under the listing requirement, part of the argument in favour of anonymity here would be undermined for public companies.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09020336000007"></a>To close, we have, therefore, to keep the anonymity provisions in Clause 227(6), and I am afraid that the Government cannot accept Amendments 76 and 78 , tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. I hope that in the light of that explanation she will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

There has been some discussion of what was done with the Bank of England's accounts.

We undertook in Committee to look at points made and reflect further. The amendment is our response to those Committee debates.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09020336000011"></a>I shall have a little more to say on the subject of transparency in general when we come to Amendment 81, and why the Government believe it to be unnecessary, but let me concentrate first on the merits of the government amendment.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09020336000012"></a>It is important to understand that the financial provisions in Clauses 227 and 228 fulfil a largely routine function in providing statutory cover for public expenditure. One consequence is that they automatically attract the standard arrangements for control, reporting and accounting of public expenditure.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09020336000013"></a>Clause 227 attracts those mechanisms that apply to expenditure from the Consolidated Fund, whether voted in Estimates or taken directly as a standing service. Clause 228 automatically attracts the normal machinery for the control, reporting and accounting for payments from the National Loans Fund. For example, no expenditure on loans may be paid out of the National Loans Fund without the approval of the Comptroller and Auditor-General under the National Loans Act 1968. All loans from the National Loans Fund are included in the annual accounts of the fund.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09020336000014"></a>The National Loans Fund can only make loans, so Clause 228 could never replace the emergency provisions in Clause 227(5), but it serves a similar purpose in that loans can also be made from Votes&#151;provided, of course, that the necessary Estimates cover has been obtained, or that the resources can be taken from the Contingencies Fund.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09020336000015"></a>So the Government felt, on reflection, that the same kind of reporting arrangements as apply for the urgent payments under Clause 227(5) should be made for individual emergency loans under Clause 228. Amendment 80 does that with the same kind of anonymity and public interest conditions as Clauses 227(6) and (7) provide.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09020336000016"></a>There are already in place well-established arrangements for accounting and reporting which will cope with most of what may happen under Clauses 227 and 228 in the normal way. The additional reporting arrangements that the Government now propose will ensure that emergency payments from the National Loans Fund will have the same reporting arrangements as those that Clause 227 provides for emergency payments, direct from the Consolidated Fund.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09020336000019"></a>We debated in Committee a longer and more detailed version of the amendment, and the Minister said that he would take the issue away to look at it. All he has produced is a little bit of extra reporting set out in Amendment 80, to which we have just agreed. I declined to group the amendment with Amendment 80, because they operate at quite different levels and I did not want the House to think that they were in some sense the same approach to transparency, because they are not.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09020336000020"></a>We noted in Committee that one thing that is not well reported to Parliament is commitments as well as cash. My amendment seeks to capture commitments as well as cash outflows. The latest schemes introduced by the Government to stave off the recession have typically involved guarantees rather than cash. Where and how can Parliament keep an eye on how much contingent liability is being racked up for the future? The answer is probably the annual resource accounts of the Treasury. As the recent report of the Treasury Select Committee in another place noted, the information that is contained in those accounts is painfully inadequate, and of course is not timely.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09020336000021"></a>My amendment calls for a quarterly report to Parliament, so that Parliament can track the build-up of both cash and commitments under the various financial assistance schemes that now exist under the very wide powers that together Clauses 227 and 228 comprise. In Committee, the Minister queried whether it was appropriate for the Treasury to report on other departments&#146; financial assistance. That is not a real point. The powers can only be used with the consent of the Treasury, and of course, we are entitled to look to the Treasury to pull together relevant pan-government financial analysis. That is one of the things the Treasury is there for. I should also note that my amendment has the usual let-out on public interest grounds for as long as the public interest may be affected, so there should be no question of having to disclosed information that is of a sensitive nature.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09020336000022"></a>In sum, this is a perfectly reasonable amendment that has the needs of parliamentary accountability at its heart. I beg to move.</p>

It also provides, as she has said, a pragmatic solution to the issue of whether market intervention should be kept confidential&#151;that is, that information may be withheld, but should be released once there is no danger of exacerbating the problem that the authorities are trying to solve.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09020336000024"></a>In addition to the parliamentary requirement, there is a more general requirement. The Treasury and the Bank are using a wide variety of techniques to counter the current problems. There is a special liquidity scheme, equity stakes in banks, preference shares, guarantees of inter-bank lending, risk sharing for lending into companies, refinancing of mortgages, lending which substitutes for bank lending, insurance of so-called toxic assets and, possibly in the future, purchase of such assets.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09020336000025"></a>Different interventions are being injected at different points in the process. Some may be in money markets, some direct into banks and some towards their credit-starved customers. Some assistance may be provided under the powers of this Bill, some under other powers, some under the Appropriation Act, and as the previous two clauses show, there are different channels through which they can be financed. One&#146;s head spins in the face of all this.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09020336000026"></a>I think there is a strong need for a regular report which would take the provisions of this clause as its kernel, but would actually go beyond it. It would bring together all the different ways in which the Government and the Bank are responding to the financial crisis. It should identify each scheme under a consistent nomenclature; when it was announced; how much has been committed; how much has been drawn; what guarantees have been offered; any losses crystallised to date; the powers used; and the source of the funding.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09020336000027"></a>Above all, it must be clear and simple. Regrettably, the Pre-Budget Report and the Budget documents have become virtually unusable. They are rather like those cumulation songs, such as the &#147;Twelve Days of Christmas&#148;, or &#147;Ten Green Bottles&#148;, when not only are this year&#146;s actions reported, but all the previous years&#146; actions are repeated until the document becomes ever bigger. The latest version should simply be compared with those produced 10 years ago.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09020336000028"></a>This amendment provides the foundation of such a report, and that is why I, too, am happy to support it.</p>

One of the problems about the situation we are in now, which the Government&#146;s provisions do not solve, is that there is a whole raft of statements, a whole raft of commitments, and it is very difficult to bring them all together and get a sense of what they are at any one time, and also, how they are growing. The great advantage of this amendment is that it produces a series so you can see from one quarter to the next how the situation is changing. In terms of getting a sense of the overall level of government commitment, it is far superior to the provisions that the Government have placed so far in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09020336000033"></a>We have already said a lot on the matter of transparency in relation to those parts of the Bill which provide for financial assistance to be made, but I think I need to spell out why the Government are opposed to Amendment 81.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09020336000034"></a>We live in extraordinary times and this Bill is intended to deal with the consequences of extraordinary events. Some of the powers in the Bill are, therefore, themselves rather extraordinary. We have had attention drawn to that during the course of the debate this afternoon. The House is of course concerned about the scope of these powers and about the provision for parliamentary control and oversight of their use. The Government would have expected nothing less and we appreciate the importance of responding to these concerns.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09020336000035"></a>However, not every power or provision in the Bill is extraordinary. Some are quite ordinary&#151;even routine&#151;and that is true of parts of Clauses 227 and 228, as we have discussed at length in the preceding debates. For example, Clause 227(1) is essentially a standard provision included in all Bills that might involve public expenditure. It gives the proper coverage for the use of the annual Supply Estimates to provide the funds for government departments to carry out their programmes. This provision is to be found in countless Acts of Parliament already on the statute book. And Clause 227(1) attracts all the normal apparatus of Parliamentary control, reporting and accountability for the expenditure concerned.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09020336000036"></a>No money, therefore, will be spent on any of the schemes covered by subsection (1)&#151;or for that matter subsection (2)&#151;unless the necessary Estimates have been approved in the normal way by the House of Commons and incorporated in an Appropriation Act or a Consolidated Fund Act, or unless funds have been taken from the Contingencies Fund in line with other long-standing arrangements. Or&#151;and this is where a reference to some non-routine provisions must be made&#151;it has been necessary to use the provisions in subsection (5), which provide the Treasury with direct access to the Consolidated Fund in cases of urgency.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09020336000037"></a>But there is more. No funds can be issued from the Consolidated Fund, even after an Estimate has been passed, without the approval of the Comptroller and Auditor-General under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09020336000038"></a>Where Estimates are involved, of course, expenditure will always be fully within normal departmental accounting systems. It will be included in departmental resource accounts and subject to National Audit Office scrutiny and audit. The schemes will be discussed in departmental reports, and scrutinised by departmental select committees and the Public Accounts Committee in another place. All of this apparatus will be attracted routinely and automatically by the departmental spending decisions, by the Estimates and by the statutory cover for those Estimates which Clause 227(1) and (2) provide.</p>

<a name="90203-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09020336000039"></a>As I said a few minutes ago, Clause 228 automatically attracts the normal machinery of parliamentary accountability. The Government do not feel, therefore,

Subsection (1)(c) of the proposed new clause opens up the issue of guarantees or any other form of contingent liability, which do not, as I explained in Committee, give rise to any expenditure when they are given. They give rise to expenditure only when they are called. So the normal mechanisms for reporting expenditure, which I have just described, do not bite on guarantees when they are given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09020336000040"></a>This does not mean that they go unreported. Contingent liabilities that are not entered into in the normal course of business are normally reported to Parliament by means of a departmental minute when the commitment is entered into. Of course, some guarantees have to be kept confidential; the established practice is that these are reported in confidence to the chairmen of the Public Accounts Committee and the departmental Select Committee. Contingent liabilities are also reported in the annual departmental resource accounts. There is, of course, full National Audit Office scrutiny and audit in the normal way.</p>

<a name="90203-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09020336000041"></a>I can appreciate why the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, see a need for additional regular reporting of guarantees or similar commitments entered into under Clause 227(1), but this would not, in practice, add much to the arrangements that I have just described and which would continue to apply. I am afraid that this would also be impracticable, when at least some of the guarantees might be large and might have to be kept confidential. The problem is, of course, that if some commitments are kept confidential while others are not, there will inevitably be a mismatch between some published total and the sum of the numbers in the column above, which it would be hard to conceal.

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09020336000042"></a>I hope that I have persuaded the House that there are already in place well established arrangements for accounting and reporting which will cope with most of what may happen under Clauses 227 and 228 in the normal way, and that the additional reporting arrangements in Clause 227(6) and Clause 227(7), which are now repeated in Clause 228, are suitable for the more unusual things that may happen under these clauses. I noted the strength with which the noble Baroness presented her amendment. I hope that, on reflection, she will accept that the Government have considered these issues and she will feel able to safely withdraw Amendment 81.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, that it is important to try to bring together all the schemes that are being used to provide assistance or support in various ways. The amendment deals with the money that comes from Parliament; it does not necessarily capture absolutely everything that goes through the Bank of England directly, but it covers the majority of it. I further agree with the noble Lord on the content of the PBR and the Budget, but we will have that debate another day.</p>

<a name="90203-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09020336000045"></a>The Minister tried to portray the provisions of Clauses 227 and 228 as rather routine. I am sure that much is routine in their structure, although not the latter&#146;s subsections. The issue is that the content is not routine. The content endorses both the payment and the commitment of very large sums of money. We learnt in Committee that this clause is being used to frank the &#163;37 billion already committed via bank rescue 1. This clause will provide the backing for anything that comes out of bank rescue 2, including the guarantees to the Bank of England. This clause will provide the cover for the various guarantee schemes that the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, has been announcing, as well as other schemes. We are talking about major sums of public money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09020336000046"></a>The Minister explained about estimates and the Comptroller and Auditor-General, none of which is in dispute. The issue is how we pull information together so that Parliament can, over time, track the build-up of not only the money that has been spent but, more important, the money that has been committed. These are exceptional times and it is right that Parliament should have an exceptional degree of scrutiny of what is being done under the authority provided by the Bill. Parliament should not have to wait for the normal production of annual accounts or the laying of Treasury minutes. The information should be pulled together and explained. This is a very important issue. I do not believe that any of the Government&#146;s objections have real substance. I beg leave to test the opinion of the House.</p>

One such area is the Government&#146;s provisions for investment bank insolvency. While these provisions have been accepted by the House, there are a number of areas where the Government continue to work to refine the proposals. It has therefore been agreed through the usual channels that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and I will not move Amendments 82, 83 and 84, relating to Clauses 230 and 233, today. We will return to these matters at Third Reading.</p>

The Government have reached a similar minimalist conclusion and tabled Amendment 86, which is in a similar form. I prefer the

<ul><a name="09020336000095"></a>&#147;shall aim to work with&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09020336000074"></a>in the Minister&#146;s amendment. However, I shall listen with care to what the Minister has to say about his amendment before deciding what to do with mine.</p>

<a name="90203-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09020336000052"></a>The amendments in this group, while useful, do not go to the heart of the concerns that we raised about the new arrangements within the Bank of England. I shall not argue them in detail, because many will emerge from the next group of amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. To summarise, there are issues about the Financial Stability Committee not having the right internal or external people on it and there are issues about it ignoring the FSA. It is working to an objective about which there may be a lack of clarity. There may be a need to appoint members to court to fill the Financial Stability Committee, thus unbalancing court. The terms of reference of the committee are a ragbag of overlapping functions and there is no transparency about the committee&#146;s working.</p>

<a name="90203-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09020336000053"></a>I know that the Governor of the Bank of England wants no change to the proposals in the Bill. The Government did not need to put him up to writing formally to the Minister to reinforce that, as it was already well known. I do not believe that the arrangements will work well in practice and I predict that we may well need another bit of legislation to unwind some of this 2009 experiment. However, as the Government have at least accepted the thrust of Amendment 85, we are prepared to listen to their version. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_171"></a>
<a name="09020336000054"></a><b><a name="90203-0009.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09020336000418"></a>Lord Turnbull:</b> My Lords, I regret that I was unable to attend the latter part of the Committee stage, when what is now Clause 235 was debated. I congratulate those who stayed to the bitter end at gone two o&#146;clock in the morning on their stamina. Had I been present, I would have supported the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. The principal shortcoming of the clause was that it almost entirely overlooked the fact that we have a tripartite structure for regulation and crisis management. The clause was entirely introspective, making provision for a change in the structure within the Bank but making no reference to the other players. Hence the amendment, which would insert the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09020336000096"></a>&#147;in co-operation with the Treasury and the FSA&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020336000075"></a>I am pleased to see that the Government have come up with a similar wording. We can debate whether our wording is better than theirs in due course.</p>

<a name="90203-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09020336000055"></a>I know that some people&#151;indeed, some people of great eminence&#151;perhaps driven more by nostalgia than by evidence, long to return to a world where the whole system revolved around the Bank. This Bill, in my view correctly, works on the premise that the tripartite structure should be retained but strengthened. For example, earlier clauses sought to define the areas of responsibility in which each player takes the lead. The old system did not work in the modern world, where threats to financial stability come from insurance companies such as AIG, which I believe is still the largest recipient of assistance anywhere in the world to date, from investment banks such as Lehman Brothers  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_608"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 608</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and, in the crisis in 1998, from hedge funds such as Long-Term Capital Management.</p>

<a name="90203-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09020336000056"></a>If the tripartite system is to be retained, it makes sense for the Government to show their commitment to making it work well and to entrench some wording that places a duty on each of the players to collaborate fully. I, too, will wait to hear what the Minister has to say before deciding whether to support the Government&#146;s wording. However, I think that we are both seeking the same outcome.</p>

<a name="09020336000057"></a><b><a name="90203-0009.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09020336000419"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, I assure the House that I have taken seriously the concerns expressed last week by several noble Lords about the interaction between the members of the tripartite in the area of financial stability. Before turning to the amendments in this group, I emphasise that the Government believe, as I have previously said, that the tripartite system remains fundamentally sound. The Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority all have roles to play in protecting financial stability, but these roles are different, defined and distinct. The tripartite Memorandum of Understanding shows how each must work with the others as appropriate.</p>

<a name="90203-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09020336000058"></a>The Government, with this Banking Bill, are taking steps to further support and strengthen the tripartite system, extending the powers and responsibilities of the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA. We are responding in this way to the call from the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, to evidence our commitment to making sure that the tripartite system works. These steps are being taken in line with each institution&#146;s current mandate and responsibilities, to avoid overlap, to ensure that at each point it is clear which institution is in the lead and to enable each body to rely on and build on its existing expertise and experience. This must surely be the right approach to take, rather than creating overlap, duplication or uncertainty over the extent of an institution&#146;s authority.</p>

<a name="90203-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09020336000059"></a>For example, in establishing the special resolution regime, the Bill sets out resolution processes whereby each of the tripartite authorities has lead responsibility within those areas in which its expertise and authority lie. In addition, where appropriate, where one authority has lead responsibility, the Bill also requires appropriate levels of consultation with the other two authorities.</p>

<a name="90203-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09020336000060"></a>As I have said in debate on several occasions, I entirely agree that full and effective co-operation between the tripartite authorities is both desirable and necessary. That is why the Memorandum of Understanding establishes mechanisms for the tripartite authorities to communicate and co-ordinate their actions in relation to their joint and individual responsibilities. This is especially important in safeguarding the UK&#146;s financial stability, in which, as I said, each of the tripartite authorities has a distinct role to play. It is also vital that they meet regularly to co-ordinate action within their individual spheres of responsibility to address those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09020336000061"></a>When addressing the financial stability objective in the other place, my honourable friend the Exchequer Secretary referred to the phrase &#147;to contribute to&#148; and said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="09020336000089"></a>&#147;That phrase reflects the fact that the Bank does not have a duty to ensure financial stability on its own, because that would

<p><a name="09020336000076"></a>It is clear that the phrase &#147;to contribute to&#148; implies that the UK&#146;s financial stability is not the sole responsibility of the Bank of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09020336000062"></a>On reflection, however, and having considered the concerns raised by noble Lords on this point in debate last week, we have decided to refer explicitly in the Bill to the fact that the Bank&#146;s financial stability objective will be pursued in collaboration with other relevant bodies, including the other tripartite authorities. That is why Amendment 86, which appears in my name, inserts wording to the effect that the Bank should aim to work with the Treasury, the FSA and other relevant bodies to protect the UK&#146;s financial stability. I recognise that Amendment 85, in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, has a similar intention, and I hope that they are content that the Government&#146;s amendment has responded to their concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09020336000065"></a>At the centre of our concerns are the operations of the tripartite arrangements in securing financial stability. One of the most peculiar aspects of the situation before us is that the tripartite committee has no statutory foundation, yet extraordinarily the Financial Stability  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_610"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 610</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee will be in primary legislation when it is just a sub-committee of the Court of the Bank of England. It is very strange that we need to have primary legislation for a sub-committee of the court but do not require it to establish the position of the tripartite committee, which the Minister has just argued is so enormously important.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09020336000066"></a>I very much agree with the Minister that the tripartite arrangement is very important for financial stability and the complex interactions of macroeconomic, institutional and microeconomic variables, all of which can feed into problems of financial stability. We know from the evidence that we have that the tripartite arrangements simply did not work at the commencement of the current financial turmoil. Indeed, those involved admitted that they did not work at all well.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09020336000067"></a>Lessons have been learnt, but I am afraid that I am still under the considerable impression that they are still not working effectively. In the past, the Bank of England had the important role during financial crises of co-ordinating the response of banks and other financial institutions to the crises. It was a meeting of the institutional investors, hosted by the Bank of England in the early 1970s, that called the bottom of the stock market crash. Today, such co-ordination is not evident and indeed would be difficult to achieve, since the Bank of England no longer has the relationship with so many of the financial institutions that it used to have. One would therefore expect the Bank of England and the FSA to work together to achieve that sort of co-ordination. However, Mr Peter Sands, the chief executive of Standard Chartered, stated in December:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a><a name="09020336000093"></a>&#147;The policymakers need to engage with the providers of capital to the banking system, rather than just talking to the banks, because ultimately you need a convergence in expectations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020336000077"></a>In other words, Mr Sands, who is running one of the most important banks in the country, is telling us that there is no co-ordinating activity, which was so important in the past. It is not clear that the difficulties and problems associated with the tripartite system have as yet been effectively overcome.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09020336000068"></a>My amendment in Committee attempted to achieve a statutory basis for the tripartite arrangements. That is why I embodied the FSA and a number of independent persons in the stability committee. I am very disappointed that the Government did not even consider whether there should be independent persons on the committee. The independent members of the Monetary Policy Committee have made an enormously important contribution to the work of that committee, so why cannot we also have independent members on the stability committee?</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09020336000069"></a>If the Government are not willing to accept an amendment in this form, I suggest that they abandon the Financial Stability Committee altogether. Over the next several months, we know, because the Chancellor has told us, that there will be significant new legislation on financial regulation and that that legislation is likely to require new institutions to make it effective. Those new institutions will have to be tripartite institutions in some sense and the committee will become an irrelevance. Yet here it is in primary legislation. We really do not need it. It would be much better to wait  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_611"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 611</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the development of regulatory reform and then put into place the institutional structures that will be more appropriate for that reform.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09020336000070"></a>It is clear, for example, that in any system of regulatory reform that is reacting to current financial turmoil there must some form of liquidity regulation. The banks must have some liquidity management, which means managing their liability side rather than just their asset side, which has been the regulatory structure until now. How will the Bank of England&#146;s Financial Stability Committee do that when all the information about liquidity, especially about the liability structure of the banks and other institutions, is in the FSA? They will have to work closely together, so there will necessarily be some institutional framework in order for them to do so. It would be much better to devise that framework free of the Financial Stability Committee, which is simply a sub-committee of the Court of the Bank of England and cannot have a primary role in dealing with financial stability as it confronts the British economy in the complex financial structures that we have today.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09020336000071"></a>In these circumstances, and in all humility, I advise the Government either to accept my amendment&#151;that is probably not terribly humble&#151;or to abandon the Financial Stability Committee altogether so that, as we move into a new era of regulatory reform, we can design the institutions that are appropriate for the effective management of financial stability in the UK. I beg to move.</p>

I accept that the starting premise of this is correct: the Bank would benefit from what might be called ventilation, or exposure to a greater degree of outside thinking. It is ironic that at a time when this is more necessary than ever, the Bank&#146;s senior leadership will shortly, for the first time since 1997, be made up entirely of insiders, defined as those who have been with the Bank for more than 10 years. While correctly identifying the problem, I wonder whether the proposed solution is indeed the best available; that is, to take four members of the court and put them into a committee chaired by the governor, assisted by the two deputy governors. Oddly, the executive member responsible for markets would not be a full member. I was not convinced by the Minister&#146;s explanation that this was a sufficient gene pool&#151;the phrase that was used&#151;to assemble the experts necessary. Some of them, who would be excellent in the role of experts, would not necessarily want to work, in effect, as the non-executive directors of the Bank, with the much wider range of responsibilities that that carries.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09020338000002"></a>I am also puzzled as to why, if a committee of this kind is needed, it could not have been set up months ago without primary legislation. As the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, has pointed out, it is inevitable that the whole architecture of regulation will be revisited, not only in the UK but internationally. I, too, wonder whether it makes sense to commit ourselves to legislate on something that will probably have only a short life  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_612"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 612</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and whether we could proceed by non-statutory means. I expect that we will probably return to what I would much prefer&#151;a body that acts as a forum to oversee and guide not only the individual players in the system, but the whole tripartite system itself.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09020338000003"></a>This Bill provides for a Banking Liaison Panel to help the Treasury and a Financial Stability Committee to help the Bank, while the FSA already has various practitioner panels. What is missing is something to bring this all together at the tripartite level and sort out the conflicts and trade-offs that the different parties will inevitably bring. For example, the FSA is currently encouraging banks to husband their capital with great care and build it up, while the Treasury wants to encourage banks to commit more of that to increasing their lending. That is precisely the kind of issue that something working at the tripartite level could help to sort out. The Bill currently addresses a particular issue but misses an opportunity to look at something that would have a greater purpose. We will have to wait, but time will probably tell that the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, and I are right.</p>

I take his point about the likely short life of the committee and how it might benefit from the extra membership, particularly as the Minister has stressed the importance of the tripartite regime. To reiterate an old chestnut of mine, I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Turner, cannot be here to put in a word for this as well.</p>

Since the Committee stage, we have received a long explanatory note from the Governor of the Bank of England as to why this committee would be completely impossible. I fear that there are real shades of &#147;Yes Minister&#148; in it. It says that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a><a name="09020338000023"></a>&#147;implementation of the FS strategy ... has implications for the Bank&#146;s balance sheet and risk and control environment&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09020338000019"></a>and that it cannot be left,</p>
<ul><a name="09020338000025"></a>&#147;to a Committee that is disconnected from the Court of Directors&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09020338000020"></a>to take decisions in that area. Instead, he suggests that it is all fine, that the Bank works happily within the tripartite framework and that he would be happy to have this stated in the Bill. I assume that this is why we have Amendment 86, which we have just debated. Again, this is a wonderfully drafted amendment. It is the absolute minimum that you could conceivably say while saying anything at all. It covers the fact that the Bank will work with the other relevant bodies, including the Treasury and the FSA, but qualifies it, lest it be thought that the Bank should strive too hard to work with them, by saying that it shall &#147;aim&#148; to work with them. The truth is that the governor says that they are happily working together anyway, yet the Bill now says that the Bank will try its best to see whether it can work with these bodies. The implication of both the amendment and the document from the governor is that the Bank is extremely grand, and will work with all the people who want to be involved if it has to, but it is the Bank that really matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09020338000006"></a>The entire thrust of what the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, has been saying, and which I support, is that the FSA and the Bank have equal roles in maintaining financial stability, given that financial stability depends very much, as we have seen recently, not on some general collective financial situation, but the position in individual significant financial institutions where the FSA, by common consent, is in a much better position than the Bank to know exactly what is going on. Given that the Government clearly will not accept these amendments, I follow the logic of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. It would be better not to have all this stuff about one sub-committee of the Bank in the Bill because it gives it an inflated importance and creates a misleading impression of how the tripartite system both is intended to work and will work.</p>

When I first went through the Bill, this was the part which I found least convincing. We should be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, in particular for setting out so clearly the arguments for replacing the Financial Stability Committee, as defined already, with something that has a better chance of working in practice, and what legislative form that might take. I therefore ask the Government to consider very seriously the points that have been made in this short debate. I do not believe that a group of people with the varied experience of those who have contributed to this debate is likely to go on some blind journey without any sort of conviction that there is a sensible destination. It may be that the solution would be to withdraw these clauses from the Bill and wait for the large regulatory Bill which will come before too long. That would be a sensible way to deal with it, so I support the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, without necessarily agreeing with all the details that he has put forward.</p>

Like my noble friend Lord Stewartby and other noble Lords who have spoken, I do not necessarily sign up to every detail of the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. They are better than what is in the Bill, but I think the solution would be to take out financial stability. We can leave in the financial objective with its weak little override about aiming to work with the others. As has already been pointed out, if it is helpful to the governor to have a financial stability committee made up of whomever he chooses to have advising him, and it does not require primary legislation to do so, that can be arranged. However, if other architecture changes to legislation are needed in due course to meet whatever global consideration there is in response to the current financial crisis, that would be a perfectly appropriate time to do this. Many things do not need to be legislated for, and since we are not even legislating for the tripartite authorities, it is extraordinary that we are legislating for a sub-committee. I support the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell.</p>

His amendments form a coherent package with the purpose of making the Financial Stability Committee into a joint committee of the Bank and the FSA, with further Treasury membership. I respectfully maintain, however, that the model of a joint committee that my noble friend suggests, while being internally coherent, would have an entirely different function from the role which the Government intend the Financial Stability Committee to play.

He has set out his thoughts on our extensive discussions about these issues and I shall refer to some of his comments in due course.

The answer, of course, is no. The court already has the power to set up new committees, whether they consist of internal committees such as the already existing Financial Stability Board or sub-committees of the court such as the Transactions Committee.</p>

A question put by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, goes to the heart of what the Government are aiming to achieve with this clause. It is clear that the Bank does not need a statutory objective in order to ensure financial stability as one of its key objectives. I draw the attention of noble Lords to the Bank of England&#146;s annual report 2008 where on page 1 it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="09020338000024"></a>&#147;The Bank of England exists to ensure both monetary and financial stability&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020338000021"></a>It lists its two core purposes as &#147;monetary stability&#148; and &#147;financial stability&#148;. We can see that in practice, the Bank of England considers its two main objectives to be equally important, but the current legislation does not reflect this. The 1998 Act gives the Bank a statutory objective for monetary policy, but there is no similar statutory description for its objective for financial stability. Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, we are placing the Bank of England&#146;s objective in relation to financial stability on a statutory footing. Does that change in any way how the Bank views its responsibilities regarding financial stability? Of course not, but what it does achieve is to ensure that the Bank&#146;s dual responsibilities in relation to monetary policy and financial stability are given a similar level of prominence on the statute book. In the light of the prominence of financial stability in the Bank&#146;s current role, and its role in relation to the stabilisation powers contained in the Bill, it is appropriate that Parliament should endorse the arrangements.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09020338000015"></a>In relation to the stabilisation powers, noble Lords will be aware that the Bill provides the Bank with new powers and levers to protect the financial stability of this country. As lead authority in the special resolution regime, in particular, the Bank will play a crucial role in the resolution of failed banks and will have to take decisions regarding individual institutions, often in extremely fast-moving and pressurised circumstances. To support the governor and the Bank in discharging these enhanced responsibilities, the Government are establishing the Financial Stability Committee. The Bank of England supports this move, as do the Treasury Select Committee in the other place and other interested stakeholders.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09020338000016"></a>Why are we establishing the committee in statute? The answer is that the Government have placed the FSC on the face of the Bill in order to highlight and set the role that they expect the committee to fulfil; namely, the crucial task of strengthening and underpinning the Bank of England&#146;s activities in relation to financial stability. Placing the arrangements on a statutory footing ensures that there is no doubt about the Bank&#146;s functions in this important area, and this gives Parliament the opportunity to debate, determine and endorse these arrangements. As the governor explained in his letter,</p>
<ul><a name="09020338000026"></a>&#147;the FSC will provide an effective means of focussing and managing the various strands of the Bank&#146;s FS work&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90203-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09020338000017"></a>Last week, several noble Lords asked questions concerning the exact status, composition and role of the Financial Stability Committee. I shall attempt to explain why the Government believe that the model in the Bill is the appropriate one. The first area of debate is when the FSC should be established as a committee of the Bank in a similar way to the MPC: as a sub-committee of the court or in a different structure altogether, for example, as in my noble friend&#146;s suggestion of a joint committee of the Bank and the FSA. The Bank&#146;s financial stability objective is ultimately the responsibility of the court. It is the court that manages the Bank&#146;s affairs, and it is the court that will set the strategy for the Bank to follow in pursuit of its financial stability objective. As the governor emphasises in his letter,</p>
<ul><a name="09020338000027"></a>&#147;implementation of the FS strategy has implications for the Bank&#146;s balance sheet, risk and control environment&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_616"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 616</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09020338000022"></a>They are integral to the heart of the operations of the Bank and its governance structure. It is therefore vital that the Financial Stability Committee be integrated into the Bank&#146;s governance structure in such a way that there is a direct and accountable relationship between the Court of Directors and the committee. For these reasons, I believe it is right for the FSC to be a sub-committee of the court and, as I will highlight when I come to the composition and membership of the FSC, its position as a sub-committee of the court will also allow it to utilise the experience and knowledge of the non-executive directors of the court.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09020338000018"></a>I now move on to the question of the role and functions of the committee. As I have mentioned before, the Government&#146;s aim in establishing the FSC is to provide the Governor of the Bank of England with a source of support and expert advice in discharging the enhanced responsibilities and tools that the Bank will have at its disposal. These new responsibilities are, as noble Lords will be aware, lead responsibility in the SRR and statutory oversight of payment systems in addition to those tools and levers that the Bank can and does already use to protect financial stability.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09020346000001"></a>In Committee the noble Baroness described the FSC&#146;s functions as a ragbag, and she used the term again today. I cannot agree with her. New Section 2B(2)(b) to (e) give the FSC functions in relation to the Bank&#146;s role in the SRR and its oversight of inter-bank payment systems. Subsection (2)(f) allows the Court of Directors to delegate further functions to the FSC. As highlighted by the governor in his letter, this will allow the court to give responsibility for some of its existing tools to the FSC. These could include responsibility for decisions relating to the provision of liquidity, decisions which I understand are currently undertaken by another sub-committee of court, namely the transactions committee.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09020346000002"></a>Finally, subsection (2)(a) of new Section 2B gives the Financial Stability Committee a role in influencing the Bank&#146;s financial stability strategy. It seems completely logical to me that a committee that is intended to be the main focus of financial stability expertise within the Bank of England should make recommendations to court on how the Bank aims to fulfil its responsibilities in relation to financial stability. Therefore, the functions of the FSC, as set out in Clause 235, are a coherent package to allow the committee to advise and monitor the practical implementation of financial stability measures.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09020346000003"></a>Last week, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was of the opinion that the committee cannot advise on and monitor the use of the stabilisation powers at the same time. With respect, I suggest that it would be entirely normal for a committee that includes non-executives to advise an institution or corporation on a specific course of action and later evaluate whether the course of action has been successful. I do not agree that this represents a source of contradiction.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09020346000004"></a>I envisage the working of the FSC involving executive members of the committee and others providing details of the current situation. This could be an institution in the SRR, or a more general concern about a threat to stability. The committee shall discuss possible options in regard to the situation at hand, with the non-executives contributing their experience and knowledge and the executives providing operational and practical input.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_617"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 617</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90203-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09020346000005"></a>The committee shall, as a whole, come to a decision on the course of action that it would advise as the most appropriate in the circumstance. However, the Bank&#146;s executives will ultimately take the decision on what action the Bank will take, and as such they are accountable to court for their decisions. The Financial Stability Committee will assist court in this regard with its monitoring role. This will be a dynamic process. The committee's expertise and advisory capacity will be enhanced by its role in monitoring the use of the tools.</p>

<a name="90203-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09020346000006"></a>I hope this will help illuminate to the House why I believe that it is entirely right for the committee to both advise on and monitor the Bank&#146;s action in respect of financial stability. The noble Baroness also asked who the committee would be advising under subsection (2)(b) and (c). It is clear that on a day-to-day basis the FSC will be advising the Bank&#146;s executives. It is they who will need to make decisions on how to deal with individual institutions, in what may be fast-moving situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09020346000007"></a>The governor and his executives derive their authority from court. Their responsibilities are delegated from it, and they are ultimately accountable to it. However, both the FSC&#146;s work and the executive&#146;s action will need to be consistent with the strategy that the Court of Directors agrees as the best strategy for fulfilling the financial stability objective, and it will be the court that holds executives and the committee to account for supporting it in meeting that objective. Ultimately, though, some decisions in relation to financial stability will be of sufficient importance and magnitude that the Court of Directors considers that the decision should be taken by the entire court. So, in some cases, the sub-committee will be advising the court itself. This is a model with which one is familiar in the private corporate sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09020346000008"></a>Moving on to the subject of membership of the committee, I am pleased to note that one thing that my noble friend Lord Eatwell and I agree on is the need to keep the committee relatively small. There has been quite extensive debate, both here and in the other place, on the question of whether the FSC should comprise a fully executive membership, a totally non-executive membership, or some variation between the two extremes. The Government&#146;s aim in creating the FSC is to provide the Bank of England with an internal forum where executives and non-executives can come together to discuss financial stability matters. The core executive presence will be balanced with a strong non-executive membership and, if deemed appropriate, co-opted members&#151;non-voting members&#151;bringing their outside expertise and insight to the committee.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09020346000009"></a>In addition, the Treasury will have a non-voting representative, not only for the reasons that I explained last week, but also, as the governor points out in his letter, because it is,</p>
<ul><a name="09020346000030"></a>&#147;legitimate for the Treasury, as the Bank&#146;s shareholder and as the Ministry responsible for public finances, to be aware of discussions that potentially involve significant amounts of public liabilities&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_618"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 618</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90203-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09020346000010"></a>But let me be clear: I am certainly not saying that attendance at the FSC&#146;s meetings should be exclusively confined to these core members.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09020346000011"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked last week why we were excluding the senior executive directors from the committee. My answer to her is that nothing in the Bill would stop the FSC from inviting other Bank executives, as may be appropriate, to attend all or part of meetings. There is no limit to the number of additional non-voting members that can also be co-opted to the committee. As I said in Committee, the most senior executive with responsibility for financial stability, the deputy governor, is a full member of the FSC, and I would expect the committee to invite other executives to attend as appropriate.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09020346000012"></a>Several noble Lords expressed other concerns about the proposed membership, specifically that the FSA is not represented and that there are no fully independent members. The Government agree that the committee should have recourse to whatever external expertise it considers necessary. Again, this is provided for by new Section 2B(4), the power allowing the committee to co-opt other non-voting members. As the Governor says in his letter:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="09020346000029"></a>&#147;It can of course invite the FSA to attend, or anyone else who might help its deliberations, and it will want access to the widest range of information and expertise&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020346000013"></a>However, the governor goes on to emphasise that the FSC is, ultimately, part of the Bank. I would like to underline that point. The committee is a sub-committee of the court of the Bank. It is designed to support the Bank in the Bank&#146;s enhanced role in protecting financial stability, which includes the management of new policy responsibilities and, in particular, its lead role in the special resolution regime.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09020346000014"></a>In saying that, I do not mean to suggest that we do not want the tripartite authorities to work together&#151;forfend that be the case, because it is critical that they do work together. I am simply saying that the committee&#146;s functions relate to the Bank&#146;s functions within the tripartite arrangements, and as such it is appropriate for this to be a Bank committee, not a joint committee. I think that the governor&#146;s distinction between internal co-ordination within the Bank and co-ordination between members of the tripartite is very helpful. I entirely agree with him that both are important and necessary, but that we should be careful not to confuse the two mechanisms.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09020346000015"></a>The letter from the governor emphasises the numerous formal and informal channels through which the tripartite authorities can already work, including the tripartite standing committee. The governor is right to conclude that we do not need a second tripartite standing committee. The function of the Financial Stability Committee is to assist co-ordination within the Bank. I am also glad to endorse a further point that the governor makes: in meeting the financial stability objective, the Bank works within the tripartite framework.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09020346000016"></a>The tripartite arrangements are set out in a memorandum of understanding. This is sufficient, clear and transparent. The Government&#146;s view is that the tripartite working arrangements are better encapsulated in a memorandum of understanding than by being codified in statute, as this provides a necessary degree  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_619"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 619</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of flexibility to refine and enhance the arrangements from time to time. Indeed, we have committed to reviewing these arrangements once the provisions of the Bill have been put in place. In any event, as I have outlined, the Financial Stability Committee sits within the Bank&#151;we do not intend it to be a tripartite body.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09020346000017"></a>I hope that with this rather lengthy explanation I have adequately laid out the Government&#146;s thinking behind the creation of the Financial Stability Committee. The decision about how much detail to set out in statute in relation to matters such as this is, of course, a matter of judgment. During last week&#146;s debate the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked me why we were specifying such minute detail about the FSC in the legislation, while at the same time the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked why the Bill is silent about the workings of the committee. I am afraid that this is one of those occasions where I will be unable to please everyone. I believe that by setting out the role and membership of the FSC in legislation, while leaving the flexibility to delegate additional functions and co-opt additional members, we have hit the right balance.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09020346000018"></a>As I said earlier, we continue to make efforts to ensure that the tripartite authorities continue to work well. Noble Lords pointed out an apparent inconsistency between the FSA urging banks to conserve capital and the Treasury urging them to lend. I do not see an inconsistency; there is common language, and the FSA, the Bank of England and the Treasury have achieved that through the tripartite system. For instance, the variable scalar&#151;the noble Baroness asked me in a previous debate to define and explain this, which I failed to do but will happily do now: it determines capital through cycles rather than at a single point of time&#151;was evidence of the tripartite authorities working effectively. I add that it is also evidence of the Treasury working effectively to conserve stamps because now I do not have to write to the noble Baroness explaining what a variable scalar is, although I have a suspicion that she knew and was just testing me, rather than seeking the information.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09020346000019"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, that the ability is there to co-opt members, which should allay concerns about a &#147;gene pool&#148;. I agree with his observation about an organisation where the route to the top appears to be confined to people within it. That is a generalised organisation; I would not limit it to the Bank of England. I would simply say that any organisation is enriched by ventilation, as he described it&#151;by having external people come in. The recreation of a new court with predominantly new members will be an important part of refreshing the Bank.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09020346000020"></a>The Financial Stability Committee and its explanation in statute will address some of the shortcomings of the Financial Stability Board. The chair of the Court of the Bank of England and the executive were never entirely clear about the nexus between the board and the independent members of court. The Financial Stability Committee makes clear that this is a joint committee that brings together the external viewpoint of the independent members of court with the internal executive of the Bank.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09020346000021"></a>The suggestion was made that we should abandon the concept of the Financial Stability Committee as further regulation will be forthcoming in due course.  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_620"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 620</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That may well be the case. The situation we have been through means that it is incumbent on us to look at existing regulatory arrangements, and I share with the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, the hope that we will see the noble Lord, Lord Turner, participating in those discussions in this House. However, it would be unwise for us to delay this necessary and important addition of a new committee at the heart of the Bank in anticipation of legislation that may or may not be produced at some later stage.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09020346000022"></a>Taking my guidance from my noble friend&#146;s suggestion that I should be humble, I humbly invite my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I am also grateful that everyone who spoke, except one, agreed with the force of my argument&#151;that particular one being the Minister.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09020346000024"></a>I was a little surprised to be lobbied by the Governor of the Bank of England, although in these febrile times I probably should not use the word &#147;lobbied&#148;. The governor should have declared his interest.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09020346000025"></a>With regard to what the Minister said, the notion that there should be a financial stability objective is entirely shared. I am sure that the Bank of England has thought that financial stability has been its objective for the past 300 years, and maybe it is a bit surprised that it has to be told again&#151;but never mind; if it is deemed to be neater to ally the financial stability objective with the monetary stability objective, that is fine.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09020346000026"></a>I still do not understand the particular statutory need for the Financial Stability Committee. The core of the governor&#146;s argument was that the committee will be advising the court and the executives are responsible to the court, so the court is the key strategy-making organisation and is responsible for the balance sheet and so on. In my structure the court would have received advice not just from the independents but from the FSA&#151;it would have had a wide range of advice coming into it, on which it could perhaps have made more effective decisions.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09020346000027"></a>One element of my amendment that the Minister did not mention at all is that the amendments would make financial stability an overt objective of the Financial Services Authority. He did not address that issue or indeed the fact that it would be the role of the Financial Stability Committee, as I formulate it, also to advise the board of the Financial Services Authority. The Minister told us forcefully last time that financial stability was the responsibility of the Financial Services Authority; he said it was embodied in the Financial Services and Markets Act. If that is so, why does the authority not also require a committee to advise it? I suggest that the structure I have proposed is the economical way to provide a wide range of advice both to the court and to the board of the Financial Services Authority, and would be an efficient means of securing the integration of financial stability policies across the piece for both the Bank and the authority, which is what the country really needs.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09020346000028"></a>It is clear from both the governor&#146;s intervention and the Minister&#146;s remarks that the Government are not going to accept any change on this. It is also clear, I

If this is indeed a temporary arrangement and the Minister has gone a tiny way towards accepting the validity of the arguments on the need for co-ordinated activity, it would be churlish of me to divide the House in those circumstances. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

When one looks at the turmoil which faces our own citizens, tremendous sympathy goes out to them. But that does not mean that at the same time we should not look wider to see what other problems there might be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09020358000002"></a>Some in this country have entered illegally. I am not sure whether it is my Liberal heart or my Methodist heart that has great sympathy with them. Certainly, realistically, those who are here illegally should be returned home as gently and as swiftly as possible. Last year, I welcomed the announcement that we had halted any removals to Darfur, Zimbabwe and, as regards those of the gay community, to Iran, where they faced persecution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09020358000003"></a>The condition of some of the people who come here illegally is numbing. In my own part of North Wales only a week or so ago, some such Chinese immigrants were found to be paid tiny wages and to be forced to sleep and rest in a disused restaurant refrigerator. Such circumstances cannot be tolerated: we think of the sacrifice that some of those folk have made just to come here, dreaming that the streets are paved with gold, when we know of our own experience that that is not so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09020358000004"></a>The Minister might be kind enough to tell us how long people who have failed with their asylum claims have to wait to be returned home. Some of those people who have not succeeded have to be here for many months before a decision is made. How satisfactory is the present system? Is it causing added harm and cost to the United Kingdom? I want to applaud and pay tribute to places such as Harmondsworth, with their concerned and caring approach to those who have failed the asylum process.</p>

For those we have the gravest concern. May I say how much we appreciate the work that is already being done for them, especially by voluntary organisations? I visit the Dallow centre in Whitechapel and see what is happening there. I work with the Barka Foundation, taking those from Poland who have not made a success of it back home. I hear of the good work carried out by some local authorities. We appreciate the work that is being carried out.

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09020358000006"></a>How can Her Majesty&#146;s Government help in the present situation? It is untrue that migrant workers who arrive here can immediately draw benefits: they cannot. They have to join the workers&#146; registration scheme. They pay &#163;90 and it is 12 months before they are able to access any UK benefits. Ninety pounds might be little for most of us but to them it could be a great deal of money. People who come here with &#163;300 and think that that will be enough to see them through find that that charge is levied before they can start to take the work that will enable them to claim benefits later. Is it possible for us somehow to delay the charge payable by them until they have started working and have the extra money that enables them to pay that particular fee, or to pay by instalments?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09020358000007"></a>Furthermore, they have to have a national insurance number, which sometimes takes a long time. How can we speed up that process, giving everyone who wants to work here their national insurance number? When we debated the UK Borders Bill; now the UK Borders Act, I tried to persuade the Government to prepare and make available multilingual information packs that could be distributed in the villages and towns in which the folk who come to the UK live, advising them about the problems and opportunities and where help could be obtained.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09020358000008"></a>I wonder whether the Government could reconsider that point. In other countries there is an emergency telephone number for those at a loss. I was walking in Victoria Street a fortnight ago and a perfectly respectable person there had arrived from Lithuania who could not get a job. There was no work going. Such people find themselves with their pennies and hope gone. Could we have a government-sponsored or supported helpline for such people?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09020358000009"></a>I want to say how much we appreciate the work of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. It does a tremendous job and we owe it a great debt. Last week I was so pleased that the Minister said we might look at the possibility with our European colleagues at having benefits that were paid in Poland and could be drawn from the Polish Exchequer here in the United Kingdom when people got into real need. Will the Government please explore that possibility?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09020358000010"></a>My colleague will speak about asylum seekers later. I want to point out that in 2007, nearly 50 per cent of all refused asylum seekers were from Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic

Prior to a change in 2003, refused asylum seekers from those areas would almost certainly have been given exceptional leave to remain in the UK. That has been changed with remarkable consequences. We now have the humanitarian protection and discretionary leave categories. As a consequence, whereas 20,135 individuals obtained exceptional leave to remain in 2002, only 405 did in 2007. We would like to see some change there.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09020358000011"></a>In reviewing the treatment of asylum seekers in the UK, the Joint Committee on Human Rights recently reached the following conclusion:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="09020358000069"></a>&#147;We have been persuaded by the evidence that the Government has indeed been practicing a deliberate policy of destitution of this highly vulnerable group. We believe that the deliberate use of inhumane treatment is unacceptable. We have seen instances in all cases where the Government's treatment of asylum seekers and refused asylum seekers falls below the requirements of the common law of humanity and of international human rights law&#148;.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09020358000012"></a>Under Section 95, the asylum seeker has some payment and some way of supporting himself&#151;although it is only 70 per cent of the social security benefit that UK residents would receive. However, that has changed and they can lose that and become totally destitute. Section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 would withdraw all benefits from failed asylum seekers. This drives them into destitution. We should look at this again. When the new immigration Bill comes before the House, we intend to table amendments that will delete that clause.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09020358000013"></a>In conclusion, the measures we take now are inhumane. They are against our ordinary traditions. The Joint Committee on Human Rights says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="09020358000070"></a>&#147;The policy of enforced destitution must cease. The system of asylum seeker support is in a confusing mess. We have seen no justification for providing varying standards of support and recommend the introduction of a coherent, unified, simplified and accessible system of support for asylum seekers, from arrival until&#148;,</p>

He said that some were here illegally, and should of course be sent home. I wish that I thought that it was quite as simple as that. Given the dreadful story behind the situation of some of those who are here illegally, it seems that they have precious little choice but to be here. It is not quite as simple as the noble Lord suggested. I am sure that he would agree with me that, in this policy area, the Government face one of the most difficult and complex tasks. I am sure that many of us have good will towards the Government as they try to grapple with it. It is a difficult issue, and not helped by the wilful misrepresentations of some of the media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09020358000016"></a>It is important to remember that, within the sphere of those who remain without permission, there are, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, suggested, different categories. There are certainly those with no protection needs in the UK who should return. But there are also those who cannot leave the UK through no fault of their own. For example, they may be stateless and have no country to return to. Their Government may not provide them with travel documents, preventing their return. They may be too sick to travel, or there may be no viable route whereby they may return home.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09020358000017"></a>There are those who, having been in the UK for a long period, have developed strong ties with it, such as entering relationships and having children. There are those who genuinely believe that it is unsafe for them to return because of armed conflict and repressive regimes. In some cases, the UK Government recognise that it is not safe for these people to go home, even though they have not granted them asylum in the UK. For example, in 2005, they refused asylum to some people from Zimbabwe but have not removed them. Perhaps slightly more equivocal is the issue of the non-Arabs from Darfur.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09020358000018"></a>We know that there is acute hardship among these people. Just think of it amidst the weather that we have been enduring for the past couple of days. Some are totally destitute, dependent on chance and spontaneous charity to survive at all. This is in a country that we are struggling to keep as one of the leading economies of the world.</p>

<a name="90203-0011.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09020358000019"></a>Some must survive under Section 4. It was calculated last September that there might be some 10,000 in that situation. They have accommodation of a sort provided, and must then survive on &#163;35 a week in vouchers. How many of us, as we look at our expenses in the House of Lords, would like to think of surviving on &#163;35 a week? We must keep a sense of perspective about these things. It is less than two-thirds of the basic income support rate. If we have something called the &#147;basic income support rate&#148;, that presumably means that it is the basic income level. These people are somehow expected to survive on less than two-thirds of it. The vouchers are inflexible. They cannot be exchanged for cash, and in attempts to do so the unofficial rate means that they are worth only &#163;25. They cannot be used for clothing. They cannot be used for medicaments, sanitary items or even basic essentials such as paracetamol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09020358000020"></a>On health, I was a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights when it produced its report on asylum. Right across the party divide, as a whole committee, we became more and more profoundly disturbed by what we saw&#151;and really quite angry. Hence, we produced a rather tough report to which, if my noble friend the Minister will forgive my saying so, we have never yet seen a convincing reply. Think of how people with serious health needs are officially debarred from receiving the medical care that they should have. Think of the moral pressure and dilemmas that this places on the medical profession, including GPs who may be unable to ensure that the necessary medical attention can be made available. They may have to engage in subterfuges such as sending people to accident and emergency departments because that is the only way that any help will be provided. They may be watching sick people who could be prevented

That is a terrible pressure to put on honourable members of the medical profession. It is also counterproductive, because it may mean that social diseases go untreated and we are therefore putting the population as a whole at greater risk.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09020358000021"></a>On education, one encounters traumas among children who are fully established residents, from families that have been here for centuries, when they see dreadful things happening to children with whom they have relationships and have felt to be part of their community, when those children are suddenly removed without explanation. How does the absence of legal aid help? It probably ends up with more muddle, confusion and cost.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09020358000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, mentioned the Joint Committee on Human Rights and its report. I wonder whether we had the same sort of briefing, because he picked the two excerpts from the report that I was going to read. I shall not repeat them. However, apart from the humanitarian and moral issues, what worries me is the political issue. We live in a terribly dangerous age. It does not take many people who have been embittered to do terrible things or become caught up in them. I sometimes think that some experiences that people go through in immigration are almost designed to embitter them and make them possible targets for extremist recruitment.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09020358000023"></a>But, of course, what is more important is what sort of society we want to be. We cannot appease prejudice and we certainly cannot buy off wilfully malicious press coverage. We have to look at the impact on race relations in general in society, if we appear to be subjecting people to embittering experiences in their search for asylum, particularly when, as the noble Lord rightly said, one remembers the traumas which these people have undergone.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09020358000024"></a>At a time like this when the going gets tough, I suggest that this is the very time to stand firm on the principles which matter. This requires strong political leadership, not trying to appease the worst instincts in society, in which we should be behind those who carry the political responsibility on our behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09020358000025"></a>Twenty-eight organisations have written to some of us about the issues as they see them from church and caring organisations to voluntary organisations in the front line. These are responsible, sensible organisations that many of us support. They have sent us a very interesting and detailed brief. I give my noble friend notice that I intend to send it in its entirety to him in the hope that I can be given a detailed response from the Government on all the points it raises. But above all let us remember that history will look at us now, in an increasingly globalised, interdependent world, and judge us pretty toughly on how far the values that we say are essential to Britain, and of which we say we are proud, are really applied in the immigration and asylum process.</p>

I concur with everything that he said. The House is indebted to my noble friend for introducing this subject with his usual Welsh irrepressible enthusiasm. His Welsh is beginning to develop a Polish accent as he discusses these issues with these interest groups, which I agree are vital. All these people who look after the communities that they seek to serve deserve our thanks for the work that they do.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09020358000027"></a>I wish to comment on a focused issue relating to refused asylum seekers, as we are now seeing some of the fruits of the legislation that has been promoted over the past 10 years. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that this is a difficult area for any Government to handle. However, worrying signs are emerging that some aspects of the legislation are coming home to roost in a way that should be, and is, uncomfortable for us all.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09020358000028"></a>I do not want to repeat the quotations that have already been drawn from the invaluable report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Rather, I shall consider whether an entitlement to work and benefit provision acts as a magnet for abusive and potentially inept asylum claims. I was struck by the fact that the committee took no comfort from the claim of the then Home Office Minister, Mr Liam Byrne, that there was a real danger of a &#147;pull factor&#148;&#151;that is how it is known in the jargon&#151;occurring if people were given the right to work and access to a continuous flow of benefit income. The committee stated, in what I think is the most powerful recommendation in the report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="09020358000071"></a>&#147;We recommend that in the development of asylum policy the Government should proceed on the basis of evidence, rather than assertion, which evidence should wherever possible be published&#148;.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09020358000029"></a>I freely admit that I am not an expert on the technicalities of asylum, but looking at the Home Office&#146;s own research and at my own experience in Scotland, where there is a slightly different perspective on some of this, I believe that promoting sensible levels of subsistence benefit on which people can have a chance of living over long periods does not act as a pull factor. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, made the important point that Section 4 support is meagre, but it is supposed to last only for a very limited period. However, some of these families live on Section 4 support for long periods. That was never the policy intention and it has consequences for people&#146;s health, particularly children&#146;s health, which the Government can no longer afford to ignore.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09020358000030"></a>We need to be clear about where the Government are getting their evidence from as regards denying access to work and Section 95 benefits over a longer period for fear of people abusing access to additional services. In Scotland, people have access to secondary health provision under Section 4, because the relevant orders are different. In Scotland, there is a much more integrated approach to the whole application process. When families, particularly those with children, make an application in Scotland, there is a much more involved process, which sometimes leads to a voluntary return when people are refused entry. Families proceed along a much smoother path and receive a lot of co-operation and support that is just not available in England; I believe that the same circumstances apply in Wales. The English provision needs to be looked at again. If we were able to provide more support, we  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_627"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 627</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would get a better outcome for everyone concerned, even for those who return voluntarily. The Government need to re-examine their claims with regard to the pull factor.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09020358000031"></a>A position statement from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, <I>Improving Services for Refugees and Asylum Seekers</I>, goes out of its way to say that the Government have done a huge amount in improving mental health services for the black and ethnic community. However, it says that there is absolutely no strategy for refugees and asylum seekers. The psychiatrists see incidents of mental illness now emerging. That is not surprising to anybody who knows the situation. The psychiatrists are now professionally concerned that mental illness is arising due to the socio-economic factors to which we subject refused asylum seekers. That matter needs to be addressed.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09020358000032"></a>I wish to make three suggestions focused on the background that I have just explained. First, we should consider allowing Section 95 cover to continue throughout any claim from beginning to conclusion, whether a voluntary or a forced return to a home country is involved. I shall explain why that is sensible financially in a moment. Secondly, I suggest that we should permit legal entry to work after 26 weeks. Measures with which the Minister and I are familiar such as welfare to work and the right to bid for contracts to get people off benefits and into work can work on a spend-to-save basis. If we could demonstrate that people on Section 95 support could trade themselves off benefit and support themselves for the duration of the rest of their claim, irrespective of whether there is a forced or a voluntary return, there would be an absolutely cast-iron cost-benefit analysis case to make for taking such an approach. Thirdly, I hope that the Minister and his department have considered the experience in Scotland, where an integrated partnership approach is taken. I have seen CoSLA reports dealing with forums that encourage people to return in a co-operative and supportive way. I believe that such an approach would improve the situation for returnees. In Glasgow, there is an assisted family return project.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09020358000033"></a>The case for taking out Section 4 and Section 9, as my noble friend mentioned, but particularly Section 4, is that Section 4 costs the public purse extra for a number of reasons. First, accommodation has to be found, which can be very expensive for local authorities. Secondly, the administration costs of the hated voucher scheme are a complete waste of money and an expense for nothing. The scheme forces people into misery; it is not effective and it does not work. Thirdly, the review of those entitled to Section 4 payments costs money. The review and appeal costs add to the totality of the present system&#146;s costs. The caseworker resources tied up in the administration of Section 4 are a waste of money, particularly given the review of the 200,000 cases that the Home Office are looking at. Those resources are important. Finally, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, NHS support in England, where people are sent bills if they receive secondary care, costs money.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09020358000034"></a>My final point relates to supporting these changes and abolishing Section 4. The cost of removal on a voluntary basis, as we know from Home Office figures, amounts to &#163;1,000 on average. The cost of a forced  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_628"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 628</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>removal costs &#163;11,000. Therefore, for every forced removal that we can avoid, we can save the public purse money, we can turn that resource into support for these families and we can get a much more satisfactory and sympathetic support system for refused asylum seekers. This argument will not go away and I hope that the Government will give it further consideration as a result of my noble friend&#146;s debate.</p>

I should declare my interest as an employer of seasonal workers from other countries within the EU at different times around the year. They represent a small but significant percentage of our workforce, which changes with the seasons. Most of them go home as the work ends, although many return regularly. I might add that our workers from Poland and such countries are hard-working, conscientious and prepared to apply their intelligence to the job in hand. I can also assure noble Lords that we are an Investors in People company and care equally for all our staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09020358000036"></a>This debate is a sequel to last Wednesday&#146;s Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, which covered similar ground. However, I come to this subject from a very different direction from that of the noble Lord and, indeed, the noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Kirkwood. There is much concern about this issue. It cannot have helped the acute sensitivity of the subject when the Prime Minister chose to raise the issue of,</p>
<ul><a name="09020358000074"></a>&#147;British jobs for British workers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020358000067"></a>If ever a soundbite came back to bite its owner, this was it. What does the Minister have to say on this? Similarly, the Immigration Minister, Phil Woolas, has said that entitlements to benefits should be for citizens of our country, not other people. Does the noble Lord agree?</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09020358000037"></a>According to government figures, there are 199,667 non-British citizens in receipt of state benefits, including child benefit, jobseeker&#146;s allowance and housing support. Given the current climate, does the Minister expect this figure to increase and, if so, what estimate has his department made of the increase? Of course, it is possible that the economic recession may persuade some migrants to return home, but there is an equal possibility that they might stay and become benefit dependent. After all, Tom Wlodarski of the East of England Polish Community Organisation said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="09020358000072"></a>&#147;Families are staying on, as they feel it is better to ride out the recession here in England&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020358000068"></a>Urszula Jukes, owner of the Polish recruitment agency Access Europe, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="09020358000073"></a>&#147;For many the answer is to bring their family here where they can support them with the higher UK wages and government support. Families are almost always better off ... as there is the generous welfare state&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020358000038"></a>This points to an increasing, not reducing, area of government engagement with this issue as a result of the recession.</p>

Of those who are officially registered, nearly 200,000 are in receipt of benefits. These figures go back to September last year and do not take into account the dramatic economic decline of the past few months and the massive job losses that it will bring. If the numbers are significant, so is the money. Can the Minister tell me the total amount paid in benefits to non-British citizens? It is not necessary for all those families to reside in the UK. Will he update the House on how much British child benefit and child tax credit is paid to Polish workers whose children live in Poland and say whether the Government have any plans to change the rules?</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09020358000040"></a>I am pressing the Minister hard on this, because it is a sensitive issue and the Government can defuse this sensitivity only by being open about the scale of the problem, the issues involved and their intentions. The soundbite messages of the Prime Minister and Mr Woolas do not help the Government to gain the confidence of the British people. However, we should be happy that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, has given us all the opportunity to debate the benefits of migrant workers. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply and his response to my questions.</p>

As set down, its scope was wide, although in some respects it has focused on asylum seekers, so my response will seek to cover all aspects.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09020358000042"></a>We fully recognise the impact that inward migration has had in boosting economic growth in the UK, in particular helping to meet previous shortages of labour and skills in the UK labour market. The diversity that this brings has enriched our culture. We also know that those suffering oppression around the world have long looked to the UK for safe haven.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09020358000043"></a>Against this background, and consistent with our international obligations, it is important that we provide adequate support for people entering this country, especially when they come here to work. At the same time, we need to be aware that there are people entering the UK who will seek to take undue advantage of our social security and other care and support systems, so we need to balance the support we provide for foreign nationals entering the UK with protection of our internal support systems and the taxpayer. The rules we have in place, combined with immigration controls, seek to meet these aims. They balance help where appropriate with measures to protect our financial and care systems. As my noble friend Lord Judd said, sometimes these are difficult tasks.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09020358000044"></a>Access to social security benefits is a complex topic which cannot be dealt with comprehensively in the time allowed for this reply. Different considerations apply for contributory benefits, income-related benefits and non-contributory benefits, such as attendance  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_630"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 630</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allowance. The nationality of claimants is not recorded on benefit, tax credit or child benefit data, because nationality is not typically a condition of entitlement. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, alluded to the fact that data are collected in respect of A8 nationals, and that information goes into Home Office monitoring report. However, nationality is not included on benefit records, so information on the aggregate amounts is not available.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09020358000045"></a>Contributory benefits are payable to anyone who satisfies the contribution conditions and other conditions of the benefit, regardless of nationality or length of stay in the UK. Most non-EEA nationals, are excluded from income-related benefits and non-contributory benefits, because they are subject to immigration control, which includes a requirement that they have no recourse to public funds. However, vulnerable individuals with certain types of leave to enter or remain in the UK can be eligible for benefits, provided that they are habitually resident in the UK. This can include those granted refugee status and humanitarian protection. In general terms, EEA nationals with worker status have recourse to public funds and may be entitled to claim income-related benefits. This could include housing benefit and council tax benefit. Should they fall out of work but remain in the labour market, they may claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09020358000046"></a>However, matters are more restrictive for accession country nationals, A8 and A2. They have worker status while they are working and are registered, as appropriate, with the registration or authorisation scheme. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked about the fee. The registration happens when the worker is in employment&#151;employment has to precede it&#151;and the fee is paid only on first application. However, workers retain this status only if they have been working and registered for at least 12 months. Should this not be the case, entitlement to JSA and housing and council tax benefit will fall. Similar considerations apply to access to child benefit and tax credits. These situations can generate some of the problems around rough sleeping, which is why we are working with colleagues in accession countries to raise awareness of the eligibility rules and discourage those unlikely to find work from coming to the UK.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09020358000047"></a>Asylum seekers, as the noble Lord has identified, are subject to immigration control and have no recourse to social security benefits until they have been granted leave to remain in the UK. However, those who are destitute and have children&#151;I will come to this later&#151;can apply through the UK Border Agency for both financial support and help with accommodation. The level of support reflects its temporary nature and the fact that supported asylum seekers do not pay council tax or utility bills.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09020358000048"></a>Last year, we extended support to cover facilitation of travel to medical appointments, the nutritional needs of pregnant mothers and young children, and clothing for children. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, posed several questions, particularly about asylum seeker applications and the average times taken for decisions on asylum claims. We are making decisions quicker than before and beat our target of concluding 40 per cent of cases within six months by the end of last year. Indeed, we are on track to conclude the  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_631"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 631</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>majority of cases within six months by the end of December 2008. We aim to conclude 90 per cent of cases within six months by 2011.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09020358000049"></a>The noble Lord also asked how long failed asylum applicants had to wait before they were removed. In 2007, we removed one person every eight minutes&#151;more than 63,000 people in total. We have been clear that our top priority has been public protection, as part of a wider enforcement agenda.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09020358000050"></a>Most migrants are privately housed, and around 95 per cent of householders who have arrived in the UK in the past two to three years live in the private rented sector. We know that houses of multiple occupation are a key source of housing for significant and often vulnerable groups in society. We also know that sometimes the housing conditions faced by migrants are poor. The introduction of mandatory licensing in 2004 of all privately rented HMOs, and discretionary arrangements for local authorities, should help to alleviate these issues.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09020358000051"></a>The focus of provision of social housing is based on need. In framing their social housing allocation schemes, local authorities must ensure that &#147;reasonable preference&#148; is given to households that are homeless, overcrowded or have medical or welfare needs, including grounds relating to a disability. This applies equally to British citizens and eligible non-British citizens.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09020358000052"></a>Inevitably, some people from abroad slip through the net, and in some cases end up sleeping rough on the streets. We recognise that this is a particular problem in London, and, to a lesser extent, in places such as Peterborough and Reading. We are providing funding to support local authorities in helping A8 nationals find work and, in some instances, pay for travel back to their own countries. We are also supporting Homeless Link to reduce rough sleeping among EU migrants in London and, as I said earlier, are investing in an extensive information campaign in accession countries to ensure that prospective migrants are aware that they will not have immediate access to social benefits.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09020358000053"></a>Refugees are particularly vulnerable, and we are working with our partners to secure good housing outcomes for refugees and other migrants through developing the housing element of the UK Border Agency Refugee Integration and Employment Service and through the Housing Associations&#146; Charitable Trust &#147;Opening Doors&#148; initiative to improve the capacity of housing associations and refugee organisations.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09020358000054"></a>Healthcare, too, is an important issue for migrants, as it is for all our citizens. The rules and procedures for eligibility to free NHS care for non-British residents balance the principles of fairness, humanity and affordability with the full treaty rights of all EEA citizens, and support for the legitimate movement of people to and from the UK. EEA citizens who take up residency in the UK for a reasonable period have full entitlement to both GP and hospital care. Shorter-term visitors receive all necessary treatment free of charge while they are here. However, this does not apply to pre-planned treatment without special arrangement.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09020358000055"></a>We have bilateral health agreements with more than 30 other countries, including some in eastern Europe, Eurasia and many Commonwealth colonies. We have further exemptions for visiting students and workers  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_632"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 632</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employed by UK-based companies. The rights of EEA and bilateral country nationals are of course reciprocated, so that British nationals travelling, working or residing in these countries receive healthcare on the same priority and charging basis as nationals of that country.</p>

<a name="90203-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09020358000056"></a>I should like to make it clear that we do not provide routine free healthcare for unregulated illegal migrants or other visitors who may come seeking free healthcare. However, it is important to state that urgent treatment should never be denied to, or delayed for, any person, irrespective of their legal status or financial position. They should be charged subsequently for their care and we take reasonable steps to recover the cost. Our regulations are designed to protect the NHS, a free service established primarily for British residents, from inappropriate access by overseas visitors, while providing appropriate entitlements to EEA citizens and other current residents.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09020358000057"></a>Asylum seekers awaiting a formal decision on their claim are eligible for both primary and secondary NHS medical treatment free of charge; and the basic humanitarian needs of unsuccessful asylum seekers continue to be met. The Department of Health and the Home Office are currently undertaking a review of the rules governing immigrant access to healthcare.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09020358000058"></a>I can skip the section of brief on education, except to say that under Section 13 of the Education Act 1996, local authorities are under a duty to ensure that sufficient primary and secondary education is available to meet the needs of the population in their area. That applies irrespective of immigration status or rights of residence and, of course, includes school-age asylum-seeking children.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09020358000059"></a>I shall pick up a number of additional questions posed. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked about the comments of the Prime Minister about British jobs for British workers. As the Prime Minister made clear, we are taking action to stimulate the economy. Jobs need to be filled and we are taking action to ensure that the British workforce will have the skills that it needs to be well placed to compete for those jobs.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09020358000060"></a>A number of noble Lords made reference to the JCHR&#146;s criticism of our treatment of asylum seekers. Of course, the Government responded to the committee&#146;s 17th report on 5 July 2007. We believe that our asylum support system is fair and properly balanced. There are safeguards for supporting unsuccessful asylum seekers who are vulnerable; for example, families with minor dependents and those who have a genuine reason for why they cannot return home. The UK Border Agency is committed to working with stakeholders to continue to improve the asylum system and the treatment of asylum seekers. The recent NAO report recognises considerable success in improving the asylum system, but clearly there is more to do.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09020358000061"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked about a helpline, a pan-London strategy. Clearly, those are issues about which we could talk further with the Mayor of London and with the Minister for London. With support from communities and local government, the Improvement and Development Agency has developed a template for local authorities to prepare information packs on key information for migrants. It brings together examples of material used by local authorities in existing welcome  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_633"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 633</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>packs and it is a rich source of expertise and ideas for local authorities reviewing their welcome packs or considering producing one for the first time.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09020358000062"></a>A number of noble Lords made reference to Sections 4, 9 and 95. On Section 9, the UK Border Agency is currently considering, with stakeholders, our review of asylum support under simplification and whether to repeal Section 9 will be part of that consultation. As the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said, Section 4 is focused on temporary support. Indeed, the legislation does not allow cash to be provided, but we shall continue to work with a variety of stakeholder groups. We believe that it is important to continue to listen to any concerns that groups and individuals might have and to work together wherever possible to identify those areas where the system can be improved.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09020358000063"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked about national insurance numbers. The key management indicator target is 86 per cent of applications processed within 30 days and we are exceeding that. On Section 95, we are looking at a reform of asylum support under our simplification proposals and we shall pick up the issue in conjunction with that.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09020358000064"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked about EEA migrants claiming unemployment benefit from their home state. As we debated last week, when the noble Lord asked a Question, there are proposals to do that when workers are posted to the UK.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09020358000065"></a>My time is exceeded. We should be proud of the welfare system we have in this country. It provides a safety net for people in time of need and seeks a responsible engagement for individuals to access work. Meanwhile, our NHS is the envy of the world. While our humanity dictates that we share these benefits with those less fortunate, we know that the real world demands a more constrained approach. As I said earlier, we need a balance between appropriate support for foreign nationals coming to the UK, sustainability of our system and protection for taxpayers. I commend this approach to noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09020364000002"></a>Under the amendments, the member must now disclose any interests in a business or dealing that falls to be considered by the committee regardless of whether the interest is direct or indirect or a current or likely future interest. That is the appropriate scope of the provision and I am grateful to the noble Baroness for helping the Government to improve the Bill in that way. Last Monday in Committee, the noble Baroness also asked me whether subsection (3) was necessary. On consideration, with the amendments that I have just outlined, it overlaps to a great extent with the mechanisms just discussed concerning disclosure of interests. Subsection (3) goes further, in that it also requires a person to withdraw from debates on matters which touch or concern him or her, but that is simply good committee practice and the committee, as master of its own procedure, can adopt such practice if it wishes. Therefore, Amendment 102 will remove subsection (3). I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for bringing those two issues to our attention and I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09020364000005"></a><b><a name="90203-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09020364000101"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, the amendment adds a new clause after Clause 235. This new clause creates a new mechanism between the Bank of England and the FSA and contributes to a public debate and understanding of the state of banking. In doing so, it responds to calls made by both the Governor and the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England for, to use the governor's words,</p>
<ul><a name="09020364000088"></a>&#147;an additional instrument to stabilise the growth of the financial sector balance sheet&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020364000063"></a>Of course, the instrument exists at a micro-level in the form of prudential capital ratios agreed by the FSA with individual banks, formally through the threshold conditions provided for by the Financial Services and Markets Act. The governor was referring to a macro-policy instrument, which is what Amendment 103 is intended to deliver.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09020364000006"></a>I do not think there is any doubt that the banks&#146; balance sheets were over-leveraged. Indeed I have heard the noble Lord, Lord Myners, talk about this. There is also no doubt that the analysis was there to be seen, for those who took the trouble to look at the available data. Therefore, this is not an issue of available data but more a lack of focus of what the data meant in policy terms.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09020364000007"></a>The Bank of England has been issuing a financial stability report twice a year, but I do not believe that it has had much influence. It is a rather academic publication. It does not reflect clear policy positions of the Bank of England and is not designed to be, nor is it in fact, a document which sets out to change policy.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09020364000008"></a>When the Bank of England ran banking supervision, there was an automatic connection between the Bank&#146;s macro analysis and its micro decision-making, because only one institution was involved, culminating in the responsibility of the governor himself. That of course disappeared when the Government chose to transfer banking supervision to the FSA. I should stress that I am not in the camp of those who want to return banking supervision to the Bank. I believe that, in principle, the FSA should be the better body. If it gets its act together, it ought to do the job well. However, I also believe that we need to be more specific about the linkage between the banks&#146; judgment about the state of banks&#146; balance sheets, and the levels of debt in the country, and the FSA&#146;s responsibilities to translate that into practical regulatory action.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09020364000009"></a>There should also be greater public awareness of the issues. These issues are too important to be discussed only behind the closed doors of the tripartite arrangements. My amendment, which is a gamma version of the beta test version that I moved in Committee, requires the Bank to write to the FSA twice a year, setting out its assessment of financial stability. The FSA then has to have regard to that when carrying out its bank supervision. The Bank&#146;s letter to the FSA and the FSA&#146;s response would be published.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09020364000010"></a>This amendment avoids a criticism of the version that I moved in Committee in that proposed subsection (3) specifically avoids referring to specific institutions.

Rather, the FSA should respond in terms of the general approach to tightening or loosening capital or liquidity requirements.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09020364000011"></a>The Minister said in Committee that this mechanism would make life uncertain for regulated firms. The reverse should be the position, because of the transparency of the process. If all of the analysis and debate were kept secret within the tripartite authorities, which is what the Minister argued for in Committee, that would generate uncertainty for firms. The plain fact is that firms should expect to have their commercial policies changed as a response to the overall analysis of developments in financial stability. The fact that they were not checked at all during the decade or so of balance-sheet expansion was a blot on the history of financial regulation in this country, and that is exactly what we need to address. I beg to move.</p>

We live&#151;is it supposedly?&#151;in a sophisticated democracy, and it is a fault of Governments that they do not explain to the electorate what is happening to them. That is very much in evidence at the present time. The transparency inherent in my noble friend&#146;s amendment is a very important issue and we should support it.</p>

The FSA would be required to respond to any such letter and have regard to it when determining whether the banks are meeting their threshold conditions with respect to the adequacy of their resources. Judging from the title of the proposed new clause, I see that such communication is to have regard to the level of debt.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09020364000014"></a>In Committee, the noble Baroness indicated that the purpose of her amendment was to address what she identified as a &#147;policy instrument gap&#148; between the Bank of England and the FSA. She suggested that the macro-level analysis of the Bank of England was insufficiently integrated with the work of the FSA in regulating individual firms. If noble Lords will allow me, I should like to address this specific concern before turning to the details of the proposals made by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09020364000015"></a>It is clear that we are in challenging times. It is also clear that the events of recent months were unanticipated; indeed, they were not in their entirety predicted by any central banker or regulator that I am aware of. With respect, I do not believe that our present difficulties have emerged as a result of the lack of policy instruments of the kind that the noble Baroness suggests. Nor do I believe that any major failure of the UK&#146;s regulatory framework has led directly to the difficulties facing our financial system today. All countries are facing serious economic challenges, regardless of their regulatory frameworks and regardless of whether they have single or twin peak regulation. To lay the blame for the economic problems that we face on the nature of the regulatory framework of any individual country seems to me to be mistaken.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09020364000016"></a>I do not believe that any &#147;policy gap&#148; exists in the lines of communication between the Bank and the FSA, but I recognise the concerns raised by the noble

I hope that I can reassure her both on the general point with regard to the effectiveness of the co-operation between the FSA, the Bank of England and the Treasury, and with regard to some of the specific policy issues that she raised in Committee.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09020364000017"></a>When we considered this point in Committee, the noble Baroness drew attention to specific issues that she felt had been insufficiently considered by the tripartite authorities. In this regard, she mentioned the views of the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England on the financial cycle. I pay tribute to the tremendous work done by |Sir John Gieve as Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. He will be retiring shortly, but he has served the Bank in an extraordinary capacity in the most challenging times and often in quite hostile circumstances. I commend his contribution to the work of the Bank.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09020364000018"></a>I assure noble Lords that the tripartite authorities are considering very carefully the implications of the current financial crisis, including the observations by Sir John Gieve and the other deputy governor, Charlie Bean. They have both identified excessive debt as a causal factor in the current crisis, but they have not called for amendments along the lines of those suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09020364000019"></a>With respect, I believe that the noble Baroness is mistaken when she indicates that the current arrangements for the sharing of views within the tripartite, on this or any other issue, are insufficient. As I indicated in Committee, I strongly believe that both the Treasury and the FSA should have full access to the advice and views of the Bank of England when taking decisions in pursuit of their respective functions, but both the FSA and the Treasury already have sufficient access to the wisdom of the Bank. The tripartite authorities meet on a regular basis&#151;monthly, weekly and at times daily&#151;at both the principals&#146; and the deputies&#146; level, and there are ample opportunities for the Bank to raise any concerns that it may have about debt or any other matter that it believes is important to financial stability. In short, the Bank of England lacks no opportunity for voice.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09020364000020"></a>I hope that I have satisfied the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns about the need for a new clause such as the one that she proposes. I should like to turn now to the difficulties inherent in the proposed new clause. Fundamentally, it would require the Bank and the FSA to publish letters. This returns to the difficult tension between transparency and the need to avoid undesirable impacts on the market; we will return to that tension later on Report. Some occasions may call for a frank exchange of views between the Bank and the FSA which, from the perspective of market sentiment, it would be imprudent to subject to publication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09020364000021"></a>Perhaps I may follow up on the concerns I raised about the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment in Committee. Her new clause rightly reflects the fact that published letters should not deal with the position of specific financial institutions or other persons. However, given the Bank&#146;s role as a lender of last resort, the most  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_638"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 638</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>useful advice that it could offer&#151;and, as I said, already does offer&#151;to the regulator regarding financial stability is highly likely to relate to specific institutions or other persons who are in receipt of liquidity or other financial assistance from the Bank. Clearly, that could not be made public. Therefore, any information in a public letter would have to be based on aggregate-level assessments of debt in the financial system as a whole.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09020364000022"></a>It is hard to know how the FSA could meaningfully respond even to such an aggregate assessment without making reference to specific firms. The FSA conducts its supervision on a risk-based basis, taking into account specific factors that affect each firm individually. It would have to evaluate the Bank&#146;s advice in this same way and would have to consider the impact of the Bank&#146;s aggregate assessment on each institution it supervises. Noble Lords will remember that this was one of the principal objections I raised to this clause in Committee. The regulator&#146;s independence in making judgments about individual firms would be undermined if it had also to have regard to aggregate-level judgments made by the central bank. Putting aside that fundamental objection for the moment, I fail to see how the FSA could publicly respond to the Bank in any terms other than that it had noted the Bank&#146;s advice and would take it into consideration.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09020364000023"></a>While agreeing with the need for the tripartite authorities to work effectively together, and with the principle of information-sharing between them, I cannot agree that this new clause provides a suitable mechanism. However, it may be of some reassurance to note that in Clause 243 we are taking steps to ensure that the Bank of England is empowered to share with other members of the tripartite specific information about individual financial institutions and with regard to financial stability. Tripartite co-operation can only be enhanced as a result. I strongly believe that the provisions of Clause 243 will address any remaining concerns that noble Lords may have.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09020364000024"></a>In addition, I would of course accept that there are lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis. Indeed, regulators the world over are striving to learn them. Here in the UK, the FSA has embarked on an ambitious supervisory enhancement programme in the wake of its report on Northern Rock, and the noble Lord, Lord Turner, is conducting a further review of the way in which the authority carries out its functions. The Bank of England, too, is undergoing change as it steps up to take on the new responsibilities which this Bill confers on it, particularly with regard to the special resolution regime. I can assure the noble Baroness that the tripartite authorities are active, engaged and co-operating closely to address the challenges to financial stability that we currently face. There is no need for new public reporting structures to be introduced to make this process of collaboration function.</p>

<a name="90203-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09020364000025"></a>In closing, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, made reference to the Bank of England&#146;s financial stability report. Although that is a high quality document, it tends towards the academic. It is not necessarily read by the right people and the Bank of England is working hard to ensure that it gets into the hands of independent directors, heads and members of risk and audit committees, rather than into academic libraries.

I hope that the Bank&#146;s financial stability reports might also learn from the examples I cited. I do not believe that a report of the sort envisaged in this amendment would be appropriate. On that basis, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

He said that banks&#146; balance sheets were not to blame for the financial crisis. I did not suggest that what had happened over the past decade or so on banks&#146; balance sheets was to blame. However, as the regulatory authorities missed a trick in their regulation of banks&#146; balance sheets during that period, there is a good question to be asked about why that was.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09020364000027"></a>The Minister talked about all these interactions in the tripartite authorities. There is a big issue about how effective those interactions are and the Minister will just have to accept that many of us are deeply sceptical about it. We are not clear whether there is a meeting of minds&#151;whether, if the Bank says something, it is heard, in a deep sense, by the FSA. There is no evidence of that to date. The issue is not so much about what happens behind closed doors but, as I tried to say in my Amendment, about getting a greater public debate. I do not believe that the financial stability report is the kind of document that could generate that debate. It is a lost cause, if you like.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09020364000028"></a>The Minister said that the most useful advice would relate to stressed institutions, but I do not believe that that is the case. The issue is to make sure that the macro risks, as perceived by the Bank, are fed into the FSA&#146;s own micro-level risk-assessed approach to the individual institutions. As I said, the Governor of the Bank of England, in a speech only last month, referred to the need for,</p>
<ul><a name="09020364000077"></a>&#147;an additional instrument to stabilise the growth of the financial sector balance sheet&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020364000029"></a>What was the governor referring to? I do not believe that he was referring to more deep and meaningful conversations in the tripartite authorities. I believe that he was referring to something with an external relevance and publication so that the issues are properly raised. It is clear that the Government will have a closed mind to the useful suggestions of the Conservative Party, unless and until they choose to steal them at a later stage and claim them as their own. I will therefore not pursue my amendment further. But it is a great pity. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We can see that there are drawbacks in the weekly publication, but we should be wary of removing information completely from the public domain. No alternative reporting requirement is placed on the Bank of England by Clause 242, so that is what my amendment would do.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09020364000031"></a>In the place of weekly publication, I have proposed two changes to the 1844 Act with my amendment. The first is to allow the Treasury to prescribe the form and frequency of the return, so that it can move from weekly if that is appropriate. The second is to modernise the publication requirement so that the existing requirement to publish in the next <I>London Gazette</I> is replaced by a broader requirement to publish,</p>

<p><a name="09020364000064"></a>but with an important let-out on the basis of public interest. I hope that the Government will not insist on letting the Bank of England retreat into secrecy. The Bank is a public body and ought to be open and transparent. The Treasury should call the shots on publication, not the Bank. That is what my amendment seeks to achieve. I beg to move.</p>

The weekly return is a one-page summary of the Bank&#146;s monetary assets and liabilities for the week in question. Under the clause, the Bank is no longer required by law to publish such a weekly statement, although, if it so chose, it could still publish such a return and may continue to do so for a period of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09020364000033"></a>When we discussed this issue in Committee, it became apparent that the issues underlying the debate were twofold, with the need for transparency set against the need to protect against untimely disclosures that could have a negative impact on market sentiment. If noble Lords will permit me, I should like to begin by addressing some of the points that emerged in that debate.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09020364000034"></a>In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, suggested that the Government were taking an all-or-nothing approach to the transparency of the Bank of England. I reassure noble Lords that that is not the case. The Bank of England has no plans immediately and comprehensively to cease reporting as a consequence of this provision. Rather, it will be empowered to determine an appropriate level of reporting frequency and I believe that it will propose to consult when determining that reporting detail and reporting frequency.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09020364000035"></a>Noble Lords also expressed concern that this step could have a broader negative impact on the transparency of the Bank of England as a public institution. As I indicated in Committee, the Government have a strong  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_641"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 641</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>commitment to transparency and believe that the free and effective flow of information is vital to efficiently functioning markets, as well as to the trust that is placed in public institutions. Indeed, matters of public interest with regard to the Bank of England are already published by other means.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09020364000036"></a>I reiterate the point that I made in Committee, which was that the weekly return is not needed to ensure that the Bank operates transparently. Other reporting obligations are placed on it, including the requirements to respect Companies Act reporting standards as laid out in Section 7 of the Bank of England Act. I alluded to this in Committee. Furthermore, as I indicated previously, the retention of a legal requirement to produce a weekly return may force the Bank of England to make disclosures that are harmful to financial stability. For this reason, the Government, with the support of the Bank, consider that it is appropriate to revoke the requirement to publish a weekly return and to allow the Bank, after consultation, to decide how it is to disclose such information as is required to maintain market confidence.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09020364000037"></a>In the light of the difficult tension between transparency and the need to retain market confidence, to which I alluded earlier, I have some sympathy with the amendment laid by the noble Baroness. I appreciate that she has carefully considered how to modify the provision in question, but I reluctantly remain of the view that the Bank of England is best placed to determine how to balance the very real tensions to which I have referred.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09020364000038"></a>Noble Lords have previously highlighted the fact that it is unusual for a public institution to determine the level of transparency to which it is subject, but I remind the House that the Bank of England will be doing so under its statutory duty to contribute to the protection and enhancement of financial stability, and that this level of delegation is appropriate, given that duty. Appropriate transparency on the part of the Bank will contribute to confidence in the financial system and I am sure that the Bank will recognise that.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09020364000039"></a>I turn to the technical aspects of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment. Under the amendment, the reporting of the Bank of England would cease to be a weekly return and would become a periodic return. An effect of the amendment would be that the period would be prescribed by the commissioners of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, given the stipulations of the Bank Charter Act 1844. I assume that that is not her intention. The technical difficulties aside, my objection to the amendment is that it does not answer the Government&#146;s concern that, whenever a return is published, those speculating about liquidity support could still be avidly reading it to determine whether it gives any indication about a bank, or banks, that face difficulties.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09020364000040"></a>The second part of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness addresses this concern. The amendment would allow some flexibility in the publication time, requiring the return to be published as soon as is practical, subject to the need to protect the public interest. I have great sympathy with this approach and, again, I appreciate the careful thought that has gone into striking a balance between the need for

Unfortunately, the amendment still does not quite work. If there is to be a periodic return, which in good times is published as regularly as clockwork, and then&#151;for whatever reason&#151;it is decided to delay publication, a chilling signal would be sent that steps were being taken concerning banks. Whatever the reasons for delaying publication of a particular return, it may well have an adverse effect on the market and it would be very difficult to predict what that effect might be.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09020364000041"></a>The amendment fails in so far as it does not manage to reconcile in a workable way the competing concerns of transparency on the one hand and the need to maintain market confidence on the other. At the broadest level, however, this debate is about whether to do away with the requirement to publish a periodic return of the nature of the weekly return or whether to keep some form of requirement for a return. The objections to this amendment that I have outlined would apply more generally to a wide range of any similar amendments. By imposing a requirement specific enough to be meaningful, an expectation of publication is raised and, as soon as a return is not published, or is published with significant redaction, market speculation is likely to escalate. Removing the obligation is, the Government believe, the appropriate way in which to give sufficient flexibility.</p>

It is an appropriate and proportionate step to enable the Bank of England to take proper control of the reporting process and to avoid a serious failure of market confidence in periods when liquidity assistance has been offered. Given these concerns and the very real difficulties with the amendment, I ask the noble Baroness to reconsider whether her amendment is necessary or desirable.</p>

I think that the antithesis between transparency and market confidence is out of date. In a reasonably open society with a free media, in the digital age, you cannot maintain the argument that there is a genuine antithesis between transparency and market confidence. I urge the Minister to go back to the Treasury and ask for that matter to be seriously considered.</p>

The big issue is not as the Minister articulated it; it should be whether the Treasury or the Bank calls the shots. I may well have drafted in HMRC because I had not translated the wording that was in the 1844 Act; I assumed that the successor was the Treasury, but I had not checked that properly. The Minister tried to make the tension between transparency and public interest the issue. It is extraordinary that the Bank has, since 1844, been publishing a weekly return, yet there have been many periods in that time when the Bank has entered into support operations and this issue has never been raised. This issue is being used as a cover for increasing secrecy.</p>

Current Treasury Ministers seem content to let the Bank retreat into its own version of secrecy. We do not think that that is a good idea, partly because of the issue of transparency about where what is in effect public money is going, but also in part because the weekly return gives important information about whether the printing presses have been unleashed. In today&#146;s environment, that is important information for all those who want to know what the Bank is up to in supporting the economy.</p>

I should say that I had intended to talk about this clause in Committee in a clause stand part debate when it was Clause 238, but in the early hours of last Tuesday morning the clause managed to stand part without my addressing it. I have now tabled an amendment in order to probe the issue.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09020364000048"></a>This clause allows the FSA to vary permissions to carry on regulated activities on its own initiative inter alia where it is desirable to protect consumers. There is nothing wrong with that, but the new wording added by Clause 245 means that the FSA can vary permission in relation to bank A even though the consumer protection is in respect of the customers of bank B. I struggle to see how that might be appropriate, so my purpose for questioning this clause in Committee and again today is to find out what the clause is designed to do in practice. I beg to move.</p>

It clarifies an important provision in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, specifically Section 45(1)(c). This section gives the FSA the power to vary or cancel on its own initiative a permission that it has granted to allow an authorised person to carry out regulated activities. It allows the FSA to exercise this power in a number of circumstances, such as when the person with permission is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the threshold conditions or has failed within the last 12 months to carry out the activity to which the permission relates.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09020364000050"></a>Subsection (1)(c) also allows the FSA to exercise its power where it is desirable to do so in order to protect the interests of consumers or potential consumers. Usually in the FSMA, where there is a reference to  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_644"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 644</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consumers, this means consumers generally and not just a particular firm, and this is the appropriate interpretation of Section 45. As recent events have shown, that is entirely appropriate. We need to consider the interests of consumers generally, not just on a firm-by-firm basis. Clause 245 would introduce an amendment to subsection (1)(c) to make it clear beyond any doubt that the reference to consumers includes consumers generally. The amendment makes it clear that, for example, the FSA could exercise its powers in the interests of consumers where firm A is conducting investment activities for firm B and is not adhering to regulatory standards, but where the contractual relationship is between firm B and the consumer. It should be noted that the effect of this amendment would relate to any exercise by the FSA of its powers under Section 45 of the Financial Services and Markets Act.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09020364000051"></a>In addition to providing important clarity in relation to banks, which are the institutions on which we are focusing in this legislation, the Government believe that the effect of the amendment should be general in application. It applies in relation to any financial institution that operates by way of permission from the FSA. This is appropriate because the point is one of clarity of the general interpretation. An amendment that applied only in relation to banks would suggest two different meanings to the interests of consumers rather than one, which would create further confusion and uncertainty. I hope, therefore, that the noble Baroness will accept that I have described why the clause sets out a sensible provision and should remain in the Bill.</p>

When we debated this in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, asked the Minister whether he was familiar with the G30 report which had been produced in the previous week. In reply, the Minister said that he would study it as soon as he had the opportunity. Given that I know he spent the entire weekend reading, I hope that he has indeed had the opportunity. In case he has not&#151;and for those noble Lords who equally might not have waded through this extremely technical document&#151;I should like to draw attention to the relevant conclusion of the report which, in typical bankese, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_86"></a><a name="09020364000084"></a>&#147;Large systemically important banking institutions should be restricted in undertaking proprietary activities that present particularly high risks&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09020364000065"></a>and serious conflicts of interest. The report is referring to exactly the problem that we have had in this country with the large banks, which have started life as deposit-takers, become investment banks and have ended up running a casino which has broken the bank. The importance of the G30 report is not simply in the content of the report, but in the fact of who chairs the committee. The committee which produced it is chaired by Paul Volcker and he will be one of the key advisers to President Obama on all these matters in the months going forward. Therefore, one could assume that this matter will be actively considered by the Administration, and not just the regulators, in the United States.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09020364000054"></a>This issue was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, in the <I>Economist</I><I>&#146;s</I> Inaugural City Lecture on 21 January. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_87"></a><a name="09020364000085"></a>&#147;A crucial issue for regulators is therefore going to continue to be how we regulate the very large and very complex systemically important banks which are too big to fail and which are involved both in narrow banking and in complex treasury and trading activities&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020364000066"></a>The precise ways in which we achieve this end will need to be carefully considered. He then said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_88"></a><a name="09020364000086"></a>&#147;I am not convinced however that this can or should take the form of any absolute separation between institutions&#148;.</p>

<a name="90203-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09020364000087"></a>It is absolutely clear that the FSA is going to be considering this along with the range of other issues which it is looking at in terms of how to make banking regulation more effective. The assurance which I seek from the Minister is that this should not be thought of by the Treasury as a technical issue to be left to the FSA. It goes to the heart of whether we are going to have a banking system which is fit for purpose in the future and a banking system which is going to have the confidence of the British public. As both the Treasury and the FSA look at a whole raft of ways in which the regulatory framework is amended in the future, I do hope that the Treasury is going to take this matter extremely seriously and not simply leave it to the FSA to look at.</p>

The investment banking operations of banks such as Barclays can create and accentuate serious systemic risk in our basic banking system.</p>

Similarly, a range of international institutions and commentators are addressing these very questions. In last Monday&#146;s debate my noble friend Lord Eatwell

I was not familiar with that report then but I understand it suggests that large, systemically important banking institutions should be restricted in undertaking proprietary activities that present particularly high risks. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, informed the House last week, the OECD has voiced similar support for the general proposition that banking activity&#151;the taking of deposits and the making of loans&#151;should be separated from other types of more speculative financial activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09020366000001"></a>Others may not share that view. The noble Lord, Lord Turner, said in his speech at the<I> Economist</I>&#146;s Inaugural City Lecture on 21 January that he was not convinced that there should be an absolute separation of investment banking from retail or narrow banking. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, will remember bringing up some of the counterarguments himself at our debate last Monday, although I do not mean to suggest that he was putting these forward as his own view but rather to show his acknowledgement of the breadth of the argument.

There is now a broad acceptance that the capital required against trading activities was too low and the capital required against conventional narrow banking assets was too high and therefore there was an incentive to broaden the activity of a bank. There are worthy issues here for debate and discussion. Even if we do not mandate the separation of the activities we can acknowledge that they had fundamentally different risk characteristics that should be recognised in regulation and capital requirements. Incidentally, that is one of the features that the governor had in mind when he talked about further instruments when he spoke recently in Nottingham.</p>

Should action in this direction be needed, the next step to be taken would of course be to publish proposals on the matter for consultation and debate with stakeholders in the UK. However, I do not believe that this proposal for a report on the matter needs to be placed in the Bill and therefore I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

My concern is not simply that the matter be debated, which it will be, but that the responsibility for deciding on changes within banking regulation should not rest only with the noble Lord, Lord Turner.

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09020366000008"></a>A major problem that we have faced in recent years is that the FSA has not been seen to perform its functions as Parliament intended in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

With that caveat, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Although my noble friend Lord Davies is always eloquent and well informed, he generalised on what the position is now rather than being more radical and going for a national or people&#146;s bank. However, I was pleased to see in the press at the weekend, which one must sometimes read to learn  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_649"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 649</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what is being thought, that we have the support of my noble friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. I saw him here a little while ago; I thought he might be coming to hear this debate. However, the press was saying that he was in favour of a people&#146;s bank, so I hope that I am pushing at an open door tonight. I shall listen with great interest to what my noble friend has to say when he replies.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09020366000010"></a>I emphasise again that we are talking about a fully fledged bank that could provide all the financial services. That is a radical step, so I hope that we are going down that route. There is no doubt that many people trust the Post Office who do not trust banks. Indeed, they would not even contemplate going to a bank. This will provide those disadvantaged people with that opportunity. It will also bring banking facilities to rural areas. In many cases, no bank is available to them for miles. It will certainly help the elderly, people with disabilities, mothers with children and, of course, those who do not have a car. It would be a great advantage.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09020366000011"></a>We are talking about providing 12,000 branches. The benefits will not only be in rural areas, but the deprived urban areas where many of the most disadvantaged people in our community live. These are people who do not have the advantages of others such as full banking facilities, going online, paying by direct debit or settling bills in one way or another. It is estimated that the poorest in our society are roughly &#163;1,400 per year worse off because they do not have such facilities.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09020366000012"></a>On deprived city areas, I do not think that my noble friend referred to the Post Office card account, which should be modified. It is currently only about withdrawing money that the Government have deposited. We want to see it extended to give its customers a fundamental basic bank account. That would certainly help them. The other people it would help are the small and medium-sized businesses that use the post office. Such businesses would derive even more benefit if a people&#146;s bank was established. We all know that the Government are talking about getting banks lending again. This would certainly be a positive step in that direction. It would get things on the move in that regard.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09020366000013"></a>I do not think that I need discuss again what form this bank should take except to say that we might consider the merger of the Britannia and the Co-op, which deals in ethical banking. However, there are positive signs in the press in this regard. I look forward to my noble friend&#146;s reply. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, made a powerful case, especially as regards trust, which I shall discuss in a minute, and ensuring that banking services are available, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="09020366000017"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, is no longer in his place. He looked in a few minutes ago. It would have been good to have him listening to this discussion, although we read with great interest the lead story in the <I>Observer</I> on Sunday on this topic, with which he is probably not totally unassociated. Trust is a great problem for our banking system and for the Post Office in particular. The noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, talked about post office depositors who did not have a car. However, if I may put it this way, they are driving, often with their eyes shut, towards a level crossing with no gates, where the red lights are flashing and the alarm bells are ringing about the Bank of Ireland. British savers have already had one serious shock from Icelandic banks where the FSA and the Government failed to warn or act until it was too late. I am afraid that the message from the markets about Ireland is equally chilling.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09020366000018"></a>The other day, the noble Lord, Lord Myners, was a little out of touch with where gilt markets have been lately. I should explain that long-term 10-year bonds in Germany are yielding 3.26 per cent today. They are yielding 3.7 per cent in the UK and 5.57 per cent in Ireland. That means that the Irish Government are having to pay a 75 per cent higher interest rate than Germany to borrow money, and even 50 per cent more than ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="st_224"></a>
<a name="09020366000019"></a><b><a name="90203-0015.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09020366000059"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, for giving way. What I said&#151;and I chose my words very precisely&#151;was that the ratio of sterling to bund interest rates saw sterling within the favourable band of the medium-term trend. I was not talking about absolute rates, but rather medium-term relativities. I am in contact with what the gilt market does.</p>

<p><a name="st_225"></a>
<a name="09020366000020"></a><b><a name="90203-0015.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09020366000060"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord is quite right that he went on to say that. What I objected to was the fact that he said that British bond yields were at a 50-year low, which they were a few weeks ago, but not quite now.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09020366000021"></a>Anyway, the key thing for Ireland is the ratio and the very serious warning message that the markets are sending that Ireland and Greece are yielding far more bonds than any other Eurobond. This is important because, similarly, the credit default swap rates for the Bank of Ireland&#151;the rates to insure it, if you like&#151;suggest that there is a chance of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent that it will default over the next few years. That is almost exactly the figure for Kaupthing and Landsbanki of Iceland a few months before they went down. At the time, I was warning and the Treasury was giving me very complacent answers. I am afraid that we have been here before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09020366000022"></a>I ask the noble Lord to take this on board and to take it up with the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, regarding his plans. The British state-owned Post Office should stand for total trust for savers, like National Savings. In these extraordinary times in the banking world, as the noble Lord, Lord Myners, has pointed out several times tonight, can we really afford to run the risk of the Post Office&#146;s deposits being placed with a shaky foreign bank by a shaky foreign Government&#146;s guarantee? The Post Office must now find a strong long-term British banking partner&#151;the noble Lord suggested one name, although there are several perfectly reputable strong names in this country&#151;to replace the Bank of Ireland before thousands of savers are either left in the lurch or the British taxpayer is put in the position of having to ride to the rescue of a foreign Government, as in the case of Iceland.</p>

I know that two noble Lords who would have spoken had trouble getting here, due to the weather, otherwise my noble friend would have found considerable support from our Back Benches. I appreciate the fact that my noble friend Lord Wedderburn committed himself in support of a sustainable Post Office operation. That is exactly what the Government want.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09020366000024"></a>We have taken a number of actions to support that goal. Over the past few years, we have worked with the major high-street banks to ensure that a wide range of banking facilities is accessible through Post Office branches. The most recent FSA guide indicates that 17 providers&#146; basic bank accounts can be accessed at the Post Office. In addition, current accounts from a number of building societies and banks are accessible at the Post Office. Furthermore, the Post Office has its own brand of banking services. Again, I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, has said; he made that point last week in Committee and he has made it again. I know it is a serious point, which we will of course take on board. However, he will also appreciate that at present the Post Office is able to offer its own-brand banking services, operated via a joint venture with the Bank of Ireland. That has been a considerably successful activity in those terms.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="09020366000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, issued a warning which the Government will take seriously, and I assure him that at this stage the Government do not share his profound anxieties about the position regarding the Bank of Ireland, although I take note of the pointers that he indicated. The Post Office continues to deliver a number of government services. For instance, last year the Department for Work and Pensions renewed the contract with the Post Office to deliver benefit payments through an enhanced Post Office card account. My noble friend Lord Hoyle said that that was too limited in its operation. There are ways in which extension could occur and we will certainly look at them.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09020366000026"></a>I will mention also that, in the Pre-Budget Report last year, we announced that the Post Office would provide the savings gateway account programme to encourage saving for people on benefits. As my noble  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_652"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 652</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>friend rightly said in his opening speech, the Post Office reaches parts that other banks have difficulty in reaching. It is a people&#146;s service for many who otherwise would not conceive of themselves as able to open a bank account. It is all the more meritorious for that. The Post Office also provides a child trust fund, a Christmas club and savings stamps.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="09020366000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, correctly observed that my noble friend Lord Mandelson was here with us for a short period this evening. I think that he was aware that this issue was coming up. Of course it is the case that he has deliberately indicated the extent to which he wants to look progressively and positively at opportunities for the Post Office.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="09020366000028"></a>Often, one looks with a shudder on Report stage, when it falls so quickly after Committee, because one has nothing fresh to say about amendments that have remarkable similarity to those in the debates of the preceding week. However, I am blessed this evening, because whereas I might only have been able to reiterate the potentialities of the Post Office that I identified last week when I had to reply in the debate, I am instead able to give much clearer assertions of the Government&#146;s intention to enhance the role of the Post Office.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="09020366000029"></a>The noble Lord said that he wanted to see a stronger role for the Post Office, and this is something that we are working on. My noble friend, who always keeps a close eye on parliamentary procedures, will also know that the Select Committee on the department in the other place has been enjoined with the task of looking at the opportunities that the Post Office could develop.</p>

<a name="90203-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="09020366000030"></a>Those two important developments give a clear earnest of the Government&#146;s intent to respond to the motivation behind this amendment. I am very glad that my noble friend raised the issue this evening. It is a very important debate and there will be other opportunities when undoubtedly it will be taken forward. In the mean time, I hope that I have given a sufficiently positive reply for him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="09020366000034"></a>Her Majesty's Government have accepted that the provisions of the Bill have the potential to cause legal uncertainty in many areas where certainty is critical for the stability and competitiveness of our financial sector. Meetings to attempt to reduce this uncertainty are ongoing, but with such wide powers given to this Government to change the secondary legislation, it will be impossible to remove the uncertainty entirely. The Bill is intended to preserve the stability and competitiveness of our financial institutions. The amendment would go a long way to reassuring all involved that the Government are serious about taking an objective, non-partisan approach to resolving problems in the banking sector. The non-partisan element is essential, which is why the amendment calls for an independent review, not an internal review. The assessment of the impact of the Bill as a whole is also crucial. In his comments, the Minister made no mention of when a review might be held. If the Government are given too much flexibility in how their commitment to a review is fulfilled, there is a risk that the review may become postponed indefinitely.</p>

In the recent Pensions Act 2008, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, appreciated that there was a very real chance that private sector provision could be seriously disrupted by the establishment of personal accounts. Therefore, he took the sensible and responsible step of accepting that there should be a duty to review the scheme. I hope that the Minister will come to the same conclusion in respect of this complex and unprecedented piece of legislation. I beg to move.</p>

If the noble Lord wanted an earnest of the Government&#146;s intent, he will see the extent to which we have already provided for important parts of the review process within the legislation. He mentioned the Banking Liaison Panel and he will know that it will have an important role in advising the Treasury in due course as to what changes are needed to legislation under Parts 1 to 3 of the Bill. That is an important dimension, given the fact that the work that is being done on the provisional panel is already appreciated. Within the framework of this legislation we create the permanent role of the Banking Liaison Panel and review is clearly part of its objective. The past terms of remit allow it to give advice about the secondary legislation under Parts 1 to 3 the Bill. We tabled amendments, which we debated yesterday, to expand the role of the Banking Liaison Panel. Thus the panel will be able to keep under review important aspects of the special resolution review which, of course, has been the nub of very significant debate today and it forms a very important part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="09020371000001"></a>That will be doubly the case if the review is also to consider any exercise of the special resolution powers in relation to a particular institution during the review period. We will need to consider carefully how best to ensure that the review is conducted by a person with appropriate expertise to assess such material. We will also need appropriate mechanisms to protect confidentiality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="09020371000002"></a>The issue is not as simple and straightforward as the noble Lord suggests. We are conscious that reviewing crucial parts of the legislation is important and have already written into the Bill specified provisions. I have no doubt that he will continue to press the concept of the general review, but I hope that he will recognise that the Government are intent on ensuring that the legislation is subject to review. If we need in due course to extend the scope of the review, we will take steps to do so. However, I hope that he will recognise that there is not a great deal of difference between us in his search for a more general review and the rather more specific and carefully thought through

He picked on specific areas. A general review of the legislation is also important and something that he may like to think about. The Banking Liaison Panel will have a very important role, but it should be mandatory for its review to take place and to be put into the public arena. It is all very well to say that the Government will consult, but if there is no set schedule for consultation, it may well not happen. I am sure that the Minister does not mean that to be the case, but there is always the risk. Information and analysis may well be technical and sensitive, and there may be an argument that the publication of the results of consultation should be delayed, but that is not an excuse for discussions that have taken place not be made public in future. I hope that the Minister will listen to those comments. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Clause 254 allows the Treasury to define what is and what is not financial assistance. According to subsection (2), an order can,</p>
<ul><a name="09020371000042"></a>&#147;provide that a specified activity or transaction, or class of activity or transaction, is to be or not to be treated as financial assistance&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020371000035"></a>That is on top of a very wide definition of financial assistance already in Clause 254(1).</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="09020371000005"></a>The importance of this is that what counts as financial assistance is critical in determining whether the FSA can invoke Clause 7 and start the ball rolling in stabilisation powers. It also drives Clause 227 in relation to Consolidated Fund cover, which we discussed earlier. Concentrating on how the FSA might use it, I find it difficult to see why the power is needed, given the wide definition in subsection (1). If it is needed, surely it ought to be considered by Parliament before coming into effect.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="09020371000006"></a>The Treasury&#146;s memorandum to the Delegated Powers Committee said that the negative procedure was needed because such orders might have to be made quickly while Parliament was not sitting. I do not think that that bears close examination. Since there is already a  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_656"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wide definition, it must be the case that the Treasury would want to use the power only if it wanted to classify something that the man on the Clapham omnibus would not recognise as plausibly equivalent to financial assistance. The Treasury would be using this power to define as financial assistance something that was not obviously financial assistance and thereby could use the revised, possibly artificial, definition to set the special resolution regime in motion, because the FSA has no option but to ignore whatever is defined by the Treasury as financial assistance when triggering the stabilisation powers under Clause 7.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="09020371000007"></a>The clause places a potentially very damaging power in the hands of the Treasury, which I suggest ought not to be exercised without Parliament&#146;s approval. Otherwise, we give the Treasury carte blanche to determine when to pull the plug on a bank and all the carefully crafted hurdles and tests in Clauses 7 to 9 become meaningless, because the Treasury will in effect define how it is all to work out in practice. I believe that if the power is to remain, we should have proper parliamentary oversight and not simply rely on the negative procedure, because I cannot see that it would be proper or necessary for the power to be used in an emergency. I beg to move.</p>

The clause is therefore of considerable significance because it provides what is essentially a reserve power to give clarity and certainty about the definition, if that is required. The power may well need to be exercised at short notice, because there may be an urgent need to make provision on whether something should constitute financial assistance for the purposes of the Bill. For example, should a bank need financial assistance on an urgent basis, it may want to know as quickly as possible how that financial assistance will be treated under this Bill. For example, will the financial assistance be disregarded by the FSA in determining whether the general conditions for the special resolution regime are satisfied under Clause 7?</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="09020371000009"></a>If it is appropriate to make provision under Clause 254 on how financial assistance is to be treated under the Bill, it may well be appropriate, for legal and market certainty, to make that provision quickly. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would make the exercise of the power subject to the draft affirmative procedure rather than the negative procedure. I recognise that of course there ought to be parliamentary scrutiny of important changes to the definition of financial assistance, but I am not at all convinced that the affirmative procedure is either necessary or appropriate. The power may need to be used urgently. Of course, there are limitations on the affirmative procedure in those terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="09020371000010"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not think that it ought to recommend the affirmative procedure for this power. The committee made no recommendation about procedure, but had it been anxious about it we all know that it would have agreed with the noble Baroness that the affirmative

The fact that the committee does not agree indicates that, as far as that important body is concerned, the Government may well have got this position right.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="09020371000011"></a>I recognise the anxieties of the noble Baroness on this matter, but we do not think that the power is too broad. The clause does not allow the Treasury to alter the basic meaning of the expression &#147;financial assistance&#148;, and the power does not allow the Treasury to make something that is obviously not financial assistance into financial assistance. It merely helps in two broad purposes of assisting with definition. As I indicated, because in certain circumstances there may be the necessity for urgency with regard to this, I do not think that the affirmative resolution is the appropriate procedure. I hope that the noble Baroness will think that the Government&#146;s defence of the arrangements in Clause 254 is sufficient for her to withdraw her amendment.</p>

The crux of the issue is whether this ever needs to be done at short notice. The Minister is right that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not make any recommendation but, towards the end of that very big document that the Treasury submitted to the committee, it was asserted that the power had to be exercised at short notice. Whether the committee had the time to challenge the underlying veracity of that assertion is perhaps open to question, but I have challenged it for the purposes of the amendment, because no additional information was given in the memorandum to the committee to explain why the power was urgent.</p>

He has not allayed my concerns but, as with so much of this Bill, we shall have to see what happens in practice. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The amendment is also one that I chose not to move at the end of Committee last week, and it raises slightly different issues.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="09020371000018"></a>I propose in the amendment to delete subsections (4) and (5) from Clause 256. I want to probe the rather unusual procedure of having a rather long list of statutory instruments which are to be made for the first time using a procedure for approval after the event. I am aware of the need for speed for at least some of the orders listed in subsection (5) to be up and running as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent. We have already debated that, in particular in relation to Clauses 47 and 48, which deal with partial transfers, netting and set-off and related transactions. Others are clearly in the same category.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="09020371000019"></a>My problem is that the amendments have the potential to be controversial. I am thinking in particular of the partial transfer order expected to be made under Clause 48. The Minister will be aware that there are still considerable concerns about the carve-outs in that order and whether they will prove to be positively harmful to banking practices. I believe that further drafts of the statutory instrument are still awaited, and there is a further meeting involving lawyers tomorrow.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="09020371000020"></a>We are only 10 days or so away from Royal Assent, and that means that the order could be made in a form that has not been fully consulted on, which does not necessarily command the support of the banks and could, in extremis, damage their businesses. Part of the purpose of tabling these amendments is to obtain from the Minister a view on the path, from now until Royal Assent, for getting in particular this important statutory instrument under Clause 48, so that it is available immediately Royal Assent is given. As he will be aware, any gap where the detailed rules are not set out in the statutory instrument will be regarded as a major problem by the banking community.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="09020371000021"></a>The list of powers in Clause 256 is quite long, and not all of them seem to be in the urgent category. While I can see that some powers have to be implemented very quickly, I am not clear that the Government have good justification for saying that all of these orders need to be made urgently. I am also not aware of whether drafts of all of them are available and being consulted on, which raises the question of whether the appropriate procedure for all of these orders in the first instance is not the one where approval is effectively given in arrear. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_659"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 659</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

Subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 256 include a rather limited list. If the Minister reads it, he will see that I am not referring to every power.</p>

<p><a name="st_241"></a>
<a name="09020371000024"></a><b><a name="90203-0016.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09020371000055"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, that is so. But the noble Baroness asked how this fits in in relation to the expiry powers of the 2008 Act, so it is a fairly tall order. But I will summarise the Government&#146;s arguments. Parts 1 to 3 are essentially designed to provide a permanent and refined replacement for the temporary powers created last year by the Banking (Special Provisions) Act, which come to an end in the near future. The Government initially used the powers to take Northern Rock into temporary public ownership. All noble Lords in the Chamber will be well aware of the fact that that Act had a sunset clause attached, which will bring its provisions to an end.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="09020371000025"></a>I think that we can all agree on the prudence of keeping the temporary powers in the 2008 Act while the permanent legislation, this Banking Bill, was being prepared. This has been clearly demonstrated by events. Last year, while we were doing all the consultation and preparation work on this Bill, the Government had to act under the provisions of the 2008 Act with regard to Bradford &amp; Bingley, Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander, and Heritable in order to safeguard financial stability and protect depositors and other creditors. The provisions of the Act lapse on 21 February.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="09020371000026"></a>As I am sure that all noble Lords will agree, in the current situation of continuing financial and economic uncertainty across the world it would be extremely unwise to create a situation where the necessary powers lapsed. That is why we have sought, gained and are duly appreciative of a consensus on putting in place this permanent legislation. I place on record, as my noble friend has done on a number of occasions, our gratitude to the opposition parties for being constructive about the necessity of putting in place permanent legislation in such an important area of our national life as the financial systems. We cannot take the risk of a gap between the relevant powers of the special provisions Act and the commencement of the powers in this Bill.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="09020371000027"></a>However, there are elements of the special resolution regime that require secondary legislation to be in place in order for them to be operable and fully effective. Over the past two days and in Committee we have explored the nature of that necessary secondary legislation. The safeguards that relate to the operation of the resolution regime are contained in secondary legislation and it is vital that it is brought into force at the same time as the power in the Bill to carry out a partial transfer. Similarly, the new insolvency regimes created by Parts 2 and 3 simply will not work unless and until regulations and rules related to the new regime created by the Bill are in place. Again, we could do ourselves the credit of having engaged in very substantial scrutiny and discussion about the Bill on those provisions. To ensure that these essential pieces of secondary legislation can if necessary be in place at short notice, these subsections of Clause 249 will allow these instruments to be put in place by the 28-day affirmative procedure  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_660"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column 660</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>instead of the draft affirmative procedure. We had a substantial debate about that earlier today and further discussion awaits us before, and no doubt during, Third Reading. I sought to assure the House earlier today that the 28-day procedure will guarantee that there will be full debate in Parliament, but I do not think we need to tread over ground we covered so extensively earlier this afternoon.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="09020371000028"></a>This House will have the opportunity to debate these instruments in full and, as an additional safeguard, the procedure can only be used the first time these powers are exercised and only if the Treasury is also satisfied that it is necessary to do so. This is a fairly standard method of bringing forward essential secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="09020371000029"></a>The Government therefore feel that their approach strikes the right balance between ensuring that these instruments are subject to full parliamentary debate and ensuring that the special resolution regime is fully operable from the date on which the key provisions of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act cease to have effect, which of course is in the very near future indeed. I also add that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which has considered the Bill in full, has not made any comment or recommendation on this approach.</p>

<a name="90203-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="09020371000030"></a>The noble Baroness will also know that work is ongoing on developing the safeguards and we believe we are very close to reaching agreement with the legal experts. Royal Assent is expected to be at the end of next week. We will then have until 20 February to commence Parts 1 to 3 and make the essential Statutory Instruments. We will use as much of that time as is needed to get the safeguard orders right. Of course that is a tight timetable. We always recognised in this House when the sunset clause was passed, given the nature of the anxieties that obtained then, which have been magnified so manyfold over the year with regard to the financial system, that this Bill would be extensive in its reach and would require extensive parliamentary scrutiny in a fairly compressed period. I place on record the Government&#146;s appreciation for the co-operation of the opposition parties on this point. I hope that I can see that co-operation on this final point and that the noble Baroness will think that this is an adequate and proper defence of the broad structure of the Bill with regard to the provision for secondary legislation and that she will feel able to withdraw her last amendment.</p>

I also thank him for saying that we have been co-operative, which I believe we have tried to be. Indeed, it is in that spirit that I approach these unusual provisions in Clause 256. The Minister said that this was the standard procedure for first orders. Actually, I think that it is the reverse of that procedure, because the procedure for first orders is often more extensive than the procedure for later orders. Almost all orders under social security legislation, for example, are for pensions and benefits. The first orders are the ones that have a special procedure. The later ones often have the negative procedure or a much lower level of procedure, so this procedure is unusual in that orders can be brought in quickly without prior parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

I hope that the Minister will reflect with his colleagues that the exercise of that power should be used very judiciously. In the spirit with which we have allowed the Bill to make progress through your Lordships&#146; House, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I will send noble Lords&#146; good wishes.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000004"></a>Amendments 131 and 132 relate to Clause 19. Amendment 132 would delete subsection (7), which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020357000121"></a>&#147;The powers conferred by this section are subject to the requirements of this Chapter&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000117"></a>I understand that the noble Lord tabled the amendment because he did not understand what that subsection meant. I think&#151;<I>Hansard </I>cannot reflect my italicisation of that word&#151;I know what it means, but it would be good to have the Minister&#146;s explanation.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000005"></a>Amendment 131 would insert &#147;or may not&#148; after &#147;may&#148;. I assume that, if one may do something, one may also not do it, but I hope that the Minister will confirm that that is implicit.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, tabled the Question whether Clause 19 shall stand part, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, have attached their names, because he was particularly concerned about subsection (6). A theme which ran right through our debates on petitions is the number of people who will be employed, in this case at national or government office level, to monitor how petition schemes go. In this clause, the Secretary of State or the Welsh Ministers may direct a principal authority to make revisions to a scheme.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000007"></a>I do not think that I need repeat the concerns on this side of the Committee about the heavy-handedness of some of the provisions. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000008"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09020357000147"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I support the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. A theme running throughout this part of the legislation is that there is too much prescription. To a certain extent, that would put people off petitions rather than help. As I said the other day, I hope that the Minister will take this away and think again. The provisions are far too prescriptive&#151;very much teaching grandmother to suck eggs. Please look at this again, for everyone&#146;s benefit. I support the opposition to the Question whether Clause 19 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000009"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09020357000148"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> I send my good wishes to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. I hope that he will dig himself out. I noticed that the road across the Pennines was free today and I must confess that I rejoiced that he would have an easy passage, not realising that he would not be able to get that far. It is very nice to have the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, back with us today.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000010"></a>I shall start where the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, finished. I listened very closely and suspect that, in the course of the next few amendments, we will have an element of the debate about what is prescription and what is enabling and necessary. I shall think seriously about what noble Lords are saying about the degree of detail that we need in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000011"></a>I shall just address why Clause 19 is as it is and why it is important. Clause 19(1) provides a power for the appropriate national authority to make orders about what should be in petition schemes and what should not be. This power will be used only for situations in which, despite guidance and directions to individual local authorities, the local authority has signally failed to create a scheme which is accessible in the way we want it to be and effective. Clause 19(3) sets out particular issues that these orders can cover.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000012"></a>I have said before in Committee that the Government intend to exercise the order-making power in Clause 19 to set a maximum threshold for triggering the debate. In order not to be exclusive and not to be impossible to reach, it should not be more than 5 per cent of local residents.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000013"></a>Clause 19(2) provides for guidance to be made to help local authorities to meet the requirements under this chapter, and Clause 19(4) permits the guidance to include a model petition scheme. These clauses describe in general how guidance is designed to support agencies outside this House as a whole, not to be slavishly adhered to but to act as a guide to what, after consultation with local authorities, we believe will work best. If they have a better scheme and a better reason, local authorities can depart from the guidance.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000014"></a>The amendment reflects the noble Lord&#146;s concern, which has run through the Committee, that this provision will be a method to prescribe by the backdoor all the details of how principal local authorities should handle petitions that they receive, but I assure noble Lords that it is not the case. Principal authorities will be free to adapt the model scheme to reflect local circumstances, or not adapt it at all. We will work closely with them,  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC135"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>drawing on best practice and communicating with them as much as we can to ensure that we come up with the best possible outcome in communicating with petitioners, and so on. It is a starting point for authorities without formal arrangements in place and will, therefore, act as a practical aid to implementing the duties. It is certainly not intended to tie their hands.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000015"></a>Clause 19(5) underlines that point. It is a &#147;may&#148; construction; the clause says that local authorities,</p>
<ul><a name="09020357000136"></a>&#147;may ... adopt ... the ... model petition&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09020357000118"></a>I hope that that will reassure the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000016"></a>On subsection (6), we are clear that we want local authorities to adopt effective petition schemes that give local people more influence in their areas. Should a principal local authority adopt a scheme that creates rather than lowers barriers to local involvement&#151;although I do not expect that to happen&#151;Clause 19(6) is necessary because it provides a power to direct an individual principal authority to amend its petition scheme. The obvious case would be if an authority set a threshold for stimulating a council meeting that was so high that it would be impossible to reach. In that instance, the appropriate authority could make a targeted intervention, requiring the principal authority to set a lower threshold without the need to exercise the order-making power. We see that power of intervention very much as a backstop, to be used in extremis if at all. However, we are committed to ensuring that standards everywhere can be raised to those of the best.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000017"></a>Amendment 132 seeks to remove subsection (7). The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, in his own inimitable words, said, &#147;It is there but I do not understand what it means. Why is it there?&#148;. It is there because it clarifies that no changes to the requirements set out in this chapter may be made through the powers in Clause 19 to issue orders, guidance and directions. Essentially, subsection (7) makes it clear that this is not a Henry VIII provision which would entitle the appropriate national authority to change the primary legislation. It is a necessary safeguard.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000018"></a>With that brief explanation, I hope that noble Lords will be content for Clause 19 to stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000019"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09020357000149"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I cannot resist commenting that if there were less detail in the Bill it would not be necessary to spell out quite so much in this clause. If &#147;guidance&#148;, which should have only its natural meaning, includes a model petition scheme, it ought not to be necessary to say that a local authority may or may not adopt the model because it is only there as part of the guidance. One would not then need to go into powers of intervention.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000020"></a>I understand better the Minister&#146;s point that the Government want to be sure that authorities, in setting up their schemes, which we continue to believe should be of their own design, do not set the threshold at some absurd number&#151;more than 1,000 people or whatever&#151;that would turn it into a petition to which they would need to respond in some way. I continue to feel that the politics of the situation will prompt local authorities, but that is part of the larger debate.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000021"></a>I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It seeks to remove the application of Clause 20 to parish councils in England and community councils in Wales, which, to all intents and purposes, are the same kind of body, identical in their functions but operating in different ways. My noble friend, rightly, is unhappy that, as the clause is constructed, the Secretary of State can apply a scheme appropriate to the other principal bodies and local authorities listed in the subsection to parish councils, which really do not need national rules. It is a simple amendment, although the Minister may say differently. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000023"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09020357000152"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b> If this amendment is agreed to, I cannot call Amendment 133A, which has already been debated.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000024"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09020357000153"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> The amendment raises an important issue and, again, I want to be as reassuring as possible. Clause 20 lists the categories of authority, besides principal councils, to which some form of petitions duty may be extended. I shall concentrate on parish councils, as the amendment applies to them. The list includes parish councils in England or community councils in Wales, economic prosperity boards established under Clause 84 or a combined authority established under Clause 98, and a range of other types of authority. Clause 21 provides that any extension would be by statutory instrument using the negative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, wants to remove parish councils in England and community councils in Wales from the list of bodies to which any sort of duty may be extended. As the noble Baroness said, he thinks that national rules are inappropriate, and I suspect that he also thinks that this is a very onerous duty. He and I certainly agree that parish councils are very much at the heart of small communities, and we recognised their role in 2007, when we discussed the Act that permitted the extension of the power of well-being to them.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000026"></a>These are cherished bodies and they deal with the sorts of services that we care about very strongly; for example, allotments, public conveniences and cemeteries. These are the things that make a difference to quality of life, and indeed to death. Therefore, we believe that it is appropriate that these councils should be accountable to local people and that local people should be able to raise any concerns with them and seek improvements. They are nearer the community but they have the same sort of problems that other local authorities face. People are still reluctant to come forward. Very few  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC137"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are aware of the work that these councils do and very few participate in that work. Part of the joint venture across the parties in this Committee is to increase people&#146;s involvement with parish councils and to make local people feel that they have more influence. We think that that comes about through knowing how to address a petition and get a result.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000027"></a>However, I am also fully aware that parish and community councils have very different arrangements and resources from principal local authorities. Therefore, subsection (4) provides that any duty in the Bill which is applied to a body listed in Clause 20 can be modified precisely to take into account the differing natures of those bodies. We know, for example, that many parishes have only a part-time clerk. Any requirements on parish councils will therefore have to take into account their ability to respond, and we are committed to meeting the cost of any new burdens placed on them.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000028"></a>My most important message is that we would not make such an order without first consulting the parish council sector and its representatives. We have already opened discussions to see how parish councils feel. Officials have had discussions with the National Association of Local Councils, which represents parish councils in England and the interests of community and town councils in Wales. I can tell the Committee that it welcomed in principle the prospect of some form of petitions duty being applied to parish councils. However, as I said, it is important that if, with its partnership, we move ahead with such a prospect, we do so only following the fullest possible consultation and agreement about what is being asked and how it might be delivered.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000029"></a>I hope that those assurances address the noble Lord&#146;s concerns and that the Committee will be satisfied.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000030"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09020357000154"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I hesitate to commit my noble friend but I am sure that he would stress not just the difference between principal local authorities and parishes and community councils but also the differences within the sector&#151;the term used by the noble Baroness. Parish councils in one place are very different from those in another. She mentioned resources. I would be aware not just of financial resources but of the time available. I refer not only to the time spent processing petitions but also to the time that a parish council might wish to devote to a petition. Living in London, I do not have direct experience of how parishes work.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000031"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09020357000155"></a>Lord Tope:</b> That is a disgrace.</p>

However, one has to remember that the proprieties and the way in which parish councillors work in and respond to their communities are very different. Their flexibility must not be reduced. The Minister referred to accountability. One does not challenge the issue of accountability, but I must remind her about the role that elections play in it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000033"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09020357000158"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I tabled Amendment 134 as a response to recommendations in the report produced on the Bill by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Clause 20 allows the petitions scheme to be extended to bodies other than principal local authorities. The first two bodies on the list are parish councils in England and community councils in Wales. As the Delegated Powers Committee pointed out, they are much smaller than the other bodies listed in that clause and therefore have much more limited resources. Their budget may be only a few thousand pounds, and any new duty or provision must be examined very carefully if it is to be made obligatory for such councils. The need to balance the desirability of extending petition schemes with the other competing responsibilities that parish and community councils face should be carefully considered.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000034"></a>This amendment requires any such order to be subject to the affirmative procedure. I would not be surprised if, in the light of our detailed and exhaustive debates earlier in Committee, the Government did not want to see the issue of petitions raised in Parliament for some time to come. However, we would be ignoring our responsibilities in this House if we were to wave this issue away and say that the appropriate national authority would take such matters into account. If we have learnt anything from these debates&#151;I feel I have learnt a great deal&#151;it is that this issue is not as simple as it might at first appear. If we were to allow the appropriate national authority simply to impose the duties and responsibilities on potentially very small and underresourced authorities, we would be passing on all the difficulties and problems that would arise, as we have discussed. Noble Lords have highlighted bodies that may not be able to unpick the problems themselves. I am quite sure that the appropriate national authority may take all such matters into account, but I believe that Parliament should be wary of allowing orders that would have a disproportionate effect on those subject to them to be made without careful and close consideration. I hope that other noble Lords and the Minister will agree.</p>

She is right to raise the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and to invite me to respond to them. Much of what I shall say will reflect what I said in relation to parish councils and the burdens that we recognise petitions might put on them.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000036"></a>This amendment gives effect to the recommendation made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. It argued that the negative resolution procedure is appropriate for the order-making powers relating to the other bodies listed in Clause 20. In our  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC139"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>response, we stated that we understand its concerns and its search for consistency, but there are good reasons to think that the negative resolution procedure would be appropriate. The Government will meet the cost of any new burdens put on parish or community councils, and we would not make such an order without first consulting the representative bodies of those institutions to seek their views about how the duty should be framed so that the diversity of behaviour in the situation, which was pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, could be met in those cases.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000037"></a>As I said, my officials met the National Association of Local Councils and discussed the prospect of having some form of petition duty, and it has given a positive response so far. If the Secretary of State is minded to draft an order on this issue, the details of any consultation and the responses received would be set out in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying all statutory instruments. That would give people the confidence of knowing that there had been proper consultation.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000038"></a>Obviously, if the Merits Committee also considered the consultation to be inadequate, or if the memorandum revealed that the responses indicated that the sector did not welcome the imposition of such a duty, and the Government were intent on imposing one, that would be drawn to the attention of the House. However, I expect that any consultation would reveal strong support for the extension of some form of duty by the sector so that it could respond to petitions to parishes or community councils. On the basis that we would proceed with consensus, we think that the affirmative revolution, which is a very serious and heavy power that takes up parliamentary time in this House, would be inappropriate and too heavy. That is why we have replied to the DPRRC&#146;s report in the way that we have. In the scenario that I have outlined, the negative procedure would be sufficient.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000039"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09020357000160"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Before the noble Baroness replies, I would like to comment on one aspect of this. I would also like to say how glad I am to see her again and how glad I was on Friday night to hear her sounding as though she was well enough to enjoy herself very considerably. I do not know whether that was the case, but it was certainly how it sounded on the radio.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000040"></a>The clause extends to economic prosperity boards. When we come to the part of the Bill that allows for their creation and that of combined authorities, which, as far as we can understand, are economic prosperity boards plus integrated transport authorities, we will discuss their role and whether this is a slide towards taking functions away from local authorities as we know them now, and putting them into the new boards. I see that as part of a central government agenda to create larger authorities. That would certainly be a threat&#151;I know that that is a heavy word, but I use it nevertheless&#151;to the districts. To have what the Minister described as a heavy and significant procedure would be entirely right because it would be part of considering how these boards will function. The Minister will realise that we have the possibility of praying against an order and I suspect that we will keep an eye on that, notwithstanding her assurances about the consultation that would precede any order.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000042"></a>I thank the Minister for her detailed response, but I would raise two issues. The Minister accepts that the organisations on the list&#151;parish councils and the organisations outlined below&#151;are very different both in the way that they are set up and funded and, more importantly, in the resourcing of their back offices, which would respond to items such as petitions. Therefore, I ask the Minister to take that on board and consider it carefully in terms of those organisations&#146; resources. She stated that the Government would be able to meet any such bills. I am sure that she is aware of the diversity of funding for parish councils, in the process, amount and commitment, both financial and other, from various local authorities. How would the cost of those extra duties be met by the Government? Would there be any direct funding to parish councils? Would it be given to local authorities? Would there then be a duty on local authorities to ensure that it was passed on? There are still questions which need to be looked at. I would be obliged if the Minister could take them back. We may have to return to them on Report, but it may be possible to clarify some of them before then. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I just wonder whether we should let the rumours grow or make it clear that we were talking about a radio programme called &#147;Any Questions?&#148;. I have probably saved her reputation&#151;or maybe I have damaged it.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000044"></a>In moving the amendment, I shall also speak to Amendments 138A to 142. We have reached the chapter on the involvement in functions of public authorities, and Clause 23 in particular. Amendments 138 and 138A probe what the Government&#146;s intentions are. If adopted, they would make this part of the Bill much clearer by having it state that an authority to which it applies shall seek involvement in the way described. I shall listen with interest to what the Minister says about the circumstances under which the duty might be exercised.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000045"></a>Amendment 139 would fall were Amendment 138A to be adopted; otherwise, the amendment would simply replace &#147;representatives&#148; with &#147;persons&#148;, which is a much more involving word with a wider meaning than the rather restricted term &#147;representatives&#148;. The latter would require clarification as to whom the representatives represent and how they would do so.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000046"></a>The next batch of amendments is to subsection (2). They probe the Government&#146;s thinking not so much as to why organisations are included in the provision but why some are not. Amendment 140 refers to the Marine Management Organisation. Amendment 140A redresses what is, in my view as a member of a local authority, the more startling omission; it would include various health bodies: a primary care trust, a strategic health authority, a health service trust and an NHS foundation trust. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s explanation for the omission. It is so obvious that it could not be accidental; there is some deliberate thinking as to why it is not there. I wait with interest to hear what it is.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000047"></a>Amendment 140B recognises what we have debated in the past on this Bill: the enormous importance of partnership and partnership working in local government. It seeks to include all the other partner organisations that may not need to be specifically listed.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000048"></a>Bearing in mind our recent discussion about their importance, Amendment 141 seeks to include in subsection (7) specific reference to parish councils. This is done at the request of the National Association of Local Councils. It has said that it would welcome an express reference, which would be a formal recognition of the positive and creative role that parish councils can play and would enrich their contribution. I support that view and have happily tabled this amendment. I am sure that the Minister will wish to respond accordingly.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000049"></a>Finally, Amendment 142 would add the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09020357000137"></a>&#147;and representatives of local government&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09020357000119"></a>to the list of those whom the Secretary of State must consult. I am sure that the Minister will say&#151;I hope she will&#151;that subsection (3) actually means that of course the Secretary of State will consult representatives of local government, but we would like to have that on the record. I beg to move.</p>

The clauses address a different point, placing a duty on authorities to take steps to involve representatives of interested persons in their relevant functions. However, I feel that I am returning to the old arguments; as with the duty in Clause 1, I agree that these are desirable aims but a duty is not required. I do not need to detain the Committee on this point; I merely flag up these clauses as ones which the Government must reconsider when they look again at Part 1, as I am sure they intend to do.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000054"></a>Those of us who went through the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 are still living with the duty to involve. This group of amendments invites me to explain why we are extending the duty to partner authorities, and I hope that I can satisfy the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, on that point. They argue that the clauses should not stand part of the Bill at all and that the duty should be extended to other partners or even to different functions. The debate gives me an opportunity to explain, while picking up some of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, why the lists are as they are.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000055"></a>Let me explain the logic of what we were trying to achieve. The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 places a duty to involve on best-value authorities, which comes into force from April this year.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000056"></a>I am delighted to say that the response to the duty has been very positive. Local authorities welcome this duty to involve. Many already take that responsibility seriously as part of their normal duties, and they are keen to increase involvement. I hope the Committee will not mind if I quote one example of that and of how the argument has gone forward. There has been a successful engagement in Ipswich with the &#147;You Said, We Did&#148; initiative. It picked up beautifully on a scheme run by a well known commercial organisation that proved that, if they asked, customers got what they asked for. Ipswich has been proactive in encouraging citizens to come forward with their concerns, acting on them and giving feedback on the action taken. The initiative has been tremendously popular, with hundreds  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of people attending meetings to take part. It has strengthened engagement and led to many improvements in the community. That feedback, which communicates the results of what people have asked for, is a key factor in its success.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000057"></a>In considering how to take matters forward and make the duty to involve a reality, we took the new performance framework that we are introducing as our starting point. It is to the credit of local authorities that local area agreements have developed and have been so well managed and successful so far. I pay particular tribute to Essex, with which I have a communicating, not mentoring, arrangement, as I do with a few other authorities, so that I can see what they are doing. We feel it important that this duty applies to partner organisations, which are under a duty to co-operate with councils to agree local performance targets. This proposal was discussed and agreed with the relevant partner organisations. I hope to pick up that point and reassure the noble Lord, Lord Tope, about that consultation. We subsequently announced in the <I>Communities in Control</I> White Paper our intention to extend the duty to partner organisations.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000058"></a>The list of partner authorities is set out in Clause 23. It is the list that we used in the 2007 Act, with two exceptions. We have added the new Homes and Communities Agency to ensure that principles of involvement apply to it. It is important that we do that because the HCA has a duty to agree local performance targets with the local authority, which is an important step forward. We have also added economic prosperity boards in combined authorities. We will discuss the status and purposes of EPBs later, but I must advise noble Lords that adding them is an oversight, and I shall be moving an amendment to remove them. I am sad to confess to a failure of drafting. We have to take out EPBs, which are established by Part 6, because they are to be best-value authorities and are covered by the duty under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. There is no reason to duplicate that, and I will take them out of the Bill. I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, is content with that explanation.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000059"></a>The duty to involve is a simple, logical extension of what we put in place in 2007. It is an opportunity for the local community to have its say, to be informed about and to become involved in a wider range of partner services and authorities, which are there to deliver the objective of the LAA, whether it is improved social care for elderly people or dealing with social issues such as teenage pregnancy. I therefore cannot agree that the clause should not stand part.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000060"></a>On the construction of the list itself&#151;and, ironically, as we have to take EPBs out&#151;we looked closely across the different departments to make sure that we were not duplicating what was provided anywhere else. We have not included best-value authorities on the list, for that very reason; nor have we included authorities that have a comparable duty when undertaking their specific functions. The list is in line with the overall agenda for community empowerment and the local performance framework, and it has been agreed with the partner authorities.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="09020357000141"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000061"></a>As we keeping saying, there must be a balance, and we are keen not to be too prescriptive. This is evidenced by our making it absolutely clear that each of the different authorities needs to determine for itself the appropriate level of involvement in its functions. That will differ depending on the body in question and the functions it performs.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000062"></a>I hope that that will address some of the issues raised by Amendment 138, which asks essentially to involve all interested persons in authorities&#146; functions. Although I know that the amendment is a hook for a wider explanation, I do not believe that it is appropriate, for the following reasons. If we adopted such a construction, it would be overly burdensome in terms of the resources required, in particular the cost of the involvement and the potential return. It would breach certain legal or Community obligations, such as privacy issues around staffing and litigation procedures. A further reason is that involvement of local representatives is being addressed via another statutory requirement.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000063"></a>We want to keep closely to the duty to involve set out in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. In effect, we are using this Bill to extend the duty but to be non-prescriptive.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000064"></a>Several amendments have, however, sought to extend the scope of the clause. Amendment 138ZA, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Best, would mean explicitly referring to voluntary and community organisations in the reference to,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09020357000127"></a>&#147;interested persons of a particular description&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000065"></a>I fully agree that those organisations are such vital partners in the community, designing services, delivering them, working with local authorities under commission and so on, that they should be fully involved. However, the amendment is unnecessary as a consequence of the rules of statutory interpretation. &#147;Persons&#148; in this context, applying the Interpretation Act 1978, includes bodies corporate and unincorporate as well as individuals.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000066"></a>I think, however, that the noble Lord would almost certainly have used his amendment to ask me about the compact arrangement between the third sector and government, and whether it could be improved by giving it a statutory framework. I wish to put on the record that the Government are committed to making the compact between the sector and government work, and to improving the way that public bodies and third sector organisations work together. As such, the role of the Commission for the Compact is highly valued.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000067"></a>Sir Bert Massie, who, as we all know, is an extremely powerful advocate for the voluntary sector and the many different interests within it, has recommended that the Commission for the Compact be established as a statutory body, which would enable it to follow good practice for non-departmental public bodies and would help strengthen its role in improving relations between public bodies and third sector organisations. We are very sympathetic to the proposal.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000068"></a>However, there are significant practical obstacles. The Office of the Third Sector has started to develop this proposal across Whitehall. Many departments, not least my own, have close relations with the third sector and want to see it improved and strengthened.

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000069"></a>Having looked at the implications of creating a statutory framework for the relationship represented by the compact, it has been very clear that it is not merely a question of an enabling clause; it needs a robust and appropriate structure. Frankly, more work is needed to flesh out the implications of moving the commission from being a private company to a statutory body. Noble Lords will know that, when we have created statutory bodies in this House, we have had to go into great detail to make sure that they are fit for purpose and do their intended job. We are intent on making sure that we do that work, particularly ensuring that the commission has the right powers to support its work. Having spoken to some bodies in the third sector recently, I know that they understand that whatever framework is created needs to be sufficient and predictable. Until that work has been done, the third sector and the Government share the view that we are not yet in a position to introduce new legislation or amendments to set up the commission as a statutory body. I welcome the opportunity that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has created and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Best, and the third sector will be grateful to have that assurance on the record. We will move with all speed to work out what is necessary and we will do that in partnership.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000070"></a>Amendment 139 proposes replacing the word &#147;representatives&#148; with &#147;persons&#148; when referring to who should be involved; it follows on from Amendment 138. It is worth retaining the use of the term &#147;representative&#148; because it is not meant to be unduly restrictive and refer only to formally elected or nominated members of the public. An authority will consider the diverse groups who may be affected by, or interested in, a particular function and engage with those people who are felt to be representative. These groups will be informed, consulted and involved and will vary depending on the type of authority and the level at which they operate, or the policy or service in question. Referring to &#147;persons&#148; could imply communicating with every individual, which, as I said earlier, could create a significant burden.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000071"></a>Amendment 141, also proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, calls for the addition of text so that &#147;interested persons&#148; includes parish councils. That amendment is unnecessary because &#147;person&#148; can include a parish council. The Interpretation Act 1978 states that a person includes a body of persons corporate or unincorporated. That includes third sector groups, businesses and organisations as well as individuals. One of the ironies of legislation is that if we were to refer specifically to a parish council, we may cast doubt on the efficacy of relying on the meaning given to the word &#147;person&#148; in the Interpretation Act 1978. I should also point out that statutory guidance in the duty to involve under Section 138 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 refers specifically to parish councils in its list of who may be covered by the term &#147;local persons&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000072"></a>We now come to the things that might be added to our list of partner authorities. Amendment 140 proposes adding the Marine Management Organisation being established by the current Marine and Coastal Access Bill&#151;an attraction in another part of the theatre. We are liaising with Defra, the DfT and the DECC&#151;the three sponsoring departments for the MMO&#151;about whether adding this proposed body to the list is a desirable option. We will come back to that and report to noble Lords at a later stage.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000073"></a>Amendment 140A would add NHS bodies to the list. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, invited me to give a clear explanation of why they were not included. NHS bodies are already under a comparable duty to involve in Section 242 of the National Health Service Act 2006. I am delighted to say that the NHS already sees the involvement and engagement of the citizens whom it serves as important and valid ways to improve services and functions and has a number of good examples that demonstrate that. The participatory budgeting scheme in Southampton is an excellent example of involvement.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000074"></a>I am afraid that I must also reject Amendment 142, which would add to the list &#147;representatives of local government&#148;. We do not need to include this group as statutory consultees for guidance to the public authorities listed at subsection (2). Should any guidance be proposed in the future, I can assure the noble Lord that we would have a consultation process, and I hope that local government would come forward and comment as freely as it usually does.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000075"></a>I have spoken at some length because a number of different issues have been raised by the different amendments. The duty to involve has got off to a very positive and constructive start in local government, not only in improving how services are delivered but in increasing influence and ownership. I think that what we intend to do in the Bill is logical, sensible and proportionate. It will make an even greater difference to the way in which people influence what happens and indeed to the quality of the partnership between local authorities and their partner authorities as they deliver the local area agreements.</p>

In the past Session alone, the Planning Bill, the Local Transport Bill and the Crossrail Bill all contained such provisions. They have a long history, and hundreds, if not thousands, of these provisions are on the statute book. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, took the matter up on the Local Transport Bill, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, tabled an amendment to the Planning Bill. In each case, they wanted to extend the duty to include talking newspapers so that blind people and others who are print-handicapped can engage as other citizens do.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000079"></a>Extending duties to improve the access of these groups to information about legislation is important enough but there is a wider point still here. Primary legislation that requires notices to be published in newspapers does not just result in inaccessibility; it is also rigid, expensive and out of date, and it does not work. Very rarely do we specify this level of detail in primary legislation. In this case, we do it only out of

Technology has moved on and so should we, but we cannot do that if we keep legislating in this way.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000080"></a>The Government have looked at this matter and have come up with some startling information. Tens of thousands of these notices are published each year. If more modern means of communication were used, the savings could be as much as &#163;30 million. More than half of notices are about local planning matters&#151;one area in which people are most active in local democracy. In the modern world, many people expect to be able to go to a website and find the details of planning applications that might affect them&#151;not just council websites but independent websites too. Yet we continue to pass laws that do not encourage that kind of progress. Camden council did a survey to discover how its citizens found out about planning applications. Press notices reached only 1.4 per cent of respondents; they simply do not justify the money spent on them.</p>
<h5><a name="09020357000142"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000081"></a>There are three things we need to do. We need to stop passing these types of provisions and come up with a more modern system. Over time, we need to go back and update existing law to take advantage of the new system, perhaps starting with the quick win of planning notices. This amendment gives the Government the chance to do that by requiring the Secretary of State to make new regulations for the publication of statutory notices. The regulations should take into account how to promote public involvement in decisions most effectively in a way that minimises the burden on public authorities, is accessible to disabled people and can be used by third parties.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000082"></a>Electronic publication in some standard format should be a basic requirement. Beyond that, the regulations could lay down a simple framework that would leave councils with maximum flexibility plus some more extensive notification requirements to ensure that genuine efforts at consultation take place. The details can be worked out in time, but we need to start the ball rolling. Local authorities want the present system changed. Blind and partially sighted people need it changed. The arrival of the internet age suggests that it is now time to act.</p>

The Government have been looking at the current processes for publication of statutory notices for some time, and I am very sympathetic to the intentions behind the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000084"></a>In 2007, the Cabinet Office produced a report entitled <I>Informing the public in a multi media age</I>, which contains recommendations broadly in line with the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. This report recognised that a mandatory requirement for statutory notices to be published in the local press is not necessarily the best way to ensure community involvement in all cases. The Cabinet Office is currently looking at how to move forward with statutory notices in a joined-up way across government. It will be writing to all government departments soon to ask them to review the mandatory requirement in light of policy areas and related legislation. My own  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC149"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>department has commissioned an independent report which, among other things, looks into statutory notices in a planning context.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000085"></a>As the noble Lord has already rightly stated, planning notices make up between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of all statutory notices. We are committed to ensuring that local people are not kept in the dark in relation to planning statutory notices. The Killian Pretty review, <I>Planning applications: A faster and more responsive system</I>, made a number of recommendations. Recommendation 11 in the report was clear that, to help improve the effectiveness of community engagement, local authorities should be given greater autonomy and flexibility to determine the best approaches to use in order to notify the public about planning applications, including allowing them to decide whether to use local newspapers or not. This report also recognises that local authorities&#146; planning authority web pages should be easily readable and understandable, with clearly presented information&#151;for example, being able to resize text or view the page as &#147;text only&#148; for those with visual impairments. The department is considering that very positively.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000086"></a>However, although a large proportion of statutory notices may relate to planning and highways, there are many other kinds of these notices and they will need to be dealt with in different ways to ensure the highest level of community involvement. For instance, a planning statutory notice which was relevant to a small group of residents would need to be treated differently from one relating to a major development or a licensing statutory notice affecting an entire unitary council area.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000087"></a>I am therefore concerned that to try and legislate for all of these may not work in the way intended by the amendment. There would need to be analysis of how it would work in each case, and we might need to amend each piece of legislation separately. Therefore, more preparatory work will need to be completed before we can confidently legislate in this area. There may be other ways of doing so which do not require primary legislation, such as by order under the Electronic Communications Act 2000.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000088"></a>The amendment restricts the framework to notices produced by local authorities or authorities included on the &#147;duty to involve&#148; list; it does not make mention of notices produced by the Secretary of State. The Government would like to investigate further whether notices laid by the Secretary of State should also be included in any change to the rules around statutory notices.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000089"></a>I mentioned that we are looking in depth at these issues and will soon publish our own report outlining how we plan to move forward in this area in relation to planning. I would very much appreciate all noble Lords&#146; views when the response is published, particularly those of the noble Lord, Lord Low. I shall ensure that a copy of the response when published is sent to the noble Lord in a format suitable to his requirements.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000090"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendment raised another interesting point that needs further thought by the Government. It aims to ensure that statutory notices can easily be reused by third parties. We would like to look at that in more detail to see how best it can be encouraged and what its benefits would be.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000091"></a>I reiterate that, while I sympathise greatly with the noble Lord&#146;s amendments, I do not believe that they are the best way to address the issue, given the current review work across government and the need to ensure that it is considered in the broadest context.<b></b>I hope that my response has gone some way to reassuring the noble Lord that the Government will seriously and carefully consider the process for publishing statutory notices, and look especially at increasing community involvement in decision-making.

They are probing amendments and provide us with little more than an opportunity to hear the Government explain in better detail what they are planning. Amendment 144 would prevent the Secretary of State setting up a wholly new body under the clause. How big a body are the Government considering? How many employees will it have? Who will sit on it? Where will they be appointed from? How will they be selected? I simply seek clarity about the Government&#146;s intentions.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000094"></a>Amendments 144 and 145 would create a panel within an existing body which could do the same job as a new body. I am sure that the Minister will explain clearly why that would not be a practical option and why a wholly new body is required, especially in light of subsection (5), which makes it clear that a body need not be limited to the functions in the clause. That suggests that those drafting the Bill saw no problem in allowing a body to have a combination of different functions. Is there no existing body that could be adopted to meet the same objectives as those provided in Clause 25? I am keen to hear the Government&#146;s reasoning.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000095"></a>Amendment 146 is designed to probe what financial assistance the Government think will be necessary, where it will come from and how much it will be. Once the Secretary of State has provided the money, who will spend it? What will it be spent on? Who will account for it, and to whom? I will be grateful if the Minister will explain the meaning of the words &#147;financial assistance&#148; so that we can read the explanation and consider these provisions more carefully with more details to hand.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000096"></a>Amendment 147 probes the powers and judgments of the Secretary of State. Clause 25(1)(c) allows the Secretary of State to give assistance to any body that she thinks could carry out the functions in Clause 25. If another body is capable of carrying out these functions, why do we need a new body? Why can the Secretary of State not use her judgment now to identify a body that has the functions specified in this clause? In any case, what criteria will the Secretary of State apply when identifying such a body?</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000097"></a>Amendments 148, 149 and 150 seek clarification of what is meant by &#147;other residential property&#148; that is not social housing. That appears to open the remit of this body to an extraordinary degree. Is that appropriate? Should potentially every residential property in England containing a tenant be subject to this new body? Perhaps they should, but when I read this clause, I thought that this provision was particularly vague and wide-reaching, and I am asking for an explanation.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000098"></a>I have asked a series of short questions about Clause 25, and I am sure the Minister will answer them fully. I am interested to hear his response to these probing amendments and will consider his remarks further once I have read them. However, at the moment, I do not like the lack of clarity in the drafting of this clause, and I am unwilling to let it stand part of the Bill without any comment to that effect.</p>

It probes some of the points that the noble Baroness has just mentioned. I am perhaps coming from a different point of view in that I am anticipating a wider, rather than narrower, group of people who might have the support, assistance and voice&#151;the term we used during the Housing and Regeneration Act&#151;of this new body. It should be made clear that those people are not a homogenous group and will have different views and interests. Even within social housing, we might be talking about ALMOs, local authorities, housing associations and the private rented sector, which we will come on to in more detail in the next group.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000100"></a>&#147;Social housing&#148; has the meaning given to it by Section 68 of the Housing and Regeneration Act, and that definition includes low-cost home ownership, which I found a little confusing because that is ownership, not tenancy, unless one extends the interpretation to the sort of low-cost home ownership that involves a tenancy as to part. I would be grateful if the Minister will explain how that works. It all boils down to the fact that there are a lot of different interests and a lot of jobs that this new body will have to do.</p>

Tenants speaking for themselves has a long and honourable history. There are many tenant representative organisations at local and regional level, but I would like to mention specifically the three national organisations: TAROE&#151;the Tenants and Residents Organisations of England&#151;the National Federation of Tenant Management Organisations, and the Confederation of Co-Operative Housing. All three do commendable work representing their members, and some might have thought it reasonable to have asked one of those bodies to become the National Tenant Voice. The noble Baroness rightly raised that issue.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000102"></a>It is worth making it clear that the National Tenant Voice will not seek to represent tenants individually but, rather, give them&#151;more than 8 million of them&#151;a collective voice. There is therefore no question of the National Tenant Voice replacing these organisations.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000103"></a>Secondly, the National Federation of Tenant Management Organisations and the Confederation of Co-Operative Housing do not seek to represent all social housing tenants and while TAROE does, it is still in development and it would have been unwise and unfair to expect it to take on this role as well.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000104"></a>Thirdly, all three organisations agree the need for a separate National Tenant Voice. They have been active in helping us form it and will be represented on it. They recognise that it will complement, not replace, the work they do.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000105"></a>The amendments would do three things. First, the National Tenant Voice would not be a newly created body; secondly, funding would be restricted to activities relating to social housing tenants and not tenants in the private sector; and, thirdly, any government assistance would be confined to non-financial assistance.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000106"></a>I should like to address each issue to explain why the Government are resisting the amendments. I hope that that clarification will reassure the noble Baroness. First, why should we have a new stand-alone body? I have already explained why an existing tenants&#146; group would not have been appropriate. Martin Cave suggested that the National Tenant Voice be located within the new National Consumer Council, and we originally concurred with that. However, the project group we convened to advise us on the National Tenant Voice, which includes representatives of the three national tenant organisations, was of the unanimous view that the National Tenant Voice should be established as a new, stand-alone, independent body.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000107"></a>The group was of the view that locating the National Tenant Voice within another body carried two risks: first, that the interests of tenants might become lost in an organisation with other purposes and intentions; secondly&#151;and perhaps far more importantly&#151;the group felt that to have any credibility with tenants, the National  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC153"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Tenant Voice would have to be clearly tenant-led, tenant-dominated and tenant-orientated. The group felt that only a stand-alone body could achieve this.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000108"></a>The project group consulted tenants across the country before putting its advice to us, and tenants supported these proposals. We were happy to take the advice of the group, which continues to support us as we make preparations for establishing the National Tenant Voice. The group is providing advice on the best way to ensure that tenants across the country have a chance to be involved in the National Tenant Voice either as part of an overseeing national council or with a seat on its board. We are looking at a board of around 15 members, at least nine of whom are currently tenants, probably with a full-time staff equivalent of half a dozen. Approximately &#163;1.5 million per annum is in the spending review period. As with any NDPB, it will have financial accountability to the Secretary of State and accountability to Parliament. The recruitment process will be through the Cabinet Office, as per the code of practice.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000109"></a>I now turn to why we do not wish to limit the National Tenant Voice to providing a voice only for tenants of social housing and the issue of limiting financial assistance. The creation of a national tenant voice is part of our wider reform of social housing regulation, as informed by Martin Cave&#146;s review. It is quite right&#151;and it is our wish&#151;that its initial and core focus be on tenants in social housing. The National Tenant Voice will play a role as yet unmet, given that it will be run and dominated by tenants, not people acting on their behalf. It will therefore be able to act as an advocate and provide a voice for millions of tenants, not least enabling a direct dialogue between tenants and Government and tenants and the new social housing regulator. It will commission research into issues that affect tenants because, as tenant-led, it will know best what these issues might be. It will also be active in promoting better representation of tenants at regional and local level and helping other tenants engage more effectively with each other and their landlords.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000110"></a>We do not wish the benefits of the National Tenant Voice to be confined to social housing tenants although, I repeat, such tenants must be its core focus. However, the National Tenant Voice will be an independent body and, once it is established, it will be for it to decide whether at some later date it will give advice to tenants in the private sector who face similar issues to their social housing neighbours. This is a decision for the National Tenant Voice and we want the legislation to be flexible enough to permit such a decision. In any event, the clause does not envisage that the National Tenant Voice will represent private sector tenants alone. Where private tenants are represented, the body must also represent tenants of social housing. The amendments seek to rule out that option by preventing any financial support for such activity. We do not believe that to be right. Nor is it practical, as any assistance provided to the National Tenant Voice will inevitably have a financial implication.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000111"></a>Amendment 150A seeks to ensure that activities are not confined solely to matters affecting all tenants but could include activities relating to specific groups. I wholeheartedly agree with the intention but we feel

Subsections (2), (3) and (4), which set out the key functions, are not restricted; in other words, the current wording already permits activities that concern all tenants or just some.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09020357000112"></a>As to the social housing definition including lower-cost home ownership being confusing, yes, it does include lower-cost home ownership but it will also include different tenancies such as shared ownership, equity percentage arrangements, and so on. I hope that the full response I have provided will reassure noble Lords and that they will not press their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09020357000116"></a>The distinction between social housing tenants and private tenants is not clear.

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000003"></a>I must declare my various interests. First, in a purely voluntary capacity, I chair the Private Rented Sector Forum, which brings together representatives of tenants and landlords. I am also a member of the council of the Ombudsman for Estate Agents, which is a non-profit-making body providing a redress scheme not only in relation to sales agents but to lettings agents and managing agents of privately rented property. I am a joint owner with my wife of a rented property and have responsibilities for other rented properties owned by my wife and my sister, and two of my children are tenants of private landlords. I hope that that satisfies all requirements.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000004"></a>Clause 25 enables the Secretary of State to establish and assist a body that will represent the interests at national level of housing association tenants in England or to support an existing body to provide that representation. It is clear that the intention is to cover tenants of social landlords as spelt out in Clause 26. Although there is provision for that same representative body also to support,</p>
<ul><a name="0902042000308"></a>&#147;tenants of other residential property&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0902042000203"></a>in the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, it seems that this potential extension of the role of a new organisation may be limited to tenants whose position is akin to that of tenants in social housing&#151;tenants of councils, their arm&#146;s-length management organisations and of other landlords whose property is managed by housing associations on a similar basis.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000005"></a>As we have heard, the work is well advanced for the creation of a body to be known as the National Tenant Voice, which will confine itself to representation of tenants from the different parts of the social housing sector. The new body will work closely with the regulator, the Tenant Services Authority created by the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. When the powers in that Act are used to extend the role of the TSA to cover council tenants, I expect that the National Tenant Voice will see its role enlarged at the same time to embrace those tenants as well. However, while welcoming the progress in lining up a new representative body for this particular group of tenants, my concern is that many of the worst abuses&#151;the most extreme grievances and the most serious complaints&#151;are found in the private rented sector. Indeed, the so-called PRS, which houses many tenants on housing benefit, including homeless families referred by local authorities, contains some of the most vulnerable households in the country.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000006"></a>It is possible that one day the remit of the new tenants&#146; organisation will be extended to embrace private tenants, but for the immediate years ahead it will be kept busy with its important function of championing the requirements, particularly in negotiations with the TSA and the Government, of social housing tenants. Private sector tenants will, therefore, be left out in the cold, yet it is those tenants, not the social housing tenants, who currently have no recourse to any regulator or any redress/ombudsman scheme.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000007"></a>My amendments would enable the Secretary of State at any time to set up and support a representative body for tenants in the private rented sector. It is probably desirable that such a body should in due course merge with the National Tenant Voice representing social housing tenants so that one consumer organisation can cover all tenants. At present, however, that is a distant prospect. In the mean time, private tenants have a range of issues on which a body representing their interests would have much to say. Over recent years, the private rented sector has expanded, after decades of decline. Not least through the growth of buy-to-let mortgages, new landlords have entered this field. The recent report from Julie Rugg, of York University, for the Department of Communities and Local Government suggests that there are now 1.2 million landlords in this country. There are more tenants in this sector than there are council tenants or tenants of housing associations. As homeowners find it increasingly difficult to sell their properties, more of them are becoming landlords, albeit often reluctantly, while more home-seekers are turning to the rented sector because the credit crunch means that they cannot buy. Julie Rugg&#146;s report and recent reports for the RICS from Bryan Carsberg and Professor Colin Jones recommend new steps to improve the position of tenants in the private rented sector.</p>
<h5><a name="0902042000312"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000008"></a>At the same time, new problems are arising with schemes for sale and rent-back, where unscrupulous landlords obtain property on terms that are very unfavourable for the occupier. In addition, more private tenants are losing their homes through no fault of their own because their landlords have failed to keep up their mortgage repayments and their properties have been repossessed.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000009"></a>Private tenants have an inferior deal to tenants in social housing, whose position is to be further improved by Clauses 25 and 26. They pay higher rents and have much less security of tenure. It seems strange, therefore, that the Bill enhances the support for social housing tenants, but would not, unless the amendments are accepted, allow the Secretary of State to establish comparable arrangements for private tenants.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000010"></a>The Minister and his successors in office may soon greatly welcome the chance to do more for the growing number of PRS tenants. I hope, therefore, that the amendments will find favour with your Lordships.</p>

They enable the power of people coming together to make a point to be felt. I hope that the Government will give us assurances as to the way in which they are looking at this important and, as the noble Lord said, now suddenly expanding sector.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000013"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0902042000326"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Best, supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, have raised a very important issue; namely, how we ensure that all tenants, regardless of their landlord, receive a good service. We are well aware that some of the most disadvantaged in our society are the tenants of private landlords. The noble Lord has powerfully highlighted the key issues.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000014"></a>Noble Lords will know that it is precisely because we are conscious of the needs of tenants in the private sector and of the issues raised by the noble Lord that we asked Julie Rugg and David Rhodes, of York University, to undertake a review. Their report sets out some real challenges for the sector and we are still considering the issues that it raises. We shall respond in due course, but one perhaps obvious conclusion of the review was the sheer diversity of the sector, from the very wealthy to the very poor. That was echoed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. That we should provide a single voice for such a diverse community was not one of the review&#146;s conclusions. However, we share the noble Lord&#146;s concerns about the more vulnerable tenants in the private sector, many of whom face issues similar to those of their neighbours in social housing. That is precisely why we have made provisions in these clauses for National Tenant Voice to undertake activities not only in relation to social housing tenants but that affect those in the private sector. That is where they have a shared concern. Again, I hope that that provides some reassurance to the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, in respect of her previous amendments.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000015"></a>The creation of National Tenant Voice is part of our wider reform of social housing regulation. We must not lose sight of that. Issues of the private sector are a different matter and, although important, need to be addressed separately. What we want is a strong private rented sector that acts professionally and meets the needs of all its customers, not just those with the financial ability to walk away from a poor deal.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000016"></a>In conclusion, I point out a technicality in the first amendment, which would allow the Secretary of State to establish more than one body for fulfilling the functions of National Tenant Voice. This amendment is unnecessary under Section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1976, as the singular includes the plural, and vice versa, unless a contrary intention is apparent.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000017"></a>I hope that the reassurance that we are giving serious thought to the matters raised in the Rugg review and will respond to the review in due course will enable the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment at this stage.</p>

For the benefit of the Committee, and to put the amendments into context, I remind noble Lords that it has taken some time to reach the present position.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000022"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mustill, sought to introduce a Private Member&#146;s Bill dealing with this matter some years ago. At that stage, it was known as the &#147;Beverley Bill&#148;, deriving from the town of Beverley and inspired by the fact that its guild of freemen was in some difficulty due to the limits placed on succession. I took over from the noble and learned Lord and, with full support from all Benches in your Lordships' House, my simple Bill to extend hereditary rights to daughters as well as sons was taken up in the Commons by my good friend the Member of Parliament for Newcastle Central, Jim Cousins. Unexpectedly, it was objected to&#151;and, as one shout of &#147;object&#148; kills the Bill, it was lost. I tried twice more and each time it suffered the same fate. It had friends in the Commons, notably the Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed, and, importantly, Ministers Phil Woolas and John Healey, who at one stage or another indicated that the Government were sympathetic to the Bill&#146;s objectives and would seek a suitable vehicle for it in future legislation.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000023"></a>The Minister has been kind enough to meet me to discuss this issue in the past. She will know that I laid a similar amendment to the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill last year, as did the noble Lord, Lord Boston, on honorary freedoms. On that occasion, I agreed to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the Government would seek a more suitable legislative opportunity.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000024"></a>I know that the Government are sympathetic to what I am trying to do. Indeed, following her assurances on the previous occasion, I was very grateful to the Minister for her support in the production of a Private Member&#146;s Bill. However, as is so often the case&#151;certainly  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in my experience over the years&#151;that was unsuccessful. So when I saw the White Paper <I>Communities in </I><I>C</I><I>ontrol</I><I>:</I><I> Real </I><I>P</I><I>eople, </I><I>R</I><I>eal </I><I>P</I><I>ower</I> in the summer, I was much encouraged, not only by its references to other ways of serving the local community but also by its recognition of traditional roles in local government, such as aldermen. I thought, &#147;This is it. The following Bill will be the suitable legislative opportunity we have been so long promised&#148;. However, it was not to be. There is no recognition in the Bill that local traditions have a part to play in encouraging interest in civic life, and, in particular, I was disappointed that the Government had not taken the opportunity to update one of our most historic traditions.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000025"></a>In essence, all these amendments are about modernising the ancient traditions of freemen. I can do no better than refer to the <I>Journal of the Freemen of England and Wales</I>, which, in a recent issue, stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0902042000248"></a>&#147;For the Freedom, this is the most significant piece of legislation proposed since either the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act, which interfered with our rights, or the Local Government Act of 1972, which saved the existence of the Freedom&#148;.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000026"></a>Who are the freemen of England and Wales? The freemen's guilds in our ancient towns and cities exist as trustees and guardians of funds and property for public benefit. They go back to at least medieval times. Unlike honorary freedom, borough freedom is not an honour but a civic duty and responsibility; nor is it purely inherited. In many towns, the terms of admission include residential restrictions, place of birth restrictions, forms of apprenticeship and relationship by marriage. Almost every town has different rules, which are exceedingly difficult to change. These amendments are designed to enable existing guilds of freemen to make the changes outlined in the amendment, if they wish to do so. It is entirely permissive. If no change is sought, then so be it. If change is sought along the lines of the provisions of the amendment, they can be promulgated by using these procedures.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000027"></a>My amendment creates a new schedule to the 1972 Act that sets out the procedure for amending the admission rights to guilds of freemen so that women can inherit the right to be a freeman&#151;in nearly all cases, purely as a result of a resolution of the freemen. If the change requires amendment of an Act, the Secretary of State will need to make an order to bring about that change. The amendment will also make it far easier to alter other admission rules, such as having to be born in a town. It also makes provision to enable a woman to use the title &#147;Freewoman&#148; to reflect the White Paper proposals for aldermen, and, for the sake of consistency, it makes the changes proposed by that White Paper. Clause 2 amends Section 249 of the Local Government Act 1972 so as to enable principal councils to confer the title &#147;Alderwoman&#148;.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000028"></a>Of course, the local authority has a part to play as, although the application for membership is to the Guild of Freemen, the guild is the predecessor of local government or councils in the town or city, therefore the city council is the successor &#147;corporation&#148;. Invariably, the local Guild of Freemen and the local council work together closely for the good of their local populace.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000029"></a>Here I pay tribute to the officials in the department and many others, but especially to the Minister and her predecessors, who have given me great encouragement  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>over the period. I especially want to thank the central body for freemen&#151;the Freemen of England and Wales. It has shown a lively interest in the Bill and has commented, invariably favourably, on its provisions. It has also suggested improvements based on its knowledge of the state of opinion within its organisation. In no way is the Bill proposed by that organisation, but it has responded to invitations to comment and improve from the department and myself over a period, and I know that the Bill will be welcomed. It will allow many disparate strands of guild freedoms to be brought up to date simply and easily, and will avoid great cost and time by petitioning one quarter or another to achieve improvements.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000030"></a>I am glad the opportunity is taken of creating a situation whereby the amendments may be used locally to grant honorary freedoms to those they wish to honour where that right or opportunity does not exist. The noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, whom I see in his place, energetically pursued that opportunity earlier, and I am glad that his interests are met in the revised version of the Bill. Other changes were made on the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. I believe that the style and drafting used in the new clause is clearer and more reader-friendly.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000031"></a>I want this legislation to bring increased pride and public acknowledgement to many more communities. Local service of one kind or another at present earns individuals honour by having the freedom of the borough conferred. No one was more delighted and happy than I when the London Borough of Enfield did me the great honour of awarding me the borough freedom medal, which I show to the Committee. I am very proud of it.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000032"></a>I know that those who serve their local community in a voluntary capacity&#151;indeed, many of our councillors&#151;do not do so for reward or recognition, but that does not mean that service should not be recognised where appropriate. It is the local authority that must have a role in representing and acting on behalf of the local community in that way, as it can by recognising the service of councillors. But, as I say, only some local authorities can do that at present. This is inequitable and an accident of history. For that reason, the amendment enables all local authorities, from parish councils to county councils, to be able to grant honorary freedoms in recognition of eminent service by amending the relevant provisions in the 1972 Act. For instance, Royston Town Council wished to award the Royal Anglian Regiment the freedom of the town on its return from Iraq, but could not do so under the current restrictive legislation.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000033"></a>In the Bill, new opportunities exist. How about extending that freedom to those who have served us so well in Iraq and Afghanistan, both collectively and individually? Let us show our debt and pride more widely than has been the practice in the past. The Bill could be used for that. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000034"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0902042000332"></a>Baroness Maddock:</b><b></b>I apologise to the Committee; I have been in another committee and have only just arrived, but am very glad that I am in time to support

He mentioned Berwick-upon-Tweed; I came into contact with this because I married the Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed, who has been very supportive of the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000035"></a>Since I have lived there, I have been a member of the borough council. We work very closely with the freemen in Berwick, which is a large group. I was particularly interested in the noble Lord&#146;s comments about how important they are to the life of a town and how they are part of the community. They certainly are in Berwick-upon-Tweed. They own quite a lot of the land there and have also instigated some very good affordable housing for older people in the borough. Indeed, until we had problems because of disability access to the town hall, the borough council met in the town hall, which is owned by the borough freemen. We are trying to find a way of getting disabled access into this very old building.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Graham, was right that the Bill is about trying to get people more involved and about how local communities work. I can vouch for the fact that borough freemen are very involved in their local community.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000037"></a>It is also important for other parts of what the noble Lord, Lord Graham, said, because local government is being reorganised in Northumberland. The borough council, where we have had the mayoralty and so on, and where we have been able to make honorary members in the borough, will disappear and a town council will be elected. If it can carry on that sort of tradition, people in Berwick will be very pleased. There are several things that people worry about in losing borough status, and some of the things that cannot go to the new unitary authority are very important to local people and how they view their community.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000038"></a>I am very pleased to be able to support what the noble Lord is saying, and I hope that the Government can accept the amendment. It is perfectly in tune with what they are trying to do in local communities&#151;to make people feel that there are different ways in which they can take part in their community. I wish him luck.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000039"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0902042000333"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I was pleased to hear the noble Lord refer to county councils, because they very rarely or never appoint freeman. The noble Lord may have the freedom of Enfield, but he actually lives in Essex, so if this amendment went through we might be able to confer on him the freedom of Essex.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000040"></a>The problem has just been highlighted. For example, we do not have an Essex regiment now&#151;it is part of the Royal Anglian Regiment. There never has been a south Essex regiment, to which the television hero Sharpe is supposed to belong, but we have had an Essex Regiment. We would like the county council to honour the Essex Regiment for the part that it has played in Afghanistan, from which it has just recently returned. That is the sort of thing that relates to the first part of the Bill, about getting people to understand more about local government. If we can do things like that, it brings local government to the fore as part of our heritage and the things that people do. I very much support the amendment and hope that the Government find ways in which to do this.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000042"></a>The noble Lord has advised me that his amendment provides an all-embracing power relating to the creation of honorary freemen. There is one category of honorary freeman with which I am concerned about in particular&#151;those connected with the Cinque Ports.

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000043"></a>At this point, I declare two interests. Many years ago, in another place, I represented a constituency then called Faversham, which included the town of Faversham, an associate Cinque Port. My arms contain part of the arms of the Cinque Ports.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000044"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Graham, would restore to the Cinque Ports of Kent and East Sussex a right to create honorary freemen, which existed for centuries. The service to the nation of those towns goes back to the time of the Norman conquest.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000047"></a>The right to create honorary freemen was ended when the Local Government Act 1972, which came into force in 1974, was passed. Until 1974, all but one of the Cinque port towns were municipal boroughs, which had the ancient right to confer the freedom of their towns on distinguished national figures and those who had given a lifetime of voluntary service to their communities.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000048"></a>Many, including 12 of the Cinque Ports, were too small to become local government districts in their own right. The majority became what were called &#147;successor parishes&#148;, which exercised the rights to be called town councils and for their chairmen to be known as &#147;town mayors&#148;. Some of the larger towns did not meet the Government&#146;s criteria to become successor parishes and from 1974 they were represented by &#147;charter trustees&#148;, as they were called. A number of these later became town councils, leaving only Margate and Ramsgate represented by charter trustees.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000049"></a>In the case of the 12 Cinque Ports which were reduced to the status of town councils or charter trustees, the legislation which gave effect to the 1974 reorganisation recognised their long service to the nation by making express provision for the successor town councils and charter trustees to continue to exercise functions as members of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports. However, the 1972 Act stripped all former boroughs of the right to confer the freedom of their towns. It was replaced by a new statutory power only for those district councils with the status of cities, boroughs or royal boroughs to confer the honorary freedom of their areas upon,</p>
<ul><a name="0902042000309"></a>&#147;persons of distinction and persons who have rendered eminent services&#148;</ul>

<p><a name="0902042000050"></a>The Confederation of the Cinque Ports, representing all 14 Cinque port towns, has been pressing the Government to rectify this anomaly and injustice&#151;which is what it is&#151;for several years. The Government have expressed sympathy for this aim and have indicated that if a suitable legislative opportunity arose it would bear those representations in mind. Over the past two years I have pressed these aims, notably in the proceedings on the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, now an Act, but the Government, while remaining sympathetic, did not feel it possible to accept that that Bill was an appropriate vehicle. This Bill provides an appropriate vehicle, with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Graham.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000051"></a>My noble and gallant friend Lord Boyce, the Lord Warden and Admiral of the Cinque Ports, is detained elsewhere in the Palace on parliamentary business, otherwise he would be with us in this room. He is keen for this aim to succeed, as are other of your Lordships with Cinque Ports connections, including the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, who has authorised me to say that she supports these amendments, and my noble friend Lord Imbert. I am grateful for the guidance and advice of the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, her officials and, on earlier proceedings, the Public Bill Office. I am also very grateful to Mr Ian Russell, Registrar and Seneschal of the Cinque Ports, for his considerable help and briefings.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000052"></a>I should indicate at this stage that I support the other two amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Graham, which come at the end of the Marshalled List. I say that now, as it will save me from having to burden the Committee with two more speeches in support. I hope that the amendment will be agreed to by the Committee.</p>

I am particularly proud that my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Boston, were able to be here despite the weather so that we could have this debate. My noble friend said that this was the most significant piece of legislation since the 1835 municipal government Act. It is certainly well up there with the great reforms in local government and equality. We always say that politics is the art of the possible, and somehow the possible seems to take years to arrive. However, the persistence of the two noble Lords in this context has been remarkable. Patience, as well as integrity, virtue and vision, are sometimes the key political qualities, and they have exhibited all that as they have tried to put these good changes on the statute book for a long time. I am delighted that we are in a position to accept these amendments.</p>

Before I confirm that, I should say that I know that we have had a long journey to get to this point, and we have failed for good reasons&#151;the amendments, the time or the vehicles have not been quite right. However, we have now satisfied all those considerations. I am grateful to my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Boston, for thanking officials; when we started, we

I had visions of us having to go back to medieval statute, especially in relation to the Cinque Ports, and trying to unscramble what William himself might have put in statute. In fact, thanks to the cleverness and hard work of our lawyers, all is now satisfied. I am sure that they will be grateful for having that put on record.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000056"></a>We gave assurances and sponsored a Private Member&#146;s Bill, and I understood the disappointment that followed that. Noble Lords all around the Committee have spoken of the historic and ceremonial traditions that are so much of what makes this country different, that are of such value to us, and that we cherish. Those traditions need to work in a way that is non-discriminatory, and we face not only historic change but something genuinely important when we think of the scope of our equality legislation and the importance that we attach to that value.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000057"></a>I am delighted. I feel I have a vested interest; I shall never be a freewoman, I am sure, but invitation goes out&#151;challenge me to be wrong. The position on the right of succession has been blatantly discriminatory&#151;in many guilds it can be secured only by patrimony&#151;so the provision has the added benefit of helping to ensure that hereditary freemen can continue as part of the active but historic framework of many of our towns and cities. The evidence of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, about how the quality of life for people in Berwick is changing was a telling example of how contemporary the work of freemen, and now freewomen, will be. I am happy to endorse the changes that recognise the position of women in those traditional governance arrangements.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000058"></a>As for the changes that the noble Lord puts forward to allow all local authorities to recognise eminent services to their area by the granting of the title of honorary freemen&#151;absolutely. If we are to keep traditions, they must be seen to be fair and to move with the times. We agree that all local authorities should enjoy this right. It enables those who govern a place to recognise the contributions made by local people, and I feel that there cannot be too many opportunities to do that by thanking people publicly and recognising their efforts.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000059"></a>Granting honorary freedoms is an important way of recognising service, whether by voluntary groups, residents or people who run tenants&#146; associations, local youth clubs and the things that make a significant difference to the life of the community. I know that this will be welcomed by local people and local authorities. All district and county councils will be able to confer the title of honorary alderman or, thanks to the noble Lord&#146;s amendments, honorary alderwoman in recognition of service. I am very pleased that we have been able to satisfy the interests of those who work for and value the traditions of the Cinque Ports. I know that many noble Lords will support that. Indeed, I remember the fascinating debates we had on the previous Bill when we discussed what makes the Cinque Ports so special in our national life.</p>

I welcome that in all respects. Therefore, with a glad heart, I propose to accept the noble Lord&#146;s amendments.</p>

I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, who speaks with more knowledge about Berwick than many people, but not with more than me, because I come from Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Berwick is a landmark and a lovely town with great history. The noble Baroness stressed the continuing value of the guild of freemen in her town, as in many others. Although we are modernising and moving on, it is essential that we retain our tradition and history wherever possible. I was very grateful for her remarks.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000062"></a>The Bill is a trigger, a platform and an opportunity for people who may not have thought of using the device of awarding honorary freedom to individuals and groups in a town. I look forward to a number of people waking up to the fact that it is possible to use these amendments to elevate the status of individuals and groups in the town, so I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000063"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Boston, has been diligent and persistent in ensuring that the interests of the Cinque Ports are borne in mind. When he tells us that there is history going back to William the Conqueror in the area that he represented, one appreciates how jealously we should guard that which has been handed down to us and which we will hand down to others.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000064"></a>The freemen of Newcastle-upon-Tyne are held in high esteem and do great work. Almshouses are provided and the Town Moor, a feature of Newcastle, is owned by the freemen, who jealously guard its rights and make sure that it is not trampled upon. They are proud of it. I am grateful for the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Boston. I was pleased that he mentioned the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, and the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes. They took part in the original debate and brought a cross-party line to it.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000065"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for her advice. She is right to point out the care that has been taken by her officials. This provision has been redrafted more than once to ensure that, as a fresh look is taken at what is intended, if people do not want to do anything, they do not have to, but if they do want to, they have to take account of modernity and other things. I am very grateful for that.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000066"></a>I am also grateful for the Minister&#146;s support for the equality aspect of the amendment. Although it started as a simple idea to give a guild the right for succession to go beyond that of sons and to include daughters, one can quickly see how the concept has grown. We had to make sure that it was not just a ramble but had been looked at and carefully thought about. From the time it started, it has been rewritten more than once in the light of advice and guidance. I am grateful to the Minister and to the Freemen of England and Wales, who have been careful not to say that they are promoters of the Bill, but they fully support what the Bill sets out to do.</p>

It is the first of a series of amendments on the subject. One of the first Bills of the current Labour Government established the executive and scrutiny functions of local authorities. Initially it did not work too well because most of their members had been members of committees and did not like to think that they were not going to be part of the decision-making process and were not keen on scrutiny. That has moved on over a period of years as many new members have arrived and it is accepted that scrutiny plays a major role in what happens in local government. We are now appointing a scrutiny officer and I would like to understand the Government&#146;s thinking on that.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000068"></a>There are two important officers in local government: the monitoring officer and the Section 151 officer. The monitoring officer deals with matters of probity, legal matters and members&#146; complaints; it is an important role in local government. Our Section 151 officer has an important role because she tells us what she thinks, sets out how viable we are and tells us if we spend too much money. She is giving me a report today about the finances of the county council in preparation for our budget. Here we are appointing a scrutiny officer. I cannot imagine that the Government see the role of a scrutiny officer as being on the same level as these two officers but the Bill seems to rate him almost at that level.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000069"></a>We have had a middle-ranking scrutiny officer ever since the legislation was introduced, but I have found that the strength of scrutiny lies in the members who do the scrutiny rather than the officer. One of our first scrutiny officers was always sending difficult e-mails to the chief executive asking, &#147;Why haven&#146;t you done this? Why haven&#146;t you done that?&#148;. The chief executive deals with administration and members; the scrutiny side is different. Obviously, the monitoring officer and the Section 151 officer work for the chief executive.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000070"></a>Scrutiny is given to how policies are delivered and sometimes it can be critical of the executive and the officers. I therefore see a difficulty with how a scrutiny officer at the same level as the Section 151 officer and the monitoring officer will work with the chief executive. All principal authorities should have a scrutiny officer and most do&#151;again, we are putting into legislation something that mostly happens already&#151;but I cannot understand what the Government mean by putting the scrutiny role almost at the level of the Section 151 and monitoring roles. I do not think it will work. It is a different role; it is not a role supporting members and the legitimacy and probity of the council. Perhaps the Minister can explain the Government&#146;s thinking on this.</p>

I am something of a Pollyanna as regards scrutiny, as I am probably too much of an advocate in relation to what it can achieve. Therefore, it may seem a little odd that I am opposing the clause, but I do so for the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has explained and perhaps for other reasons too.</p>

I do not think it is possible for an individual, on a given subject, to support the executive in the morning and the scrutiny of the executive&#146;s work in the afternoon, which I believe is what happens too often at the moment.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000073"></a>I can understand that the Government&#146;s intention, through this clause, is to boost the status of scrutiny but the Explanatory Notes say that the impact will mean each authority appointing one officer. If anything, ring-fencing to one officer will reduce the status.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000074"></a>I absolutely agree with the point that has been made. I, too, wrote down &#147;finance officer&#148;, &#147;Section 151 officer&#148; and &#147;monitoring officer&#148;. This post would be entirely different in quality. I also wrote down &#147;children&#146;s services&#148;. I am not sure of the legislative status but I think that authorities have a children&#146;s officer, and this, again, is different.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000075"></a>The Government are right to advocate stronger and more effective scrutiny than some authorities have been able to achieve, but I do not think that this is the way to do it. If, after all, we believe that each local authority should be autonomous in the way that it goes about its business, from these Benches I must consistently oppose central government telling it how to set about that.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000076"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0902042000345"></a>Baroness Maddock:</b> I support my noble friend. I know from my own experience that it is important that you have officer support, but she is absolutely right: one officer might be able to do certain things for you but certainly would not be able to provide support on the sorts of things that I feel are needed on a scrutiny committee. I served on one on a district council, where we had a committee system because we were a small authority. I have also had experience of a large county council, although I was not on one.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000077"></a>I understand where the Government are coming from because, frankly, when it was decided to split the executive and the scrutiny, it became clear from all sorts of research that in many areas it did not work terribly well. Many councillors felt that they were disenfranchised and that they could not have a say in what went on. Therefore, it is important&#151;I think that the Government have identified this&#151;that people who sit on scrutiny committees have support so that they can carry out the scrutiny that they are trying to do and so that people can chase up what they want to be scrutinised. I remember one particular time when we were scrutinising what was happening with school transport in Northumberland, which is a big rural authority. The situation was that people had to pay for transport. It was all very complicated and it had become a terrible mess. At the beginning of the term it was a total mess, and trying to get to the bottom of it was very difficult. You could get an officer to a meeting and ask questions, but after that it all went away.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000078"></a>I understand where the Government are coming from, but I still think that it is important for local authorities, as my noble friend said, to sort it out for themselves. We have a very good officer on our small scrutiny committee in Berwick, who has done most of the things that the Explanatory Notes say that officers should do. A lot of work has been done by various

I attended a very good scrutiny conference, in which my noble friend Lady Hamwee was also taking part, with her experience of what had happened at the GLA. A lot of good advice is going out to councillors and people have themselves identified that they need to have proper officer support. It does not need to be in this form. If any of the back office&#151;I shall call them that rather than civil servants&#151;has the opportunity to see what goes on with local councillors in those scrutiny conferences, they will see that many people are taking it up without the need to have it in primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000079"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0902042000346"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> It is evident that noble Lords understand what we are trying to do, although there is clearly concern about how we are trying to do it. Perhaps I could clarify some of that. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, got it right.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000080"></a>The noble Lord described how the scrutiny functions had grown in recent years, with the changes in governance, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that this was about raising status and visibility. I shall respond to both those points in the context of some uneven and patchy practice. I am glad to have support in principle for the value that we want and the visibility of scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000081"></a>Clause 27 inserts a new section into the Local Government Act 2000, requiring local authorities to designate one of their officers as the scrutiny officer to support the work of the overview and scrutiny committees. Amendment 153, a probing amendment, seeks to make the designation of the scrutiny officer discretionary. The second amendment requires that it is met within existing budgeted expenditure.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000082"></a>Local authorities have very broad powers in respect of their staffing arrangements; they can already designate an officer to support their overview and scrutiny committee. Amendment 153 therefore adds no practical effect . The purpose of the clause is simply to raise the status, visibility and effectiveness of the overview and scrutiny function to ensure that all local authorities have a chance to rise to the standards of the best. We have based this on substantial evidence; all the studies on the development of overview and scrutiny have shown that officer support is an important condition for effective scrutiny. Our conclusion is that if overview and scrutiny is to be effective, it is crucial that officer resources are in place to provide support and advice to those committees. The evidence suggests that it is not always in place or in place in the most effective way.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000083"></a>We have considered the work of the Centre for Public Scrutiny, whose recent survey sought views from the local government sector on the single element that would do most to improve the overview and scrutiny function. That is what we are trying to achieve. One of the biggest responses was in favour of providing more resources and staff. So there is quite a lot to commend this proposal to place a requirement on lead councils to have a scrutiny officer responsible for supporting the work of the committee to ensure that there are strong arrangements in place to review and drive outcomes.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC173"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000084"></a>We have arrived at a point where the local area agreements are about to be refreshed and we know that a lot of work has gone into constructing them. It is clear that overview and scrutiny will be an increasingly important part of the local government landscape.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, asked some very important questions. He is quite right that we are not doing anything new in the sense that what we have in place already came under the Local Government Act 1972. Under Section 151, the local authority is required to have an officer who is responsible for its financial affairs. The Local Government and Housing Act 1989 enhanced the role and created two further statutory officers: the head of paid service, recognising the importance of the senior management functions, and the monitoring officer.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000086"></a>We are following a similar approach in this Bill by creating a statutory officer, which evidence suggests is the critical thing to do. Local authorities can sort it out for themselves; we are making the requirement, because we think that this function ought to be performed, and visibly so, but we are not prescribing the level of the post. We are simply saying that it is for the authority to decide, in recognition of local circumstances, what will suit it best. We are providing funding for this. We are trying to ensure that there is an officer in place that everybody knows that that job is to be done and the support is there.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000087"></a>There will be one statutory scrutiny officer in each local authority, just as there will be one head of paid service and one monitoring officer. Obviously, actual staff and officers are included in support services and we hope that there will be more than one officer employed in undertaking this. We are paying additional money; it will be ring-fenced and authorities can use that additional money for support if they wish.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000088"></a>We are trying to make this a visible and standard part of all local authorities, which it is not at present. We need to achieve a balance between providing a new resource but letting local authorities decide how this is best managed in their local circumstances.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000089"></a>Amendment 154 on funding demonstrates a concern that the provision might have an adverse impact on council resources because of the requirement to make savings elsewhere. As I have said, we are very sympathetic, not just to the wider economic challenges facing councils but to the resource implications of having this in the Bill. I can, again, give the assurance that the costs will be met in full.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000090"></a>I know that Members of the Committee are sympathetic to what we are trying to do. I hope that I have given sufficient reassurance that this will be a matter for local authorities to manage as they see fit under the circumstances. I respect the experience of Members of the Committee and take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. I would be very happy to talk to him further about how we think this can best work and some of the implications that arise from it.</p>

I agree with a point made earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that scrutiny should be carried out by a team of officers even if one officer is monitoring the others. Members need support at different levels. Scrutiny has improved because of the extra status members have given to it. In our own council, we have an executive member for scrutiny and she spends a lot of time raising the status of scrutiny within the organisation. It might have been better in this Bill if we had raised the member profile as much as the officer profile.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000093"></a>I was heartened by what the Minister said because I was concerned that the officer would have the same status as a monitoring officer, Section 151 officer or the head of children&#146;s services. That is clearly not how it should be. I am grateful that she said she would talk to me about that because we need to make it quite clear in the Bill. Otherwise, some people might think that the status was same as that of a Section 151 officer. I am grateful that we will have a conversation about this before we progress the Bill. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Now that we have had that explanation, the intent and purpose of the amendment is fairly clear.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000095"></a>Amendment 155 stands in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, as well as my noble friend Lady Hamwee and myself. We added our names to it. It is an amendment suggested by the Local Government Association, which we are happy to support. I assume that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, will speak to it in a moment. As his name is before mine on the Marshalled List, I will leave him to explain its purpose more fully, but it is intended to provide a general power for any two or more councils to set up joint overview and scrutiny bodies should they wish to do so and extends rather further the provisions of the Bill. It will be a useful amendment in areas which have county and district councils, about which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, knows far more than I do, having been a member of a London borough council</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000096"></a>That brings me to Amendment 155A, which, for my noble friend and I, is the substantial amendment in this group. I need to refer to the debate we have just had on the previous group of amendments. I should say that I have served on a scrutiny committee in a local authority and I have always been on the receiving end of them&#151;as an executive councillor, I am scrutinised, it seems, very frequently. I know, recognise and experience effective scrutiny&#151;and, just occasionally, not very effective scrutiny. I should also say that, with my noble friend Lady Hamwee, I served for eight years on what must be the best resourced scrutiny body in the country, the London Assembly, whose sole purpose is scrutiny. This is not the place to discuss its resourcing, but it is significantly greater, I would think, even than the kingdom of Essex in its scrutiny functions. So some experience is there.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000097"></a>I share and understand the intentions of the Government in this chapter of the Bill. All of us would wish to raise the status and visibility of scrutiny and its effectiveness. However, it is also frustrating to be on the receiving end of a scrutiny committee that is not working very effectively, so it works on both sides. I said right from the start that for scrutiny to be effective the committee must have its own, independent&#151;in the sense that it is not part of the department that is being scrutinised&#151;scrutiny support. That is enormously important.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000098"></a>The proposal to designate a scrutiny officer will not have any effect on that. I would think that most of the authorities to which it applies&#151;because it excludes district councils&#151;will already have scrutiny officers. All that will happen in most, if not all, authorities, I am sure, is that they will designate an existing officer with the title of scrutiny officer, just as has happened everywhere with monitoring officers and Section 151 officers. They are not new posts; they designate existing posts.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000099"></a>The Minister said that additional money was ring-fenced. That is welcome news for those who are going to receive it.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC176"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

Whether it is ring-fenced or not, the additional money will not come to the great number of authorities that are already floor authorities and do not receive any additional money. I have great doubts about the effectiveness of the provision in achieving the aim which we all share.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000102"></a>Amendment 155A, on the other hand, would have considerable effect in raising the status, visibility and effectiveness of scrutiny committees in local authorities. If a local authority&#146;s scrutiny committee or committees had the power to require what we term simply as the &#147;connected authorities&#148;, as described in the Bill, to come before the scrutiny committee, to scrutinise them on behalf of their local community in public and to hold them answerable and accountable, it would do more than any other single measure to raise the status, visibility and effectiveness of scrutiny. It would do far more than designating an existing middle-ranking officer with another bit of a title which means nothing. I urge the Minister to consider carefully the amendment, or at least its purpose, because it would do more to achieve what she and we wish than any designation of middle-ranking officers. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000103"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0902042000353"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I shall speak briefly to Amendment 155. As the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said, it is in our name also. It is supported by all parties in the Local Government Association. The scope of scrutiny could be widened by it, which I am sure the Government would like to encourage.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000104"></a>I am the leader of a county council and therefore working with districts is very important. Our chief executive is chief executive of one of the districts, therefore joint scrutiny committees between the county council and that district would be very valuable, as would working with any district or group of districts on particular issues. It is not just the county with a district; the joint scrutiny body for a group of councils has established a joint waste disposal arrangement under that legislation. There could be a joint scrutiny body for a group of metropolitan authorities that had agreed a multi-area agreement or a regional scrutiny body that would scrutinise the RDA. All sorts of things could happen that would improve the status of scrutiny, which we all want to support. I hope the Government will accept this amendment and go along with the LGA and the all-party agreement in local government about this issue.</p>

When local authorities were given the ability to scrutinise health, it seemed rather odd to have

We therefore set up a single body with a representative from the 10 authorities that has effectively done a number of studies on healthcare in Greater Manchester. Even when the Government reorganised the health service yet again, so that we now have a North West Strategic Health Authority, we felt it important to continue the scrutiny at Greater Manchester level.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000106"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, Greater Manchester was one of the first authorities to get an MAA. It was clear to us that we needed to strengthen the role of the executive&#151;the leaders of the Greater Manchester authorities&#151;working together, and we needed to create stronger powers of scrutiny for members who were not part of the executive to understand what was going on. We did that at two levels: at the Greater Manchester level where representatives of the 10 authorities come together, and at the level of individual authorities. It can be done, and we should get on and do it.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000107"></a>I am fascinated by the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Tope. He wants to exclude police authorities. Why not the fire authorities and so on? He gave the game away when he talked about the amount of money being spent on scrutiny in the London area. Perhaps if less was spent on scrutiny and more on gritting, the capital would not have come to a halt after a sprinkling of snow.</p>

We are talking about a different type of joint overview and scrutiny. That is what the LGA sees, and is why we have tabled this amendment. We need some clarity on that. People can be invited. Perhaps your officials know more about how the legislation stands. This amendment was promoted by the LGA because it needs the new status of joint scrutiny committees.</p>

In Greater Manchester we accept that this is a serious matter&#151;these people can scrutinise what we do and therefore we respond in a proper manner. That is probably even more important than putting it down in legislation because it requires that respect.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000111"></a>These are important amendments. I take the point that the Local Government Association is behind some of the arguments, but three things are happening in the amendments. In Amendment 155, we have what seems to be a search for greater flexibility and scope  in terms of what the joint committees can do. Amendments 154A and 154B have now been helpfully clarified. Amendment154A is about the scope involved. Other amendments look at the definition of &#147;partner authorities&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000114"></a>The problem we are addressing in the clause, which is why we want to expand it, is that currently the committees may make reports and recommendations only on matters strictly connected to the particular local area agreement. I can see from Amendments 154A and 154B that noble Lords are concerned about whether the clause restricts the scope of what overview and scrutiny committees may consider. My first job, therefore, is to reinforce what I have said. Clause 28 is there precisely to expand the scope of what joint overview and scrutiny committees may consider to bring them into line with single authority overview and scrutiny committees so that they may consider any matter affecting the area of the group of partners or the inhabitants of the area. That is already provided for in the language of the clause. If a matter affects part of an area, it can also be said to affect the area. So they will not be bound by the limits of the LAA, for example, if green space or the health of the voluntary sector have not been selected as a priority. The joint overview and scrutiny committee, like the single overview and scrutiny committee, will now be able to scrutinise the policy.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000115"></a>I understand the intention behind Amendment 155 and why it seems like a good idea. It is certainly worthy of consideration as it is consistent with what we are trying to do with the MAAs. The key challenge is to consider how practically it could work within the balance of the burdens that would flow from it. My noble friend Lord Smith pointed out that, at the moment, this is perfectly possible because it is happening on an organic and innovative basis. I am sure it is the case that local authorities are proceeding on an informal basis. Any amendment that sought to put any partnership together with any other partnership to form an extended joint overview and scrutiny would have to have a formal footing and would have to be considered in the context of the enhanced powers for overview and scrutiny committees contained in the 2007 Act. We would need a formal structure around that.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC179"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000116"></a>We have taken advice on the issue of putting authorities together in any combination in our recent consultation on improving local accountability. We sought local government and stakeholder views on what issues should be considered as part of any new power to establish area scrutiny committees. The view that came back to us, not surprisingly, was that we needed to be balanced in our approach and to bear in mind that joint overview and scrutiny committee membership should not become so large and so unwieldy that it became ineffective and could not do the job it was there to do.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000117"></a>There is also another consideration. We have made substantial changes to overview and scrutiny through the 2007 Act. We have to consider whether any  new joint overview and scrutiny committees could accommodate those relatively recent changes. New powers were given to the committees with respect to local partners. We must consider whether it would be appropriate for such powers to be extended across boundary scrutiny arrangements. For these practical arrangements, I think that it is a very positive provision. I am sympathetic to what noble Lords are saying, to the arguments behind their proposals and the need to be able to move across boundaries. The time is not right to accept the recommendation, because of its practical implications.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000118"></a>Amendment 155A would add a list of partners that should be required to provide information to overview and scrutiny committees to the lists set out in new Section 22A of the Local Government Act 2000, which was inserted through the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. We use the definition of partner authorities because the enhanced provisions for overview and scrutiny provided for in that Act are primarily aimed to ensure that there is scrutiny of LAAs. That is important in delivering the priorities of the local area. The requirement to provide information should be placed squarely on the authority and partner authorities entering into the local area agreements, since they are responsible for the services that they supply, including those that they commission.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000119"></a>A number of bodies in Clause 2 are not included in the list of partners that I have described&#151;maintained schools, FE colleges, the Greater London Authority, parish councils and strategic health authorities. However, we have to recognise that overview and scrutiny will work only if its partners also have a capacity to respond effectively. We debated about a lot of that in 2007. In this Bill, we have achieved the right balance of powers and we should not seek to add partners outside those named in Part 5 of the 2007 Act.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000120"></a>In the break, when we were away from the Committee, I may have lost track of some of the other questions asked in the debate. I am very happy to read <I>Hansard</I> carefully tomorrow and respond in writing to anything that I may not have answered.</p>

Amendment 155 came from the Local Government Association and, I believe, has all-party support&#151;it certainly has two-party support, which was voiced here today. I was not quite so sure about the third  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC180"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC180</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>party. The Minister made the point, and I am very grateful to her for agreeing to consider the matter, that what we are discussing may well be happening through good practice, as most of what we have considered in this Bill so far is happening. However, the point made here and by the LGA is that there is no legislative basis for it happening; it is outside the law. I am very grateful to the Minister for agreeing to consider how best it can be achieved. I do not speak for the Local Government Association, but I am sure that it will be more than happy to have those discussions on its proposal.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000122"></a>I hope that we can discuss Amendment 155A further with the Minister. I really do feel, speaking from experience, that the ability to require those various bodies to appear before a local authority&#146;s overview and scrutiny committee, or one of the others, will do far more to enhance the status, visibility and effectiveness of scrutiny in the public mind than designating an officer as a scrutiny officer. The two are not necessarily alternatives; they can of course go together. But I hope the Minister and her colleagues will give serious consideration to how we can achieve that as the next logical step forward in enhancing the role for scrutiny.</p>

At Second Reading I mentioned that repealing what have become known as the Widdicombe rules would do a great deal to extend involvement, which is what so much of this Bill is about.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000124"></a>These amendments come from the Local Government Information Unit. I understand that the LGIU met the Minister and discussed them before today&#146;s proceedings. I was not at that meeting but the LGIU tells me that the discussions followed from these amendments and the briefing I have.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000125"></a>The amendments, taken together, are a lot of words but a fairly short and simple group of points. The effect would be to repeal the legislation that establishes a salary threshold for politically restricted posts in local authorities. It would repeal the legislation requiring  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC181"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>council employees to resign on nomination of a candidate in an election to be a councillor, as distinct from resignation on election, and would reduce to three months the period during which most former councillors are restricted from taking up employment with the council after their period of service comes to an end, retaining the current 12-month period for politically restricted posts and councillors who have been involved in the appointment of senior staff. The Councillors Commission called for the political restrictions based on salary level to be abolished. In response, in the White Paper, the Government indicate that they would abolish this rule while retaining restrictions on the most senior council officers and others in sensitive posts.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000126"></a>The first amendment stems from the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which requires every local authority to have a list of politically restricted posts, identifying three categories of posts that are deemed to be politically restricted on the basis of one or more defined characteristics. The categories are, first, specified posts, in which the postholders are restricted without a right to appeal for exemption. They include the head of paid service, the statutory chief officers and non-statutory chief officers and deputies, the monitoring officer and chief finance officer, who have featured already this afternoon, as well as officers exercising certain delegated powers and assistants to political groups.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000127"></a>The second category of posts includes those paid at and above a certain level, who have a right to appeal for exemption on the grounds that they do not influence policy or speak on behalf of the authority. Remuneration that includes overtime, performance-related pay and so on, not simply basic salary, at present, taken on a spinal point on the scale, is just under &#163;37,000.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000128"></a>The third category includes sensitive posts. The postholders have a right to appeal for exemption on the grounds that the authorities applied the wrong criteria. Sensitive posts are those that have duty-related criteria, such as giving regular advice to the authority or speaking on behalf of it.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000129"></a>The amendment provides for the removal of the category of posts determined by a salary threshold. This seems to be quite an arbitrary measure and would mean that the content of the post, as distinct from the salary that it carried, would be the determining factor in whether it was politically restricted. At the time of the original legislation following the Widdicombe committee, it was intended that this should apply to senior officers, as it is senior officers who are routinely involved in advising local authority members. It was thought that fewer than 3 per cent of local authority employees would be affected but in reality the number has been much higher.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000130"></a>Under the legislation that we dealt with 18 months ago&#151;the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act, as it now is&#151;postholders can appeal to the local standards committee but, because the restrictions have been in place for so long, it has become implicitly accepted that there is a restriction. I am told that officers rarely apply for an exemption, even though they could. The Local Government Information Unit also understands that there are inconsistencies in the approach taken across the different authorities in England and Wales.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC182"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000131"></a>Amendment 157 deals with disqualification. If an employee wishes to stand, he must first resign from his post. However, this loses for the local government sector the skills which employees have gained and which could be used very well in the position of councillor. Having to resign on nomination rather than on election requires an employee to be either very optimistic or very confident about election. I cannot imagine that those of us who were in employment, although not in the employment of a local authority, when we stood for election would have been required to resign before standing. I was not in employment; I was in a partnership, and the only comment that I received when I said that I was going to stand was, &#147;Won&#146;t you be very tired?&#148;, which was spot on. However, it was not suggested that I should give up the job. I should perhaps say that the standards framework would nevertheless continue to apply if there were any issues around that.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000132"></a>Amendment 158 concerns the prohibition on appointment of councillors and ex-councillors to local authority posts under Section 116 of the 1972 Act. This is a prohibition for 12 months. In some local authority areas, the local authority is the largest employer because it employs people such as teachers and social workers. In my view and that of the LGIU, the 12-month restriction is a real handicap and, again, unnecessarily lengthy. The amendment would substitute a three-month period for those who have been in a politically restricted post or directly involved in the appointments process for senior council officers. There is an appreciation that it must not be regarded by local people that an appointment that was made before a councillor retired was in any way influenced by the hope of employment at a later date. I believe that the amendment would adequately meet the concerns which underlay the original legislation but with changes which reflect experience. I beg to move.</p>

Certainly, the whole thing needs updating, as most things do after a period of time, and this should be looked at. I agree that we should look at the role played by the officer rather than the salary. The salary thing is totally outdated. It debars some people in particular areas and is quite ridiculous. We should be looking at the role of that officer in the local authority, the proximity to advice and such things rather than the salary. I also have a lot of sympathy with the point made about nomination. Clearly, to give up your job and wait to be elected is not fair. It is a question of natural justice.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000134"></a>On the third amendment, I know of councils that have got around the problem by employing someone who has lost their seat as a consultant&#151;although not in Essex. I know that there are ways around the problem, but they would break the real purpose behind the law. I know of local authority members who lost their seats and then became consultants for the local authority in the same year. That might need tightening up to make certain that people do not get around that law. But I have some sympathy because the provision is out of date and needs looking at again.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000135"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0902042000363"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This group of amendments is significant and I was interested to hear what both noble Lords said. The amendments address what we have come to call the Widdicombe rules. Amendment 156 removes the link between salary and the designation of a local authority post as politically restricted. Essentially, the holder of that post is barred from taking part in certain political activities.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000136"></a>The Widdicombe rules were introduced in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Their purpose is to preserve the visible political impartiality of senior local authority employees. This is a policy that we support, but as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, time has moved on and we fully acknowledge that change is required to the link between salary and political restrictions, so I am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment. Indeed, our 2008 White Paper <I>Communities in </I><I>C</I><I>ontrol: </I><I>R</I><I>eal </I><I>P</I><I>eople, </I><I>R</I><I>eal </I><I>P</I><I>ower</I> explained our intention of amending the rule about local authority workers above a certain salary band being barred from being politically active. It means that only the most senior council officers or those considered to be in politically sensitive posts continue to be barred. The noble Lord is right: one should look at the role rather than the salary levels.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000137"></a>The Government are considering a more general review of the Widdicombe rules. We want that to form part of a draft Bill to be published in the spring. Because it raises a large number of contextual issues, that is the better way forward. I hope that noble Lords will bear with us on that. We are taking this matter very seriously. The fact that it is in the White Paper makes that clear and I am pleased to find that there is cross-party support for this particular proposal.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000138"></a>Amendments 157 and 158 are slightly more complex in the sense that they address the relationship between being a local authority officer and a local authority member. I am sure that the Committee will agree that trust in those elected to office is one of the cornerstones of a healthy democracy. As citizens, we need to know that local authorities are working on our behalf in an appropriate matter. That is why those sorts of expectations have been enshrined in codes of conduct and in legislation which has been on the statute book for a very long time. There are, for instance, rules to ensure that local authority members can be sure that the advice they receive from the officers of the authority is unbiased and that officers are protected from a conflict of interest. I am concerned about proceeding with insufficient caution before we dispense with legislation which has worked for more than 30 years.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000139"></a>These changes proposed to the statutory provisions are substantial, and it is important that we take the time and the opportunity to consult local government, stakeholders and the public because of the potential to damage confidence. There may well be merit in the changes but they are significant and we need to approach them seriously and with consultation.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000140"></a>I turn to Amendment 157. It is clear that some local authority employees are prevented from standing for election to any local authority because they occupy politically restricted posts. The amendment is concerned with local authority employees who are not subject to such restrictions but who wish to be elected as members  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC184"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the authority by which they are employed. At the moment, if a local authority official wished to stand for election as a councillor, he or she would be expected to resign his or her post, and Amendment 157 would remove that expectation.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000141"></a>The amendment poses a valid question about the expectations that we place on local authority officials, but this is a complicated issue. I say that in the knowledge that we are keen to encourage more people to become councillors, but we must also recognise that the rights of individual employees have to be balanced against the requirements of political democracy.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000142"></a>I am afraid that making it acceptable for serving officials to stand for election may well, or may well be seen to, create problems because there is the possibility of a perceived conflict of interest. It would not be unreasonable, for example, for a councillor to question how a person might serve the elected members properly while seeking to take one of their seats. In addition, there is the important question of the impact on confidence in local democracy and confidence in elected representatives. For example, if officials stand for election, that opens them up to allegations of having access to information that other candidates do not have access to, and that might be perceived to be unfair.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000143"></a>Amendment 158 seeks to reduce from 12 to three months the period of time that must elapse between a local authority member leaving office and taking up paid employment as a local authority officer, although a 12-month period is retained in relation to appointment to a politically restricted post or where the member has been involved in the appointment of a politically restricted post.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000144"></a>We agree that there needs to be a period between leaving office and taking up employment as a local authority officer, as such a measure gives confidence to both voters and members that the appointment is made on merit, which is very important, and not as a direct result of any influence that the member may have exerted when in office. What we do not have is an objective basis for determining what that period should be. Over the years, the 12-month period has been seen to be robust and, unless there is compelling evidence that it is proving a serious obstacle or difficulty for those seeking employment as a local authority officer, I am not persuaded of the need to change it.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000145"></a>I hope that, with the assurances that I have given, particularly in respect of the substantive amendment concerning breaking the link between salary and the ability to stand for political office, noble Lords are reassured that we are indeed on the same side.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000146"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0902042000364"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield.

I would not like to be thought to be dismissing the points she made because it is important to get any change in something that has been in place for so long. In parenthesis, that is a change for us too as the Bill seems to seek to change things that happened only five minutes ago.

They take us to the chapter on the audit of entities connected with local authorities. My amendments, which I am happy to have grouped together, are relatively minor and of a probing nature. I would not seek to challenge the clauses in principle for a number of reasons, one of which is that they are the legislative encapsulation of recommendations made by the committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Sharman and I am sure that he got it right.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000150"></a>Amendments 158A and 158B relate to Clause 32. Subsection (6) provides that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0902042000271"></a>&#147;Before making an appointment under this section in relation to an entity the appointing audit authority must consult the entity&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000205"></a>My amendments provide for that to extend to the appointment of a replacement auditor under Clause 33 and provide for consultation with the local authority.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000151"></a>Amendment 159ZA takes us to the access to information provision in Clause 41. It may look as if I am taking up the cause of wrong-doers, but I am not. It probes the penalty for an offence that may be a lump-sum fine and an additional fine levied on a daily basis for each day on which the offence continues after the offender has been convicted. It is not perfectly drafted&#151;I would be the first to hold my hand up to  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC186"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that&#151;but it does raise issues about the propriety of levying a fine. Given that in this country one is not guilty until found guilty, can there be a prospective conviction?</p>

<a name="90203-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000152"></a>Under Clause 41(9), the offence is failing to comply with an auditor&#146;s requirement, obstructing the exercise of a power conferred on the auditor. That is not necessarily a black and white situation. The offender, as it were, may be guilty of an offence up to a given point but feel that he could quite reasonably argue that after that point he had a good reason for saying no to an auditor that would not amount to obstruction under subsection (9). Obstruction is quite subjective, I suggest; it is not neatly defined. It is not even clear to me that the obstruction that could give rise to a daily fine would necessarily be the same thing as amounting to an obstruction.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000153"></a>Amendment 159ZB is to Clause 42. Clause 42(4) says that certain things may be decided at a meeting. My amendment would change that to &#147;following&#148; a meeting, simply because, as I understand it, the entity that would have to decide would normally mean the board and the meeting that is the subject of this clause would be one of shareholders. They are not actually the same group of people.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000154"></a>Amendment 159ZC would remove from Clause 44(8) the provision that a Secretary of State must consider it &#147;desirable or necessary&#148; before making regulations. Does any Secretary of State make regulations which he or she thinks may not be desirable or necessary? I do hope not. The same position applies to Welsh Ministers in Clause 44(10).</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000155"></a>Finally, Amendment 159ZE is to Clause 47, which deals with the making of regulations. I propose that before the regulations are made the Secretary of State or the Welsh Ministers must consult, as I have set out in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000156"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0902042000367"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I have one amendment in this group on a small but none the less important point. The amendment would simply put in the Bill the requirement to publish any public interest reports made under Clause 39. Subsection (1) says that a report should be made about a &#147;relevant matter&#148; if,</p>
<ul><a name="0902042000310"></a>&#147;it would be in the public interest to bring to the attention of the entity, the local authority with which it is connected or the public&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902042000206"></a>That provision seems to get close to what I suggest but it is not explicit. There is no requirement to bring a matter to the attention of a local authority and the public.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000157"></a>I see no reason why a report that is in the public interest should not be made available to the public to read. No doubt any such information would be made available under the Freedom of Information Act, but there is no justification for making it necessary for someone to have to consider taking that route. I hope that the Government agree that this is a very minor and uncontroversial measure and that it can be accepted.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000158"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0902042000368"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, rightly said, this chapter of the Bill enables the recommendations of the noble Lord, Lord  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC187"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Sharman, as set out in his independent report of 2001 on local government audit, to be implemented. This is to provide a public sector-style audit for local authority-controlled entities in the way that there is already a public sector-style audit for central government-controlled entities. Parliament long ago approved an independent external audit for local authorities; that is why there is scope for external audit in the private sector in order to reflect the special accountabilities attached to public funds. Entities controlled by local authorities effectively carry out public functions and spend public money.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000159"></a>The Bill will ensure that in future qualifying entities will continue to have a Companies Act audit but, where the auditor considers it necessary, the auditor will also have the power to conduct a broader audit of the entity&#146;s activities, based on the principles of public audit as recommended by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and report in the public interest.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000160"></a>Amendments 158A and 158B concern whether the audit authority, before appointing an auditor or a replacement auditor to an entity connected with a local authority, should consult not only the entity but also the local authority. These amendments seem unnecessary because where the entity is connected to a local authority, the authority can be expected to be represented on the board of the entity. A duty to consult would impose a burden on auditors and would involve cost. We need to be sure that there would be sufficient benefit. Having two separate consultations could be confusing. I agree that the views of the local authority should be known, and I am confident that they can be obtained through consultation with the entity.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000161"></a>Amendment 159ZA arises from concerns about the nature of the continuing offence where the provision is creating a prospective conviction. I can see the logic of the noble Baroness&#146;s argument, but I think her proposed system would not work. At the point of the initial conviction, no one will know how long the offence will continue for or whether there will be any reasonable excuse for any obstruction. Under the Bill&#146;s provisions, there would be no prospective conviction as it would be for the court to decide whether the person had continued to obstruct and what the appropriate level of fine should be, up to a maximum of &#163;20 a day. There are identical wording and equivalent provisions in the Audit Commission Act 1998 and the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004. I hope that reassures the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000162"></a>Amendment 159ZB addresses the issue of who in the entity considers the public interest report and takes the decision on whether the report requires the entity to act. The effect of the amendment would be that the decision would be made by the directors after the meeting exercising their general powers of management. The amendment would also have the unfortunate effect of delaying the entity&#146;s decision in relation to the report. Our view is that the decision should be made by the shareholders, not the board, not least because the report might be critical of the board itself. Shareholders should be an integral part of the process for deciding how the entity responds to the public interest report, just as they are in signing off the entity&#146;s statutory audit report. The provisions provide for this.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC188"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000163"></a>Amendments 159ZC and 159ZD exclude the requirements for the regulations to be &#147;desirable or necessary&#148; before making regulations prescribing a scale of fees. The noble Baroness makes a valid point in that regulations should be made only if they are desirable or necessary. However, the expectation is that the relevant audit authority will set the scale of fees. The drafting of the provisions sets out the expectation that the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers will act if necessary or desirable; that is, if there is an exceptional reason to act. Again, if it reassures the Committee, the drafting also provides consistency with existing provisions in the Audit Commission Act 1998 and the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000164"></a>Amendment 159ZE inserts the requirement that before making regulations defining qualifying entities the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers must consult relevant entities connected with the local authority in England and Wales respectively. I can assure the Committee that we have every intention of consulting on the content of proposed regulations. However, having a statutory obligation can lead to technical objections that the consultation is flawed in some way. This could be particularly the case here as we could never be sure that we had consulted all relevant entities before making the regulations. That is something we wish to avoid.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000165"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, tabled Amendment 159, which places a duty on the auditor to make the public interest report available to the public. I hope I can reassure the noble Baroness in my response. The duty to make the report public lies with the local authority as part of its deliberations at an open meeting of the council. Making information public through for the council meeting arrangements allows the public interest report to be made public alongside the entity&#146;s decisions and any proposed action. A copy of the report also goes to the relevant audit authority. The normal practice of these authorities is to make reports available on their websites and therefore accessible to everyone.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000166"></a>In conclusion, we believe that the provision achieves greater transparency and accountability to citizens and communities for how money is spent by local authority entities. It will strengthen public accountability over what are essentially public funds and public liabilities and obligations that may arise for local authorities. It will also place local authority entities within an appropriate public audit regime alongside local government bodies. In the current financial climate, that must be the right approach. I hope that noble Lords will feel able to withdraw their amendments in view of this explanation and my undertaking that we will consult on the proposed regulations.</p>

I am not sure that it will take us a great deal further if I try to answer each point, so I shall not. However, I hope that it is acknowledged that I am not seeking to exclude the Secretary of State from considering whether something is desirable or necessary. I do not think that I have ever come across a refusal to provide for consultation in a Bill because the consultation might be flawed. In this situation, I can understand the Government&#146;s caution. I suppose that I have at least

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000169"></a>The first of the amendments probes why Clause 49 prohibits the new Boundary Committee for England borrowing money,</p>
<ul><a name="0902042000311"></a>&#147;which is calculated to facilitate, or is incidental or conducive to, the exercise of its functions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0902042000207"></a>I have no doubt that the Minister will tell me why it should not be able to borrow money. Is it related to sensitivity about public sector borrowing?As a practical matter, the Boundary Committee can run itself, so it might want to borrow to acquire premises, for example. I then that there may be an issue about what borrowing means. Does incurring credit fall within the restriction? That would obviously be a real problem.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000170"></a>My other amendments are to Schedule 1. Amendments 159BA, 159PA and 159PB provide for the Speaker&#146;s Committee to oversee all appointments to the Boundary Committee as it does the appointment of electoral commissioners. The amendments were suggested to me by the Electoral Commission. The Minister will be aware of that and will want to take  the opportunity to explain all the thinking behind the design of this schedule. Amendment 159WA provides that a chair who is removed from that office or decides to give it up would remain a member of the committee. It is designed to clarify whether that would be the case.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000171"></a>Amendment 159ZZ relates to the clause on delegation. The schedule provides that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0902042000273"></a>&#147;The Boundary Committee ... may delegate any of its functions to any of its members, employees, committees or sub-committees&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000208"></a>I am not convinced that the functions under these clauses are appropriate for delegation to an individual, although they may be appropriate for delegation  to a sub-committee. The Government have tabled Amendment 160C and they will no doubt explain their slightly tweaked thinking on delegation. I hope that I have covered all my amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000172"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0902042000372"></a>Baroness Warsi:</b> I have one amendment in this group which I think is now redundant. I tabled Amendment 160 as a response to the DPRRC recommendation that the Boundary Committee should not be able to delegate its functions, including making electoral change orders. I have now been trumped by the Government&#146;s amendments, so I do not intend to press it.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000173"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0902042000373"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> Before turning to the amendments, I hope that the Committee will find it useful if I provide a brief explanation about why we are introducing the provisions in Part 3 of the Bill. In February 2006, the Committee on Standards in Public Life began a review of the Electoral Commission to ascertain whether its current mandate, governance arrangements and accountability framework remained appropriate. The review took place as a result of the Speaker&#146;s Committee&#146;s request for the equivalent of a financial management and policy review, which usually takes place every five years for non-departmental public bodies. The standards committee&#146;s Eleventh report, <I>R</I><I>eview of the </I><I>E</I><I>lectoral </I><I>C</I><I>ommission</I>, published in January 2007, made 47 recommendations. They were made in the context of the key finding that the Electoral Commission had not successfully performed its core duties as a regulator to ensure integrity and public confidence in the electoral process and in the framework that governs political party funding and campaign expenditure. The standards committee therefore determined that the Electoral Commission should no longer be responsible for functions that may distract it from its core tasks.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000174"></a>There are two recommendations in relation to Part 3. Recommendation 17 is that the Electoral Commission should no longer have any involvement in electoral boundary matters and that the provision in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to allow the transfer of boundary-setting functions in England, Scotland and Wales to the commission should be  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC191"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>repealed. Recommendation 18 is that the Boundary Committee for England should become an independent body in line with local government boundary commissions in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000175"></a>We have sought to base the provisions establishing the new Boundary Committee on the administrative arrangements in place in the Electoral Commission. Most importantly, we have provided for the Boundary Committee to be established as an independent body accountable to Parliament rather than to a government body. Furthermore, the process for the Boundary Committee to make orders that implement new local government electoral arrangements to wards and electoral divisions will continue to be independent of government, but will, in future, be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I hope that the general overview I have given about why we are taking the Boundary Committee out of the Electoral Commission has been useful.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000176"></a>I now turn to the amendments. Amendment 159ZEF was tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and amends Clause 49(4), which prevents the Boundary Committee borrowing money. I assure the noble Baroness that that is not being done simply for cosmetic reasons. As I have indicated, when establishing the Boundary Committee, we have sought, where possible, to follow the arrangements in place for the Electoral Commission. We have therefore replicated the provision in paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which prevents the Electoral Commission borrowing money. As a general principle, it is right that bodies that are directly accountable to Parliament for their funding should not be able to borrow money. Paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 to the Bill sets out that the funding of the Boundary Committee will be provided directly by Parliament from the Consolidated Fund. The Boundary Committee will present an estimate to the Speaker&#146;s Committee, which must examine it and lay it in the other place, where it will be approved. It would clearly be wrong for Parliament to consider and agree the estimate for the Boundary Committee and for the Boundary Committee then to be able to obtain additional funds through borrowing. If it requires additional funds, it must present its reasons to Parliament, which will determine whether they should be granted.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000177"></a>A number of amendments in this group address appointments to the Boundary Committee. Government Amendments 159A to 159Z and 160A and 160B clarify how the appointment process for the chair of the Boundary Committee will operate. In relation to the appointment of the chair, it has been brought to our attention that the current drafting of Schedule 1 leaves some ambiguity with regard to the role of the Secretary of State. Schedule 1(2) provides that the chair of the Boundary Committee will be appointed on an Address from another place, mirroring the existing arrangements for the appointment of Electoral Commissioners. As the current chair of the Boundary Committee is an Electoral Commissioner, we deemed it appropriate that this process should be maintained. For reasons that I will set out when responding to amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, we do not believe there would be any difficulties with the Secretary of State being responsible for the appointment  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC192"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the chair of the Boundary Committee. However, where possible, we have sought to replicate the existing arrangements.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000178"></a>The other members of the existing Boundary Committee are appointed by the Electoral Commission and, as a result of the separation, we need to identify a mechanism for their appointment. We have therefore chosen to follow the model of appointments by Her Majesty on the recommendation of the Secretary of State. The Government&#146;s amendment clarifies that there is a separation between the processes of appointing the chair and the other members of the committee. The appointment process for the chair will be by open competition and will not be restricted to the current membership of the Boundary Committee. The amendment is therefore necessary to make it clear that the process of appointment of the chair by Her Majesty following an Address is the only process required to make the chair a member of the Boundary Committee.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000179"></a>In response to the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in relation to the appointment of the other members of the Boundary Committee, I am aware that concerns have been raised by the Electoral Commission about the role of the Secretary of State. As we are removing the Electoral Commission&#146;s role, we need to find a process for the appointment of the other members of the new Boundary Committee. We agree that it is essential that appointments to the new Boundary Committee are, and are perceived to be, politically impartial, independent and unambiguously made on merit. We believe that the appointment process for members of the Boundary Committee is at least as likely to deliver these aims as a process involving votes in another place. The appointments process will be undertaken, as is always the case, in accordance with the guidance of the public appointments commissioner, who will maintain oversight and audit of the process.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000180"></a>The process that we are introducing will ensure not only that impartiality and independence are maintained but also that knowledge of the local government sector can be brought into the appointments process. In these circumstances, the Secretary of State would make recommendations for appointment on the basis of recommendations from the panel of officials, including an independent person, following a process of advertisement and executive search. We have therefore provided for the Secretary of State to be responsible for the appointment of members in the same way that she is for the appointment of various other public bodies, including the Audit Commission and the Standards Board for England.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000181"></a>Government Ministers are also responsible for appointing members to bodies that are responsible for electoral arrangements. They are responsible for appointments to the parliamentary boundary commissions across the UK, and Scottish and Welsh Ministers appoint members of the local government boundary commissions in those areas. I am sure the Committee will agree that all these bodies operate in a thoroughly independent manner. We have ensured that the Secretary of State has no role in the determination of the Boundary Committee&#146;s work plans and budgets and, most importantly, no role in decisions on local authority electoral arrangements, nor the making of electoral orders.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000182"></a>Paragraph 2(6) of Schedule 1 provides for the chair to request to be relieved of that office. This addresses Amendment 159WA in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Paragraphs 2(7) and 2(8) provide for the chair to be removed for a number of reasons, including failure to discharge the functions of the office or being convicted of a criminal offence. The effect of the amendment would be that in those circumstances the chair would become an ordinary member of the committee. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for an individual who had been removed from the office of chair to become a member of the committee.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000183"></a>Although there may be circumstances where the chair requests to be relieved of the office but wishes to continue as a member, we do not agree that such provision should be made. If we were to provide for the chair to become a member when he had been relieved at his own request, it would have the effect of artificially increasing the membership of the Boundary Committee by one member. I do not believe that this would be a justifiable use of public funds. Of course, it would be open to any individual concerned to apply for any vacancy on the committee if and when such a vacancy arose.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000184"></a>The second matter addressed by the government amendments in this group responds to the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Government Amendments 159AA to 160C have broadly the same purpose as the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi. However, we have sought to ensure that the principle of restricting the delegation of the Boundary Committee&#146;s order-making power is applied to all such powers.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000185"></a>We agree with the DPRRC that the committee&#146;s function of making electoral change orders under Clause 53 is a power that should be exercised by the full committee and that it would be inappropriate for it to be delegated. We believe that the restriction should also cover all the Boundary Committee&#146;s order-making powers, as well as any powers exercised during the transitional period before the establishment of the new Boundary Committee for England, as set out in Schedule 3.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000186"></a>As we are all seeking to achieve the same goal, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment. I thank the Committee for its patience. I hope that I have convinced noble Lords that their amendments should not be pressed, and that they agree that the government amendments clarify and strengthen the drafting of the Bill. I commend them to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="0902042000187"></a><b><a name="90203-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0902042000374"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I am grateful for that detailed response. On appointments, a Speaker&#146;s Committee has a status which is perhaps not recognised simply by talking about an appointment being an appointment by Parliament. The noble Lord suggested, rightly, that there are quite polarised political positions within the House of Commons. However, I have sought to take the politics out, not add them in.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000190"></a>The first three amendments address the criteria for selecting the number of councillors. The schedule provides for the need to secure that the ratio of electors to the number of members is as nearly as possible the same in every electoral area of the different councils the subject of the schedule. My amendment would change the word &#147;possible&#148; to &#147;practicable&#148;, subject to the next paragraph.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000191"></a>That is because that paragraph rightly recognises the need to reflect the identities and interests of local communities, of fixing boundaries which are easily identifiable and of not breaking local ties when fixing boundaries. Those are very important points. In representing one&#146;s electors one thinks about representing a community, not a community with an artificial boundary down the middle of it because that makes the numbers neat. I am not suggesting that absolutely a community must be kept as a distinct entity&#151;apart from anything else there would be arguments as to where the boundary of a community is&#151;but the term &#147;possible&#148; reduces too much the criteria set out in paragraph (b) and I would like to see greater recognition. I dare say I am going to be told that this is provided for at the moment in whatever legislation this is replacing, but it is still important.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000192"></a>Amendment 160BD takes us to Schedule 3, which relates to the interim period and provides for a transitional arrangement. This is the subject of my objection to Clause 58 and Schedule 3. Amendment 160BD will enable me, I hope, to ask the Minister what is in the pipeline. The Electoral Commission makes the broader point that the new arrangements commencing before the new committee is established is confusing, counterproductive and inefficient. There will be no statutory relationship between the two bodies. It clearly feels that it can continue. I look forward to the Minister explanation of the Government&#146;s thinking. I beg to move.</p>

I support the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about practicability rather than trying to keep communities together. We have tabled our amendment because one increasingly sees the suggestion of two-member wards in county government. County government, which covers quite a large area, is being related back to communities. It is referred to in the guidance. I am concerned at there being more encouragement from government for two-member wards. I agree that one chooses wards for the type of authority and the community, but we would not like to see too many more two-member wards in county government.</p>

I shall first address the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in relation to the statutory criteria set out in Schedule 2. Schedule 2 sets out the criteria that the boundary committee must have regard to when conducting electoral reviews under Clause 50. It is important to make it clear that the schedule simply re-enacts and consolidates existing criteria in Section 13(5)  


<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC197"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column GC197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the Local Government Act 1992 and Schedule 11 to the Local Government Act 1972. The schedule incorporates a number of drafting changes, but the criteria remain unchanged. The statutory criteria in Schedule 2 are balanced so that one criterion does not take precedence over another. While we sympathise with the noble Baroness&#146;s comments about the importance of community identity in setting electoral arrangements, changing the balance of the statutory criteria should be approached with considerable caution.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000195"></a>We of course agree that considerable importance must be attached to the effective engagement of neighbourhoods, communities and individuals in the provision of local services. However, the wide variety of local circumstances suggests that any criteria need to be broad to allow the new Boundary Committee the flexibility to deliver electoral arrangements that reflect community identity, provide for fair elections and support effective local government and service delivery. The Government therefore believe that we should avoid prescribing a hierarchy of criteria that might rigidly be applied in all circumstances. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendments to Schedule 2.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000196"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has given notice of his intention to oppose the inclusion of Clause 51 in the Bill. In addition, the noble Lord, Lord Tope, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, have given notice of their intention to oppose the inclusion of Clause 58 and to amend the related Schedule 3. I hope that I can briefly explain why Clauses 51 and 58 and the Schedule 3 provisions should be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000197"></a>The Bill re-enacts provisions recently enacted under Section 55 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, which inserted two new sections, 14A and 14B, into the Local Government Act 1992. I hope that that I can quickly allay the noble Lord&#146;s fear that there is anything new in Clause 51 and explain that it simply re-enacts the provisions introduced by the 2007 Act with some modifications to provide for the Boundary Committee for England to take over the Electoral Commission&#146;s current function.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000198"></a>I would now like to address concerns about Clause 58 and Schedule 3. Clause 58 and Schedule 3 make transitional provision for the existing Boundary Committee to exercise its functions in relation to electoral boundary work without the involvement of the Electoral Commission prior to the establishment of the new Boundary Committee for England. Clause 58 and Schedule 3 will come into force immediately on Royal Assent. If Parliament agrees to the implementation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#146;s recommendation to remove the role of the Electoral Commission from electoral boundary work, we believe that the Electoral Commission&#146;s role should cease at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000199"></a>Schedule 3 therefore modifies the Local Government Act 1992 to provide for an interim period starting on the day on which the Act is passed and ending with the establishment of the new Boundary Committee for England, which we expect to be on 1 April 2010. It has been suggested by the Electoral Commission that leaving the Boundary Committee as a part of the Electoral Commission while the Electoral Commission no longer has a role in electoral review work would be

My right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government recently met with the new chair of the Electoral Commission and the chair of the Boundary Committee to discuss these arrangements. We have asked the Electoral Commission to provide information on any particular difficulties that it envisages and the level of work that is expected during this period. In our view, the sooner that the Electoral Commission is able to concentrate fully on its core functions in relation to party political finance and electoral administration&#151;the key recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#151;the better.</p>

<a name="90203-gc0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0902042000200"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said that he feared an increase in two-member divisions. The provision would enable any local authority to request single-member divisions. Indeed, West Sussex County Council, which had two-member divisions, requested such a review, which is ongoing. I hope that I have reassured noble Lords. Unless further evidence can be provided by the Electoral Commission of any particular problems that our approach will cause, I hope that noble Lords will agree that Clause 58 and Schedule 3 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="09020317000032"></a>Criminal Justice: Women</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09020317000003"></a><b><a name="90203-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09020317000027"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Maria Eagle) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09020317000004"></a>I am today updating Parliament on further progress made in implementing the Government&#146;s response to the Corston report on women with particular vulnerabilities in the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09020317000005"></a>In my Statement to this House in December (<I>Official Report</I>, 10 December 2008, col. 59WS) I confirmed that while significant progress had been made since the Government&#146;s response was published in December 2007, we remain determined to do much more to divert vulnerable women, who are not serious or dangerous offenders, from custody.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09020317000006"></a>I am therefore pleased to announce that the Ministry of Justice will provide &#163;15.6 million of new funding over two years to invest in the provision of additional services in the community for women offenders and women at risk of offending. The new funds will be directed towards building capacity of specialist provision for women in the community and developing bail support services. We propose that some of the funding will be used to invest in existing third sector providers, enabling them to work with courts, police, probation and other statutory agencies to provide support and services to vulnerable women in the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09020317000007"></a>I have asked the cross-departmental Criminal Justice Women&#146;s Strategy Unit to lead on this new phase of capacity building and to report progress to the Ministerial Sub-Group on Implementation of the Government&#146;s response to Corston.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09020317000008"></a>If we are to successfully protect the public from crime then we also need to tackle the underlying causes of crime and break cycles of disadvantage. My announcement today reaffirms the Government&#146;s commitment to do more to ensure that there is early and effective provision for vulnerable women in the community and our continued commitment to the wider Corston agenda.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="09020317000009"></a><b><a name="90203-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09020317000028"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions and Ageing Society (Rosie Winterton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09020317000010"></a>On 22 May 2008 the Minister for Pensions Reform announced that John Elbourne had been asked to examine the current arrangements for the engagement of older people and the ability of those arrangements to inform policy and actions of government at all levels. Specifically, this was to include examining Better Government for Older People.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS46"></a><b>3 Feb 2009 : Column WS46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09020317000011"></a>John Elbourne published his report on 18 November 2008 and the Government received comments up to 9 January 2009. The report made a range of recommendations for improving older people&#146;s engagement with government, which fell into three broad areas: establishing a UK advisory forum for older people, building the capacity for effective dialogue at regional and local level through regional forums and local older peoples forums, and withdrawing funding for Better Government for Older People from 1 April 2009 to support the new government office arrangements and thereby increasing the funds available for on-the-ground activities.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09020317000012"></a>The Government are today publishing their response to this report. The Government will establish a new UK-wide forum. The forum will be known as the UK Advisory Forum on Ageing, and will be co-chaired by the Minister for Pensions and the Ageing Society, and the Minister of State for Care Services. This will bring together representative views of older people at a national level, and will build links with forums in the devolved nations, the English regions, and the local level. The Government will set up a new structure with a designated regional co-ordinator for older people&#146;s engagement in each English region, providing advocacy and co-ordination for older people and working with older people to set up regional forums on ageing and local forums where they do not already exist. This will build on existing arrangements for engagement with older people and address weaknesses in the current structure. These new arrangements will give older people a direct line into government at a local, regional and national level.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09020317000013"></a>Better Government for Older People&#146;s response to John Elbourne&#146;s review has been to develop a proposal for a new independent body to carry forward its aims. The Department for Work and Pensions will support it in making a smooth transition into this new phase.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09020317000014"></a>The Government&#146;s response can be found at <a href="http://www">www</a>. dwp.gov.uk/resourcecentre/ind_review_older_peoples _eng_with_govt.asp and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09020317000022"></a>I am pleased to announce that the UK will sign the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as soon as practicable.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09020317000023"></a>The convention will reaffirm that disabled people have&#151;and should be able to enjoy&#151;their human rights on an equal basis with non-disabled people. The optional protocol builds on this by establishing two additional procedures in respect of implementation and monitoring of the convention itself. </p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09020317000024"></a>The first is a procedural avenue that, subject to meeting conditions set out in the optional protocol, will enable individuals or groups of individuals to bring petitions to the UN committee that has been established to monitor implementation of the convention if they believe that their convention rights have been breached. The second is an inquiry procedure giving the committee authority to undertake inquiries, when reliable information is received, into allegations of grave or systematic violations of convention rights.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09020317000025"></a>This is an important decision which further demonstrates the Government&#146;s firm commitment to the convention, on which our work towards ratification is continuing, and to the principle of ensuring equality of human rights for disabled people.</p>

<a name="90203-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09020317000026"></a>The decision to sign this optional protocol does not set a precedent for similar individual complaints mechanisms. These will continue to be considered on their merits on a case-by-case basis.</p>

All spares holdings are subject to formal processes to ensure they can be accounted for at all times.

The optimum numbers and locations for spares holdings vary with the nature of operations and are therefore subject to change.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_21"></a><a name="09020352000040"></a>My department published <I>Improving the Effectiveness of Rent Arrears Management: Good Practice Guidance </I>in June 2005. It is aimed at all social landlords and  all levels of a<I></I>landlord's rent arrears management service. This guidance is also available on the  Communities and Local Government website at <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/improvingeffectiveness">www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/improvingeffectiveness</a>.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_22"></a><a name="09020352000041"></a>On rent arrears, the guidance makes no explicit reference to debit or credit cards. It stresses the value of preventative measures. It advises landlords, among other things, to ensure that arrears repayment arrangements are realistic by undertaking with the tenant a detailed financial assessment of his or her income and expenditure.</p>

<a name="90203w0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_23"></a><a name="09020352000042"></a>On rent payment, the guidance advises that landlords should provide a diverse range of methods for tenants to pay their rent. These should be well-publicised, flexible, accessible and convenient to use. Whilst credit and debit cards are included in the range of possible payment methods mentioned, the guidance states that any review of payment methods should consider their effectiveness in minimising arrears.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a><a name="09020352000043"></a>The Tenant Services Authority (which succeeded the Housing Corporation as the regulator of social housing on 1 December 2008) is aware that the use of credit and debit cards to pay rent and rent arrears has raised concerns. The Tenant Services Authority supports flexible approaches to the payment of rent and other charges. For many tenants, for example those who may find travelling difficult, being able to use direct debits or online banking provides convenience and security. The Tenant Services Authority also recognises that it may not be cost-effective for landlords to handle relatively small amounts of cash. It has not issued any guidance to housing associations on this, as it is for each individual association to decide its own approach to managing rent payment.</p>

<a name="90203w0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_30"></a><a name="09020352000064"></a>Some of the chemicals contained in products such as fabric softeners, washing powders and disinfectants may reach soils via the application of sewage sludge to land. Our previous research into the risks from sewage sludge application to land did not highlight significant issues arising from organic chemicals from these sources.</p>

<a name="90203w0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_31"></a><a name="09020352000065"></a>In April 2008, Defra consulted on controls on phosphates in domestic laundry cleaning products, as there is evidence that phosphate pollution in freshwaters causes eutrophication which can lead to death of fish and other organisms. Following the consultation, a working group of key stakeholders was set up to provide evidence for a full impact assessment. An announcement on the way forward will be made shortly.</p>

<a name="90203w0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_32"></a><a name="09020352000066"></a>The consultation considered washing powders, but did not consider fabric softeners and disinfectants, as they do not contain significant amounts of phosphate and there is insufficient evidence to suggest that they cause significant pollution of watercourses.</p>

Already, around two-thirds of doctors in training already work 48 hours a week or less. Based on estimates from the NHS we expect that by August this will have risen to around 96 per cent. The department and the NHS remain committed to implementing the EWTD for trainee doctors.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_37"></a><a name="09020352000078"></a>For a very small number of specific services at local level, implementation is extremely difficult. This could, for example, be due to service reconfigurations, or to service isolation. In this small number of cases, the department will apply to the European Commission for derogation, which will allow this small number of local services an extra four hours in addition to the minimum 48. This element of flexibility represents good NHS management.</p>
