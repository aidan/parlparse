But the families are still without a right of representation.

He will know that legal aid for representation&#151;that is one of the issues, as is representation in general&#151;is not considered appropriate in many inquests because an inquest is a fact-finding process; it is not an adversarial conflict between different parties.

Currently, 98 per cent of all coroners&#146; inquests are held with a coroner sitting without a jury, but I am sure that where juries do sit we can rely on the overall leadership of the coroner.

There has been a big improvement in the progress of those inquests. I think the noble and gallant Lord is suggesting the creation of specialist military coroners. We are not persuaded that that is a route down which we should go. We believe that all coroners ought to be able to deal with all inquests. Our understanding is that coroners around the country have been handling these inquests effectively and quickly. The development of a national service with a chief coroner will enable there to be much greater consistency and professional leadership in the future.</p>

Is that not grossly unfair and a betrayal of the military covenant? Will the Government cease to hide behind the arrangements for coroners&#146; courts in the case of those who have been killed in action and allow relatives to have legal aid at public expense when attending an inquest into the death of a loved one?</p>

I have already said that legal aid is generally not available because an inquest should be seen as a fact-finding process. As for MoD representation, that is often because a coroner feels that it can assist the inquest in the finding of facts. There are provisions for allowing legal aid to be provided in exceptional circumstances for inquests in cases such as the noble and gallant Lord described. Legal aid funding has been given to a number of families of soldiers or Armed Forces personnel who have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, so I think that we have a proportionate system.</p>

It is important for the credibility of those that do send observers that they ensure that Zimbabwe&#146;s election meets the SADC principles and guidelines.</p>

Are not the elections which will happen in the next few days regarded as particularly important because they are taking place under the auspices of President Mbeki of South Africa and at the instance of SADC? Was not one of the successes of those negotiations an agreement that the police would not be present in the polling stations while voting was taking place? However, is it not also true that President Mugabe has recently revoked that decision without consulting anybody as far as I know, certainly not consulting even his own Government? Does that not mean that the elections will take place without adhering to the SADC rules for elections, which are pretty good? Is the Minister aware of any complaint which has been made by a SADC member country or even by the secretary-general of SADC?</p>

The changes that he sought to secure in the election processes of Zimbabwe have been honoured more in the breach than the observance. Many of them, while put on to the statute book, have not been fully implemented by the Government and the fact is that the fundamentals of the SADC principles are not met. More than 3 million to 4 million people remain outside the country which&#151;as there are only 5.9 million registered voters for the election&#151;means that at least one-third of the country is disfranchised. I could continue with the list. It is a very sorry situation.</p>

We have to look at every possible eventuality. We very much hope that there will not be the violence that followed the elections in Kenya. We very much hope that the Government of Zimbabwe will allow free and fair elections and then accept the result. But if that does not happen and there is indeed violence and displacement, we have plans in place. It will not surprise the noble Lord if I say that it would be imprudent of me to go beyond that at this stage.</p>

However, does she share with me a profound disappointment that the housebuilders have rejected the proposal in the strategy that by 2013 they should adopt the full lifetime homes standards of accessibility and adaptability for new homes? In view of the obduracy of the housebuilders, would she consider bringing forward changes to the building regulations so that, from now on, all new homes can enjoy the much higher and better standards of accessibility and adaptability that are prescribed within this excellent strategy?</p>

This is the world&#146;s first strategy on housing and ageing and we have had global responses to it. We need such a strategy because one in five children born today is likely to live to 100. Therefore, we have to match our housing policies with our policies on ageing. I was disappointed with the reaction of the Home Builders Federation. I understand that the task is challenging but, on the other hand, there is a huge market for adaptable and flexible homes for older people. We consulted the federation informally and formally. I hear what the noble Lord says, but we think that the best way forward is for us to work with housebuilders by providing advice and support in the next two years to help them to adopt the standards voluntarily, after which we will review the situation, with a view to regulation.</p>

Some of the poorest conditions and poorest people are to be found in the private rented sector. That is why we have commissioned Julie Rugg to have a thorough look at the whole issue of tenure and conditions in the sector. As we said in the report&#151;and this is part of our health and social care strategy&#151;we have put &#163;33 million more into handyperson and handy van services, so that they can visit and repair the stairs, for example.

Hence, we start with a national advice and information service, which makes it easy for them to make the right choice at the right time and not be forced into making the wrong choice. Housing information, alongside a much expanded service for repair and adaptations, will make the difference, but if older people had better, more adaptable homes to go to, they would be more likely to move out of larger, inappropriate housing.

Guide Dogs research has demonstrated that shared surfaces affect the safety, confidence and independence of blind and partially sighted people. In some towns, no-go areas have been created. In promoting lifetime neighbourhoods, will the Government make a clear statement that shared surfaces discriminate against blind and partially sighted and other disabled people, effectively excluding them from the street environment, and that clearly defined pedestrian-only paths&#151;a safe space&#151;must be provided for safer and independent travel?</p>

We now have a new President in Cyprus with a new and fresh mandate, who is committed to negotiations. Equally, in the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr Talat, we have someone committed since he came to office to finding an agreement.

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="08032768000073"></a>The noble and right reverend Lord said: My Lords, GK Chesterton once remarked that the English working man was less interested in the equality of human beings than he was in the inequality of racehorses. There is still some truth in that. However, what is very deeply rooted in most English people is a strong sense of fairness. The English may not reveal much outward observance of religion, but there is a deeply felt inner conviction that some things are fair and others are grossly unfair. In proposing this debate, I do not primarily have in mind a discussion of equality as such, fascinating though that would be, but the stark inequalities in our society, which the majority of our fellow citizens now regard as unacceptably unfair.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08032768000074"></a>I say &#147;inequalities&#148; but we are all aware that the situation is one of growing inequalities&#151;widening financial and economic inequalities, which are reflected in every area of life. Recently there have been a number of reports which bear on this subject, which have been helpfully summarised in the briefing note provided by the House of Lords Librarians. Although the situation is complex, what emerges from the reports of the Institute for Fiscal Studies in both 2000 and 2008 is that for the poorest 15 per cent of the population, income growth has been very much lower, with real income falls in the very lowest part, while for the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population, there has been rapid economic growth, with what they term a &#147;spike&#148; at the 99th percentile point.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08032768000075"></a>In recent years, as we know, we have become used to stories of vast City bonuses, which have, in my opinion, totally distorted the housing market, and stories of great pay-offs to directors and executives, some of whom, by any ordinary standards, have failed. There is widespread disquiet in our society about this. Three recent polls reveal that 75 or 76 per cent of the population find this totally unacceptable. We are not talking about the politics of envy, with what WB Yeats called,</p>
<ul><a name="08032768000501"></a>&#147;a levelling, rancorous, rational sort of mind&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000076"></a>We are talking about a feature of our financial system, which, if it continues unabated, could undermine both the basis of our economic prosperity itself and the fabric of our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08032768000077"></a>In the great debates about the market economy in recent years, its most thoughtful defenders have always stressed that the success of the market depends on factors other than the market itself&#151;in short, on certain moral assumptions that go wider than the legal framework on the basis of which the market in fact operates. One of those is the acceptance of what we might term proportionate reward. Appropriate reward for hard work, skill and enterprise is basic to how the market operates, but implicit in that is some kind of judgment about what is appropriate and fair and what is inappropriate and unfair. If people as a

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08032768000078"></a>What does a person on the minimum wage feel when they work long hours just to survive for year after year when groups of people get a regular windfall that is more than they can earn in several lifetimes? I believe that that undermines any sense that what they are doing is worthwhile.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08032768000079"></a>I am sure that your Lordships will fill out the facts and figures of what is happening in various areas of life, but I just mention a few. There are still 3.8 million children living in poverty&#151;one in three&#151;with even higher rates in urban areas such as Manchester and London. More than half of those children have at least one parent working. If both parents are working with at least one of them full-time, families can survive, but with only one working, the situation has not improved. The situation of children with no parents working has improved somewhat in recent years, but there were 1.4 million children of poor parents living in working households in 1997, and that number is the same today. That has not improved. The Zacchaeus 2000 Trust has drawn our attention to the stressful and inevitable rent and council tax arrears, debts, loan sharks and clashes with bailiffs created by poverty for people both in and out of work.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08032768000080"></a>What the Government have done in introducing the minimum wage has been an essential, very welcome first step towards helping with that problem. That wage is now &#163;5.52 an hour, although often paid without holiday or sick pay. A single earner in a couple with two children would now have to work  80 hours a week at the minimum wage to avoid poverty through their wages alone, without any other benefits or tax credits.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08032768000081"></a>Whatever Government we have in power should commit themselves at least to maintaining the value of the minimum wage in line with average earnings growth over the economic cycle and should extend the adult rate to 21 year-olds. But that is not enough, so I very much welcome the Living Wage for London movement. The living wage for London has been set at &#163;7.20 an hour&#151;a big difference from the national minimum wage&#151;and the unions and London citizens have been remarkably successful in persuading a significant number of employers in London to sign up to it. By December 2007, 5,800 were covered, with a total gain of nearly &#163;20 million in wages. I believe that the figure of &#163;7.20 is in fact the minimum that all London employers should be paying.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08032768000082"></a>Cleaners and hotel workers are especially liable at the moment to be treated unfairly. One hotel worker was paid the equivalent of 26p an hour for the first six days&#146; work, the first three days being regarded as training. That is only one of a number of such stories.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08032768000083"></a>As we know, the Government have committed themselves to halving child poverty by 2010. The recent Budget ensured that another significant step would be taken towards that. We need to ensure that there is no let-up on what will be needed every year until child poverty is eliminated. Again, I believe that  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_635"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 635</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whatever Government are in power, they should share that commitment to the total elimination of child poverty.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08032768000084"></a>That is action that needs to be taken at the bottom end of the financial pile: action to raise the poorest people out of poverty and enable them to participate meaningfully in the market economy. What about at the other end? Inequality has two poles to it and is indicated by the distance between them. Some suggest that we can eliminate child poverty while not bothering too much about gross inequality. However, it is no accident that the only countries to abolish child poverty&#151;the Nordic countries&#151;are much more equal than ours. There is a clear link between gross inequalities and the presence of poverty.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08032768000085"></a>The figures on inequality speak for themselves. Some 3 per cent of the country&#146;s income is taken by the poorest 10 per cent of the population; 28 per cent of the country&#146;s income is taken by the richest 10 per cent&#151;and that is only what is declared. According to the recent Budget, the official Revenue and Customs&#146; estimate is that tax avoidance has now reached  &#163;41 billion a year.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08032768000086"></a>As far as wealth is concerned, it is estimated that the share of wealth owned by the top 1 per cent rose from 17 per cent in 1991 to 24 per cent in 2002, while the wealth of the bottom 50 per cent fell from 8 per cent to 6 per cent over the same period. No less startling is the fact that, over two decades, the average earning of the chief executives of the top 100 companies has gone up from 17 times the average employee&#146;s wage to 75.5 times the average employee&#146;s wage. That is an extraordinary jump in just 20 years. Is that jump really deserved? It may be argued that in a market economy&#151;particularly one that is operating internationally&#151;there must be huge salaries and bonuses available to attract the few who allegedly make all the difference in a highly competitive world. However, as Will Hutton put it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="08032768000479"></a>&#147;The practice of giving vast annual bonuses embeds greed and recklessness&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80327-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08032768000087"></a>It is interesting that the Institute of International Finance&#151;the association of global banks&#151;met recently, in Rio de Janeiro, to discuss for the first time a voluntary code of conduct on pay. According to Polly Toynbee, it was,</p>
<ul><a name="08032768000480"></a>&#147;revolutionary and penitential, acknowledging that a cause of the credit crunch was wild risk-taking with other people&#146;s money to secure higher bonuses for themselves&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000452"></a>Suggestions include a deferral of bonuses until the impact of the strategy is clear, or even clawing back bonuses in light of later, worse performances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08032768000088"></a>The Motion before us is about financial inequality. It is not surprising that this inequality is reflected in every aspect of life&#151;housing, education, health, opportunities for advancement and so on&#151;and I take just a very few examples. One strong theme from the recent reports is how segregated the United Kingdom now is, between rich communities getting richer and pockets of deprivation. This is, of course, because economic inequalities are reflected in what economies call &#147;positional goods&#148;&#151;housing, whose costs have risen so disproportionately, access to good schooling  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_636"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 636</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and so on. Then there are the prisons. Martin Nary, who visited one prison a week for years, says quite simply:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08032768000481"></a>&#147;The proportion of prisoners who are not from impoverished backgrounds is incredibly small and investment in poverty eradication would have a direct economic benefit to the UK&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80327-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08032768000089"></a>Less familiar are the figures about low birth weight, a core signal of poverty. From 1953 to 1973 the percentage of babies born in the UK with a low birth weight was in the area of 6.6 per cent. The data for 2007 show that the figure has now risen to 10 per cent. This is compared to 4 per cent for countries as varied as Sweden, South Korea and Samoa, and 9 per cent for countries such as Romania and Namibia. Causes have been identified by experts as being due to poor maternal nutrition owing to poverty and a lack of education about a healthy diet. There is something very shocking about those figures.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08032768000090"></a>Then there are the figures on life expectancy. About two decades ago, there was a difference in life expectancy of about five years for males, depending on whether they lived in Glasgow or the south-east of England. More recently, that difference has widened out to more than nine years. Poverty brings ill health and earlier death; increasing inequality brings about even starker contrasts.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08032768000091"></a>John Rawls, one of the most influential philosophers of the late 20th century, argued that a degree of financial inequality was acceptable provided that the poor benefited from it. A society is just only if its worst are better off than they would be under any alternative arrangement. He justified this view on the basis that if we all had to choose a society from scratch, with no idea whether we would be badly off or well off in it&#151;in other words, leaving aside our present interests&#151;we would all be bound to choose his idea of a just society, for this would be the only one in which everyone could benefit wherever they were born in it. The acid test, however, is whether the worst off are benefiting or benefiting enough. According to Rawls&#146; view, which seems to be pretty compelling, our present arrangements, which rightly allow for some inequality, are justified only if they are benefiting.</p>

<a name="80327-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08032768000092"></a>I come back to my starting point: the widely perceived unfairness of growing inequalities, the results of which can be seen in every aspect of our national life. Above all, this not only undermines the basic moral assumption underpinning the market economy of proportionate rewards but demoralises those at the bottom end of the market by devaluing their contribution. It sets the rich apart and spreads discontent. As Professor Wilkinson has put it, it is likely to mean that the rich have less sense of responsibility to the poor and that the poor may be beset with a sense of fatalism and disengagement. It needs to be tackled on many fronts, both to advance the prospect of the worst off and to create consensus about rewards at the top end of the market that is acceptable to all who participate in it. It needs to be addressed by Governments and employers. Our present financial instability should not distract us from this task. On the contrary; the present shake-up should act as a salutary shock in recommitting us to the creation of a flourishing society, in which all have a proportionate share and in which there is a shared sense of well-being. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

At the outset, let me state my areas of agreement and disagreement with him. I agree very much with him about the problem of poverty and that we must urgently address it, but I part company with him on the question of whether inequality breeds poverty. I shall certainly say something about what the financial markets have done to inequality. Indeed, I shall take it up first because it will be more controversial.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08032768000094"></a>The noble Lord is quite right that the system of bonuses and compensation in financial markets encouraged excessive risk-taking, as did the very cheap liquidity that has been available for the past 15 years. This financial crisis has, however, shown us how fragile some of these numbers are. One gentleman lost  $1 billion in the Bear Stearns fiasco&#151;he also has the misfortune of owning Tottenham Hotspur, but we will leave that aside. If the stock market were also to collapse by, say, 40 per cent tomorrow, a lot of those people&#146;s spikes would come down, and it would not benefit a single person in this economy. This is not a zero-sum game. Moreover, some of these numbers are what Karl Marx called fictitious capital. The people who were compensated two years ago by Bear Stearns&#151;some of the brightest people&#151;were paid in shares but with a three-year delay. They have found that what was worth $1 million is now worth $10,000.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08032768000095"></a>I agree that there is a spike at the very top&#151;the top 1 per cent&#151;but the spike exists in the few mainly Anglo-Saxon economies that have very vibrant financial markets. These financial markets have generated fantastic returns not only by recklessness but, mainly, because some highly educated and intelligent research economists have created some very complex financial instruments that have made it possible for people to take risks. These are rewards for risks.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08032768000453"></a>Now, we have to insist that if the risk-takers fail, we will pay no heed to their problems. If they believe in the market, let us enforce the market on them. Let no bank be saved. If banks are saved, let none of their shareholders receive any compensation for their loss. I think that the Northern Rock policy is correct and the Bear Stearns one is somewhat wrong but that is neither here nor there. We have to be completely ruthless. If people say they believe in the free market, let us say: &#147;You play by the free market. There will be no compensation&#148;.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08032768000096"></a>However, as soon as markets begin to collapse, everybody comes on to the scene and all the newspapers tell the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor that something must be done to save the system. Nothing must be done to save it. The system must live or die by itself. We are not interested. The most interesting part of the latest crisis is that the real economy has so far not been affected. We do not know what it has done to the spike, though we will in about three years. I am taking a harder line on this than I necessarily would if I were a Minister, but since there is no prospect of that, thank God, I can do so.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_638"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 638</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08032768000097"></a>The calculation of income distribution in percentages leads to the idea of a zero-sum game or a fixed pie. We have to part company with this idea. Over the past 20 years, while the financial markets have been perhaps reckless and perhaps quite mad, income growth also has been quite spectacular, and not only in this country. The growth in Asia and the removal of millions from poverty would not have been possible had the financial markets not made it viable to transfer capital to countries such as India, China and lots of others in Asia where it was needed. I am therefore not entirely in agreement with the noble and right reverend Lord about the evils of the financial system. I do not have to declare an interest because I have made no money from the financial markets. I can boldly say that I am not bothered about it.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08032768000098"></a>I would like to say just one more thing, because my time is running out. I think that poverty is the most serious problem in our society. It has happened because changes in the economy have removed the need for manual unskilled and semi-skilled labour. That has been the biggest transformation in our economy. Unless people are highly educated and highly skilled, they will not get a living wage in our economy. As the noble and right reverend Lord said, some of the wages paid for manual and unskilled jobs are absolutely appalling. I agree with him that we ought to do as much as we can to shore up the situation. One thing we must not do, however, is to take seriously the EU&#146;s definition of poverty as such and such a percentage of median income. We must concentrate on poverty as a standard of living measured directly in terms of what people need. We must try to eradicate that poverty and problems of ill health, but we must not be bemused by such statistics.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08032768000100"></a>The word &#147;inequality&#148; can have two meanings. One implies an unfair situation; the noble and right reverend Lord has given many examples and this is the aspect that we will primarily be discussing today. The other, as Peter Bauer&#151;later Lord Bauer, one of the most brilliant lecturers when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge&#151;used to say, is that inequality merely means &#147;difference&#148;. I believe that in discussing financial inequality we should keep both meanings in mind.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08032768000101"></a>I would suggest that there are four important principles when considering public policy on financial inequality. The first is the need to stimulate economic growth, which is the only way in which all can be made better off. The second is to recognise the difference between the tax system and the social security system, because they both have quite different purposes. The third, as the noble Lord, Lord Desai, said, is to focus on absolute poverty rather than relative poverty. The fourth is to avoid giving financial help from state funds to those who do not need it at the expense of those who do. In my book, that is, quite frankly, immoral. I should like to say a brief word on each  of these.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_639"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 639</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08032768000102"></a>A culture of incentives is crucial. The French philosopher Bertrand de Juvenal once said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08032768000482"></a>&#147;The statesman who believes the world is populated with angels will be sorely disappointed&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000454"></a>The fact is that man is quite a selfish creature who wants the best for himself and his family. Taxes should be used to raise the revenue needed with the minimum dislocation to the functioning of the economy. The concept of the &#147;social wage&#148;, which will always exist in any society as justifying high taxes, was at one time used to justify virtually unlimited tax take. But a high social wage can rapidly become unsustainable through the limit it imposes on growth. In Europe, it is still a problem in both France and Germany. It is one of the main challenges that President Sarkozy has today. People of course enjoy public benefits, but when it comes down to it most prefer to make their own spending decisions, and the net utility of private spending is usually higher as well as more efficient.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08032768000103"></a>To use high taxes to impoverish the rich does not enrich the poor. We had a long experiment disproving this. When Mrs Thatcher was elected in 1979, the top marginal rate of income tax in Britain was 98 per cent and the threshold at which it came in, in today&#146;s money, was under &#163;100,000 a year. Those were the days of the brain drain when many of the brightest and best people migrated to countries, primarily the United States, where their talents could be rewarded.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08032768000104"></a>Confiscatory taxes really only came to an end some 20 years ago when, in his March 1988 Budget, my noble friend Lord Lawson reduced the top rate of income tax to 40 per cent. Such was the rage from the Labour Benches when he announced it that that was the only occasion ever that the House of Commons has had to be suspended in disorder during a Budget speech. I should take this opportunity to give the present Chancellor, and indeed the whole Government, warm congratulations on keeping to this top rate over the 11 years that they have been in power.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08032768000105"></a>I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Desai, that although the state has a real responsibility at the bottom end, at the top end the market must pay the costs and get the benefits. People should suffer for failing and be rewarded for succeeding. I well remember that the American industrialist, J Peter Grace&#151;who ran W R Grace &amp; Co, a big chemical company&#151;once said to someone who asked for a lot of money: &#147;I shall have absolutely no problem in paying you that. You may just have a problem in earning it&#148;.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08032768000106"></a>The social security system must be used with imagination, flexibility and as far as possible with simplicity. There is no point in having complicated schemes which people do not understand and do not use. We must focus on those who are truly deprived, whether it be because of ill fortune, ill health or simply their own inadequacies. As we all know, there are those who simply cannot cope with life. They will always need the state to give them the decent standard to which, in a civilised society, they are as entitled as the rest of us. Absolute poverty can and must be eliminated in a prosperous society.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_640"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 640</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08032768000107"></a>By definition, however, relative poverty will always exist. We are back to inequality meaning &#147;difference&#148;. But the state should focus its efforts on what it can achieve. For example, it has a duty to ensure that all families are decently housed. It cannot and should not take responsibility for ensuring home ownership for all; we have seen the disaster that that can lead to, especially in the USA. A real effort should be made to stop giving benefits in kind tax-free to those who do not need them. Two obvious examples are the winter fuel allowance and free bus and tube travel for the over-60s. Both benefits should be taxed. In the former case especially, the tax collected would enable the level of winter fuel payment to be raised, which would really help the poorest.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08032768000108"></a>Many improvements to how we do things can and must be made. But I believe that these four principles can help ensure that Britain remains a compassionate and decent as well as a prosperous society.</p>

I particularly appreciate the moral philosophy that he introduced into this debate when opening it. It is important to take account of, and indeed act on, the principles involved in addressing inequality.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08032768000110"></a>Financial inequality exists widely in the nations and regions of the United Kingdom. The result is, on the one hand, poverty, poor housing&#151;and unaffordable housing at that&#151;social exclusion and unemployment; on the other, relative prosperity, a better quality of life, quality employment and more life opportunities, with better housing and better health. If we have a social conscience, we must address this and try to put it right.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08032768000111"></a>I am grateful that this debate is about the whole of the United Kingdom. In the other place I represented a part of Wales. Because of the devolution settlement, we do not have much chance these days to make comparisons, but in this case we can make some. I will concentrate to some extent on the situation in Wales and say that it is almost identically replicated in the north-east of England and in Cornwall, which have very similar economic indicators, and in some other parts of the EU. I shall then suggest how we might address these matters and improve on them.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08032768000112"></a>The current performance of the Welsh economy is well below expectations, particularly taking into account the application of EU funding in west Wales and the valleys. The evidence is that the gross domestic product per head remains stubbornly fixed at 80 per cent of the UK average. It was that before devolution and it has not moved much. If one applies the gross value added measurement, which takes on board some services as well, it has declined from  84 per cent in 1995 to 78 per cent in 2004. In west Wales and the valleys, it has gone down to 65 per cent. We do not have a very sound economy. Much of the spending has been in the public sector rather than the private sector. If one compares these figures with those for other parts of Britain and Europe, one finds  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_641"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 641</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the gross domestic product of west Wales and the valleys is 79 per cent of the UK average. It is slightly lower in Cornwall. But in Bucharest, Romania&#151;which has not been in the EU for very long&#151;it is  74 per cent. In Warsaw it is 81 per cent. It is even higher in Prague and Bratislava than it is in west Wales and the valleys. In contrast, the figure for Ireland is 143 per cent, as a result of a revolution in the way that it has been managed in recent times. Noble Lords will not be surprised to learn that inner London is on 303 per cent of the EU average, which is an extraordinary situation.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08032768000113"></a>Average disposable income for a family in Wales stands at &#163;21,182, a figure which may reflect two people working. What interests me is that that family spends 13.3 per cent of its income on food. When I was lecturing 25 years ago, it was 27 per cent, which is a percentage that poorer members of our society are probably still on. On a per head basis in Wales, people are on &#163;11,900 compared with &#163;15,000 in London, a difference of &#163;3,100. I do not see that that is fair at all. We know that the cost of living in London is higher, but it is quite hard to make a living in my part of the world. It is clear that where I come from there has not been enough focus on innovative and entrepreneurial economic activity, both private and social, but that is now being addressed.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08032768000114"></a>The success of Ireland over the past 20 years should be an inspiration to many of the regions and nations of Britain which are not so well off. For the first time in the history of Ireland, an indigenous moneyed class has emerged after a long economic boom. The Bank of Ireland estimates that from a few hundred euro millionaires 20 years ago, there are now 300,000, which is hard to believe. Ireland has an educated labour force and a strong demand for labour in well-paid jobs. An in-depth study of the Irish experience and the application of the principles involved is something that many of the poorer nations and regions of Britain could benefit from.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08032768000115"></a>We have a huge mountain to climb. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has laid bare the scale of the challenge. More than a quarter of Welsh children live in poverty, while average family incomes, to which I have already referred, show huge disparities with other parts of the United Kingdom. I believe that the Barnett formula should be revised so that it is based on need. At the moment in Wales, with its GDP running at 80 per cent of the EU average, the question of need is not being met.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08032768000116"></a>In conclusion, Wales, Cornwall and north-east England are way behind other parts of the United Kingdom, and indeed in many sub-regions of those areas, incomes are only two-thirds of the UK average. The result of that is poverty, child poverty and a lack of opportunity in employment. Essentials such as food and housing are rendered unaffordable because they absorb an ever larger proportion of net income. This creates debt. Of the 10 regions with the highest rates of unemployment benefit for longer than five years, five areas are in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08032768000117"></a>I finish by saying that the Barnett formula needs to be completely updated on the basis of need and government policy needs to concentrate on upgrading investment and entrepreneurship in our poorer regions so that average incomes are brought up to a level where essentials are affordable. In that way, the populations of these areas will not continue to suffer.</p>

I wish to address my remarks for the most part to a particular group in the population where there is significant inequality and, as a result of that, poverty; that is, the older members of our society. Earlier discussion at Question Time indicated that if this is a serious issue, which I believe it is, it is one that will grow in both complexity and impact on our community. The noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, gave us a couple of figures: for example, that there will be an additional 2 million people over the age of 65 in our society before long. I can give your Lordships a rather different figure. If I stick to my time in the course of my speech your statistical life expectancy will increase by 1.5 minutes. One cannot claim the deposit individually but that is one of the more interesting statistics of society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08032768000119"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, pointed out that the life expectancy of children being born now is such that one in five will live to the age of 100. Those are significant facts, so if there is inequality and poverty in the older community within our society it will have a huge impact. As the noble and right reverend Lord pointed out in his speech, there are two ends to the equality debate. Over the past couple of weeks we have had warnings from the Foreign Office about so-called SAGA louts. There are those who have money and who are misusing it, but that is not the experience of many older people in the community. They are not all out there having SKI holidays; that is, &#147;spending the kids&#146; inheritance&#148; holidays: many are stuck in their homes as a result of inequality and poverty.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08032768000120"></a>I accept the points made about the definitions of poverty. There is a great danger in simply taking a statistic or a percentage and defining poverty in that way. However, I shall give a version of one of the statistical indicators to which the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, pointed. If one takes seven stops on the Central Line in London, one&#146;s life expectancy goes down by about 10 years. This is not individually; it is statistically, but that is the issue of life expectancy in our community. There are poor communities where life expectancy is low. In the same communities&#151;if we look at the available deprivation indices&#151;not only is life expectancy low; earnings are low, employment prospects are bad, housing is bad, health is clearly measured on low scales, and educational success is low. Those indices kick in in the same parts of the major cities and rural communities

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08032768000121"></a>I want to make a couple of points about pensions in relation to the older section of the community. Separating the measurement of what should be paid by pension from some form of average earnings has been a mistake and will penalise many people. I hope that the Government will look again at how the pensions available through the state system are calculated. They should be linked to the earning power&#151;50 per cent of average earnings or whatever&#151;of our community. That should be possible because the tax system should be able to reflect the income coming from earnings going up and perhaps the benefits available to the poorer members of the community.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08032768000122"></a>I wish to make a further point about pensions. Only 17 per cent of women qualify for the full state pension. That is bound to have an impact on poverty and it is a blatant form of inequality. The women in question have not been able to work permanently throughout what is regarded as normal working life because they have taken time off to have children, to care for them and to bring them up. They may now be taking time off to care for elderly relatives, thereby providing a service to the community. However, that is not recognised in their pension benefits. For various reasons&#151;partly because of the age in which they were reared and learnt their attitudes to life&#151;that same group in the community are bad at claiming benefits. Help the Aged estimates that &#163;4.5 billion in unclaimed benefits lie within the system. That is the reality. Perhaps some of it should be unclaimed, but it is worth asking the Government to examine why those benefits are unclaimed. It could well be that people who formed their attitudes to life 60, 70 or  80 years ago simply have a style of life that is not rights-focused. That may produce a guffaw in certain parts of the City or incredulity among younger members of the population who have been brought up in a rights-focused society, but the danger is that we are not respecting these attitudes as part of the reality of how we treat people. Rather, I fear we might be exploiting them: if they do not claim benefits, fine, the money remains in the public purse.</p>

<a name="80327-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08032768000123"></a>Those are some of the difficulties that older members of the community face. What can be done about them? I shall stick to the issue of the possibility of employment beyond current employment age. We have the prospect&#151;I think it is inevitable&#151;of the age at which state pensions can be claimed being raised. That is the stick, but there ought to be carrots in place. If older people want to continue working, and 53 per cent of them estimate that they need to because they have inadequate financial resources, what are the incentives for employers to do something about that? Who is looking at the tax threshold that discourages older people from continuing to work and discourages employers from taking them on? Those are areas where not only the comparative wealth of individuals could be helped but no doubt their health as well. Positive social attitudes would come out of all this. I commend to the Government the need to look at the employment of older people as one of the ways in which we might begin to deal with this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08032768000125"></a>I shall take the debate in a regional direction. Having lived in and experienced different parts of  the United Kingdom over the past 30 years, I am of the view that there is a divide between the north and the south. That is not to say that there is not wealth in the north or poverty in the south&#151;both are definitely there&#151;but the division is one of scale; it is the scale of wealth in the south and of poverty in the north that mark the contrast. Although the gap in growth is narrowing, there has been a consistent gap in the growth rates between the north and the south. The regional development agencies have had a strategic role in narrowing the gap, but there are forces at work that still militate against financial equality across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08032768000126"></a>The north has large swathes of population living in deprived areas. Fifty-three per cent of households in the most deprived areas in England are located in the north, with 26 per cent in the north-west alone. Housing waiting lists in the north-west are growing faster than anywhere else in the country, which has had a knock-on effect on homelessness. Despite all of this, the north-west regional funding for housing is falling&#151;indeed, has fallen more than in any other region&#151;while its housing waiting list and homelessness have grown more than in any other region. This is but one example of the persistent inequalities across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08032768000127"></a>For a number of years I was chair of the North West Constitutional Convention. Although the debate about regional government has come and gone, what remains is the need to address the strategic development and governance of our regions. That is happening at a regional level, but most of us feel that it lacks coherence, accountability and transparency. As someone involved in the pastoral care of the region, committed to its welfare and aware of the inequalities, I recognise that too many decisions that are made about the region and its economic development are made nationally and centrally, and that the outcomes are sometimes hard to understand at a regional level. I know the Government are committed to making the regional development agencies more coherent, accountable and transparent, and I welcome the sub-national review and the  &#163;6.5 billion that the Government are investing in RDAs in the period 2008-11. But in giving more power to the RDAs, the question is begged of how accountable these bodies will be to their own regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08032768000128"></a>Financial inequality impacts upon levels of poverty in our regions, especially in the north-west, which is the only region to have borders with both Scotland and Wales. There is a feeling of injustice. Investment per capita in both Scotland and Wales is of a much higher order than it is in the north-west of England. This was one of the factors that drove the debate on regional government. There is a widespread  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_645"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 645</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>feeling that there is no one to champion the needs of those living in the north-west in the way that the Government and Assembly in Scotland and Wales do for their own people. It is galling for those in the north-west to discover that just a few miles away hospitals and schools are funded on a formula that discriminates against people this side of the borders. This formula for investment has an impact upon the regeneration of the regions.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08032768000129"></a>For four years, I chaired the New Deal for Communities programme in Liverpool. Regeneration requires the creation of real jobs. There is a limit to the benefit that can be gained from the development of social businesses which has been, I am afraid, the weakness of NDC. There has to be real wealth creation, real jobs and real economic activity. But that economic growth can be justified only if it is sustainable. Unfortunately, to date people have looked for a successful economy and then asked to what extent it can accommodate sustainability. This will not do. We have to promote sustainability and show that this is the only economic way forward. In the regions, especially in the north-west, we are already thinking of new ways of developing the regional economy. We need a new approach so that we can turn water, wind and waste into energy, we can develop the rivers and the railways for more efficient and sustainable transport, and we can create cities where, within walking distance, people can live, labour and spend their leisure together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08032768000130"></a>Forty-five per cent of the diocese of Liverpool has areas of multiple deprivation. One of the greatest aspects of inequality in my diocese is the number of children born into poverty. This was touched on by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries. They are born into what I call consolidated poverty. There is much debate about relative poverty but what I am aware of day by day is consolidated poverty. By that I mean where there is generational unemployment, generational deprivation of parenting, vandalised public space, poor health and low educational achievement. It is this accumulated and consolidated poverty which deprives children of equality of opportunity and, ultimately, of financial equality.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08032768000131"></a>The Government have rightly invested in education to break this cycle of deprivation. I pay tribute to the work on academies. I chair two academies and have seen their success. Within 18 months I have seen young people, whose record previously was just 27 per cent, achieve 44 per cent and five GCSE passes at grades A-C, and who are on target this year to achieve more than 50 per cent. I have seen how this can have an impact on our communities. I have also noticed the development of children&#146;s centres and I pay tribute to this initiative, but we have to recognise that some of the neediest people and parents are not being drawn into the sphere of these excellent centres. We need radically new interventions in order to reach those people who are beyond their reach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08032768000132"></a>For understandable reasons I have spent a great deal of time recently in Croxteth which has many public and voluntary sector projects and where extraordinary work is being done, as I saw yesterday.

Three-quarters of the time of the person leading the play scheme that I visited yesterday afternoon was spent in finding funds for next year. It seems such a waste that these extraordinary skills in enabling children and empowering parents should be diverted into trying to find more money to support these projects. When all is said and done, we have to find new ways of cutting the cake and making sure that it is shared, and when it is, that it is fed to our children.</p>

<a name="08032768000133"></a><b><a name="80327-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08032768000616"></a>Lord Sawyer:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, for introducing the debate, which is on an important issue. We live in a worldwide free market economy where the pursuit of wealth is a prime goal. This wealth enables people to live in the way that they choose, pursue their dreams and desires and own the things that they think are important. In our country, that wealth has doubled over the past 25 years and will continue to increase. Politicians, faced with voters&#146; attachment to wealth and all that flows from it, find it difficult to question the desirability of its continuous growth. Given the scarcity of the world&#146;s resources and the drive for more nations and people to participate in this growth and increase in wealth, the time is surely here for a serious debate about alternatives. It is not my intention to engage in that debate today, but that is the overriding issue in any debate about wealth in the future; the question of the degree to which the world can sustain wealth creation and the extent to which we can look at other alternatives.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08032768000134"></a>I want to speak briefly about something more manageable; about wealth distribution and our attitude to growing disparities of earned wealth. There is a growing body of evidence and opinion in this country claiming unfairness in the distribution of wealth, particularly at the excessive pay of top business leaders. In 1979, the chief executive officers of the top firms were earning about 10 times the wage of the average worker, which for those top people was about &#163;200,000 in today&#146;s money. Today, wages for the average worker have risen slightly ahead of inflation since 1979, but we are told that the leaders of the FTSE top 100 can expect to earn about 75 times the wage of the average worker. Earlier today I read that it was just over 60 times, which is still a huge increase since 1979.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08032768000135"></a>In America, the top business leaders can expect to make about 300 times the wage of an average worker. Is that the direction in which we are heading, and is there an alternative? It is my belief that those huge inequalities of wealth do not necessarily make for good, long-term sustainable companies, nor do they help to create fair and balanced societies. Do the disparities continue? Are we moving closer to the American model? Or is there something else that we can do? I sit on the remuneration committee of a substantial successful business, with 3 million customers and 5,000 employees, so I know something about the need properly and adequately to reward talent and to attract and maintain good business leaders. That does  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_647"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 647</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not stop me from feeling uncomfortable about some of the disparities of wealth that I see around me. Remuneration consultants offer continuous comparative data to show where shortfalls occur and, in effect, help to create a spiral of ongoing and increasing reward mechanisms in all the companies that they advise, to ensure that, as they would say, those businesses retain their competitive packages.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08032768000136"></a>Perhaps I am slightly naive, because I think back to the communities in which I grew up, where the chief executive and the workers worked together, lived fairly closely together and shared the same kind of community facilities. They also shared the benefits of the good times and the sacrifices of the bad times. There are many people today in business, some at the highest levels, who share the values of fairness and more equality and who want to live in more balanced communities. They do not subscribe to the pursuit of personal wealth as the main goal in life, and they will say that excessive executive pay is often not justified by business performance. I say to my noble friends the Ministers in my Government and to some of my honourable friends in another place that those people, who have strong and good values that are not just about earning money, need encouragement and support. They need recognition from the Government, because they share what might be called similar values to centre-left, new Labour values.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08032768000137"></a>I hear Ministers say that we should not question the morality of excessive wealth; but I disagree. We should question it, we should talk about it and we should challenge it. We should certainly be in favour of fair rewards. I agree that we should celebrate and encourage success. Millionaires are fine, and 300,000 millionaires in Ireland are even finer. We should promote and argue for balance, and we should say something about other values, not just wealth. There are business leaders who share the wealth of their companies not only with customers and shareholders but with their workforce, and we should talk about them. There are leaders who think that customer satisfaction and employee engagement are just as important as profit levels and personal reward, and we should talk about them, too. There are business schools which develop leaders who appreciate a wider, balanced approach to wealth creation, and we should talk about them, too. There are even pension funds which, while obviously having an obligation to maximise their investment returns, look at many more factors and do not always look kindly on excessive rewards at the top.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08032768000138"></a>I encourage the Government to give more attention to a wider view of wealth, a wider view of how businesses can be led and different kinds of values that can be talked about, supported and championed. That would be good to hear, and it would ensure that the Government were on the side of the people and not of the ever-widening inequality and ever more extremes of wealth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08032768000140"></a>My wife and I are about to move from Ripon to Leeds, where the majority of the people of our diocese live, so the Church Commissioners are to sell our nine-bedroom 19th-century house. We thought that it might sell as a guesthouse or maybe as sheltered accommodation, but inquiries of estate agents locally produced quite different advice. We were told, &#147;Sell it as a single home, because there are plenty of people who have &#163;2 million to buy the house and then another &#163;3 million to make it habitable&#148;. I do not know to how many of your Lordships that applies. If it does, there is an attractive house outside Ripon coming on to the market; we will not benefit a penny from its sale.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08032768000141"></a>This welcome debate takes place against that background of growing inequality in this country, which has been well demonstrated by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, and others. Our own city of Leeds seeks to rid itself of the tag of a two-speed city with the strapline &#147;narrowing the gap&#148;, but its efforts in that area struggle against the growing inequality in our culture. Some of the narrowing of that gap needs to come from a mixture of tax and tax credit measures. I therefore regret the abolition of the lower rate of income tax. At the same time, I welcome the Government&#146;s continued commitment to dealing with child poverty. There is much to be done fiscally to deal with truths such as that 1.5 million children in poverty belong to households that pay full council tax. Fiscal measures need to be brought together to tackle poverty and so to reduce inequality.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08032768000142"></a>We also need to take account of the evidence that fewer people now believe that redistribution of wealth needs to be a priority. There is criticism of massive wealth, but there is also criticism of those who are in poverty. In this respect, I am grateful for the report <I>When Ends Don&#146;t Meet</I>, which comes from Church Action on Poverty and Oxfam, based on interviews held in Thornaby-on-Tees. The report uses the concept of the sustainable livelihood approach and chimes with my experience in Leeds and elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08032768000143"></a>Those oppressed by inequality often have a resilience that puts most of us to shame: there is a determination to bring up children well, to survive in a hostile world and to keep going. Yet they often feel that no one is interested in them and that finance is given to them grudgingly, which means that self-esteem is hard to maintain. In this respect, I salute the social assets provided by the voluntary sector in some areas. I am particularly grateful for the concession on Gift Aid in the Budget, which has done something to allay the worst fears of churches and other community charities that yet again the support that they provide would be reduced. The presence of community groups in areas where inequality bites cannot possibly take the place of fiscal measures, but they are of immense value to those most affected by inequality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08032768000144"></a>The Thornaby research speaks of two crucial factors in inequality: debt and access to health services. Debt has become a crucial issue for vast numbers of people in our society. The Church of England recently published some helps&#151;mostly very straightforward ones&#151;on household budgeting and avoiding debt. We were astonished at the positive  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_649"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 649</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>interest&#151;not least from the press&#151;in the assertion that debt was an emotional and, indeed, a spiritual issue, as well as a financial one. This goes for many who see the inequalities in our country, who fall into debt and experience nightmares as they struggle with fear. For those most affected, there needs to be from government a wider restraint on loan sharks&#151;including maximum interest rates&#151;and more positive support for credit unions as one highly effective way of coping with debt.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08032768000145"></a>Access to health services is a further key issue in coping with inequality. The majority of households in the Thornaby study have mental health problems&#151;that is particularly true of women. Yet mental health provision remains too often a Cinderella service that is not available to many, especially to children. I hope that the Care Quality Commission that we were discussing the other day will see this as a continuing priority for its own work. This is a matter not just of poverty but of major health provision for many who cannot afford to buy themselves out of health inequality. Disability and mental health are a crucial and increasing element in inequality in our culture.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08032768000146"></a>This is a crucial debate. Inequality has many causes and elements and we need a coherent, vigorous and imaginative response if there is to be a real narrowing of the gap in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08032768000148"></a>One of the biggest concerns in this area should be debt, about which I shall talk initially. The problem of debt divides people into those who have and those who have not. It is another dimension in our discussion today. In response to a recent Parliamentary Question in another place, total personal debt was estimated at &#163;1.4 trillion in January 2008. Further, it was revealed that the average personal debt had increased from &#163;16,000 in 2002 to &#163;23,000 in 2006. That is a large increase and for many it is a serious issue. Total household financial liabilities have increased every year since 1997, rising from approximately &#163;586 billion in 1997 to &#163;1,370 billion in 2006. When one allows for loans secured on dwellings as a percentage of households&#146; gross disposable income, the figure has increased from 28 per cent in 1997 to 39 per cent in 2006.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08032768000149"></a>Citizens Advice has seen increasing numbers of mortgage and secured loan arrears problems in the past two years. Home owners in arrears receive little help from benefits, insurance or their lenders. Poor lending and arrears collection practices have made problems much worse for many borrowers. In the past year, Citizens Advice reports having to deal with 57,000 problems of mortgage and secured loan arrears&#151;an 11 per cent increase on the previous year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08032768000150"></a>Safety nets are failing. The take-up of mortgage payment protection insurance has declined and the Government&#146;s own income support for mortgage interest payments scheme is failing to keep people out of serious arrears problems because of the limited help that the scheme provides. Sustainable home ownership is a challenge for many low-income households. Better co-ordination of government policy and proactive regulation of bad businesses are needed to prevent these borrowers from being set up to fail.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08032768000151"></a>Earlier this month, the final report of the Thoresen Review of Generic Financial Advice was published. It sets out a blueprint for a national money guidance service to help people to make better decisions about money issues. The conclusions include the provision of money guidance focused on giving people information on budgeting, saving and borrowing protection, retirement planning, tax and welfare benefits, and jargon busting. The report recommends a United Kingdom-wide approach to money guidance to be delivered using a multichannel approach&#151;telephone, face-to-face and web-based provision. Those improvements would be paid for by splitting the costs equally between the Government and the financial services industry. I am sure that noble Lords would be most grateful if the Minister would provide some indication of the Government&#146;s response to these proposals.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08032768000152"></a>I believe that we need to do more to tackle the problems of financial difficulties and debt issues. There is a role for the Government, civil society, financial institutions and businesses to take responsibility jointly and to work together to find and implement the solutions. I would like the Financial Services Authority to exercise greater scrutiny and control over financial institutions where moral hazard or signs of bad practices are indicated. Financial institutions should follow responsible lending practices.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08032768000153"></a>The Government should take steps to improve the financial education that is delivered in our secondary schools. There should be a clampdown on store cards. Perhaps we should consider a seven-day cooling-off period, so that if a customer signs up for a store card or other revolving credit facilities at the point of sale, this credit cannot be used for seven days. Equally, much clearer information for credit card users should be provided. For example, credit card adverts, application forms and statements should include illustrative scenarios that explain exactly how much credit will cost if only minimum repayments are made every month.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08032768000154"></a>Finally, I should like to add that one of the key causes of financial inequality is that many people are trapped into poverty by the very welfare system that was designed to help them. There is reliance on a welfare culture. It is imperative that we support initiatives and polices that give encouragement and incentives to people to look for work or to go on training schemes. There should be a focused welfare-to-work programme. In addition to earning a wage, people will get satisfaction and self-esteem from working. Unemployment and poverty are contributory factors in the breakdown of families. My party is taking this matter seriously and we have set out our proposals on it. In view of the constraint of time, I am not able to discuss these fully.</p>

I am pleased to have struggled out of my sick-bed to take part in it. It has been a fun and instructive debate so far. I am happy to say that I disagree with something in what all noble Lords have said and I disagree with everything in what some noble Lords have said.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08032768000156"></a>If one wants to analyse inequality, one has to take an approach to it over time. You have to look at trends and you have to see how much policies have affected those trends. If one looks back at the period just after the Second World War, from about 1955 to 1975, inequality in all industrial countries was in decline. That was the so-called golden age of the welfare state. All countries followed a roughly similar pattern, and that is also true of the period after 1975 from the late 1970s through to the start of the 2000s, Inequalities started to increase in all industrial countries during that period. Those increases were not uniform. You will find very different levels of increase when you compare some countries with others. If you look at the statistics on the UK, economic inequalities increased more steeply during that period than in any other industrial country, including the US, apart from New Zealand&#151;which also followed a similar kind of economic programme at that time. The polarisation of income here was greater than that in any other industrial country.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08032768000157"></a>By 1997, the UK ranked poorly in terms of child poverty; by most measures it was 14th out of  15 among the EU nations. As Anthony Atkinson from Oxford University has shown, there has been an escape of income at the top. There was a steeply rising accrual of income to the top 1 per cent. For the top 0.5 per cent or 0.1 per cent, the rise was steeper than in most other industrial countries and certainly any other EU country.</p>

<a name="80327-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08032768000158"></a>Labour came to power in 1997 with the ambition of doing something about that. It was new Labour, which had a different orientation from past Labour Governments. It placed an emphasis on job creation and work to root out poverty. That was right and proper. It introduced a minimum wage, which was shown not to damage the proportion of people in work. Some 74 per cent to 75 per cent of the UK labour force is in work&#151;a much higher proportion than in most other industrial countries. In France, for example, the figure is about 64 per cent and in Germany it is about 65 per cent. Having a high proportion of people in work is the condition of doing something about the less privileged, because that means that you can spend money on welfare measures that would otherwise be consumed essentially by paying people to stay out of work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08032768000159"></a>Labour introduced a raft of policies to help people in poorer areas and neighbourhoods. Many policies were targeted to help the poor and, of course, Labour made the radical pledge to reduce child poverty by a half by 2010 and eradicate it&#151;which to me means reducing it to about 5 per cent&#151;by 2020. I completely disagree with what some noble Lords have said about poverty and child poverty. For me, the aim to  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_652"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 652</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>substantially reduce child poverty is important precisely because it is a means of reducing overall inequality. Child poverty is measured in terms of inequality. If you help children, you help poorer adults and poorer families. The pledge was the  single most important statement that the Labour Government made on their commitment to producing a more egalitarian society.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08032768000160"></a>What has been achieved? Well, Labour has been a redistributive Government. According to the studies of David Piachaud at the LSE, about 2.5 million people have been lifted out of relative poverty since 1997. Most people accept that that figure includes some 600,000 children. A much higher proportion of children have been lifted out of poverty if that is measured against an absolute deadline of 1998, as some noble Lords have suggested.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08032768000161"></a>Contrary to what some noble Lords have said, it is not the case that overall economic inequality is on the increase. Most studies show that the Gini coefficient, which is the main measure of overall inequality, has stabilised since 1997 and has not continued to increase. But that is not easy to measure and it is not necessarily the best measure of overall inequality. In terms of child poverty, the country ranks about ninth or  10th among EU countries. At least that is an improvement. Some people say that social mobility has decreased under Labour; that is completely ridiculous because social mobility takes some 20 or so years to unfold. We will not know the effects of Labour&#146;s current policies&#151;for example, the children&#146;s programme&#151;until many more years have unfolded, but there is a decent chance that they will be successful.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08032768000162"></a>What has gone wrong? Why has there not been more change? Since I do not have much more time, I shall briefly mention three things. First, Labour has been too timorous at the top. I do not agree at all with my noble friend Lord Desai. Social exclusion at the top is as serious a problem for society as social exclusion at the bottom. Personally, I am in favour of a wealth tax on the top 0.5 per cent of income earners which would be hypothecated and spent on helping poorer children. I do not think that that will ever be accepted by the Government, but something like that should be done. Secondly, the Government have not managed to reach those at the very bottom. The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, mentioned the 10 per cent to 15 per cent who have not profited much from economic growth. I have figures that show that the bottom 4 per cent to 5 per cent has especially lost out. That is because tax credits do not really reach those groups and the problem of the in-work poor is significant.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08032768000163"></a>Finally and thirdly, in contrast to the views of my noble friend Lord Desai, I do not believe that you can conquer poverty by concentrating on the poor alone. The problem is that more affluent people find strategies to outflank what you do. Labour came too late to thinking about policies such as lottery admission and the policies adopted by the Charity Commission and others to ensure that private schools have more social responsibilities. You have to do something about inequalities in the middle, as well as at the top, to help those at the bottom.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08032768000164"></a>In conclusion, I believe that we can have a more equal society. It is completely compatible with economic competitiveness and, as the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, said, the Scandinavian countries have shown that this is so.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08032768000525"></a>12.58 pm</h5>

<a name="08032768000165"></a><b><a name="80327-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08032768000620"></a>Lord Roberts of Llandudno:</b> My Lords, I appreciate the opportunity provided by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, for me to take part in this debate on inequality. I looked first at the extent of child poverty in various constituencies in the UK. I took as the criterion the percentage of families in receipt of income support, jobseeker&#146;s allowance, incapacity benefit, severe disablement benefit or pension credit. Manchester Central was the constituency with the largest percentage, where 52 per cent of children were in poverty. Buckingham had the smallest percentage of children in poverty&#151; 5 per cent. That is a big division. It indicates that children in that part of Manchester are 10 times more likely to suffer poverty and its effects than those in Buckingham. Other areas I looked at, such as Islington, north-east Glasgow and Tottenham, were all on 47 per cent. I was surprised that Islington, for instance, was there, but it was according to this measurement.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08032768000166"></a>In Wales, as my noble friend Lord Livsey indicated, we also have severe problems. These are not new. I originally come from the quarrying areas of north Wales and we know that in the time of the lockout in Penrhyn quarry, say 100 years ago, poverty was far worse than anything we can imagine today, as it also was in the coalfields of south Wales. However, within Cardiff&#151;not between area and area, but within cities&#151;the Cardiff North constituency registers 13 per cent of children in poverty while Cardiff South and Penarth, just a stone&#146;s throw away, registers 34 per cent. Therefore, we get this difference within cities themselves.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08032768000167"></a>You can compare that with areas outside. The Rhondda has 38 per cent and Merthyr Tydfil has  37 per cent. This contrasts with Brecon and Radnor at 14 per cent, and both Montgomeryshire and Monmouth at 13 per cent. Therefore, parts of Wales have three times greater a number of people in poverty than others. The older industrial areas are faring the worst. Merthyr Tydfil was once the greatest ironworks in the world, but of course declined over the years. The coalfields have gone so the industrial areas have fared very badly.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08032768000168"></a>We can also see rural poverty, but in a different way. I do not know why but there is a different sort of culture. For instance, a year or two ago, the average income in farming communities was about &#163;7,000 per person. It is better now; I am told it is on the level of the national minimum wage. However, there was poverty there. Why? Rural depopulation&#151;we come again to the closure of quarries, mines and steelworks. I come from a tourist area and, even there, we have seen change as people decide they are going to spend their money to get a little sunshine. In Llandudno we offer them a great deal of sunshine, but sometimes they want a bit more than we can offer, so they go overseas and spend their income there. We see a change&#151;where hotels were, flats are being built.  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_654"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 654</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Things are different. Some former seaside resorts are now places of real problems, concern and poverty. So many of our young people&#151;the ones who could really take the lead in their local communities&#151;go elsewhere and build careers, often very successful ones, in different areas.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08032768000169"></a>Therefore, regeneration is of course necessary. However, I suggest&#151;and someone has hinted at this today&#151;that even money from Europe is not put to work in the best possible way. It must not be a one-off solution but a rolling programme of solution. One-offs often do not succeed; we need something continuous. People who can look ahead and plan with vision can tackle some of these problems that we are facing. It needs all-round planning.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08032768000170"></a>Not every rural school can be maintained. Not every rural church or chapel can be safeguarded. We may have to take tough decisions about communities on which we can concentrate our efforts, and look at a holistic approach&#151;schools, libraries, post offices, shops, community facilities and churches. Too often, we see these in gradual decline. They disappear one after the other. Jobs go after the quarry closes. Families with children have to go to earn a living elsewhere. With fewer people to buy at shops, they close. With fewer children to make school viable, the school is down and possibly has to be closed. The post office closes. Pubs and churches go. Houses that once housed local families are now on the open market and that is the end of that community.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08032768000171"></a>Communities are vital these days. If you have community, a feeling of a neighbourhood and of people belonging to and helping each other, you can see that this affects not only social things but crime and so on. Recently the lowest crime area was Ceredigion, perhaps the most rural of our communities. If people are neighbours, then changes can happen.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08032768000172"></a>Just looking at the inequalities, we can see not only that there are ways of tackling poverty, but that by tackling it we can improve neighbourhoods, social cohesion and many of the crime scenes that trouble us so much today. Therefore, we can see financial and social but also moral rewards when we try to tackle the inequalities within our communities.</p>

There is just no equality of respect. I certainly part company with those who put what I call a panglossian gloss on the current position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08032768000175"></a>Before turning to the main theme, I note that the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury will follow the Bishops in a month&#146;s time, leading a debate on exactly the same subject. I hope that he is not going to have the same problem as I believe he had on the General Synod. It was remarked that he noted a very strong current of disagreement with something that he never said. I hope he will not have that experience here.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08032768000176"></a>The extremity of the ratios we have been hearing about takes us back to pre-war distribution, perhaps not in the general Gini coefficient&#151;I will come back to that&#151;but certainly the top to bottom ratio goes back to before the war. I was on the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth in the 1970s, and one could chart the gradual growth of equality. Some industries, including the Post Office, had data going back 150 years. Between the chief executive and the postman, for example, the ratio went from 75:1 before the First World War, to something like 50:1. By the time the Second World War broke out, it rapidly went from 25:1 down to 15:1. By the 1970s, it was down to about 10:1 and now, of course, it is shooting back up. It has leapt back to how it was in the 1930s and, goodness knows, if it goes on like this, it will be back to how it was in Victorian times. I believe that this phenomenon will have consequences, which we are beginning to see with people pulling away from the political process. If they do not think that they are part of society, it is a case of &#147;to hell with them&#148;.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08032768000177"></a>That leads to a political point, with a capital &#147;P&#148;, to some extent. For most of my life, when Labour politicians have been out of kilter with a substantial consensus of public opinion, it has been argued that that has been because they have been in some sense too socialist. You can argue about that, but we now have the extraordinary phenomenon that a majority of people, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation research, consider the income gap to be too large. This perception is specifically based on those on higher incomes being overpaid rather than those on lower incomes being underpaid. We now have a perception&#151;not mine, of course&#151;that the Labour leadership is to the right of the consensus. I do not expect this phenomenon to last.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08032768000178"></a>I strongly agree with some things in new Labour and strongly disagree with others. One thing I disagree with is the green light that people thought that it was giving to the pay explosion in industry. It is not just in financial services. My noble friend Lord Desai, talking about the future of capitalism&#151;he will forgive me if I misrepresent him&#151;implied something along the lines of a spike in financial services; my noble friend Lord Sawyer, said that there is not. On the differentials in the remuneration committees, when I was on the royal commission I learnt that, if you raise the top of the pyramid, you will increase its step sizes. That has been the experience of the past 150 years. It is changing now, but somehow equality has not been on the new Labour agenda.</p>

The parents of children who went to public schools are actually paying for and seeking a rise in inequality. That is what the public schools are there for, to an extent. I cannot forgo the opportunity to mention the old chestnut about the master at Eton who told a boy who was a bit reluctant to write an essay on poverty to write down one sentence to get the essay going. The boy wrote that, in a family, the Daddy was poor, the Mummy was poor and the butler was poor. This is a question of people&#146;s lifetime experiences. I want the Charity Commission to say that public schools must have 50 per cent of pupils on scholarships to change the culture, not 5 per cent. In Parliament&#151;let us cite facts&#151;60 per cent of the Conservative Party in  the House of Commons went to public school; for the Liberal Democrats, the figure is 39 per cent and for the Labour Party it is 18 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08032768000184"></a>Working as I do now, and declaring my registered interests, both in the City of London and the boardroom, I was particularly interested to hear the references of the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, to Chesterton and Yeats in his introduction. It made me pause for thought on the fact that the greatest leveller of inequality is mortality itself, and reminded me of some lines in TS Eliot&#146;s &#147;East Coker&#148; summing it all up. I have for some reason never heard these lines read out at any of the memorial services for the great and the good that I have attended:</p>
<ul>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08032768000185"></a>Having reflected on that, I was more than comforted in reading the article of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Rochester in this Easter&#146;s <I>Sunday Times</I>, where he wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08032768000486"></a>&#147;The creation of wealth is certainly part of our stewardship but so is the use of it&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08032768000455"></a>The right reverend Prelate, who is not in his place today, went on to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08032768000487"></a>&#147;There were a number of wealthy people around Jesus ... What was required of them is also required of us and that is to share our wealth generously&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000456"></a>Just so. I have caught a hint in one or two of the speeches I have heard so far from the Labour Benches, and perhaps also from the Liberal Democrat Benches, of disapproval of wealth creation. It is all too easy to condemn wealth creators whose activities have genuine benefits when they are spread and multiplied through income groups. I see this in the City of London, where I work with people who give up a lot of their own income and time on charitable and voluntary work. As one example, I have no relationship, and never have had, with HSBC&#151;one of the great British banks, a global superpower. Its chairman, Stephen Green, who was the chief executive, doubles up on Sundays, high days and holidays as an Anglican lay preacher. It is important that these things are recognised. It was because I saw some hint of recognition of this in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Desai, that I lined myself up behind him.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08032768000186"></a>All of that said, I have only two points to make. First, financial inequalities are sometimes relative and a matter of perception. There are lots of people working in the public services, for the public good, who perceive an inequality between what they get and what the private sector gets: the difference between that and their own public-sector wage settlements. Yet these presently rather grumpy public sector workers have great leverage and influence because there are lots of them. They also have excellent conditions, often better than are enjoyed in the private sector, in the matters of holidays, leave, index-linked pensions and all the rest of it. They are in a powerful position, as they were back in the golden age of the 1970s  that the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, was lauding so much.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08032768000187"></a>Public sector workers can make a fuss, but lots of people cannot. I think of those who are perhaps elderly and do not have much of an organisation, like the not very well off who have saved a little bit&#151;a few thousand or tens of thousands over the years&#151;as they are always enjoined to do, so that they do not become a burden on the state. Yet when they reach the age of 75, they must have an annuity. That can tip them over, bizarrely enough, into a situation which is much closer to poverty. Particularly in the present state of the markets, it is bad luck to anyone who has had to buy an annuity in the past six months; they may have seen a 20 per cent drop in the income they will get. This seems to be the result of a slightly unholy collaboration between the Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs and, I have to say, some of my friends in the pension fund industry who earn substantial fees from these annuities. People should not be forced to put their hard-earned, often very small, savings at risk through being forced to have annuities in this way.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08032768000188"></a>Secondly, the position of married couples, unmarried couples and those&#151;often women, sometimes men&#151;who live alone with children is a financial inequality that does not get enough attention. When I went into the  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_658"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 658</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>matter with your Lordships&#146; ever-helpful Library, I got a letter, expressed with proper restraint, dated 18 March. I had asked what facts there were about income differences between married and unmarried couples and single parents. The kind and excellent Librarian said that Government statistics frequently conflate marriage and cohabitation and, as such, income data, broken down by marital status of couples, appear not to be widely available. I would put it rather more colourfully. I think that there is a conspiracy of statistical silence in government circles to conceal what may exist and what some people assert exist: that some lower-income married couples, who may be in receipt of benefits, are getting less than those who are unmarried. I do not know whether it is true or not. I cannot make a clear judgment because we do not have the facts. We get screaming headlines in the tabloids which say they are the facts. Sometimes those headlines are right; sometimes they are not.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08032768000189"></a>I seek some transparency from the Government on this issue. There seems to be a clear and unusually absolute consensus from scholars of all views&#151;left, right and centre&#151;that family breakdown is bad for children, and is consistently associated with poorer outcomes, increased risk of poverty, crime and health problems, leading to the inequalities raised by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, in his introductory speech.</p>

<a name="80327-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08032768000190"></a>I ask the Minister to give a clear statement today that we are not going to be denied this information in the future. Sometimes the politically correct seek to hide inconvenient truths. The Government should collect and publish the data on the income disequilibria that may exist between married and unmarried couples, and make it publicly known so that there can be a proper debate in your Lordships&#146; House and elsewhere.</p>

The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool reminded us that the noble and right reverend Lord debated this issue when he was on the Bishops&#146; Benches, and he is still fighting on the Cross Benches. As ever, he is right: it is unfair. However you measure it, there has been growing financial inequality. Like the noble and right reverend Lord, I am aware that greater financial inequality leads to more social upheaval. It leads to more crime, embeds greed and, as the noble Lord, Lord Layard, said in his recent book, leads to less happiness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08032768000192"></a>I say to the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, that we have to balance this with other considerations, such as the economy. My noble friend Lord Desai reminded us that globalisation and technology have eliminated unskilled jobs and created the need for greater skills. Innovation has changed the face of industry. Our membership of the single market has created more competition. We deal with this through empowerment. We need to empower people and to give them the tools to improve their skills, to be innovative, to be entrepreneurial, to be more competitive and to grow the economy, as the noble Lord, Lord

Certainly, there have to be safeguards such as a minimum wage and human rights. To a degree, legislation has provided these.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80327-0006.htm"/>


<a name="80327-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08032768000193"></a>If you are going to empower people, you cannot set limits. As my noble friend Lord Desai said, it is not a zero-sum game. As a result, income differentials arise. This empowerment may have created excessive wealth for the few, which the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, described dramatically, but it has also created jobs and opportunities for the many. To give credit where it is due, 29.5 million people are at work in Britain today and unemployment is the lowest since 1975. My noble friend Lord Giddens explained that our 75 per cent employment rate is among the highest in Europe. In general, the policy seems to have worked. It has been successful for the economy as a whole, in spite of the increasing financial differentials. </p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08032768000194"></a>However, I agree that there is one area of society where rising income differentials are not acceptable and the damage is too great. Many noble Lords have given the answer: children. What convinced me were those wonderful longitudinal surveys, where the same people are interviewed regularly every few years. Some go back to the 1940s. They make it absolutely crystal clear that if you do not reduce financial differentials among children, disadvantage is passed on from generation to generation. This is the consolidated poverty about which the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool spoke. Growing financial inequality at work might be tolerated, but financial inequality between children is not. It has to be deliberate government policy to close this gap.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08032768000195"></a>In the 20 years before this Government came to power, the proportion of children in relative poverty more than doubled and something had to be done. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds said, the tax and benefits system had to be reformed. Child tax credits were introduced specifically to increase the income of those households with the poorest children. As a result, the 2008 Budget book tells us that, in real terms, compared with 1997, households with children will this year be on average &#163;1,800 better off. In spite of what my noble friend Lord Giddens said about child tax credits not reaching the lowest levels, the Budget book tells us that households with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be on average &#163;4,000 better off. Tax credits are reducing financial differentiation among children.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08032768000196"></a>Money is not enough. In addition, you have to deal with the consequences of financial inequality on children in order to break the cycle of deprivation. To do this, a whole new sector of public services for the under-fives has been created. Noble Lords who read the <I>House Magazine </I>will have learnt that I took my youngest grandchild to the One O&#146;Clock Club at Brockwell Park, south London, on Friday afternoon. It is one of the 2,460 Sure Start children&#146;s centres established so far. That is where you can see for yourself Sure Start working and financial inequality reducing.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08032768000197"></a>Other things work, too. <I>Every Child Matters</I> was introduced in 2004. We have enhanced maternity, paternity and adoption leave and the children&#146;s element in the working tax credit. The results have

The independent evaluation report published on 4 March shows what a positive impact all this has had on the lives of children. This is important, because I hope that by now noble Lords will agree with me that income inequality between children is everybody&#146;s business.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08032768000198"></a>This is why I am concerned when David Cameron says that he would cut government investment in Sure Start in order to employ more health visitors. He said so on 15 March. I say to those on the Front Bench opposite that surely this would have the effect of increasing the income differential between children, not reducing it, and increasing the funding difficulties that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool described. Perhaps they think that, politically, it does not matter. I agree that reducing the differential is a thankless and expensive task, but it is brave and it is right. Right now it is something that may produce very few political dividends and so may be easy to cut, but eliminating financial differentials between children will be one thing for which this Government will be remembered. Irrespective of which Bench we sit on, we should all be prepared to play our part.</p>

My starting point is what is happening to inequality. There has been broad agreement that, generally speaking, the period from the First World War until the end of the 1970s saw a steady fall in the share of income that accrued to the top earners. That trend was then reversed and there has been a big increase in the share taken by top income earners during the past 25 years. UK experience in this respect has been pretty similar to the OECD average, although, as the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said, it is at the top end. At the bottom end, it is not just the Scandinavian countries that have seen a lesser increase; France and Japan are also in that category. Income inequality is now at its highest since the 1940s. As the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, pointed out, if it is not increasing, it is certainly not reducing. As for wealth, during the lifetime of this Administration, Britain&#146;s richest 10 per cent have increased their share from 47 per cent to 54 per cent of the nation&#146;s wealth.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08032768000200"></a>If that is the situation, why does it matter? Obviously, poverty in absolute terms matters a lot, but inequality matters a lot as well, because it exacerbates a whole range of problems, many of which have been referred to today. For example, several noble Lords talked about how inequality affects health at both ends of one&#146;s life, whether birth weight or life expectancy. Through the reduction in self-esteem that it brings, it helps to fuel crime. It undermines democracy, because, broadly speaking, the poor do not vote. It divides cities; it prices people out of housing; it heightens ethnic tensions; it is a barrier to opportunity; and it stifles social mobility. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds and the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, pointed out, it leads to debt.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_661"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 661</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08032768000201"></a>Most generally, inequality erodes the spirit of community. By contrast, I think that there has been agreement that a society that is seen by its members to be fair is likely to be a more content, happier society&#151;surely the kind of society in which we would all prefer to live.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08032768000202"></a>If inequality is increasing, concern about it, at least until recently, seems to have been falling. Even a generation ago, there was a real resentment among many people about the incomes of the rich and the plight of the poor. That has not gone altogether, but the real anger that drove many, especially those on the left, into politics has in many cases been replaced by a wearied acceptance that hedge fund managers, top lawyers, footballers and film stars will earn increasingly stratospheric amounts.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08032768000203"></a>Perhaps, however&#151;today&#146;s debate may reflect this&#151;there are the beginnings of a sense that that state of affairs is not desirable and should change. If so, what shall we do about it? Traditionally, if you wanted to reduce inequality, the place to start was tax. In particular, income tax was seen as the most powerful redistributive tool, and high rates of tax for high earners were advocated principally on redistributive grounds. Today, a very high level of personal income tax is no longer seen as politically acceptable or, in a footloose age, economically desirable. It was interesting that in the Rowntree poll that has been referred to three-quarters of people said that they thought that the income gap was too great, but only 32 per cent wanted it tackled by redistribution&#151;that is, by higher tax on higher earners.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08032768000204"></a>There are no doubt a number of reasons for that. A major one is clearly that many in the middle classes fear that any further tax hike will somehow hit them. There is also a fear&#151;if I may say so, the affluent are extremely adept at stoking it, as we are currently seeing&#151;that if the affluent were taxed at a high rate, many would leave the UK to work elsewhere and the overall economy would suffer. Partly as a consequence of that line of argument, some believe that higher taxes would reduce overall tax revenues and that, in line with the Laffer curve theory, we should be reducing tax levels to increase tax take. We are also increasingly hearing arguments that direct taxes should be reduced across the board to make room for new taxes to promote more environmentally friendly patterns of behaviour.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08032768000205"></a>Although all those arguments are in my view to a greater or lesser extent intellectually flawed, the fact is that they are advanced with such energy that virtually no politician&#151;perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, is an exception&#151;will now make the argument for higher direct tax rates. There is, however, great scope to rein in inequalities of disposable income of some of the most affluent by taxation measures. Noble Lords will recall that Leona Helmsley, the New York hotel billionaire, famously said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08032768000488"></a>&#147;Only the little people pay taxes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000457"></a>That has too often been the case in the UK. The Government are belatedly proposing measures in respect of capital gains tax and non-doms that begin to tackle the problem, but in both cases their  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_662"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 662</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>approach is too timid. In the case of capital gains tax, we support the idea that capital gains should be taxed at the same rate as income, which would mean in practice that many paid a rate of 40 per cent rather than the 18 per cent now proposed by the Government. In the case of non-doms, we propose that those wishing to retain non-dom status for more than seven years should pay taxes on all their overseas income, rather than the proposed non-dom poll tax of &#163;30,000. However, at least the Government are making some progress in those directions.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08032768000206"></a>Tax, however, will not greatly affect income inequality if the salaries of those at the top end rise at a much faster rate than those at the bottom. Much as I would like it, I am not a great optimist that voluntary restraint is about to break out. The back-scratching nature of many remuneration committees, for example, has made them an instrument for an upward ratchet in wages rather than a restraining influence. The noble Lord, Lord Sawyer, referred to that; no doubt his remuneration committee is the exception that proves the rule. The bonus culture in the financial services sector, which can see individuals earning bonuses of up to 10 times their salary, is particularly pernicious, for not only does it lead to excessive total income levels but it feeds the kind of reckless decision-making that fed the banking bubble that has now been so dramatically punctured. As the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, pointed out, the banks are beginning to discuss that. They need to do so for commercial as well as moral reasons.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08032768000207"></a>If reining back the income growth of the rich is necessary to reduce inequality, what about the other end of the spectrum&#151;improving the income levels of those at the bottom end of the income scale? The Government have done a number of things that have undoubtedly made a positive difference. We have heard about those this morning: tax credits, for example, and the minimum wage. However, there is much more that can be done, not least, as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, pointed out, in respect of pensions. The level of pension poverty in this country, especially among women, as he pointed out, is a national disgrace and needs to be tackled urgently.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08032768000208"></a>However, just as important as any increase in transfer payments from the state to the poor must be a series of measures that help people to earn their way to a decent standard of living. We have a lamentable track record in providing appropriate education and training opportunities for those who find the traditional academic route unmotivating and which therefore fails them. Here we are talking primarily about the poor and those from poor backgrounds. The report of the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, pointed out that, out of 30 OECD countries, the UK was  17th on low skills and 20th on intermediate skills. Seven million adults lack functional numeracy,  5 million lack functional literacy and tens of thousands of schoolchildren leave school virtually unable to read, write and do arithmetic. Two key initiatives need to be further supported in this area. The first relates to vocational education for those still at school; the second relates to apprenticeships. In

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08032768000209"></a>We will have the opportunity to debate some of those issues again in a month&#146;s time, but the message from today is that inequality matters. For too long, it has remained in the shadows of political debate. The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, has rightly put it in the spotlight today and we must all hope that it remains there.</p>

Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Newby, I will not have two goes at the subject because I will not be available when the debate in the name of the most reverend Primate is debated in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08032768000211"></a>I agree with the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, and with other noble Lords who said that it is a matter of both economic and social concern when there is massive inequality of wealth. Many of your Lordships have spoken with great feeling&#151;emotion, even&#151;on this. It is often argued that a lack of connection between the rich and the poor is divisive and damaging to society as a whole. However, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Desai, that this would be true if we were talking about absolute poverty, which the noble Lord, Lord Newby, spoke about and which, thankfully, we have not seen in this country since the Victorian era&#151;a point that was made in relation to south Wales by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno. Absolute poverty is where people lack the necessary food, clothing or shelter to survive. This debate is about relative poverty, which has been defined as the inability of a citizen to participate fully in economic terms in the country in which they live.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08032768000212"></a>The right reverent Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool introduced the subject of the north-south divide, and told us of his belief that relative poverty is greater in the north than in the south. I rather doubt that some who live in Leicester, Birmingham, London or Bristol would agree with him. We do not so much need policies that narrow the gap as to secure a rising income level for those at the bottom of the wealth scale. Too much preoccupation with differentials tends to obscure this more vital objective. I defy anyone successfully to argue that this is not a wholly positive, desirable and noble aspiration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08032768000213"></a>Neither I nor the Minister can rank ourselves among the professors of economics who grace your Lordships&#146; House. However, even I, who got as far as A-level in the subject, appreciate that wealth can only be created by providing something for someone at a price that they want to pay. Of course, the rewards that result would be greater than they otherwise would be if the levels of both corporation tax on the company, and income tax on the individual were reduced. This would be all very well for the manufacturer, but I note from National Statistics

This is not to argue for an increase in taxes, which would damage the economy as a whole, but it is to suggest that targeting the lower income deciles is the right approach.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08032768000214"></a>It has been argued that hedge fund managers, footballer players and the like, and even venture capitalists, contribute very little to the wealth of the nation and get gross rewards. Good is good, money is bad, in pr&#233;cis. I cannot condone this approach, which is so often based on jealousy, although I noted that the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, denied this in his particular case. Those who argue this way are wrong. What these men, particularly the money men, have introduced is a more efficient method of using capital&#151;capital, I might remind you, which can only be effective if it is used to finance goods and services for which there is a demand. If it is not used in this way, it will diminish or even disappear, and then there will be little or no financial rewards for anyone. If, however, it is used effectively, greater wealth will have been created for everyone, both rich and poor.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08032768000215"></a>It should be the duty of government to organise things so that poorer people can afford what they need. That is exactly why we have a social security system in this country. My noble friend Lord Patten is right&#151;the rich should support those at the bottom end of the wealth scale, not only by paying taxes, but through charitable donations. In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, parents who send their children to private schools are subsidising the education of the rest of society&#151;to a small extent, I accept. Unfortunately, over the years the social security system has become hugely expensive&#151;the DWP budget is now &#163;120 billion, which is mostly spent on 3.5 million people on inactive out-of-work benefits. It is also out of kilter, by which I mean that people are still getting benefits which are not appropriate to their circumstances.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08032768000216"></a>I have always believed that the basic reason for any Government&#146;s existence is insurance. This has many meanings including, for instance, defence of the realm, or the policing of our towns and cities, which do not concern us in today&#146;s debate. What does concern us is the provision of a basic level of income provided, if necessary, by the State, to those who through no fault of their own fall on hard times. That is the right of all our citizens. However, with rights go responsibilities, and it is the responsibility of those on benefit to do all they can to reduce state support for them.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08032768000217"></a>This Government believe, and I agree with them, that there are those receiving benefit who, even if they cannot cope with full-time work, should do such work as they can part time. The trouble is that the benefit system is now so complicated, and the tapers and withdrawal rates so severe, that for some there is no economic advantage in getting a job. This is the major challenge for the Government. If work does not pay, it will not be achieved&#151;I agree with my noble friend Lord Sheikh on this. The Government have made a bad situation worse here, not merely by removing the

Incidentally, this is much higher than the marginal tax rate for very rich people, which is set at 41 per cent.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08032768000218"></a>The Government are target-driven, and the most obvious target, indeed the primary objective of the DWP, is to eliminate child poverty by 2020, and on the way to halve it by April 2011. Child poverty is defined as those children living in households receiving 60 per cent of the median income, which was &#163;14,000 a year in 2007. By definition, this is a moving target. It is hardly surprising then that the Governmnet have given up on the half-way staging post of halving child poverty.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08032768000219"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Giddens and Lord Roberts of Llandudno, spoke about children. I, too, welcome what the Chancellor managed to achieve for families with children, even in these straightened economic times: the increase in child benefit and child tax credit; and the fact that parents&#146; income from child benefit will be disregarded when calculating housing and council tax benefits. However, even these welcome additions will mean that the target of halving the 3.7 million children currently living in poverty will be missed by between 450,000 and 800,000, depending on whose figures you believe&#151;either the TUC or what I understand came out of the various pieces of paper accompanying the Budget. Even so, the sums found in the Budget will certainly help to reduce the income gap of people with children.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08032768000220"></a>However, what help are the Government planning for single people and childless couples? As far as I can see, they are the people who now need help so as to reduce income inequality. To return from the particular to the general subject of this debate, the reason for the Government&#146;s encouragement to get more people into work is that it stimulates growth by triggering people&#146;s aspirations of gaining wealth so as to climb the social ladder. None the less, a degree of income inequality is not only inevitable, it is essential, to foster those aspirations.</p>

We may perhaps have a reprieve in a month or so and I am sure that we all look forward to further intensive scrutiny of the issues that have been raised today. We are also particularly grateful to him for the measured way in which he introduced the debate and for the questions that he posed. Underpinning it all, as we would have expected, was a strong moral stance on the concept of a fair society. Indeed, most noble Lords who have participated in this debate have stressed that dimension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08032768000222"></a>There is no doubt that there are areas in which it is difficult for the Government to act against excess. We all recognise the great difficulties in any international market in this respect. There does need to be a moral force in society and a requirement that wealth faces up to the responsibilities that it enjoys because of the power that it conveys. When that wealth is reckless and heedless of the greater good of society, excess may be to the severe detriment of the economy and the welfare of society. Indeed, aspects of the present financial situation reflect this. It is therefore important that we ensure that people who hold responsible positions in society act responsibly. In the private sector, that goes for the remuneration committees which deal with bonuses that may reflect contributions to society that are not necessarily for the general good. That does not, however, alter the fact that the Government recognise that we operate in a condition-free market in which a great deal of wealth is generated by the private sector but in which there are also responsibilities. One responsibility is the Government&#146;s: their management of resources and the decisions that they take on behalf of society.</p>

<a name="80327-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08032768000223"></a>I listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, who stayed true to the philosophy that has underpinned his contributions in this House and in his previous career with regard to the free market. He will have noticed, however, that he was almost the only noble Lord in this debate who mentioned public services&#151;I shall come in a moment to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Patten, who supported his noble friend on this, if I have time. The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, indicated that we need to keep taxation low and that little good may come to the wider society through public resources. How can we talk about equality or inequality in our society without mentioning the National Health Service? One of the great distinguishing features between our society and that of the United States of America is reflected these days not so much in the distribution of income between the top and the bottom but in the distribution of a public good in terms of a free health service, which is of great importance to equal rights, equal opportunities and equality in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08032768000224"></a>I stress that the Government&#146;s public expenditure on health services and education and in other areas has contributed to a fairer society&#151;a concept that has underpinned so many contributions to this debate. In stressing that, I come to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. We have been running an economy that, as he has freely recognised, has been successful for more than a decade in controlling inflation and producing necessary economic growth, which means that real household disposable income has grown substantially in the past decade. There has been a significant reduction in the number of children in poverty. Some 600,000 children have been taken out of poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08032768000225"></a>The concern has also been articulated that the Government are wedded to a target, but the target to reduce child poverty totally by 2020 and to halve it by 2010 is an estimable one. I know that it leaves us vulnerable to the charge that we are having difficulty hitting it. We all know that we need to redouble our

I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Haskel, who did precisely that.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08032768000226"></a>I listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, on the pensions position. I recognise that we have to make progress with regard to an increasing number of older people in our society and to pensions, which are a crucial issue for so many of them. In addition, we must consider a flexible working age and the ability of people to sustain themselves when they still have a contribution to make to society. However, the number of pensioners in poverty has reduced by more than a million under this Administration.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08032768000227"></a>The last major point that I want to respond to&#151;I hope I will also have the opportunity to reply to other detailed points that have been made&#151;was the one on which my noble friend Lord Giddens reflected. Employment is crucial to reducing poverty. The opportunity to get and to hold a job is a critical escape route out of the irretrievable poverty that settles on the workless. This Government take pride in the fact that there are record employment rates for lone parents in our society. Indeed, we have the highest number of employed people in any significant economy. These measures help us to respond to a debate which I recognise challenges the Government on issues that are fundamental to a fair society. Nevertheless, it would be remiss of me not to assert with considerable pride from this Dispatch Box the achievements that have been made, or to recognise that the debate has highlighted how much needs  to be done.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08032768000228"></a>On the stretching out of differentials in our society, I concede the point made by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, that those in the top 1 per cent have seen a significant growth in their resources in the recent decade or more, although that is against a background in which all incomes have risen significantly. There is a slightly wider measure than that. The growth in income of those in the top 10 per cent is not greatly above the median growth of incomes across society. It might be said that that is no answer to extremes of wealth&#151;when has it not been?&#151;but it might also reflect the fact that we can exaggerate the influence of the few when perhaps we should look at the quality of distribution over greater numbers than those in a restricted category, into which we put the hedge fund managers and the few who, with their reckless behaviour, have plunged us into considerable financial difficulties. Their impact on the real economy is quite limited.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08032768000229"></a>In the same way, I am not sure that noble Lords can sustain the argument&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Newby, raised this topic&#151;that the large numbers of working people who go to football matches resent the earnings of footballers, except when they fail. It is all fine and dandy if their side is successful and at the top of the league. We can exaggerate the politics of envy that might sometimes creep into some arguments about income distribution, and I am not at all sure that it stands up to real analysis. I was therefore grateful to both my noble friend Lord Desai for

My noble friend Lord Desai also said that the important thing for a Government to do on the question of distribution was to eradicate poverty. That is the moral case, the one that ought to drive government objectives, and is the one that will continue to drive this Administration against a background, as I have said already, where we have made substantial progress.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08032768000230"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, introduced an extra dimension to the debate and was followed, as far as the Welsh perspective was concerned, very closely by his noble friend Lord Roberts. The right reverend Prelates the Bishop of Liverpool and the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds brought out regional dimensions and the fact that communities in other parts of the country did not enjoy some of the more obvious extremes of wealth that are seen in London. However, I always say to my colleagues in the other place that one of the great distortions that Members of Parliament can have is that, when they think of London, they think of the arrival at a railway station and travel through the West End to the Houses of Parliament. If they went a little closer to Hackney and the East End of London, they would see the same regional deprivation that obtains in other parts of the country. That does not alter the fact that there is an argument about regional distribution and I emphasise that the Government are increasing their support to regional development agencies. They do very good work and I was in conversation only yesterday with someone who marked out the fact that employment in South Wales for one company was directly due to the incentives given and work done by the regional development agency. Good work can be done there, and we intend to increase resources to the agency.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08032768000231"></a>My noble friend Lord Giddens gave us the concept of trends. He is absolutely right: we cannot talk about issues of distributions as a snapshot, we have to look at trends of policies. There are aspects of the Government&#146;s policies that we never conceived could be fulfilled within the narrow framework of the four-year perspective that the parliamentary election cycle tends to determine these days. Nevertheless, he indicated that, while there are trends concerning aspects of the work of the Labour Government since 1997 that he castigated as being too timorous, considerable work had been and is being done to conquer poverty. I agree with him, of course: we cannot concentrate on limited groups of the poor alone, although they are undoubtedly the most important.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08032768000232"></a>I am greatly restricted on time, not least because noble Lords also pushed their time limits to a greater extent and were not entirely in keeping with the clock, but I promised the noble Lord, Lord Patten, a response. We do publish examples of measures and gains from the Budget. There are clear illustrations of the position as regards couples and lone parents. I will be happy to discuss that with him subsequent to the debate. He will recognise the constraint that I am under now and he will forgive me for that.</p>

I am all too well aware of the fact that with so many participants in the debate, some noble Lords are disappointed with my response today. I can say only that there is a second round to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08032768000234"></a>However, I want to emphasise that we have set out some quite critical objectives. We have established increased opportunity for work. We are concerned that work should be the option for people to get off benefits. We have introduced a national minimum wage, mentioned by some in the debate but certainly a critical factor for fairness in society. We have introduced pension credit, which has helped transformed the lives of many pensioners. We have been concerned, through child tax credits and working tax credits, to deal with child poverty. These are solid achievements of a Labour Government. It is redistribution in action. There is a great deal to do and we intend to carry on with that work.</p>

Tony Blair affirmed his ambition that, in our generation, we should leave,</p>

Good design enhances people&#146;s lives and transforms how they feel and behave. It can revitalise neighbourhoods; reduce pressure on the countryside; uplift and bring hope to neglected communities; reduce crime, illness and truancy; and help public services&#151;hospitals, schools, housing and transport&#151;to perform better. The Government have now rightly committed us to a zero-carbon standard for new buildings. There are empirically tested ways to achieve good design and there is no excuse for bad design.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08032768000243"></a>The costs of bad design are disastrous. In <I>Utopia on Trial</I>, Alice Coleman examined 15 design variables in 4,000 blocks of flats and correlated these with the behaviour patterns of residents. She found that as the design values worsened, litter, graffiti, vandalism, pollution and the incidence of children in care correspondingly deteriorated. Bad design leads to higher management and maintenance costs, earlier replacement costs, environmental costs and poor quality of life, worse educational attainment, worse stress, worse health, worse crime rates, social exclusion, and all the economic costs associated with these. In <I>Estates: An Intimate History</I>, Lynsey Hanley has written movingly of tower blocks that,</p>
<ul><a name="08032768000504"></a>&#147;sap the spirit, suck out hope and ambition, and draw in apathy and nihilism&#148;.</ul>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08032768000244"></a>In 1918, Lloyd George declared that there must be &#147;homes fit for heroes&#148; and, by 1939, there were more than 1 million council houses. The Tudor Walters standards stipulated generous scales and good materials. Aneurin Bevan insisted that quality should have precedence over quantity in public housing, as well as insisting on what he called,</p>
<ul><a name="08032768000505"></a>&#147;the living tapestry of a mixed community&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000464"></a>the avoidance of physical segregation by class.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08032768000245"></a>But then mistakes were made. In 1951, the new Government gave precedence to quality over quality in housebuilding. There was also the cult of the tower block. Le Corbusier was a great architect, but a disastrous social theorist, and many of his disciples were disastrous architects. Modernist architects were messianic. As Philip Johnson later said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08032768000492"></a>&#147;We really believed, in a quasi-religious sense, in the perfectibility of human nature, in the role of architecture as a weapon of social reform ... The coming Utopia when everyone would live in cheap prefabricated flat-roofed multiple dwellings&#151;heaven on earth&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000465"></a>The prophets and architects of utopia swept aside the survey evidence that people did not want to live in flats. Local authority leaders were enchanted by utopian visions for their cities. Paternalistic chief planners and city engineers saw that they could quickly and cheaply rehouse wholesale. Big builders made a fortune. Central government not only endorsed but intensified the utopian disaster. The Housing Subsidies Act 1956 rewarded local authorities with a bigger subsidy the higher they built. </p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08032768000246"></a>Other forces also militated against good-quality design and construction. Stop-go economics destabilised architects&#146; practices and contractors&#146; workforces. Systems building required little craftsmanship and there were fewer apprentices. The free-market ideology of the 1980s led to the dismantling of local authority architects&#146; departments, weakened planners and allowed shoddy builders a clear run. Oppressive central control and audit stifled creativity in the public sector. Capital gains tax exemption for owner-occupied homes and inflation led to properties increasingly being regarded as investment units to be traded rather than as homes. The mediocrity and meanness of much housebuilding generated public antipathy to development. Wanton destruction of built heritage produced an aversion to the modern and the different. Subordination of other design considerations to the imperatives of the motorist dehumanised environments.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08032768000247"></a>Much that was good was built in these decades, but we must learn from the bad experience. Since 1997, this Government have made serious attempts to improve the quality of planning and design.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08032768000248"></a>CABE was set up to work for improvement in quality of life through good design. It champions well designed buildings and public space, runs public campaigns and provides expert, practical advice. It works with planners, designers, clients and architects. Although it exercises no statutory powers, CABE has become an influential and creative force within Whitehall and across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08032768000249"></a>The Office of Government Commerce, which is responsible in the Treasury for public procurement policies, no longer insists on the cheapest up-front price, but now propounds the importance of economy in whole-life costs. The National Audit Office also supports far-sighted policies in the procurement of buildings. Although the picture of PFI remains very mixed and the contracting process is often unsatisfactory, there are signs of a better recognition that initial expenditure on design and quality will abundantly pay for itself in lower maintenance costs and better outputs of public goods, such as health and education. The concepts of social inclusion, intergenerational equity and sustainability&#151; language that we have come to use in recent years&#151;are all serving to engage us in better thinking about design.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08032768000250"></a>In 2005, planning policy statement 1, <I>Delivering Sustainable Development</I>, said roundly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08032768000493"></a>&#147;Design which fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area should not be accepted&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000466"></a>Paragraphs 33 to 39 say, in brief, everything that one would want in government guidance on the principles of good design. Planning policy statement 3, on housing, issued in 2006, is equally to be welcomed. To help translate the maxims of the planning policy statements into actual good practice the Government and CABE have promoted the appointment of design champions within Whitehall, local government, the health service and the housebuilding industry. Design quality indicators and CABE&#146;s &#147;design for life&#148; standard are helping to establish a common language and reference points for design quality. Pre-application discussions and design review panels are improving the planning process. Changes to the planning rules have given councils more scope to demand higher design standards. The Barker review of land-use planning and the Callcutt review of housebuilding delivery have emphasised the importance of design, as have the housing and planning Green Papers.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08032768000251"></a>All that is no less than is needed. In 2006, Richard Simmons, the chief executive of CABE, reported in <I>The Cost of Bad Design</I>:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08032768000494"></a>&#147;We continue to see badly laid out housing estates, hospitals that aren&#146;t fit for purpose, schools that aren&#146;t inspiring and public spaces that are green deserts&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000467"></a>CABE&#146;s 2007 housing audit found,</p>
<ul><a name="08032768000506"></a>&#147;far too much development that is not up to standard ... and far too little that is exemplary in design terms&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000468"></a>Only 18 per cent of developments were classed as &#147;good&#148; or &#147;very good&#148;. The quality of 29 per cent was,</p>
<ul><a name="08032768000507"></a>&#147;so low that they simply should not have been given planning consent&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000469"></a>CABE has also found that too many local development frameworks,</p>
<ul><a name="08032768000508"></a>&#147;lack a genuine vision for the area ... They are often not realistic or deliverable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000470"></a>So, as we head further into this period of intense building activity, what is needed?</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08032768000252"></a>We need a drive to improve skills. Among transport planners only about two-thirds have had any formal urban design training. The planning policy statements require high-quality design, but we still will not get it,  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_673"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 673</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unless we are lucky, if planning officers and members of planning committees have a poor understanding of design or lack the confidence to reject inadequate design. In 2004, a skills survey by the LGA found that 52 per cent of local planning authorities admitted a lack of design skills. More planning, one might suppose, is being done by consultants working for developers than by local authority planners. Local authorities need more firepower. Just as Sir Terry Farrell is the master planner for Edinburgh and my noble friend Lord Rogers advises the Mayor of London, should not more architects be assisting other local authorities as planning and design gurus? Planning inspectors need the design skills to ensure that poor-quality designs are dismissed at appeal.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08032768000253"></a>We must work to universalise best practice. Design champions should be appointed in all relevant bodies. In January 2007, only 65 per cent of local authorities had a design champion. Many said that they did not know how to use their design champion to best effect. Design champions need to have the standing, the time and the skills to be effective. Design review services should also be available everywhere. Legislation should empower the Secretary of State to make provision for design review panels and for their findings to carry weight at appeal. The new legislation should indeed lay a duty on planning authorities to promote high-quality design. Post-occupation analysis&#151; examination of how developments have actually worked&#151;should become normal practice, enabling us to learn quickly from experience.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08032768000254"></a>Planners and developers need to take to heart paragraph 43 of PPS 1, and ensure that there is genuine involvement of the community in the development of plans and designs. I visited Barcelona with my noble friend Lord Rogers and Sir Stuart Lipton, chair of CABE, to study how the authorities there had made such a success of new development. What was impressed on us was that Mayor Maragall not only had a passion for architecture and for his city, but had spent endless amounts of time meeting citizens in their own neighbourhoods, explaining, listening and responding. He also had power in Barcelona to raise money and take decisions effectively untrammelled by Madrid.</p>

<a name="80327-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08032768000255"></a>Paragraph 38 of PPS 1 states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08032768000509"></a>&#147;planning authorities should not attempt to impose architectural styles or particular tastes&#148;.</ul>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80327-0008.htm"/>



<p><a name="08032768000471"></a>If people want traditional architecture&#151;and very many do&#151;they should be allowed to have it, albeit constructed to sustainable standards. The debate about style should be won honestly. There should be no more hubristic imposition of the &#147;innovative&#148;. We need to think about how to structure rewards and penalties to encourage good design and construction. Long-term costs and benefits for society often are not aligned with costs and benefits for developers. Richard Simmons has noted that accounting and valuation methods often give low weighting to design quality. In the public sector, capital and revenue costs are usually allocated to different budget-holders. Often in the private sector, it will be someone other than the developer who gains from added value arising as the benefits of good design are gradually experienced. Equally, if the  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_674"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 674</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>development is sold off quickly, the developer does not have to incur the long-term costs of poor design. With land supply limited by planning, the value accruing from scarcity may far surpass the value added by good design. In favourable market conditions, should they come again, almost anything will sell and there is little premium for good design. Planners need to correct this market failure by rejecting bad design. The Government should add what pressures and incentives they can for good design. The Homes and Communities Agency will need capacity and commitment to require high-quality design. The housing and planning delivery grant should reward quality as well as quantity.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08032768000256"></a>We should set space standards that are more, not less generous. It will not do to create 3 million hutches. We must also ensure that enough time is available&#151;you do not get good design in a rush. Encouragement of pre-application discussion will help. In the hurry to get schools and houses built&#151;and I understand the reasons for pressing forward&#151;there is a risk that insufficiently considered and poor-quality design will be churned out.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08032768000257"></a>We need to complete the culture change that has begun. Our civic leaders in the 21st century, like their predecessors in the 19th, must aspire to the best for the people whom they serve. Indeed, they must insist on the best. Leadership at every level and a willingness to learn will be the keys to promoting good architecture and urban design. Nothing will be better for national morale. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08032768000259"></a>I will address my remarks entirely to that part of the noble Lord&#146;s Motion that raises the importance of design quality being taken into account by local authorities, with which I agree wholeheartedly, and then only in relation to one particular issue, that of good housing design in brownfield and greenfield edge-of-town housing schemes. These may seem a bit prosaic and humdrum compared to shards of glass and signature architects&#146; vaunting ambitions, skyline-changing statements and so on. However, in the mass, the three million houses that the Government predict will come off the production line will have much larger impacts on the landscape&#151;irreversible impacts on the landscape, changing it for ever. They will also affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. I hasten to add that I have no commercial interests to declare and am also out of sight and sound of any proposed developments affecting our homes in Westminster and the West Country.</p>

There have been advances in recent years with road schemes. They are never popular, but they have been made a little more acceptable because of the much greater attention that has been belatedly paid, after decades of complaint, to key issues concerning surface noise, landscaping, planting, light reduction and the lessening of pollution of the night sky. There has been something of a revolution by road engineers and designers in order to get the schemes through. We need much more of a revolution in attitude by two of the most important players in the mass home-building area&#151;the design departments of local authorities and the design divisions of our mass new-home builders. First and foremost, a rigorous approach by them should lead to building layout dictating highway design, rather than the other way round. There are still schemes coming forward that are based around highway design, which is generally unfriendly to community, landscape and the night sky. This approach is the first building block in creating an attractive new public landscape&#151;the framework for a well structured layout, making use of, and reflecting, local landscape and diversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08032768000261"></a>It cannot be easy<I>&#151;</I>I do not have these skills, I am an amateur&#151;to produce a master plan to build a scheme of 250, 500 or 1,000 homes on the edge of a town, embracing perhaps both brownfield and greenfield sites. The problem is that even if an attractive master plan is produced, it does not ensure necessarily that detailed good design will follow. That is the next frontier. This demands great skills by building companies, but they need to be guided with a firm hand by local authorities&#146; design departments and planners. Having spoken to and corresponded with designers and planners over the years, I do not think that either group has all the skills. Behind them very often are councillors with the very difficult job of implementing schemes that have been urged on them by central government&#151;build more houses in your region to meet the numbers thought to be needed&#151;often in the face of considerable controversy and concern by local residents.</p>

In local newspapers up and down the land, you see that councillors about to press the planning button are advised by officers to get that planning gain from developers&#151;as though the planning gain of a new zebra crossing, community centre or school, wrested from a house builder or developer, is in the end what local councils are really all about&#151;and, once that planning gain has come, that is it, their job has been done. While planning gains are significant in themselves, they sink into insignificance compared with how councillors should oversee the way in which schemes are planned and built. The biggest planning gain that any council anywhere in the land can achieve is always found in good and sustainable design, sympathetic to setting and heritage, giving the backdrop for the new community that is going to live in that area. Councillors need to wake up to the fact that this is their main responsibility. Some do, but not all. For such new developments will irreversibly alter the landscape, for better or worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08032768000263"></a>Too often, house builders still work from a pattern-book approach&#151;one design fits all. Affordable, two-bed, three-bed and then, right at the top end, a few four-bed and five-bed McMansions added on to give a touch of glamour on the margins. This must be why the chief executive of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, writing in his foreword to its housing audit in 2007&#151;a document referred to by the noble Lord in his excellent speech&#151;wrote that,</p>
<ul><a name="08032768000510"></a>&#147;the housing produced in the first years of the new century is simply not up to the standard which customers have the right to expect&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000472"></a>The chief executive of CABE was absolutely right in what he wrote. The approach that leads to this dire situation is one that I recall with amusement tinged with horror. A few years ago I was talking to the CEO of a major house building company at a private, informal gathering. I pressed him a bit about design. He turned to me and said, &#147;Design, John? Come on&#148;. At this point he lapsed into Anglo Saxon vernacular not so shocking that I cannot risk it in your Lordships&#146; House. &#147;We basically have the same patterns everywhere in the country and then we use a few gob-ons on the buildings&#148;. It took me a second or so to understand what these gob-ons were. I then realised that he was referring to the fact that in chalk country a flint porch is added, while in the Midlands they gob-on a little brick façade with a bit of what is probably plastic barge boarding. That sort of thing has done the UK house building industry no end of harm. Builders deserve the opportunity to build if the Government want them to, but they must do so in a way that is acceptable and gives customers what they want. We cannot have any more identikit design with a bit of locally derived façade stuck on the front.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08032768000264"></a>In conclusion, there is a huge opportunity for planning authorities, encouraged by the Government, to do what are often marginal things such as checking the designs for estates with huge trees planned for the edges. Those trees are planted as slips and take 20 to 30 years to reach maturity, so that is the ultimate deceit. It is in paying attention to little things such as minimising abrupt and harsh lighting on town edges that pollutes the night sky that in the end will help to deliver the Government&#146;s housing objectives. I look forward very much to hearing what the Minister has to say in response.</p>

He already had a distinguished international reputation, but I did not expect then, as I now do, to receive some of his mail through the House of Lords Post Office, including a letter this week praising the new Heathrow terminal.

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08032768000267"></a>It is now a quarter of a century since Foster, Rogers and Stirling broke through to the wider public with a new generation of remarkable architects in the influential Royal Academy exhibition. James Stirling died much too soon, but his name is carried in an international architecture prize, the Stirling Prize. As for Foster and Rogers, they have gone from strength to strength, and their world reputation stands exceedingly high. But there are many other outstanding British architects working at home and abroad, including our own Michael Hopkins&#151;if I may call him that, given Portcullis House. Outside the world celebrities, we have practices such as Edward Cullinan Architects&#151;Edward Cullinan was awarded the 2008 RIBA gold medal&#151;and MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, which has designed many fine buildings in our universities.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08032768000268"></a>It may seem invidious to name names, but architectural practices are usually marked by high quality individuals, dedicated and sometimes idiosyncratic. That is unlike some other professions which often appear to be anonymous. I can think of no structural engineer by name, although the profession plays a crucial role in major architectural projects. However, if the top 10 per cent of the architectural profession is outstanding, some should probably not be practising at all, and even very good architects can make mistakes. But despite architecture being a relatively poorly paid profession, many talented young men and women are seeking places to study architecture in our universities and colleges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08032768000269"></a>I hope that the profession has overcome the brutal, damaging and unfair speeches made by the Prince of Wales in 1984, when he referred to the &#147;monstrous carbuncle&#148;, and in 1987 when he made comparisons with the London Blitz, along with remarks about the British Library and other buildings he did not like. They were quite inappropriate given his status and disproportionate influence. Those were rather depressing years, including the acceptance of the public finance initiative that diminished the importance of design and put the contractor ahead of the architect in creating major public buildings.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08032768000270"></a>I have to say that the arrival of new Labour in 1997 greatly raised the morale of the profession and, more important, pointed towards even better architecture. In particular, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, already mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, and which is now a statutory body, has been a very good thing in advising contractors, architects, planners and clients. That is important, for without a good client, even a good architect cannot create a good building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08032768000271"></a>One great loss in the 1980s and 1990s was the role of the county architect. Despite some building disasters, the LCC in particular, and then the GLC, had many good architects. The model of an outstanding architect

His schools were, and still are, a byword for high quality design supported by a good client; they are pleasing to teachers and pupils alike. There is currently a large school building programme and I hope that these schools will be as good as those of Hampshire, despite what seem to be more complicated contractual arrangements. For example, in the London Borough of Camden there is to be a new academy school sponsored by University College, London, on a key site near Swiss Cottage. I hope that the design will be regarded as a model for other academies. Perhaps the Minister will explain in a letter to me the precise construction procedure&#151;that between the decision to go ahead with the academy and building to begin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08032768000272"></a>As for my concerns, some arise from success and, hitherto, a confident economy. As the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, pointed out, there are massive building developments in east London arising from the forthcoming Olympic Games, but there is inescapable pressure both on time&#151;it is sooner than we think&#151;and the budget. It must be tempting to cut corners in design and the quality of the architecture, but it would be unforgivable. Again, and in due course, I should be grateful if the Minister could explain the procedures and bodies responsible for establishing the permanent buildings and spaces which should last for many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08032768000273"></a>Recently I visited Liverpool, where I was born and brought up and which is the European Capital of Culture 2008. I rejoiced in the many exciting changes, but I am reserved about the building site now called Liverpool One because of its bulk. As for the huge conference centre, the Arena, it seems to overshadow the strong and historic Albert Dock area and draws nothing from the river. In turn, in Salford, BBC Manchester has a great opportunity for utilising first-class architecture in the major new developments and to redeem some awful buildings in Wood Lane and White City. I should like to know what is happening and to be reassured on the financing, given that Gordon Brown and the Treasury have cut the BBC&#146;s licence fee income to the bone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08032768000274"></a>As for housing, there are far too many blocks of flats in the private sector that do not appear to have used an architect at all. I hope that everything will be done to ensure that higher standards in social housing are achieved in the bold programme that Ministers envisage. But there is a degree of scepticism&#151;what an expert recently called &#147;an impossible aspiration&#148;&#151;about new homes becoming zero carbon emitting by 2016 and all new buildings three years later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08032768000277"></a>Lay person though I am, I believe that this is a golden age for design, for architects and for architecture. I see before me designers and architects at the peak of their professional potential, and I have observed their work in many locations. They are undoubtedly helping to create some of the most beautiful, sustainable and human-friendly buildings and spaces ever known. We should harness their knowledge, experience and skills at every opportunity. There is absolutely no excuse for some of the dismal failures of the past, as the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, outlined, or some of the mediocrity referred to both in this debate and in the CABE report. The profession&#146;s skills, abilities and initiative make such failures inexcusable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08032768000278"></a>In the university town of Middlesbrough&#151;particularly at the University of Teesside, of which I have the honour of being chancellor&#151;we have transformed our town by creating outstanding public buildings and open spaces and using outstanding architecture. The university itself is a tribute to modern architecture. From humble beginnings as a small Gothic college, it is now a beautiful campus in the town centre, with 10 buildings constructed in the past 10 years. Some are iconic, including an institute for digital innovation and a centre for creative technology. We have a new student union building and a new performing arts centre. We have enjoyed  12 major refurbishments over the same period.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08032768000279"></a>Alongside the university, bang in the middle of the town centre and costing &#163;14 million, we have the beautifully designed Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, designed by the leading Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat. The building has won several awards and is absolutely central to our town&#146;s drive for regeneration and renewal. It has opened the town hall area to give light, space and a completely new perspective on the centre of town. It has brought to life, in a way which was never possible before, the original, beautiful Victorian town hall building.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08032768000280"></a>Complementary to the creation of that public space is the Middlehaven project, a riverside development which is bringing the vision of the Tees Valley into being. It is growing where the town was originally founded, on riverside land that was dominated in the previous century and first part of this century by the steel, iron and heavy engineering works of the last Industrial Revolution. It is a place where people will live, learn and work in a new industrial revolution, with apartment blocks, houses, offices, hotels and leisure and entertainment facilities built to the highest sustainable and environmental standards and for people to enjoy.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08032768000281"></a>I cannot begin to tell your Lordships how important this is to a town that was blighted and damaged in the 1970s and 1980s by factory closures and economic decline. Initiatives such as those in Middlesbrough and similar ones in Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds and other northern towns and cities are rebuilding our regional economies and the lives of the people in the region.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08032768000282"></a>This is a short speech that applauds the Government for helping to regenerate our university, our town and our region. There is, however, still a north-south divide which was referred to extensively in the earlier debate on equality in your Lordships&#146; House. Economic and personal problems in the regions still need to be addressed and I do not want to minimise that. Too often, from a regional point of view, the debate on design and architecture is also London-centric. I ask the Government to keep up the important investment in the north. We have to battle every year for our share of investment against a range of other priorities, and we understand that. But my noble friends on the Front Bench should make no mistake: the regeneration of our northern city and region which I have outlined today is making an important difference to people&#146;s lives.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08032768000283"></a>I would also like the Government to value the contribution that architects can make to regeneration. My experience in this is very limited, but it seems to me that the profession has much more to offer than its usual contributions on design and build. It should be involved in regeneration and development work beyond the usual confines and expectations.</p>

<a name="80327-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08032768000284"></a>To the architects I say: well done&#151;but we want more involvement. Exactly 100 years ago this year, Philip Webb had just retired but Norman Shaw was still working, as was WR Lethaby. CF Voysey and CR Ashbee were at the height of their powers, and Barry Unwin and Raymond Parker were building the garden cities. All of them, as noble Lords will acknowledge, were undoubtedly under the influence of their forebears John Ruskin and William Morris. They laid down the standards of architecture for the people, not just in Britain but in Europe and around the world. Some of them were great influences on giants such as Frank Lloyd Wright. They are the foundations on which today&#146;s best architecture is built. However, they were more than architects, they were also social reformers. That is the bit that we need more of today. Architects are important agents for social reform and they should promote it. They should extend that part of their contribution. It would benefit us all.</p>

I am familiar with the noble Lord&#146;s interest in design from the time when he was Minister with responsibility for architecture. He kindly opened a beautifully designed block of apartments for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, of which I was then the chief executive.

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08032768000286"></a>In contributing to this important debate, I will confine my remarks, like those of the noble Lord, Lord Patten, to the design of UK housing, and address three questions. First, how do we recognise good design and where can we actually see it? Secondly, how can we secure better design through an inevitably imperfect planning system? Thirdly, how can we pay for better design when housing is already unaffordably expensive for so many?</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_681"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 681</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80327-0009.htm"/>


<a name="80327-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08032768000287"></a>On the first, it is not impossible to witness imaginative and creative design of new homes that fit harmoniously into their local context. Seeing these is believing that good design matters. Although the bulk of house-building in the UK is the subject of blistering criticism from the Commission on Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), a small number of private developers and quite a few housing associations have produced some really fine modern buildings sympathetic to their surroundings. As the housing associations increase their output, it is right to look to these&#151;now highly professional and well-motivated&#151;social businesses to show the way. Presentation Housing Association&#146;s Angel Town estate in Brixton, Wherry Housing Association&#146;s Brooklands development in Cambridge, the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust&#146;s new Art-Eco scheme in York, and so many more, demonstrate ways of integrating environmentally sustainable new homes into their localities.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08032768000288"></a>However, might these social housing providers, with their captive market, repeat the mistakes of the councils of the 1960s and 1970s which resulted in those dreadful concrete estates and ugly tower blocks that we are now demolishing? I think not, for two reasons. First, the mood of the age is to involve and encourage local people&#151;future residents, consumers, neighbours&#151;in decisions about these developments in a way that eludes the private sector house-builder. Secondly, the now universal practice of building mixed-tenure schemes of both tenants and owners&#151;not segregated, separated welfare housing for the poor&#151;means that homes for sale must satisfy the aspirations of purchasers who are making substantial long-term financial commitments and exercising choice in the marketplace next to the tenants in the social housing. Good examples exist of what we mean by better design. Hopefully, as the housing associations expand their work during the credit crunch now inhibiting other development, there will be increasing numbers of inspiring and influential new developments that we can see with our own eyes. </p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08032768000289"></a>My second question was how we can secure better design through an inevitably imperfect planning system. How can decisions be taken on good design when the staff of the local planning authority cannot be expected to have the expertise required to make difficult design judgments? Many councillors on the planning committee will have had little training in that discipline. After all, an architecture course lasts five years, and even then it may not include much on urban design. The Local Government Association&#146;s Improvement and Development Agency has a good planning advisory service. English Partnerships gives very good guidance on large-scale planning applications through its ATLAS scheme. At a national level, the Commission on Architecture and the Built Environment, as I know from direct experience, comments most helpfully on design aspects of important projects.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08032768000290"></a>How does all that filter through at the local level for the multiplicity of house-building applications? One very sensible answer is through local design review panels of unpaid volunteer experts who meet regularly to offer advice before planning decisions are taken. This commendable arrangement works well in a number of local authorities and could be extended  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_682"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 682</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to many more. The use of panels was supported by the thoughtful review of house-building delivery from John Calcutt. Although it brings with it some important governance issues&#151;members must have no vested interest, and a regular turnover of members is needed to renew the panel&#151;it has been shown to make a substantial difference to design quality at the local level.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08032768000291"></a>My third question was: how can we pay for better design when housing is already unaffordably expensive for so many? We have heard of the dismal design record of the UK house-building industry, which produces the smallest homes of any EU country; yet our house prices, relative to incomes, are already extraordinarily high. The house-builders argue that better design would add extra expense. Engaging an architect costs money, and better design may well mean higher space standards for greater accessibility&#151;the full lifetime homes standards, the subject of a Question earlier today&#151;and probably the use of more sympathetic and durable materials. To pay for buildings that are designed specifically to fit different local contexts, rather than using standardised pattern-book designs, would add to the cost and push prices further beyond the reach of many purchasers.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08032768000292"></a>If standards are low yet prices are high, where is all the money going at present? The answer is that the cost of land for each new home in this country has risen so far and so fast that, since there is a finite limit to the amount buyers can afford to pay, something has had to give. That something has often been the standards that go with good design. How can we break out of this negative loop of high land costs leading to poor design and bog-standard housing? The answer is by making planning consent conditional upon design requirements, thereby depressing the value of the land. The landowner always gets a residual sum once planning conditions&#151;including requirements to produce a certain number of affordable homes, to achieve environmental standards and perhaps in future to pay a community infrastructure levy&#151;have all been satisfied. Thus it is that the landowner, not the house-builder, ultimately has to absorb the cost of better design.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08032768000293"></a>It is already possible for local planning authorities to turn down developments where the design is abysmal, and I have addressed the question of improving the skills and confidence of planning authorities in answering my earlier question. It is through this route&#151;insisting on design quality, the cost of which must then be factored into the price paid for the land&#151;that standards can be improved without the purchaser or tenant, or even the house-builder, having to foot the bill.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08032768000294"></a>When the new Planning Bill reaches this House, will the Government be sympathetic to amendments that seek to reinforce the design elements in future planning decisions, perhaps through greater use of design review panels, so that the 3 million new homes that will be built in the UK in the next 12 years or so really will be a national asset for our children and our grandchildren?</p>

He has excellent timing, as the Planning Bill will be coming before your Lordships in a few weeks. I am impressed, as I often am when I am here, by the way in which quality of design is valued across the parties. I disagree with very little of what I have heard today.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08032768000296"></a>In any civilised society, well designed buildings and glorious public spaces should be a fundamental human right. Better design makes better citizens. Degraded buildings and public spaces degrade society; as Hazel Blears has said, they brutalise us. You need only compare the vitality of Notting Hill with the desolation of many contemporary housing estates to see the truth of that. Beautiful cities, however, do not just happen. From Amsterdam to Barcelona, from Copenhagen to Venice, the cities that we love to visit were created. They are the result of collaboration between clients, architects, builders, government agencies and local authorities.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08032768000297"></a>Ten years after John Prescott asked me to lead the Urban Task Force to assess how we could turn around our failing towns and cities, there is much to celebrate. This is the first Government to have actively encouraged people back into cities, setting clear targets for developing brownfield land and reversing depopulation; it is the first Government to appreciate that the compact, multicentred city is the only socially and environmentally sustainable form of development; and it is the first Government since the early 1940s to have set out a vision for sustainable, long-term change in our cities.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08032768000298"></a>There has been success in creating new agencies and new devolved government, too. In London, we have a mayor who has pledged to accommodate 1 million new residents within the city&#146;s current boundaries. Ken Livingstone has said that all new building should be on previously developed land, has set tough targets for affordable housing and lower CO2 emissions and has established a dedicated design team under my leadership. Cities around the world now look to London. Nationally, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment has been a major success, creating a focus for expertise, for design review and for helping to make better buildings, towns and cities across England.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08032768000299"></a>However, there is something wrong when, nine years after the Urban Task Force published its report, we still have no examples of regenerated neighbourhoods and cities in the UK that compare with the best in the world. There is something wrong when the Thames Gateway, Europe&#146;s biggest regeneration project, is still peppering the banks of the beautiful River Thames with shoddy, toy-town houses and Dan Dare glass towers. There is something seriously wrong when new houses across the country form rootless estates that could just as well be in Beijing, Buenos Aires or Belfast&#151;developments that have no regard for the community&#146;s sense of place, belonging or identity.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08032768000300"></a>I fear that we are building the slums of tomorrow. Why is this the case? It should not be. Britain has some of the best architects in the world, as we have heard. Indeed, only the USA has more winners of the Pritzker prize, recognised as the key international  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_684"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 684</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>award for lifetime achievements in architecture. The answer is simple: we are sidelining the talent that we have. In what should be a golden age for British architecture, our output is simply lacklustre.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08032768000301"></a>In November 2005, members of the Urban Task Force produced an update on the original report but, unfortunately, due to numerous ministerial changes over the last two years, no Minister has had time to take it on board or to respond to the recommendations. This exposes a government weakness. It takes at least 15 years and strong leadership for urban visions to become urban realities. In Britain, every policy is watered down through negotiation with countless agencies and every proposal is bogged down in endless process.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08032768000302"></a>As noble Lords may know, the first planes landed and took off from Heathrow&#146;s Terminal 5 today. When my firm started designing this building, I was a much younger man. It was 19 years ago. We have to speed up decision-making. We are entering a new era of devolution. The Government have empowered local authorities to play a stronger role in delivering 3 million new homes by 2020 and to lead the shaping of their towns and cities. This is great news, but to get it right we need to make sure that all agencies have the tools that they need.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08032768000303"></a>What needs to be done? I recommend action as follows. Trained architects should be placed at the heart of decision-making, at ministerial level in government and at cabinet level in local authorities. We must make sure that these design champions have the clout to make a real difference to decision-making. Design quality should be made a central corporate objective for every agency with an impact on the built environment, from the new Homes and Communities Agency to individual housing associations. All planners should have access to advice from skilled architects and vice versa. In my role heading Design for London, I am endlessly impressed by the way in which local authority officers go out of their way to seek advice. We need to make sure that they can get the support that they need. I recommend that we strengthen CABE to provide that support. CABE is one of the great success stories of the urban renaissance, but it needs a stronger regional presence. Why should local planners from Newcastle have to travel to London to get the advice that they need?</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08032768000304"></a>I propose that we clarify, simplify and reduce the number of delivery bodies&#151;Thames Gateway, for example, has over 30 authorities and partnerships involved&#151;and move towards establishing single-purpose, area-based delivery bodies. Architectural quality should be central to our public sector procurement. We should make design competitions mandatory where public money is involved, using the guidelines prepared by the Greater London Authority. Every city and district should be required to prepare plans encompassing existing public spaces&#151;the squares, parks and streets where friends and strangers meet&#151;as well as proposals for new space. Why should there not be a right of access to good public space within a few minutes&#146; walk for every citizen?</p>

Now they need to give our towns and cities the tools to finish the job. I hope that these recommendations will help to put those tools in place. Unless we empower and enable our civic leaders to create beautiful cities, we will not just repeat our past mistakes but condemn our children to live with them and in them.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08032768000307"></a>In my maiden speech in this Chamber, I expressed the hope that we might have an opportunity to discuss issues of planning and housing in London before too long, so I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, for giving us this opportunity today. It is gratifying that so many of the themes that I wished to touch on have been anticipated, but I hope that I will illustrate them rather than simply repeat them. I fear that I am not so sanguine as some noble Lords have been about the spirit emanating from new Labour. Only the other day, I was talking with someone who was trying to promote quality in design in school building. &#147;Don&#146;t bother with all that&#148;, was the message that she was getting from the department, &#147;just give us boxes to put children in&#148;. Boxes, hutches, what is the difference?</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08032768000308"></a>The debate is certainly badly needed, for what we are talking about goes right to the heart of the lives that people lead and the legacy that we leave to future generations. RIBA has said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08032768000495"></a>&#147;Design is about much more than aesthetics. It is functional, sustainable and gives pleasure ... It attracts people, investment and activity to places, and brings social, environmental and health benefits&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000473"></a>But of course what is needed is not just a debate. As RIBA goes on to say, design should be one of the most important considerations in new development. The Planning Bill should be used to entrench design into the planning process. There should be a statutory duty to consider the design quality of planning applications and local authorities should be encouraged to establish local design review panels or appoint local design champions. I would support this, so long as local communities, not just &#147;experts&#148;, were represented. Both the Barker and Calcutt reviews endorsed RIBA&#146;s recommendations and it would be good to hear an assurance from the Minister today that the Government will take these forward. But it is not just a matter of institutional reform. There needs to be a sea change in the culture surrounding the planning process, away from one dominated by the values of hard-faced accountants to one concerned more with quality of life and user friendliness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08032768000309"></a>In my maiden speech, I hinted at the baleful influence of the planning policies of the London Borough of Hackney on the lives of the residents of Dalston, where I live. The protocol surrounding maiden speeches precluded my going into greater detail on that occasion, but today I am under no such constraint. If I may, therefore, I shall describe for

Let me straightaway declare an interest as the patron of OPEN, a not-for-profit company of local individuals and businesses committed to promoting excellence in the quality of the built environment.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08032768000310"></a>When we heard that Dalston was to be regenerated, we had high hopes that this derelict, neglected and overcrowded area of east London would rise as a modern phoenix. We anticipated that our few remaining historic buildings would be given a new lease of life and inform the proposed development around them. How naive we were. The proposed development consists of two adjoining sites. The driver of the whole project is a site owned by Transport for London, which is building a new transport hub said to be vital for the Olympics. But there is no direct link to the Olympic site. Had it been 300 yards further on at Dalston Kingsland, it would have linked directly to Stratford as well as being much closer to the commercial heart of Dalston. When we protested about this to the London Development Agency, its reply was simply that this was by no means the only transport hub that was mislocated in this way.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08032768000311"></a>A massively expensive concrete slab over the railway will accommodate an unnecessary and potentially dangerous bus stand, where current routes will be cut short. TfL deployed a kind of circular argument: the bus stand is necessary to enhance the scheme and the scheme is necessary to finance the bus stand. A brutal phalanx of tower blocks of up to  20 storeys will be erected on the slab to help to pay for it. These will blight the environment and bring no benefit to the area. Of their 300-odd dwellings, none is to be affordable. This is in direct contravention of the Government&#146;s policy as affirmed both in this House and in another place. However, when we asked the Secretary of State to use her powers to review the scheme, we were simply told that the transport hub was essential for the Olympics.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08032768000312"></a>The adjoining site is being developed by the London Development Agency. It has similar disadvantages; moreover, it is aesthetically and architecturally unrelated to its neighbour. Together, they represent the worst type of unimaginative and destructive town planning. No more health and other services are to be provided for the total of 550 extra households. Such high density, in an already overcrowded and underresourced area, completely ignores the potential for alienation, anti-social behaviour and vandalism, as we have heard. As a criminologist, I know that this is not the way to build a housing estate.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08032768000313"></a>The two sites are separated by a strip of land overshadowed by the tower blocks, creating a sunless wind tunnel. This is the public space that the inhabitants of Dalston will have to make the best of for their leisure. Both schemes will be divorced from proposed developments on the other side of the road, in a kind of piecemeal development that lacks any coherence. Instead of design-led regeneration, we have the prospect of a sink estate in less than a generation.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_687"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 687</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08032768000314"></a>How has the travesty that I have described come about? Three reasons immediately come to mind. The first is a poor understanding of what constitutes good architecture and design on the part of town planners and developers. High-quality architecture and good design do not just consist of buildings, as we have heard. Buildings have context. Good design should blend with and seek to preserve the best of what exists already. That is why the residents of Dalston were so concerned to preserve what little was left of their historic heritage.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08032768000315"></a>The irony of a blind man lecturing your Lordships about architecture will not be lost, but I would say that good design appeals to all the senses. As a native of Edinburgh, I know about well planned squares and streets, gardens and open spaces. Other countries manage these things better. For example, some of your Lordships may be familiar with Montpellier in France, which I recently had the opportunity to visit. It has preserved its historic area, yet it has a modern quarter with a unified design, decent public space, trees and water features. You may say that they have more space in France, but even tightly packed New York has small pocket parks for the refreshment and enjoyment of its citizens.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08032768000316"></a>Secondly, consultation with the public was, to say the least, inadequate, even misleading. OPEN&#146;s submissions were even &#147;lost&#148;&#151;forgive my inverted commas. Nevertheless, local residents mounted vigorous opposition to the destruction of their heritage and the imposition of unlovely and unsuitable developments that were wholly out of character with the area. Their case was comprehensively ignored. The historic buildings were demolished, and a modern Gormenghast will rise in their place. This was said to be a once in a lifetime opportunity for Dalston. Instead, we are offered off-the-shelf, unimaginatively designed blocks of varying height, with no relationship either to the Victorian street pattern or to one another and with little aesthetic coherence.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08032768000317"></a>Thirdly, in direct contravention of planning guidance, these schemes have not preserved heritage buildings or enhanced the cityscape that remains. They meet neither of the mayor&#146;s much vaunted criteria that new housing should be built to the highest architectural standards and that it should be 50 per cent affordable. The council has waived social housing requirements and parking and space standards. The windows of inhabited bedrooms in adjoining blocks will be just five metres apart; Hackney&#146;s official standard is 21 metres. To fund TfL&#146;s bus stand, the council has also leased its site to developers on terms so unfavourable that they required the Secretary of State&#146;s consent. The Secretary of State refused to withhold her consent.</p>

<a name="80327-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08032768000318"></a>Why should all this be? The answer lies partly in the need to meet external and undisclosed financial imperatives out of a misplaced fear that developers would otherwise walk away, partly in developers&#146; ability to hoodwink poorly qualified planning officers into accepting substandard designs and partly in the ability of multiple authorities in central and local government to evade responsibility with a cynicism

I am sure that I am the least expert person speaking in this debate, and I warn your Lordships of the danger of a criminal lawyer speaking about architecture. Nevertheless, even as a mere consumer of our increasingly built environment, I have an acute sense as a lay person that we are so cautious and so set in our ways in this country that we are desperately underusing the opportunities offered by a hugely imaginative architecture profession. Architects have the capacity to create and to enable us to enjoy the world&#146;s finest and most environmentally sustainable buildings at every level and to a far greater extent than now.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08032768000320"></a>My complaint is not about great public buildings and other large-scale structures. Some of those are being built to the highest possible quality. My concern is about the vernacular&#151;about domestic and small business spaces in every population centre, down to villages and the rural countryside. Like the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, in another place I represented a Welsh constituency. His was mainly urban; mine almost entirely rural. Wales provides a useful microcosm of the state and progress of architecture and of many other aspects of life. Wales has seen much new development in the past 25 years. There are some remarkable small contemporary buildings in Wales, but I doubt whether they could be counted on the fingers of more than four hands at the most.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08032768000321"></a>Over the same period, cautious and defensive planning policy has led to an unremitting increase in mock-Victorian cottages, neo-Tudor townhouses and factory units that I would describe as post-nondescript. There has been a disease of bad architecture. The bungaloid growth has been like chicken pox over the countryside, while very good farm buildings that would have lent themselves to modernisation of the most dramatic and interesting kind have been left to go derelict. As a result, there are few housing developments, particularly in the private sector, anywhere in the United Kingdom using the best of modern materials and design.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08032768000322"></a>The dwellings of today should be light, spacious, warm, efficient and sustainable. Too often they are the opposite. However, the housing association movement, in which the noble Lord, Lord Best, played such an important role for many years, has striven at least in some places for the kind of standards he described in this speech, but it is rare to find the same aspirations, and very rare to find the same achievements in the private sector.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08032768000323"></a>Very few planning departments have the will or the funding to judge whether something different is good different or bad different. If it is different, you cannot have it&#151;that seems to be the rule. That makes it all too easy for refuge to be taken in the tried-and-tested  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_689"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 689</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>shelter, and the results are often disappointing. I reflect that very few of the finer houses, terraces and housing estates of Britain would have had a chance of being built in the current planning attitude.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08032768000324"></a>In areas where land is still relatively cheap&#151;relatively speaking at least&#151;some people might well have the will to construct the equivalent of the small Georgian mansion. Yet I feel sure that most local planning officers would have shown Mr Palladio the door rather than even unfold the second copy of his plans. In most areas potential developers know that they would be wasting their money even to go to an architect, let alone to suggest a house or estate be built at the cutting edge of design and materials. Too often design comes from a catalogue rather than an imaginative catalyst. The entrenching of design in the planning system is recognised by Planning Policy Statement 1 of 2005. However, if one goes outside the sort of areas that the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, described, there seems to be little palpable change, resulting in architects, planning advisers and builders tending to play safe. Therefore, I support the conclusions of the Barker review of 2006 and the Calcutt review of 2007 that good design should be raised to a new level of first principle in planning applications.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08032768000325"></a>CABE regional design review panels are beginning to have an impact and should continue to do so. However, it is now imperative that they should be rolled out to become available to every planning authority in the country, wherever it is and where most decisions are taken. The modern should not be messianic, nor should we presume the idealism of the pastiche. There is a real danger that what 70 years ago Osbert Lancaster described as &#147;pelvis bay&#148; is now being replaced by the horrors of &#147;pastiche pastures&#148;.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08032768000326"></a>My other theme is about the effort we make to showcase United Kingdom architecture at all levels abroad. There are, of course, some remarkable successes&#151;we have heard of one today. British-designed buildings abound abroad&#151;big, public buildings that will be iconic for centuries. However, in October 2006 I took the opportunity to visit the Architecture Biennale in Venice and the contrast between the British and German pavilions could not have been starker. The British pavilion was quite imaginative and moderately interesting. It made me determined to limit my number of visits to Sheffield during the next 12 months because it presented a depressing view of that city, despite being a pavilion that was community-based in its design.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08032768000327"></a>The German pavilion, on the other hand, contained multiple mini-showcases of projects involving many architects on every scale and throughout Germany, including public buildings, hospitals, houses and a baker&#146;s shop that I remember had been redesigned by an architect trained in the United Kingdom&#151;a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects. The exhibition revealed what one observes in Germany&#151;an enthusiasm, perhaps built on the enduring legacy of the Bauhaus, to embrace the new within and around the old. The Germans manage to do it at a micro level; why can&#146;t we?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08032768000328"></a>By our reluctance to share that approach we sell ourselves short both at home and in the international arena. I hope that this debate will provide at least some encouragement to those who are prepared to regard vernacular architectural design as dynamic rather than historic. If 3 million homes are to be built, that means 3 million opportunities for good architecture.</p>

I, too, want to speak about housing.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08032768000330"></a>The buildings where we live are our first and constant cultural environment. We are all profoundly influenced by the design of our immediate surroundings, probably in ways that we are unconscious of and only realise when we stay in different architectures. There is no non-cultural building, but there are homes whose building style, whose architecture, is a life-enhancing culture and there are those which are not.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08032768000331"></a>In the past we have put up a lot of those that are not life-enhancing. As my noble friend said, Lynsey Hanley delineates acutely the bleakness, corrosive social segregation and the resulting poverty of aspiration and easy move into crime&#151;estate-linked identities which sink with the estate, created by the architecture of successive governments&#146; housing policies. We need to remedy those estates and prevent their reappearance in Dalston, as elsewhere. We need to rehabilitate the attractive homes of earlier times, and we need to build new one in very large numbers which lift the spirits and make wholesome communities easy to grow. And all must be done sustainably without unnecessary stress on the vulnerable atmosphere of our planet. This cannot be achieved without design and high-quality architecture. But it can be done.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08032768000332"></a>Lynsey Hanley describes the rescue of Broadwater Farm. A few weeks ago I saw in Angell Town in Brixton the rehabilitation of exactly one of those estates, accompanied by new building, which created attractive, safe and affordable homes within a strong community, steered by residents&#146; own wishes. Nearly three-quarters of them said that they now felt safe, that they were satisfied with their new homes and that Angell Town was now a pleasant, friendly and attractive place to live. A few years ago, half knew a victim of crime and it was a deeply unpopular place to live.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08032768000333"></a>However, this sort of thing is not yet the norm. For that we need a cultural lead&#151;political leadership&#151;to promote as widely as can be done that it is reasonable, natural and feasible for everyone to have a good built environment. To make this a norm, it must be mainstreamed. But design is invisible in many national policies. Why does the Audit Commission, jointly with the Housing Corporation, in last February&#146;s report, <I>Better Buys</I>, on improving housing association procurement, make so little, in 54 pages, of design or architecture other than a nod to sustainability? The joint consultation by the Audit Commission and the services for social care, health, police, prisons, probation and education on how to

Yet physical design can make all the difference about accessibility and about social integration.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08032768000334"></a>What happens in schools? RIBA and CABE do good work on how to teach design and architecture as living subjects, but how widespread is the teaching that good design matters, that it can be chosen and that it must be available to the ordinary citizen? Where is the cultural champion in Whitehall whose task it is to promote attention to design? In the admirable plans for pensioner-friendly homes set out in <I>Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods</I>, developed by my noble friend the Minister, good design is implicit; but it could be made much more explicit. If all areas for regeneration have a holistic design focus like Sir Terry Farrell&#146;s magnificent new plans for the Thames Gateway, developers will want to build in previously abandoned areas.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08032768000335"></a>The private-sector review prudently set up by the Government last January does have it in its remit to look at &#147;the quality of homes&#148; converted and maintained by private landlords. Such quality standards would have to be monitored by local authorities. This brings us the role of the planning authorities and their support. One of their best supports is the CABE system of design champions; but fewer than 70 per cent of local authorities have them. As many noble Lords have said, there is an acknowledged lack of design capacity in planning authorities and they do not even have to consider design quality. This is perhaps the biggest area for structural change that the Government could look at.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08032768000336"></a>We have a good national framework with Planning Policy Statement 3, but you normally find people with design skills on the bodies which choose plans for affordable housing in other European countries. This is not a requirement here. There are widely respected regional design review panels under CABE&#146;s auspices, as we have heard, but they are only for major schemes, so it is hardly surprising that one-third of housing applications in the past five years was found to be substandard. The <I>Barker Review of Land Use Planning</I> and the Calcutt <I>Review of Housebuilding Delivery</I> recommended the systematic use of design review within the planning process. A national network of local panels, as described by the noble Lords, Lord Best and Lord Low, active from the beginning of the process, could make what are now wonderful exceptions, like the developments created by the social entrepreneur Presentation&#146;s design guide, part of the ordinary course of events.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08032768000337"></a>Everyone has a right to the well-being which can be induced by good design and architecture. We could do it once, with our pioneering garden cities and social housing copied all over the world. We have done it here and there since. We can do it again, for the many, not only the few, with our brilliant architects. Derek Walker, the architect of Milton Keynes, said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08032768000341"></a>The outcomes to which a number of noble Lords have referred, and which have been well-documented by CABE, suggest that an awful lot of decisions have not been based on that sort of advice, so even the best of planning authorities cannot be expected to get the decisions right.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08032768000342"></a>I am not a qualified architect, but worked with and for architects for more than a decade. I have a huge amount of respect for the profession. In the early 1970s, I was responsible for planning policy at the RIBA. I remember during that period sitting in the public seats in the Committee Room at the other end of this building, listening to the then Conservative Minister decide how to compromise on the allocation of planning powers between two levels of authority, as part of the local government reorganisation legislation of the 1970s.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08032768000343"></a>Faced with the competing claims of counties and districts, he ignored the good biblical example of King Solomon and cut the planning baby right down the middle, with plan-making going to the higher authorities and plan implementation, through development control, going to the lower authorities. Through great areas of the country&#151;wherever there was not a unitary authority&#151;that split has had devastating effects, not least, of course, on the planning profession itself. The career prospects in the smaller development control authorities were very limited, while those in the higher plan-making authorities were necessarily conscribed, because they could not see what was going to happen in terms of implementation. Impermeable glass ceilings were appearing everywhere that those two levels of planning authority were installed.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08032768000344"></a>In the three decades since, the situation has deteriorated further. It could be&#151;and the Minister will be well aware of these issues&#151;that the creation of new unitary authorities will give us a new opportunity to put that right. By bringing together planning expertise to fulfil both functions, we have a much better chance of a well-rounded expertise and experience, with all forms of specialist within one department, serving the community at large.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08032768000345"></a>As the noble Baroness knows, I welcome the fact that Cornwall will be one of the authorities able to do precisely that. Bringing together those responsibilities, so that implementation and plan-making are within the same departments&#151;and councillors are well-served by people involved with both&#151;will be a great step forward. However, there is a long way to go, hence the importance of my question to the Minister. I hope, in particular, that she will be able to give us some indication of the trend over recent years.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08032768000346"></a>Early in my time at the RIBA, I was responsible for a project entitled &#147;Long life/Loose fit/Low energy&#148;. I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Rogers of Riverside, may even remember that; it was a long time ago&#151;forty years ago. At the time, it needed some explanation. Today, I believe that it has come of age as it is now fairly obvious what it is all about. I believe that the profession has adjusted to those important criteria. I am not sure that the community at large or, in particular, clients have&#151;whether in the house-building industry or anywhere else. We took as examples opposite extremes that clearly met the requirements of LL/LF/LE and those that equally blatantly did not. The Georgian terrace house was clearly a good example. With substantial load-bearing party walls but lightly constructed interiors, it might change its usage and character several times over the centuries, even through several decades: family home; business premises on the ground floor, perhaps with family use above; full use as office; doctor&#146;s surgery; split neatly into flats; and even back to family homes again, as has been the case in more modern times. Indeed, it was fairly economic both to heat and insulate.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08032768000347"></a>However, the contrast with what was being built as hospital or school buildings in the 1960s and 1970s was extraordinary. I remember a very distinguished architect who worked particularly with hospital buildings&#151;Alex Gordon, president of the RIBA&#151; explaining to me that, during the course of the design, planning and construction process for a major hospital building, which would take at least 10 years and sometimes longer, the consultants, each with an individual, not to say idiosyncratic view of medical and clinical necessity, would change the whole thing. There would therefore be major changes in the resulting design in just that period. The design brief and specification would change, each time at considerable cost. In his view, the only sensible way to plan for those sorts of buildings on a long-life, loose-fit, low-energy basis was to build a very basic shell. He thought that aircraft hangers were probably the best way to provide that shell, which the hospital management could fit it out temporarily and cheaply and then move on with the next medical fad coming from the consultants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08032768000348"></a>Energy is obviously topical while the Climate Change Bill is going through your Lordships&#146; House. There has been great emphasis this afternoon on house building, particularly the domestic residential sector. I shall do the same. Of the UK's carbon emissions, 27 per cent are produced by the electricity, gas and oil used to heat, light and power our homes. This is twice as much carbon dioxide as our cars produce. Cutting greenhouse gases produced by our

If we had the same home efficiency levels as Sweden, the average householder, every single one of us, would save nearly &#163;400 a year. Three quarters of the housing stock to be used in 2050 has already been built. Just sorting out new build from now on will only make a fairly modest contribution to that target. These figures do not include other building types which will be just as important, if not more so. Nor do they take into account the energy currently used in traditional forms of material and construction usage. There are major issues to be addressed in that context.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08032768000349"></a>Architects are fully immersed in these environmental issues throughout their training and career development. Energy use in construction materials and usage, quite apart from eco-friendly design for sustainable buildings over ever-increasing lifetimes&#151;we must hope&#151;are wired into the architectural mindset from the very beginning. I know that the RIBA now spends a great deal of effort ensuring that architects are doing excellent work on the low-carbon agenda throughout their careers. Sad to say, that will not be seen in many new buildings, especially in the speculative residential sector, to which much reference has been made in today&#146;s debate, simply because no architects are involved in that process.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08032768000350"></a>I am back to my original question, and I hope that the noble Baroness will be fully briefed by the time she rises to her feet. How many planners have the necessary expertise and experience to make this vital contribution to the quality of the design of our built environment? That is why this debate is so timely.</p>

I declare an interest as a very part-time consultant with HLM Architects. I am a consultant on public policy issues, not architecture, and was going to claim, along with the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, the distinction of being the least experienced or knowledgeable person to speak in this debate. I speak, in part, on the basis of some years&#146; experience as chief executive of the NHS and Permanent Secretary in the Department of Health.

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08032768000352"></a>This may indeed be a golden age of architecture, but my starting point is to question whether architecture and its related professions always do enough to influence their clients and the public about the importance of good architecture and design and, indeed, to explain what it is. As lay people, we all carry around in our heads rather different versions of what high-quality architecture and design quality are. You might have wanted me to say &#147;to educate&#148; the public, rather than &#147;to influence&#148;, but I am not sure that this is education, which seems to me to be very one-way and top-down.

Let us engage with you, and influence.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08032768000353"></a>After all, a lot of the discussion about quality and design can feel highly technical to the lay person. It is sometimes quite theoretical, often very sophisticated and, in appearance at least, pretty elitist. Our understanding, as lay people, is made more difficult by the fact that very few of us are involved in more than one major building project in our lives. We are always, or almost always, beginners. And, of course, what is contained in the terms used in this debate on &#147;high-quality architecture&#148; and &#147;design quality&#148; is very wide-ranging and open to disagreement and interpretation. The task that architects and designers have is not, by any means, easy. How do they reconcile all the different aspects such as the aesthetic, the spatial, the ease of use, the environmental, the social and the economic, to name a few, let alone the vast difference in viewpoints? No doubt it is largely about the balance between all these things, between the aesthetic and the utilitarian, the beautifully functional and the functionally beautiful, things that are fit for purpose, durable and a pleasure to use.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08032768000354"></a>One aspect of high-quality architecture is the functionality of buildings. I know the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, and others in his recent debate talked about the importance of creating a healing environment within hospitals and other health facilities. They drew attention to research which shows that there are real, tangible benefits in terms of faster healing, less stress for staff, and patients in mental health establishments having fewer episodes of aggression. This is clearly a vital function of a healthcare building that should be in the design from the outset, but often is not. This point needs much more attention and, in turn, perhaps, more research so that we understand more fully how it works.</p>

<a name="80327-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08032768000355"></a>I do not want to replay that earlier debate, but rather to pick up on a different aspect of architecture and design that very strongly needs, in the words of this debate, to be encouraged; that is, the social aspect. I am indebted to colleagues at HLM, Chris Liddle and Les Welch, for helping me to understand how big a part social and community function and impact can and should play in high-quality architecture and design quality. This is not only about the social or community role that the building may have as a school or, indeed, a hospital, or about the contribution that the development may make&#151;or, as my noble friend Lord Low has said, may not make&#151;to social and economic regeneration. These are both massive. It is also about breaking down barriers of all sorts, such as the barriers between the community and the development. How integrated, how user-friendly is it?</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08032768000356"></a>It is also about breaking down barriers within the community itself. Let me illustrate this last point. We increasingly understand that there are good health and educational reasons for making better links between health and education facilities. Physical activity, diet, surveillance, mental health and health education all have a part to play in both areas. I have   


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_696"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 696</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seen physiotherapy gyms in schools for children with walking problems; exercise facilities and classes in GPs&#146; surgeries; and children learning about trauma management in hospitals. Too often, however, we plan facilities within tight constraints, not allowing for overlap and reinforcement and, in doing so, create gaps and dislocations between things that should be linked. Therefore, we create problems.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08032768000357"></a>I hope that your Lordships will not think that I am stretching the notion of high-quality architecture too far by including such social considerations. Buildings shape what happens within them, but they also describe and even shape the way that we see things within the world. After all, we need only look across the river to St Thomas's to see how Florence Nightingale's original hospital not only responded to clinical needs but, as she intended, influenced and helped shape clinical and, subsequently, societal behaviour. It still does. Think, for example, about how we understand infection control or the importance of fresh air flows for health&#151;in our lives, not just in our hospitals. It is worth noting that, like all designers, she did not get everything that she wanted. In particular, she did not want the hospital to be so central to this great city and beside the &#147;great stink&#148; of the river, which was so antipathetic to healing.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08032768000358"></a>Today's great public clients, the Government and the NHS, should of course be able to exemplify high-quality architecture in all its aspects, including the social. They do so very successfully on many occasions; there are many examples of that. I think of the new Birmingham University hospital, currently under construction. It is a huge regeneration project, creating up to 2,000 jobs in the short-term but  also building a health hub, a learning and skills centre for long-term unemployed people, thereby enabling 750 previously unemployed people to gain employment. It embodies the other qualities of high-quality architecture: it has high design values, meets its sustainability and environmental requirements and is open and welcoming.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08032768000359"></a>Finally, I turn to the process of planning and approval and to the call of the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, for design quality to be taken into account by local authorities. Again, I speak as a layman who does not understand the intricacies of the system, but one who has seen many NHS boards struggle with the planning, design and building of facilities of all kinds. </p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08032768000360"></a>Why are we not always successful in getting what we want? Part of the answer is financial: the fact that the financial, funding and economic considerations are not only so important but so complex and time-consuming that they can tend to overwhelm other considerations. Another part of the answer is that design considerations often come too late in the process. Another is that the whole process is not simple and that there are tensions and conflicts between different goals. A single example that summarises this for me is that patients may well want a building where the windows can be opened, but the energy consultants will certainly want a sealed unit. How do we reconcile the differences that will come up in the design process?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08032768000361"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, is right to want local authorities to take design quality seriously, and I note that proposals will come forward for the consideration of design quality to be a statutory requirement for local authorities. I have some sympathy with that, but my greater sympathies are with the view that there should be wider use of design review panels and design champions. I am with my noble friend Lord Low in saying that the panels should not consist purely of design experts. It is important that the discussions are not conducted in a private language of reference and concepts that lay people do not share. High-quality architecture and design is too important to leave entirely to the experts.</p>

I have to declare interests as a vice-president of the Town and Country Planning Association, as joint president of London Councils and, although I hesitate to do so after the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, as having a connection with the Greater London Authority.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08032768000363"></a>The case for encouraging high quality, the title of this debate, is really a no-brainer, because quality is always to be encouraged. In the case of architecture and design generally, it is so important to one&#146;s well-being, both physically and mentally, as noble Lords have said. My spirits lift when I see both Westminster Abbey and the London Eye. Conversely, poor design, leading to a lack of care and affection, affects the physical environment and, as the noble Lord, Lord Rogers of Riverside, put it, degrades society.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08032768000364"></a>We have to define the terms. Quality now clearly encompasses sustainability&#151;in both construction and in operation, indeed, in the life of a building. I am shocked that we are now on the third generation of buildings in London&#146;s Docklands. It may be that the first and second generation buildings were not that good, but it is awfully wasteful. The initial outlay does pay for itself, as the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, said.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08032768000365"></a>For a time, I chaired the planning committee of the London Borough of Richmond-upon-Thames. I was chair of the committee when the Richmond Riverside Development was constructed. It had consent before the Liberal Democrats took control of the council, so we inherited a scheme. I would have been much more comfortable, and perhaps more enthused, by something that was not traditional, not pastiche&#151;the word that a lot of people applied to the riverside&#151;but something splendid and modern whose form expressed its function. However, I am not sure that I would have been right about that. It was so clear, after the development opened, that people enjoyed it. They took pride in their own place&#151;a point which picks up on what the noble Lord, Lord Sawyer, said&#151;in the buildings and spaces which were liberated by the development. The importance of spaces, and of the public realm, is something that many noble Lords have touched on. I wonder whether we should be attaching status to spaces as much&#151;or even more&#151;as to buildings. Certainly, in London the spirit of the princes of San Gimignano seems to live on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08032768000366"></a>However, the difficulties are much greater in the smaller, less significant schemes. The big schemes&#151;the big buildings&#151;attract public debate and the resources of organisations and authorities. They allow for pre-application negotiations. There may be a lot of controversy revolving around style and taste, but the basics of how people move around, for instance, are likely to have had proper attention&#151;or they should have had. I share the concerns expressed about the Thames Gateway&#151;so far, at any rate; let us not be too negative about the future. The debate about the gateway too often seems to have taken on an air of desperation about numbers. It must not be a case of the little boxes, made out of ticky-tacky, all looking just the same, which the noble Lord, Lord Lowe, did not quite say.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08032768000367"></a>The day-to-day&#151;I would not call it humdrum&#151;business is much harder. There is a shortage of planners. There is a shortage of training of planners. I can answer my noble friend Lord Tyler&#146;s question&#151;and he knows the answer&#151;which is, not enough. Nor do I get the impression that there is much training these days for members of planning committees, although I am well aware that many of the professionals would say, &#147;Don&#146;t let the politicians anywhere near the design&#148;.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08032768000368"></a>Design panels have been referred to. I confess to a slight sense of unease about bringing in experts, because what is the implication for those whose job it is to reach decisions and to undertake the work? PPS1 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08032768000497"></a>&#147;Good design is indivisible from good planning&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000474"></a>That is quite right. However, it does not seem to be easier to refuse an application on design grounds. Is that not the crunch? I thought that PPS1 was rather a good, short, analysis of both quality and design. However, I found it difficult when reading it&#151;as I did again, yesterday&#151;to see how one could reach a decision using PPS1 other than on the very functional criteria on what is described as &#147;beyond aesthetic considerations&#148; in the paper.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08032768000369"></a>When I became chair of the planning committee&#151;I am horrified to realise that that was  25 years ago&#151;I was told about the traditional stand-off between planners and architects. I do not know whether it is better now&#151;I hope it is&#151;but I feel some need to defend the planners from criticisms made by, among others, my noble friend Lord Carlile, whose skills as a criminal barrister proved to be very relevant to this debate. Architecture seems to breed a supremely self-confident and assertive group of professionals, and it must be very tough for planners to hold their corner against them. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, put it rather more politely.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08032768000370"></a>Planning tends to be, even though it should not be, in essence reactive and regulatory. I have not heard much this afternoon about that, but it is important to understand how planners and the planning system function. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, referred to local authorities&#146; design departments. That is not an animal that I know. I do not think that local authorities can afford design departments. Speakers expect a great deal from planners&#151;more, I think, than they have the tools to deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08032768000371"></a>Reference has rightly been made to local community engagement. The noble Lord, Lord Best, referred to the mood of the age being to involve. My noble friend Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank talked about the need for a good client. I regret that I cannot remember who said it, but someone said earlier in the debate that the place is the client. It is not, however, the only client. For the past six years, I have worked in the Greater London Authority building, where the client has been the Government Office for London, not the occupants of the building. I give this small example. The building is iconic, admirable and in many ways wonderful to work in, but if it had been possible to ensure that all the political groups working in it shared the same water coolers, the building and the people in it would have functioned differently. That perhaps is the post-occupation analysis to which the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08032768000372"></a>The everyday presents challenges that are as least as great as the big schemes.

Debating it in this form enables us to look at it in the round and in a fairly abstract way, but at the same time with a strong sense of agreement&#151;in principle, at any rate&#151;on what we would like to see in the communities that we all serve outside.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08032768000374"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, was being very modest when he tried to claim to be the most ignorant person here today. I thought that that claim belonged to me, although I am not going to compete particularly for it. The truth is&#151;this is one of the wonders of this place&#151;that we bring a breadth of experience to a task such as this. The end result is that we usually have, as we have had so far, an extremely good debate and all feel better as a result. If a little collective wisdom rubs off in a small way outside&#151;sometimes I despair that it will&#151;we have a major achievement on our hands.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08032768000375"></a>I declare an interest. I have sold land for building and I still own land which might go for building. It is as well that that should be understood. It gives me very particular experience in relation to the debate. I have also served for five years on a county planning committee, an institution sadly defunct although the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, may be able to revive it in Cornwall. Of course, it will not be called a county planning committee but the Cornwall Planning Committee, and that will perhaps be a good thing.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08032768000376"></a>I was also pleased to hear from the noble Lords, Lord Carlile of Berriew and Lord Low of Dalston, what I might call a somewhat agnostic approach to the institutional structures that we have to rule, regulate and develop our planning systems and control development. When the job is done well, the result is a town or a village that looks and feels good and then

Not least of the problems that we face, which have not really had a great deal of discussion this afternoon, is how we prevent communities that were formerly good from becoming sink communities. It can happen accidentally over time by a process of drift and I do not know how we stop that. Equally, the opposite process can suddenly take place. Communities can begin to pick themselves up again and there is a very real sense of hope.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08032768000377"></a>Nearly 35 years ago, I was responsible for the whole of the building estate of Essex County Council&#151;not that it was my personal responsibility to look after day-to-day details. I had to control the whole of the maintenance and services budget for those buildings. It was a very interesting experience. Obviously, the buildings had developed over a long period. What I particularly want to talk about in this context is the estate of buildings I inherited, so to speak, that had been built just after the war. In those days, they were built to cost limits set by the Government. That particularly applied to educational buildings. That was the way the system worked. I pay huge tribute to the architects who produced those buildings. They produced volume for very low cost because that was what they were required to do. We needed new schools in the county and it was a very successful programme. We need to remember all the time the context in which people and society are working.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08032768000378"></a>Fifteen years later, of course, we had the most horrendous building maintenance costs and hugely expensive energy costs to keep these buildings warm. They were frame buildings with cladding panels, too much glass, no insulation and so on. One of the results of that was that we put in place a study to see what we should do about building quality. Essentially, the study showed that, if we could reduce the annual running costs of a building by 5 per cent or more per annum, we could afford to double the amount we spent on the building in the first place.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08032768000379"></a>The beginnings of a good architecture preceded 1997 and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment by some considerable amount. Indeed, I have an abiding memory of the improvement in London when we began to clean the city up again.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08032768000380"></a>I am somewhat sceptical about our institutional structure. All the time, we need to remember the great buildings that we long to preserve and the wonderful small communities. We should think of the beautiful architectural arcades in big cities and the wonderful stone in the towns and villages of the Cotswolds. In East Anglia, timber-framed buildings are stuck together cheek-by-jowl and there is an immense difference in character as one goes along the street. Early Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian structures are interspersed with ancient structures. They are higgledy-piggledy buildings in conservation areas, which we fight to preserve, and they were constructed without the benefit of any planning system whatever.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08032768000381"></a>I often wonder what the modern conservation societies might have had to say if they had seen Sir Christopher Wren&#146;s plans for St Paul&#146;s Cathedral before it was built. One can imagine their approach. They may have said, &#147;Not in the British tradition. It is  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_701"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 701</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out of scale and out of character&#148;. They may have said that it was Romanesque or even&#151;perish the thought&#151;popish. All those things would have been said of the glorious building that is central to London and an example of what we seek to preserve here. When I am thinking about the London skyline, I think of the Victoria Tower. When it was built, it must have had a dramatic impact on Westminster Abbey, particularly when the rest of this building was added. I am told that when it was built, it was the tallest square tower in the world. We need to remember that progress sometimes is not the way we perceive it to be immediately. In time, our successors may judge things very differently, but that is not to say that we should not make every effort we can to get design improved.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08032768000382"></a>We also need to be sure that there is a clear distinction between design, which has to do with an agglomeration of property, and architecture, which&#151;in deference to the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, if he will forgive me&#151;seems to be about a particular building. Design is particularly important. If I want to see good, domestic architecture, I go abroad, by and large. In this country, planning committees have all too often reduced everything to the lowest common denominator.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08032768000383"></a>There is hope and I look forward to a better quality of design all the time. But, ultimately, it will depend not particularly on planning committees and our institutional structure, but on people who want to have land developed to a high standard; on architects and designers working together to create good design; on financiers accepting that; and, most of all, when the chips are down, it will depend on the client being prepared to buy it and not to buy anything that is not good design.</p>

I join other noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lord Howarth for creating this opportunity and for, as with every debate in this House, uncovering such a wealth of expertise and experience. For example, I did not realise that so many noble Lords had served on the RIBA, and it is always intimidating to find that out at this stage of a debate.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08032768000385"></a>In the tour de force that my noble friend Lord Howarth introduced, he described the power of good design and the blight of bad design. Much of what noble Lords have said has said has left me reeling at their wonderful examples, as well as being very mindful at their examples of poor and bad design that we all live with still. There has been some wonderful language. I particularly hope that the notion of the post-nondescript passes into the lexicon of what we do not want to see.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08032768000386"></a>There has been an implicit debate about the relationship between good architecture and social reform. Such debate is apposite in this great, iconic building, designed by an architect who placed such emphasis on the moral influence of architecture, and spent so much time thinking about the way in which  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_702"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 702</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>architecture mediated behaviour. It is an interesting example of that. The debate is timely for many reasons. Design is a big idea and should be a bigger idea&#151;but it is certainly a big idea for this Government. We are on the threshold, as noble Lords have said, of several different things that make this a critical point in our architecture and design history. We are on the threshold of the most ambitious 20-year programme for building new homes and communities. We are in the midst of a renaissance of our city centres, to which some noble Lords have paid tribute. We are in the midst of a programme of social and economic regeneration and housing change in areas of the country that for a long time have been victims of economic catastrophe, as referred to by my noble friend Lord Sawyer. With the Olympic site, we have the opportunity for the first time to demonstrate what we can create as a global showcase.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08032768000387"></a>We are living in a golden age of opportunity and the price of getting things wrong is very high. It was instructive to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, talking about what went wrong with building after the war. Much of the change that we now have to manage, with as much imagination and skill as possible, is being driven by demographic and economic forces that are driving house prices beyond the reach of many people; but is also in the context of an ageing society, which will present the challenge for better inclusive design, to ensure the opportunity to grow old in comfort and in place. All this is taking place in the context of climate change, which has a bearing on where and how we build, and how we manage our land and resources&#151;whether that is energy, water, aggregates or skills. It gives us an opportunity for thinking, planning and building differently, whether we are talking about how we maintain the integrity of our historic villages, how we manage intensified urbanisation, how we reconcile our built heritage so that it drives the future as well as reflects the past, and how we design for identity within density, and for cohesion within spaces that by definition will be very tight. These are big issues and I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that we should raise the status of the public realm. People are concerned not only about the type of house they live in, but the place they live in. That is what shapes behaviour.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08032768000388"></a>Sixty years on, we are asking the same questions, and with the same intensity, that characterised the debate on the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. David Kynaston&#146;s book <I>Austerity Britain</I> describes the ferment of activity and ideas in the debate on planning at the end of the war, and what came to fruition and what did not. We have had a catalogue of failures in many respects, judging by what noble Lords have said&#151;not least the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker. We know the price of dysfunctional buildings and monolithic estates. I welcome this debate because it gives me a chance to set out why I know that the future can and will be different.</p>

<a name="80327-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08032768000389"></a>We have to recognise that things have changed. Since 2004, there has been a cultural change in the climate of planning&#151;not least with spatial planning. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that we want to see planning become part of the proactive  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_703"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 703</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>stage of design and thinking, rather than the reactive stage of mitigation. Planning must go to the heart of policy-making in local government, not stay on the periphery. We can only make friends&#151;and this is crucial&#151;for the sort of housing and community growth that we need if we put such high and irresistible importance on design and quality that people see housing growth as an opportunity for building to the best and most desirable standards. We must create places where people want both to live and to be, so it covers private and public spaces.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08032768000390"></a>Let me take as my text the housing Green Paper published in 2007, which set out key actions that recognise and harness the inspirational power of the very best to make good and very good development the norm, ensure that new homes and places meet everyone&#146;s needs by embedding principles of inclusive design, and work to speed up the system. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, along with the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, was absolutely right to put domestic architecture at the centre of the challenge we face. All these principles will be tested on whether they work in relation to our domestic buildings.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08032768000391"></a>It is easy to celebrate the best. The noble Lords, Lord Rogers of Riverside, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank and Lord Carlile, celebrated the work of our most inspirational architects and our best places. My noble friend Lord Sawyer spoke powerfully about the changes in Teesside. Recognising and harnessing the inspirational power of the very best is actually relatively easy to do because, however we describe the value of design and the passage from aesthetics to functionality, there is a simple test. They create places where people want to be, whether it is the forecourt of the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the Sheffield Peace Gardens or Cardiff Bay. All these are places which people colonise.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08032768000392"></a>However, this is also about shaping less glamorous places. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and my noble friend Lord Sawyer pointed out, there are areas in the north of England and the east Midlands where we need to encourage character and memory as well as providing more choice and quality for a new generation. Achieving that will mean that people will want to live in these places again. This is one of the many ways in which the partnership between English Heritage and CABE can help. Master-planning and advising on procurement and preferred developers are crucial, but the most critical challenge lies in shaping the places where people will live in the future. This was alluded to by many noble Lords, but particularly the noble Lord, Lord Patten. I refer here to urban extensions and settlements in the Thames Gateway, growth areas such as in Milton Keynes, Cambridge, Corby, Portsmouth and Southampton, and developments such as Northstowe. These are brownfield and greenfield sites with settlements to build around, but which allow us to imagine the future. It is in these places that volume builders, local authorities and delivery agents are under the most intense scrutiny because they know that the past will not serve the future. The message is loud and clear: no more monolithic housing estates and no more &#147;character&#148; of the kind described by the noble Lord, Lord Patten.  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_704"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 704</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We want well designed, diverse, mixed housing  for people who may both live and work at home in the future.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08032768000393"></a>This is not just about architecture. The signals we are sending represent a leap of faith because much of this is in development, but it is clear that people have definitely got the message. I shall return to that when I come to talk about local authorities. I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, that the Thames Gateway is not an empty brownfield site; it is a place with a wonderfully diverse history. By bringing in CABE, developing design pacts with local authorities and setting targets for design, we are in with a chance of creating a very good site.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08032768000394"></a>One of the privileges of my job is to visit the best and the worst in terms of housing development. Recently I have seen three examples where building for the future has come alive for me in extremely powerful ways. The first is the Sherwood Energy Village. It has been built on an old coalfield site by people from the community who have designed the housing and new industrial site in such a way that it is completely eco-efficient. It is a splendid example of what the community itself can achieve when it has a mind to do so. Returning to our debate and the discussion about design review panels, of course there is a case for not leaving all this in the hands of experts; we do not need to do that. Community involvement is a mark of the way we have changed our approach to planning, and it is an extremely powerful and effective development.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08032768000395"></a>Next week I will be visiting a 2,500-acre site near Peterborough originally owned by Hanson plc and now with O&amp;H Hampton. What is important about this site is the extraordinary way in which green space and water resources are at the heart of the whole community. Water will be recycled in many different ways and there is enormous potential for open parkland as well as developing a dense site.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08032768000396"></a>Last week I visited Southampton, a Living Places priority&#151;one of five sites&#151;which is building regeneration through culture. Its arts centres and visual art commitment will be driving much of the connection between its old estates and its new city centre development. These are inspirational, leading-edge sites. We are good at competitions and awards; we can do things to inspire competition. The challenge is making good and very good development the norm. The Government have to shape a vision, articulate an ambition and create a framework, incentives and conditions.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08032768000397"></a>Some noble Lords, not least my noble friend Lord Howarth, invited us to think about more statutory duties to ensure that local authorities consider design quality when assessing planning applications, but other noble Lords, by reference to PPS 1, PPS 3 or statutory guidance, demonstrated the case better than I can that we do not need more statutory powers; that is not what will guarantee that local authorities are encouraged and enabled.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08032768000398"></a>We have to make the best of what we have, particularly following on from the Urban Task Force and the creation of CABE, for which I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Howarth, who was its midwife,  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_705"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 705</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>using the partnerships and the tools that we have, which are relatively recent but which make some powerful levers. CABE inspires, assists, guides and demonstrates the value of design, not least in some of the public buildings that the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, spoke about, particularly in relation to health. There is some extraordinarily good work going on in public health design. We are talking about well-being&#151;better people and better places. We are working closely with CABE. We fund it to the tune of about &#163;11 million to &#163;12 million, which along with the sustainable communities fund has, I think, made the single most important difference.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08032768000399"></a>There is a raft of good advice in relation to housing, as the noble Lord, Lord Best, knows. We have design and access statements and a whole raft of design guidance, which enables people to plan more effectively for better town centres&#151;we can design out crime. We take extremely seriously the status and capacity of training in local authorities. A great deal of research is in place to scope the nature of the problem. A lot of that has come from the Egan review, but I cannot answer the noble Lord&#146;s question despite the fact that he gave me infinitely generous warning; I will have to write. I will say something more about skills in a moment.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08032768000400"></a>This is about dissemination on the ground, whether through the Millennium Communities programme or Design for Manufacture. What excites me is the possibility of demonstrating how best design can work for the future. I am thinking of the opportunities for sustainability in our ecotowns and our need, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said, to address the problems of reducing energy consumption, as we have already begun to do through building regulations. Our ageing strategy will give us the enormous opportunity to place both economic and social sustainability together in inclusive design.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08032768000401"></a>As to what we should do, I will start by saying that no one should be in any doubt about what we as a Government want. There is no shortage of leadership or confusion over the statutory framework. There is no excuse for any local authority not to know how and where to obtain help, to plan creatively from the start of development and to get local people involved in planning for community involvement. The challenge is to remove some of the cultural and practical barriers in order to give quality the priority that we have spoken about, to build confidence that people can understand what design is, to address the skills shortage, to put more champions in place and to create advocacy throughout the system. We are on the way.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08032768000402"></a>CABE is critical to all this: <I>Building for Life</I>, the document that it put together with the Home Builders Federation, asks 20 questions to assess design quality in new homes. It helps developers and local authorities to understand what makes a high-quality scheme. We have design reviews, the CABE enabling service and CABE Space. There is no way that a local authority can hide behind an assertion that it does not know where to go for advice. As confidence and discrimination grow, so will the ability to turn down poorly designed proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08032768000403"></a>Design review panels are in seven out of nine regions at the moment. Of course there should be nine&#151;that is what we want&#151;and I will think hard about the arguments that have been made about expanding their scope. We are tackling the lack of design through the use of regional centres of excellence. We are asking regional and local partners&#151;higher education institutes, architecture and design centres, professional bodies&#151;to work with the RDAs to determine the best approach to improving skills and training in each area. That is critical and it is why, following the Egan review, we created the admirable Academy for Sustainable Communities, which promotes not just design and architectural skills in the community but social skills&#151;how to build the sort of communities that we want to see in the future. It is identifying gaps in the provision and how to fill them. CLG itself has grown another  513 high-calibre graduate students across the planning profession. In the future, planning must not be the preserve of planners or geographers; we need the social scientists, the linguists and the critical thinkers to come into planning and be creative. Ultimately, we need more incentives.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08032768000404"></a>With specific regard to the title of the debate, we asked, in a recent consultation on the housing and planning delivery grant, how we might provide incentives to encourage better design through that grant. We are looking now at the responses; I hope that that will be very powerful. The housing Green Paper also set out how we would examine options for a quality assurance scheme. Working on that with CABE will take us forward into a possibility of incentivising local authorities. We have the Bill on the Homes and Communities Agency, which will give us the opportunity to bring all this together.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08032768000405"></a>The Planning Bill gives us another opportunity. I look forward to the debates that I will have with the noble Lord, Lord Best, and with my noble friends Lady Whitaker and Lord Howarth on how we use that Bill to promote design. In that Bill&#151;I say this in response to the noble Lord, Lord Rogers of Riverside&#151;we are streamlining the infrastructure so that, if we have to have an inquiry on another terminal or runway at Heathrow, it will not, we hope, take seven years. That can only be good.</p>

They spoke with knowledge, insight and feeling. It is a vast subject and no doubt we would all like to have been able to talk about aspects of it other than those that we covered. I would have liked to have been able to say something about the architects and the buildings that I personally admire but it is invidious to pick out individual architects, as it is invidious to pick out individual speeches. I will, however, take that risk and just mention that I am a great admirer of the architecture of my noble friend Lord Rogers of Riverside.

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08032768000410"></a>There has been much unanimity. It can be dull if there is excessive agreement in a debate so, prompted by something that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said, I will court controversy by suggesting that this is not a debate that could have taken place in an elected House. The depth of expertise in this Chamber is such that that is unimaginable. But let us return to that upon which we more easily agree around the House. Every noble Lord who spoke expressed a deep conviction about the value of good architecture and design. We were all happy to acknowledge the abundance of excellent architecture and design in this country. But at the same time we know that iconic buildings are not enough and every speaker expressed deep frustration and, indeed, anger at the poverty and inadequacy of too much of the design around us.</p>

We can all take satisfaction from her personal commitment to the cause of good architecture and good design. I know that she will be ready to engage in debate with those of us who may wish to revert to the issue of whether guidance is sufficient or whether we will need to strengthen legislation to lay statutory duties upon those who have responsibility to ensure that we do better.

<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_708"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 708</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08032768000414"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I also wish to speak to the Early Removal of Short-Term and Long-Term Prisoners (Amendment of Requisite Period) Order 2008. My purpose today is to discuss amendments to the early removal scheme for determinate sentence prisoners who are liable to deportation or administrative removal from the United Kingdom. These orders set out the Government&#146;s proposals to extend the early removal scheme to enable prisoners to be removed up to a maximum of 270 days early rather than the current 135. This is the first time these specific order-making powers have been used.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08032768000415"></a>The early removal scheme in respect of foreign national prisoners has been successfully in operation since 2004 and more than 3,000 prisoners have been removed to their country of origin under the scheme. The scheme applies only to those foreign national prisoners who are able to be removed to their country of origin. Such prisoners benefit from the scheme only if their removal from the UK can be given immediate effect. We have been working to ensure that arrangements are in place to enable us to remove prisoners to their country of origin.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08032768000416"></a>Prisoners serving a life or indeterminate sentence are not eligible to be considered for removal under the scheme. Determinate sentence prisoners serving a sentence of four years and over under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for a sexual or violent offence are removed under the scheme only if the Parole Board considers that they would present an acceptable risk to the community. Details of prisoners removed under the scheme are placed on the Home Office&#146;s warnings index. Should they seek to return to the UK during their sentence they can be detected by the border control officer on arrival at the UK border, and returned to prison custody until the point at which they would have been released had they not otherwise been removed.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08032768000417"></a>Based on the successful experience of the last three and a half years, and in particular our increasing experience of and success in securing travel documents from overseas countries and making other arrangements with them that enable us to remove prisoners, we believe the scheme can make an even greater contribution to removing criminals from  our shores.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08032768000418"></a>As of December 2007, there were 11,310 foreign national prisoners in the prison system, representing 14 per cent of the total prison population. Foreign national prisoners represent a significant proportion of the prison population, although it is low in comparison to many other European countries. The early removal scheme has a positive impact on the prison population. Moreover, we have made it clear that our objective is that foreign national prisoners should face deportation when they meet the relevant criteria and that deportation should happen as early as possible in their sentence. These proposals are entirely consistent with overall government policy.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08032768000419"></a>The Criminal Justice Act 1991 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 empower the Secretary of State to remove foreign national prisoners from prison early for the purpose of removing them from the United Kingdom. This is formally known as the early  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_709"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 709</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>removal scheme. To qualify for the scheme, a prisoner must be liable to deportation or administrative removal, in accordance with immigration legislation. The statutory instruments amend the relevant provisions in both Acts to expand the early removal scheme to enable foreign national prisoners liable to deportation or removal from the UK to be removed from prison, and hence from the UK, at an earlier point in their sentence than is currently the case. The instruments double the maximum number of days from which a prisoner may be removed from prison under the scheme; from 135 days before the halfway point of the sentence to 270 days before the halfway point of the sentence.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08032768000420"></a>The ERS provisions under the Criminal Justice  Act 1991 apply to those prisoners who are liable to removal and are serving a sentence of less than  12 months or a determinate sentence in respect of an offence committed before 4 April 2005. The statutory instrument amends Section 46A of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which enables the Secretary of State to remove from prison early short-term and long-term foreign national prisoners who are liable to deportation or administrative removal and are subject to the release provisions of the 1991 Act. Section 46A(6) provides the Secretary of State with the power to amend the definition of &#147;requisite period&#148;, being the period prisoners must serve before becoming eligible for removal from prison under the ERS. There is a tapering mechanism, which means that the requisite period that must be served will be dependent on the length of the sentence.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08032768000421"></a>The order provides that a prisoner liable to removal and serving less than three years must serve one-quarter of the term before they can be removed from prison. The effect is that prisoners serving less than three months will now be eligible for the ERS, whereas under the current provisions they are not so eligible. Those prisoners serving more than three months but less than four months will be required to serve a quarter of the term. Currently, they must serve 30 days. This means that they will be eligible for removal earlier then they are currently. Prisoners serving 18 months or more, but less than three years, will be required to serve one-quarter of the term. Currently, they can be removed up to 135 days before the halfway point of their sentence. This means that they will be eligible for removal earlier than they are currently. Prisoners serving three years or more will be able to benefit by up to the maximum period of 270 days. Prisoners serving four months or more, but less than 18 months, will not be affected by this  draft order.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08032768000422"></a>The Criminal Justice Act 2003 applies to prisoners who are liable to removal and are serving a sentence of 12 months or more in respect of an offence committed after 3 April 2005. Section 260 of that Act contains the relevant early removal scheme provisions. The provisions are very similar to those of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The draft Early Removal of Fixed-Term Prisoners (Amendment of Eligibility Period) Order amends the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to expand the ERS to enable foreign national prisoners to be removed from prison up to a

Again, this is the first time that this order-making power has been used.</p>

<a name="80327-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08032768000423"></a>The order replaces the current time limit of 135 days with a new time limit of 270 days. That means that the Secretary of State will be empowered to remove from prison a person who is liable to removal up to 270 days before the halfway point of the sentence. Prisoners serving three years or more will be eligible to benefit by the maximum period of 270 days.</p>

He knows and I know that the Government are trying to make certain adjustments to cope with the fact that the prisons are bursting at the seams. There are far too many people in them and they want to get some out to get the numbers down. I accept, as the Minister put it, that the proposal is entirely consistent with government policy. I accept that no doubt a number of pilot schemes have been looking at this issue, but the Minister knows perfectly well that the reason for this measure is, as I said, to get the figures down. That is a perfectly admirable reason because the prisons are bursting at the seams.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08032768000427"></a>In their Explanatory Memorandums on the orders, the Government give the game away. The two memorandums seem to be identical, but I shall refer to that on the Early Removal of Short-term and Long-term Prisoners (Amendment of Requisite Period) Order 2008. At paragraph 7.9, they explain that there will be amendments to deal with this  matter in:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="08032768000499"></a>&#147;Clause 33 of the current Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000476"></a>I forgot to look at my copy of that Bill to see whether it is still Clause 33 because the Government seem to amend it so often. It is probably a different clause now, but let us assume that it is still Clause 33 to which amendments will be made. That Bill will be enacted early in May&#151;in barely five or six weeks. But, so desperate are the Government to move forward&#151;we all know why; the prisons are bursting at the seams&#151;they have to move the orders and bring them into effect now. I seem to remember a call from the Government Whips&#146; Office asking, &#147;Can you take these orders some time before Easter?&#148;. I gather that this is &#147;before Easter&#148;, although Easter has already happened as far as I am concerned. We are dealing with the orders now, despite the fact that the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill will be enacted in six weeks, and Clause 33 will be Section 33 on the  statute book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08032768000428"></a>Paragraph 7.10 of the Explanatory Memorandum states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="08032768000500"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State is therefore amending primary legislation by an affirmative instrument whilst at the same time taking a Bill through Parliament which amends the same provisions, albeit in different ways. The rationale for using the order-making power to affect the changes to the ERS set out above is because the statutory instruments can be made and come into force well before the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill receives Royal Assent&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032768000477"></a>in six weeks from now.</p>

They are making policy almost on the hoof purely so that they can deal with matters rather more speedily than they could do in the Bill already before them. I feel sorry for the Minister having to come before the House on a day like this to make such a speech.</p>

I have no complaint to make about the orders themselves, and I think that my noble kinsman has been a little hard on the Government. We are always complaining that they have done nothing about the bursting prisons, and now they are doing something. But I suppose he is entitled to have a little bit of fun. At the end of the day, it is a good thing that these orders are being made now and that they come along as early as possible.</p>

<a name="80327-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08032768000431"></a>We are looking at an uncontroversial scheme, which has, so far, allowed fixed-term prisoners to be removed to their countries of origin 135 days before the half-way point of their sentence, with tapering for short-term prisoners at between three and 18 months. As the Minister has explained, under these orders a foreign national can be removed from prison 270 days before the half-way mark, with those sentenced to less than three years having to serve a quarter of their nominal sentence. The lower limit of three months originally applied to the ERS is removed. That is an improvement because those people were not formerly eligible for any release.</p>

<a name="80327-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08032768000432"></a>Obviously, the scheme applies only to those who are capable of being removed or deported to their country of origin. The Explanatory Memoranda do not say to how many of the 11,310 foreign nationals in our prisons at the time of writing, who the noble Lord mentioned, this scheme will apply. We hope that the noble Lord will tell us what increase there will be in the number of prisoners affected, based on the current number of prisoners, as a result of the extension from 135 to 270 days. The chief executive of the BIA wrote to the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee in another place on 20 November 2007. He said that 1,500 foreign national prisoners whose sentences had expired were awaiting deportation. It would be useful if that figure were updated. In spite of the claim that the experience of  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_712"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column 712</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the past three and a half years has been successful, the 3,000 removed under the early release scheme since it began in June 2004 is presumably some way short of the number eligible for deportation or removal. It would be useful to have some assessment of what proportion of the total that would represent. What are the obstacles to deportation of the 1,500 who are still detained?</p>

<a name="80327-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08032768000433"></a>In her evidence to the Select Committee on  15 January, Ms Homer, the chief executive of the BIA, said that it would automatically consider deportation for anyone given a custodial sentence unless there was an appeal. What proportion of foreign national prisoners in custody who would otherwise have been subject to ERS are excluded from the procedure because their appeals have not yet been concluded? Does this account for some of the 1,500 in administrative detention, or are they all from the countries where difficulties arise, such as the four particularly mentioned by Ms Homer: Jamaica, Nigeria, China and Vietnam? Do those difficulties arise mainly from the expiry, loss or destruction of travel or identity documents by the persons concerned? Presumably the prisoners who qualify for ERS are told clearly that if they appeal either against sentence or deportation, it can mean that they will have to remain in custody for part or even the whole of the 270 days&#146; freedom back home they would otherwise have enjoyed?</p>

<a name="80327-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08032768000434"></a>If that is the choice facing those prisoners&#151;to accept the ERS or resist it and lose some of the time for which they would otherwise have been freed&#151;can the noble Lord assure me that they will have available to them the best legal advice so that they can make the decision on the best possible grounds?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08032768000437"></a>I am equally surprised at the speed at which this is being done, not least because of the timing of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. Nevertheless it must have some benefits in that at least those who remain in the prisons will have slightly less crowding to cope with. From that viewpoint I suppose that I, too, must welcome what is happening. Apart from endorsing the point about legal aid&#151;it is crucial that they have access to legal aid&#151;I wonder how many of the people we are talking about are women, because a considerable proportion of the prison population are foreigners.

If so, I will write to noble Lords. However, the provisions will have a positive impact on prison population. I do not think that I ought to apologise for that. As for the principle of foreign national prisoners, where it is considered safe and risk assessments take place, it is appropriate to do this. The scheme is worthy in its own right.</p>

<a name="80327-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08032768000439"></a>We have already made it clear as a general principle that foreign national prisoners should face deportation where they meet the relevant criteria. We therefore believe that the proposals are consistent with government policy. There is no question but that the prison-population situation is serious. As the noble Lord will know, however, we have published the Carter proposals and we have a programme to make an impact on the numbers of prisoners in our prison population and to increase the provision of places over the next few years. These orders will make a positive impact as well.</p>

<a name="80327-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08032768000440"></a>The statistics on the number of foreign national prisoners removed early under the scheme are as follows. In calendar year 2007, 1,054 persons were removed. As for the impact on the prison population, we project a saving of approximately 235 places. I should say that this is not an exact science but based on the places that were saved from the original scheme. Nevertheless that is a significant number in terms of our current prison population. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that according to my information the number of time-served foreign national prisoners in prison stood at 389 as at 25 March. That is pretty up-to-date.</p>

<a name="80327-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08032768000441"></a>Obviously, one could talk more generally about some of the challenges in documentation where appeals are being heard. One of the questions that has always arisen about the operation of the scheme is how early advance notice from the prison authorities to the BIA is and when documentation can start to be prepared. There has been case law that means that the process cannot be started too early because an actual decision has to be made on the basis of the facts at the time. However, there is no doubt that there is improved collaboration between the Prison Service and the BIA. We are seeing these improvements coming through.</p>

While there are still major challenges in this area, there are significant signs of improvement. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that, in terms of the guidance given to governors, they do an extraordinary job under extreme pressure. Anyone who has visited prisons recently and has seen the population pressures they are under can only admire their work. I have no doubt whatever that the quality of the governors and people working in prisons has improved immeasurably over the past few years. We owe them a great debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08032768000444"></a>On how many it can apply to, it is difficult to give a fixed figure. That is also why I cannot give an absolute estimate of the reduction in prison population that will take place as a result. The point is that any foreign national prisoner liable for deportation or removal is eligible for the scheme. However, there is of course a great difference between the number eligible and the number it would affect.</p>

<a name="08032768000445"></a><b><a name="80327-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08032768000653"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My Lords, I do not ask the Minister to give these figures now, because I am sure that he does not have them to hand. Since Ms Homer mentioned before the Select Committee the particular difficulties arising in respect of four countries which apparently do not accept their nationals or the documentation provided, it would be useful to know how many of the prisoners that would otherwise be eligible for the ERS are stopped from taking advantage of it because they belong to one of those countries.</p>

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="08032768000446"></a><b><a name="80327-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08032768000654"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, I accept that. I have figures for each of the countries represented by the prison population. Rather than read them out, perhaps I may write to the noble Lord. I cannot tell him how many offenders with outstanding appeals are excluded from the scheme. We are not sure whether that information can be obtained, but I will certainly do everything I can to see whether that is possible.</p>

<a name="80327-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08032768000447"></a>The changes being introduced in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which we are all thoroughly enjoying debating at the moment and look forward to gathering for again next Wednesday, will make the scheme easier to administer and certainly bring more prisoners into scope. Clause 33 amends the position for prisoners entitled to be released under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, whereas Clause 34 amends the position for the 2003 Act prisoners. Broadly speaking, the changes in the Bill do two things: they remove the current statutory exemptions to the ERS, and extend ERS to those prisoners who are not liable to removal but who demonstrate a settled intention of residing abroad. Clause 33 also corrects a potential anomaly in the operation of the ERS in respect of prisoners sentenced under the different regimes of the Criminal Justice Acts 1991 and 2003. The provisions in the Bill are consistent and in parallel with the provisions that we are bringing forward in the SI today.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="08032775000007"></a>The Committee met at two o&#146;clock.</h4>


<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000008"></a>[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (VISCOUNT SIMON) in the Chair.]</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="08032775000002"></a>Learning Disability: Adult Social Care</h3>

<p><a name="08032775000009"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08032775000341"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Viscount Simon):</b> It has been agreed that, should any of the Questions for Short Debate not run for their allotted hour this afternoon, the Committee will adjourn during pleasure until the end of the hour. Therefore, each of the Questions for Short Debate will start on the hour.</p>
<h5><a name="08032775000318"></a>2.01 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08032775000010"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08032775000342"></a>Lord Rix:</b> I thank noble Lords for attending today's debate&#151;we are, I fear, the usual suspects&#151;to discuss how the needs of those with a learning disability will be addressed in the Government's forthcoming paper on future funding for adult social care. You will appreciate that, as president of the Royal Mencap Society, this subject is close to my heart. Mencap is a leading member of the Learning Disability Coalition, which is at the forefront of the campaign to ensure that this Green Paper fully addresses the demographic changes which will necessitate, and already are necessitating, greater social care support for those with a learning disability.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000011"></a>Currently, only 120,000 people out of the 1.5 million people with a learning disability receive support from social services. Many of those who receive support have had it reduced because of pressures on social care budgets. That means fewer hours at a day centre and fewer hours of help with washing, shopping and attending social activities. Others have been totally excluded from care as cash-strapped councils tighten their eligibility criteria. For all the people affected, that means that their quality of life has deteriorated. Many languish at home instead of being able, like their non-learning disabled peers, to reach their potential.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000012"></a>The Commission for Social Care Inspection has referred to these people as becoming &#147;lost in the system&#148; and has confirmed that the tightening of eligibility criteria is set to get worse with 73 per cent of councils stating that next year they will be able to support only learning disabled people with severe or critical needs&#151;means testing by another name. That means that three-quarters of councils' learning disability budgets are under-resourced.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000013"></a>Individual stories of hardship, as a result of this tightening of eligibility criteria, are beginning to emerge. The other day I heard from a 70 year-old mother and an 80 year-old stepfather who support their 41 year-old son, Philip, in the family home. Previously, Philip enjoyed a total of nine weeks' residential respite at a local unit three miles away from home. He also had six tea-time visits a year. The family described this respite as a &#147;life saver&#148;, giving them a chance to relax and carry out their household tasks. They also had access to a 24-hour emergency support service.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000014"></a>I believe you will be as shocked as I was to hear that most of this system of support has been withdrawn. In their own words, the family says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000294"></a>&#147;Philip's respite was reduced to just four weeks, eleven miles away at a unit which we consider unsuitable and which necessitates a difficult journey for us, his elderly parents. There are no tea time visits, no emergency services in place. In reality we had only fifteen nights respite in the last year&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000280"></a>The care services Minister has announced a review of eligibility criteria, and for this we are grateful. However, stories such Philip's show how urgently action is needed and that these alarming reductions in the availability of social care need to be addressed in the forthcoming Green Paper.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000015"></a>Another worrying story concerns a 43 year-old man, Andrew, whose father contacted the Learning Disability Coalition. Andrew suffers a range of physical and mental disabilities. His father says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08032775000309"></a>&#147;whilst his condition has been deteriorating over the past eight years, this mainly affected his mobility&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000016"></a>The underfunding of adult social care in his area has meant that the vital one-to-one support that Andrew's daycare centre provided has ceased. Andrew used to have the capability to communicate vocally with a few words and short sentences, through which he could indicate his needs. However, Andrew's father says,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000295"></a>&#147;Since the one-to-one facility was abandoned by the centre, he has lost all power of speech. Whilst one cannot be absolutely sure his loss of vocal communication is the result of the lack of stimulation, being shuttered up daily with 50 or so others in a &#145;warehousing&#146; situation, leads our own doctor to strongly believe this is the major cause of his problem&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000017"></a>That widening reduction in services, caused by a lack of adequate resources, will make it near impossible for the Government to deliver the admirable policy promises they have made to people with learning disabilities. Those promises have been set out in <I>Valuing People Now</I>, <I>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People</I>, <I>Putting People First</I>, the Independent Living Strategy, and others. Those government plans have raised the hopes and expectations of people with a learning disability and their families. However, as the excellent report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights said earlier this month,</p>
<ul><a name="08032775000310"></a>&#147;limited resources are undermining attempts to implement the aims of that policy [Valuing People] effectively&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000018"></a>The Commission for Social Care Inspection has also commented that,</p>
<ul><a name="08032775000311"></a>&#147;the quality of life for many could be significantly enhanced with relatively minor social care interventions ... support to take part in leisure activities, support to go to a skills class at the local further education college or support to sustain a job&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000019"></a>Indeed, removing day-time activities for people with Down&#146;s syndrome and other forms of learning disability can lead to early onset of dementia and mental health problems. Withdrawing support from people to take exercise endangers their health and encourages obesity. Apart from the impact on people's quality of life, that will cost more in the long run than the cost savings made. This shortfall in funding is making a mockery of the Government's prevention agenda.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000020"></a>The Green Paper provides the Government with the perfect opportunity to get to grips with the current failure to resource properly the services they have promised people with learning disabilities. The  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government have talked a great deal previously about this Green Paper's agenda to tackle the problems of an ageing population, but they have not talked nearly enough about how they plan to address the social care needs of adults with a learning disability. There are significant differences between the social care needs of people with learning disabilities and older people. Many people with learning disabilities need care packages for life and those packages will need flexibility so that they change as their needs and aspirations change.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000021"></a>Co-payment, which is such a pertinent issue in funding the care of older people, is unlikely to be relevant for people with learning disabilities as many of them remain, regrettably, some of the poorest and most socially excluded in the country. I am delighted to say that more people with a learning disability are surviving infancy and are living much longer than ever before. However, improvements in neo-natal care mean that the number of babies surviving with profound and multiple learning disabilities is increasing. Such babies may need costly care packages. This is adding yet further to the pressure on social care services which, as we have seen, are already struggling to meet demand.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000022"></a>Another issue is that 60 per cent of people with a learning disability live with their parents. As these sons and daughters live for longer, many elderly and frail parents and families will no longer be around to care for them in the family home. Unfortunately, there is not enough up-to-date information about the trends in demand for services for people with learning disabilities to make accurate projections of how those numbers are increasing and what the likely future costs will be. We need a great deal more evidence if we are to ensure that we allocate sufficient resources to provide the accommodation and support that people with a learning disability need to live independently of their parents. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me whether the department has, or is considering, carrying out that vital research.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000023"></a>My conclusion is very simple. I invite the Government to use the months before the publication of the Green Paper to commission the necessary research so that when they publish they can ensure that services for people with learning disabilities will be adequately resourced in future. The Government have set themselves the aim of achieving equality for disabled people by 2025; if they are truly committed to tackling the complex and sensitive issues that I have outlined today in the forthcoming Green Paper, it has the potential to be a vital tool in the achievement of the 2025 aim. I look forward to hearing the thoughts and comments on these issues from other noble Lords and, in addition to these speeches, eagerly anticipate the Minister&#146;s reply to this discussion.</p>
<h5><a name="08032775000319"></a>2.10 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08032775000024"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08032775000343"></a>Baroness Wilkins:</b> First, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Rix, on initiating this timely debate, focusing attention on the needs of one of the most significant groups in adult social care. I fear that I shall repeat many of the points that he has made but, such is the importance of this debate, I have no doubt that many  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC114"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of us will do so. To date, as he said, the debate surrounding the forthcoming Green Paper has been focused almost solely on the funding of long-term care for elderly people. The value of this debate is in pointing out how some of the potential solutions voiced in that area will not meet the needs of adults with learning disabilities.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000025"></a>As the noble Lord pointed out, social care packages for people with learning difficulties are for life, not just old age. While elderly people may be able to contribute to the cost of their social care, it is unlikely that people with learning difficulties will be able to gain the resources to do so. Moreover, the social care packages for people with learning difficulties accommodate much more than just personal care. They need to involve multi-disciplinary teams covering most aspects of that person's life, including housing, domiciliary support, employment, further education, health and leisure activities.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000026"></a>First, I congratulate the Government on their decision to publish a Green Paper on adult social care, which has been warmly welcomed. It is extremely heartening that adult social care is at last gaining prominence on the political agenda. The Government strategy unit's report <I>Improving</I><I>the Life Chances of Disabled People</I> was widely applauded, with its target date to achieve equality for disabled people by 2025. However, if that is to be realised, this Green Paper must address the sensitive and complex needs of people with learning disabilities. It needs to grapple with two stark facts: first, the extent of need which is not currently met and, secondly, the future growth in demand that will result from social trends and demographic changes.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000027"></a>Mencap's report, <I>Breaking Point</I>, put in sharp relief the significant amount of unmet need that currently exists, especially relating to respite care. It found that seven of out of 10 families have never been offered a choice of short-break services and six out of 10 do not get a short break that fully meets their needs. One in three families had experienced a cut in their short-break services last year and six out of 10 family carers who are in poor physical health say that it is because the amount of care they provide.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000028"></a>As this shows, local authorities are struggling to meet even current need. The Local Government Association has found that in 2005-06 three-quarters of councils experienced significant cost pressures for their learning disability services. As a result, local authorities have tightened their eligibility criteria for care services to a shocking degree. According to the state of the nation report from the Commission for Social Care Inspection, by the end of the current financial year 73 per cent of local councils will support people with learning disabilities only when they have substantial or critical needs.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000029"></a>What does this mean for all those people with learning disabilities who have very real needs that are not so severe? It means that they will live poverty-stricken lives of isolation and restriction, in which they are given no chance to fulfil their potential in employment, training or any meaningful social activity. They have no hope of getting even a small amount of support to live the fulfilling lives which admirable government policies have spelled out for them.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC115"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000030"></a>The gap between the vision of government policy and reality is stark. While central government may be committed to establishing a support organisation of disabled people in every social service authority, those organisations are the first to be cut when council funding is short. Currently, Liverpool People First, in common with many other such organisations, is in danger of losing all its core funding. Core funding is the essential element that enables these organisations to survive, yet trusts and funding organisations are loath to fund them. As People First points out, local councils&#146; duty to consult disabled people is severely impaired if local organisations of disabled people do not exist. As a result, local councils&#146; commissioning of services to meet need is bound to be faulty and inadequate. People First calls on the Government to set a baseline for funding those local disabled people&#146;s organisations that councils are unable to fall below without financial penalty.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000031"></a>As the Learning Disability Coalition points out, the current lack of funding for adult services lies at the heart of the widespread human rights abuse that was detailed in the Joint Committee on Human Rights report <I>A Life Like Any Other</I>, which was published earlier this month. The report found that the human rights of people with learning disabilities were being violated by public authorities, local councils and NHS trusts in an alarming number of areas and concluded that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000296"></a>&#147;For many adults with learning disabilities, the violation of their human rights is seen as a normal part of their everyday lives&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000032"></a>If that is the current picture, what is the prospect for the future? There are a number of demographic changes and social trends that mean that the pressure on services will only get worse unless they are properly addressed by the Green Paper. For one thing, improvements in neo-natal care have resulted in an increasing number of babies surviving with profound and multiple learning disabilities. There is the rise in single-parent households and the consequent pressure, mostly on mothers, which can lead them to breaking point. The tightening of local authority eligibility criteria means that many more people with learning disabilities are forced to stay at home as day activities are cut, which increases the pressure on families. Moreover medical improvements mean that people with learning disabilities are living longer, but that means that they are outliving the ability of their families to help care for them. It is estimated that 60 per cent of those with a severe or profound learning disability in England live with a family carer, so provision needs to be made for the time when that family carer is too old or frail to continue. Yet Mencap&#146;s report <I>The Housing Time Bomb </I>found that only two in four local authorities was even aware of the number of people this affected and only one in four had planned alternative housing for people with learning disabilities who were living with parents aged over 70. The Learning Disability Coalition is keen to hear from the Government how they will use the Green Paper to ensure that there will be sufficient funding to provide adequate support for people with learning disabilities when they leave their family home.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000033"></a>It is this lack of awareness of the extent of need and the conflicting predictions by social care statisticians of future demand that the Learning Disability Coalition calls on the Government to address urgently. Can the Minister assure me that an up-to-date assessment of the future demand for social care for people with learning disabilities will be carried out before the Green Paper is published? Unless the provisions proposed in the forthcoming Green Paper are based on an accurate forecast, it has no hope of closing the yawning gap between the Government's admirable policies for people with learning disabilities and the reality of their needs.</p>
<h5><a name="08032775000320"></a>2.19 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08032775000034"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08032775000344"></a>Viscount Tenby:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Rix for raising this important subject in a Question for Short Debate, even though he has skilfully and clinically dispatched some of my birds. On quoting his phrase, &#147;the usual suspects being here&#148;, I can honestly claim to be not guilty on that score, strangely enough.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000035"></a>However, I must declare an interest in these matters, as chairman of a small residential home for women with physical and learning disabilities in Hampshire and as the honourable vice-president of MCCH, an organisation which provides services for those with mental illness, learning disability and autism in London and the south-east.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000036"></a>The debate is timely because earlier I had the honour of hosting a launch in this House for the Mental Health Helplines Partnership, a much-needed and exciting initiative by the Department of Health, NHS Direct and a media company.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000037"></a>It is entirely right that, ahead of publication of the Green Paper, we should be singling out one critical aspect of adult social care&#151;the needs of those with a learning disability. These needs are inevitably more complex and diverse than those in other categories of social care, acute though they may be; that includes issues such as housing, employment, further education, home support, health, life enhancement&#151;I could go on with such a list.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000038"></a>I believe that the strain on funding, and therefore on services, has never been greater, at least in my time, which is quite long. Whether it is the threat to day services and what they are able to offer clients, or to respite care facilities, the danger of cuts is evident on every side.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000039"></a>The critical factor is surely the evident dysfunction which exists between the entirely understandable and laudable aims of the various agencies in this field and the financial resources which are likely to be available for these purposes. You could argue that this is&#151;indeed it is&#151;an age-old problem, but I believe that it has never been so acute and as apparent as it is now.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000040"></a>Speaking in general terms and non-technically, I have become increasingly puzzled by the rationale which allows two systems to run in parallel&#151;care provided by the NHS and care provided through the social services departments of local authorities. Perhaps a short personal example will illustrate the point. The home with which I am associated is in a serviceable building, is quite modern and is capable of accommodating 20 clients. On national criteria, however,  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC117"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is 10 too many. So, until we rebuild, we will get no further referrals. Without these our income drops until ultimately we implode. Contrast that with the recent case&#151;admittedly exceptional&#151;of Orchard Hill in Sutton, run by the NHS with, so far as I can recall, over 100 residents and the subject of a damning report 18 months ago. Are they down to 10 yet&#151;I wonder? The phrase &#147;level playing fields&#148; comes to mind.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000041"></a>My first question to the Minister is: there has been much speculation about the transfer of learning disability from the NHS to local authorities. When is that going to take place? Secondly, will wholly adequate resources be made available to fund the transfer so that those affected will not be disadvantaged in any way? Furthermore, there is a general move away from the commissioning of block contracts to spot purchasing. Will provider organisations be allowed the time to make new arrangements? Will there be guidance in the Green Paper on how commissioners can move from one system to the other without serious disruption? We know how common a disease serious disruption has been in this country in recent years.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000042"></a>When local authority budgets are under severe strain&#151;18 months ago it was estimated that three-quarters were in the red&#151;and in view of the parlous financial situation for the foreseeable future, it will be essential that the Green Paper deals with today&#146;s realities, among which are, as we have heard, carers getting older and being unable to cope. I do not apologise for repeating that 60 per cent of those with learning disabilities live at home. People with learning disabilities are living longer. Last but not least are the alarming findings of the report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which states that, for many adults with a learning difficulty,</p>
<ul><a name="08032775000312"></a>&#147;the violation of their human rights is seen as a normal part of their everyday lives&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000281"></a>I echo calls for the Government to undertake a thorough evaluation before the appearance of the Green Paper of the likely demands on special care from those with learning difficulties&#151;that is essential. The heart of this and previous Governments has been in the right place in valuing people policies. No one doubts that for a moment&#151;certainly not this speaker. But, since the demand for resources to back these policies up has never been greater, we are rapidly approaching a last-chance saloon in providing a satisfactory framework for the needs of our most disadvantaged citizens. If the forthcoming Green Paper does not meet these concerns head on and offer practical&#151;I stress that&#151;solutions, a great opportunity will have been lost. I am confident that the Minister will have regard to those anxieties when she replies.</p>

This is an interesting debate not because anything new has come up, but because the Question has been asked as the policy paper is being commissioned. We are starting to co-ordinate a response to government, because, as has been said, they seem to be making the right noises and commitments. But the question is how parts of government tie together.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000044"></a>That we should get bits of government to co-ordinate is one of my usual cries. We should take it as read that Chinese walls exist in Whitehall, but how do many of the problems that have been spoken about today&#151;for instance, the fact that social care needs are not being met&#151;impinge on other government policies? The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, should be here to talk about carers, as they probably underpin the whole approach. If carers are let down and they ultimately fail and say, &#147;We cannot cope any more&#148;, one&#146;s entire strategy is torn apart. Those with mild and moderate learning disabilities will suddenly have acute problems, because local provision for those acute problems will suddenly disintegrate as a result of the maths not balancing out. The problems will get worse without the carers and the support workers at home who are part of the demographic process which the Green Paper addresses. To make the thrust of the Green Paper work, one must have a strategy that addresses what happens to those groups; otherwise, everything will break down.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80327-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000045"></a>How does one tie in adult social care with other groups? When discussing the previous welfare reform package of legislation, we spoke about welfare to work and getting people involved. How do social care budgets tie in with that? The question does not apply if one is talking about those who require care predominantly for reasons of age; it does apply if one is to try to get those with mild and moderate learning difficulties into work to provide themselves with some social support and outside stimuli. That the Government have said that they will enable people to gain qualifications will mean that the day courses in colleges which have already been referred to face acute problems as well, because one is accentuating problems arising from people being at home for too long.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000046"></a>How this is co-ordinated is the big question for government. As the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, said, it is not that the Government&#151;indeed, all who are involved with government: we all must take some responsibility here; it is anybody who deals with Whitehall, either as direct lobbyer or organiser of the system&#151;lack good intentions. But how will they make the parts come together? There are two ways of doing it: either one tries for joined-up government, or one says, &#147;We can&#146;t do it&#148; and goes for a silo defence of one&#146;s budget. We must hear from the Minister which one of these is favoured. Will she simply say that a criterion will look after this problem within these strategies, which is often the way we go forward and have to deal with it?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000047"></a>How do mild and moderate learning disabilities fit into the thinking? Another of my clich&#233;s is that we have reverse battlefield medicine here. In battlefield medicine, you patch up very quickly those you can get back out to be shot at again, but the state tends to deal first with those with the most severe problems. This means that those who are the least easy to spot, or who are muddling through and achieving at the moment, are ignored. Then, when they are pushed over the edge, they suddenly become a new problem. How the Government intend to deal with that and work such people into the system is an interesting question.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000048"></a>Although the Minister has taken on her responsibilities only comparatively recently, I am sure she has already noticed the similarities across many of these debates. She nods her head. The fact is that if you have a middle group that is undiagnosed, unhelped and unsupported, it can become a much bigger cost later on. Can we please have some indication of how the Government are starting to work this group into the system? Will the Government continue to try to get government and parts of Whitehall working together, or are they going to make sure that there is an understanding and commitment, with something written up front, that all new policies will include this group? I am sadly coming to the conclusion that that may be the only practical way forward.</p>

By doing so, he has put a challenge to the Minister and to the Government which I am sure the Minister will be able to rise to today.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000050"></a>The whole question of support for vulnerable adults is mired in controversy, and it should not be. It is to be hoped that the Green Paper will bring common-sense solutions to the fraught question of who pays for what. There is a crying need, too, for coherence in relation to the question of how responsibility can be borne or shared for those who need care, either because they cannot provide it for themselves, or because they have no one to provide it for them, or because their requirements, either practical or financial, are beyond committed families to provide.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000051"></a>It is well recognised that for our older population, irrespective of their financial means, there is a need for sensitive, practical care, either to help keep people in their own homes or in supported housing. Those who are most at risk of not finding such care are those who fall outside the criteria for the limited social care support, about which we have heard a great deal today, but where paying for their own care is beyond their means. Currently local authorities&#151;I declare an interest as an elected member of one in London&#151;which either give support themselves or commission it from private providers, are able to do so only for the most needy, a point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, very specifically. For the rest, what can be given is either extremely limited or non-existent. In many cases, local authorities are not even providing advice or practical assistance to anyone who does not meet their criteria. That seems to be as true for those with learning difficulties as for elderly people who need help.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000052"></a>No one who has listened to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, today, or has read the briefing provided by the Learning Disability Coalition, can have failed to be moved by what both have said. Of course, as with other people who are vulnerable, there are gradations of need. Many of those with learning disabilities can, given a modicum of help and the support and drive of their families and teachers, achieve virtually normal lives, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby. They can maintain jobs applicable to their own capacity and an independent  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>existence. However, others are almost totally reliant for the whole of their lives on social or healthcare support.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000053"></a>We have already noted that medical improvements ensure that those with learning disabilities live longer than in the past and, in many cases, may outlive their parents. They either then become the responsibility of their siblings&#151;if they have any&#151;who may find assuming responsibility for them too onerous or too intrusive on their own lives, or they may require help from the social or health services. Regrettably&#151;again, as we have heard&#151;a recent audit by the Healthcare Commission found that, where health services are provided, insufficient attention is paid to safeguarding those who are most vulnerable, they are poorly planned, and residential care provided by health services is largely in institutionalised settings. I recognise, as the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, said, that there are private organisations which provide this care, but the report related specifically to services provided by the state. As I said, they were found to be institutionalised, but is that still the case? Institutionalised settings should have gone out years ago.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000054"></a>The commission concluded that it had concerns about the quality of care overall in most establishments. The noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, raised a very important point in referring to one particular home. Many homes for the elderly&#151;and, now, for those who are vulnerable in other senses&#151;are being driven out of existence by care standards. In my own borough, I know of two large private homes for the elderly that gave up simply because they could not meet the very exacting physical standards demanded of them. I just hope that that will not happen across the board. No one wants establishments that do not have proper facilities or are unable to provide nice surroundings but, equally, do we want some of these excellent places forced out of existence simply because they cannot practically provide a room with an en suite bathroom?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000055"></a>As other noble Lords have pointed out, help from social services is not necessarily an option either. As the social care inspectorate found, by the end of 2008, 73 per cent of local councils&#146; finances will support only those who have substantial or critical needs. Local authorities will tell you that there is enormous pressure on their social care budgets, but being able to provide only a proportion of what is required, and then only for the most seriously affected, will leave many questions still to be answered.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000056"></a>As with the whole question of adult social care, for years solutions have been sought to the unequal conundrum of who pays, who receives and who loses out. The report, <I>Valuing People</I>, which was published in 2001 and has been referred to already, set out the Government&#146;s commitment to improving life chances for people with a learning disability. <I>Valuing People</I><I> Now</I> went further into how the principles outlined in the former report could be extended. However, fine words cannot deliver the goods if there is insufficient money in the system to enable that to happen.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000057"></a>There is a not unreasonable expectation that, where they can, people should self-fund at least a proportion of their care, and it is anticipated that this will be promulgated again in the Green Paper. However, this  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC121"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concept&#151;I think it was the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, who raised it&#151;does not readily lend itself to those with learning difficulties, who are unlikely to earn sufficient to make any contribution to their present or future needs and who, in many instances, have been maintained by their parents, often at enormous personal cost.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000058"></a>The aim of the Green Paper is to ensure that care funding is,</p>
<ul><a name="08032775000313"></a>&#147;a sustainable system that targets resources effectively&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000282"></a>That seems to be as relevant to the concerns about those with learning difficulties, who in adulthood become increasingly vulnerable, as it is to those who are elderly. The problems relating to both are not going to go away. Demography tells us that, if nothing else does. The distribution or sharing of resources, standards of care and responsible authorities are germane to both. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to the case which I believe has been made out by noble Lords that this widely anticipated Green Paper should not address itself to adult social care alone but should include those with learning difficulties.</p>

As I am learning in my job, in which now I am not so new, many noble Lords have huge expertise in these areas, some of whom are represented here today.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000060"></a>Social care is a vital part of the lives of many disabled people, including people with learning disabilities. In 2005-06, a total of &#163;5 billion was spent on social care for 18 to 64 year-olds, of which 56 per cent was spent on people with learning disabilities. That indicates the scale of the issue that needs to be addressed when we consider the future. While we have become better at identifying and supporting people with learning disabilities, there are now many more people with learning disabilities that survive into adulthood and older age and require continuing care. We have a responsibility to ensure that people can access that support. We recognise that the voices of people with learning disabilities and their carers have not always been heard in the debate on social care. Now, as we face fundamental reform of social care, it is of great importance to the Government to consider the needs of people with learning disabilities in the whole debate around social care.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000061"></a>Demand for social care has increased in recent years and is set to rise even further in future. The main reasons for this is down to the major changes happening in our society, which have serious implications for the care system: an ageing population; people with learning disabilities living longer and fuller lives; higher expectations about what services should deliver; and technological changes. All this is excellent news, and a tribute to the advances in medicine and in care over recent decades, as well as the effectiveness of organisations such as Mencap under the leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Rix. But we cannot underestimate the challenge that this represents to social care services.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000062"></a>A recent report produced by the King&#146;s Fund estimated that the cost of providing the current levels of social care for those over 65 will increase from &#163;10 billion per year in 2002, to &#163;24 billion per year in 2026. We also know that by 2021, there will be over 1 million people aged 15 and above with learning disabilities in England, and the number of adults with learning disabilities aged over 60 is predicted to increase by 36 per cent between 2001 and 2021.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000063"></a>Although it is clear that continuing research will be needed to underpin the developing policy, we already know that there is a huge challenge before us. It is the shared ambition across government to put people first, including people with learning disabilities, through a radical reform of public services, enabling people to live their own lives as they wish, confident that services are of high quality, are safe and promote their own individual needs for independence, well-being and dignity. That is why in December last year we published a cross-sector concordat, <I>Putting People First</I>, which establishes collaborative framework between central and local government, the sector&#146;s professional leadership, care providers and the social care regulator. It sets out the shared aims and values, which will work across agendas with users and carers to transform people&#146;s experience of care and support services.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000064"></a>The challenges to delivering the ambitions set out in <I>Putting People First</I> are significant. In recognition of this, we are providing councils with &#163;520 million over the next three years to support them to make the system changes and, more importantly, the cultural changes required to empower citizens to shape their own lives through the support that they need.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000065"></a>However, the noble Lord is right to seek clarity about how we will meet the needs of those with learning disabilities through these reforms. For far too long the needs of people with learning disabilities have not had the prominence they have deserved and needed in the debate on social care. We are committed to listening to the views of people with learning disabilities and their carers, and that is why we are currently consulting on <I>Valuing </I><I>P</I><I>eople </I><I>N</I><I>ow</I><I>: F</I><I>rom </I><I>P</I><I>rogress to </I><I>T</I><I>ransformation</I>. This sets out the priorities for the provision of services for people with learning disabilities for the next three years. <I>Valuing </I><I>P</I><I>eople </I><I>N</I><I>ow</I> sets out how we are working towards transforming people&#146;s lives&#151;for example, through prioritising jobs and housing for people with learning disabilities&#151;through the public service agreements on socially excluded adults.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000066"></a>Through <I>Valuing </I><I>P</I><I>eople </I><I>N</I><I>ow</I> we are setting out the Government&#146;s strategy to tackle a number of serious concerns raised around how health services are meeting the needs of people with learning disabilities. In May 2007, the Secretary of State established an independent inquiry into the healthcare of people with learning disabilities. This was in response, of course, to Mencap&#146;s report <I>Death by </I><I>I</I><I>ndifference</I>, which highlighted the tragic deaths of six people with learning disabilities who were under the care of the NHS. Sir Jonathan Michael is chairing the inquiry and we await his report to the Secretary of State early this summer.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000067"></a>We are committed to considering the feedback from people with learning disabilities and their carers. We shall look with interest at the views of groups such as  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the National Forum, the Task Force and the Learning Disability Coalition and will look to publish the final document in the summer. <I>Valuing people now</I>, which was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and others, and <I>Putting People First</I> are vital to achieving our aspirations for supporting people to live independently through choice and control. However, the challenges of an ageing population and the facts that disabled people are living longer and that higher expectations remain mean that a radical rethink is required of the care and support system to meet these long-term pressures.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000068"></a>The Green Paper mentioned by noble Lords will push forward the commitments made in <I>Putting People First</I> and address the long-term outstanding issues around funding, a point mentioned by my noble friend Lady Wilkins, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and others. Over the next 10 years the Government want to create a new care and support system suitable for those with learning disabilities and their families. This is why the Government announced in the Pre-Budget Report last year that they would be producing a Green Paper on the reform of the care and support system. The Green Paper will look at options for developing a sustainable care and support system and whether it will be possible to develop a new system for all adults, not only for people over the age of 65. This is important for those with learning difficulties as a large proportion of them are of working age rather than pension age. The issue of ageing parents, a point raised by several noble Lords, is clearly part of the consideration of the Green Paper.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000069"></a>At this stage, the Government remain open-minded about the solutions and are keen to work closely with a number of learning disability interest groups throughout this process. These groups will play a vital role in shaping the success of the reform and the support system. My honourable friend Ivan Lewis announced on 6 February that the Department of Health will commence a public engagement process in the spring which will engage with people of all ages about the problems facing the care and support system. In order to capture the views of people with learning disabilities, the Government will ensure that the public engagement process and associated literature are accessible, available in a wide range of formats and appropriately publicised.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000070"></a>Turning now to specific questions raised by the Committee, the noble Lords, Lord Rix and Lord Addington, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Wilkins and Lady Hanham, particularly mentioned the issue of the eligibility criteria&#151;one of the themes with which the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said I would become familiar. The Government have asked CSCI to carry out a review of the criteria for fair access to care services, their application by councils with social services responsibilities and their impact on people, and to address the issues, particularly for those with mild or moderate disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000072"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, raised the issue of people with low and medium-term needs. The range of ways in which local authorities support people with low and moderate disabilities has to be addressed, including support for housing and leisure programmes.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000073"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Rix and Lord Addington, asked about carers. From our outset in 1997, the Government have recognised the value of carers, and since 1999 we have had a policy for carers, which is now being reviewed. We are increasing the amount of money that councils can use to support carers to &#163;185 million this year, and we have made &#163;25 million available to councils to help them support carers who are in a crisis situation. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, also raised the issues of research and how to look at unmet need when planning the Green Paper. Research underpins the reason why the Green Paper is being written. It is, by definition, difficult to identify how much unmet need there is out there. The research that has taken place looked at the overall level of demand and modelled the forward trends. The Green Paper has not been planned on specific research but has been planned and led by the Treasury.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000074"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, asked what the Government are doing about modernising day services. We want people with learning disabilities to be more independent. <I>Valuing People Now</I> has been published, and one of its priorities is what people do during the day, at weekends and in the evening. The deadline for responses is tomorrow.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000075"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, asked what the Government are doing to ensure that people with learning disabilities are not socially marginalised and have access to housing. We have committed to a public service agreement to prioritise support into employment and to enable people with learning disabilities to have security in housing.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000076"></a>I shall turn briefly to the issue raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, about when the Government are transferring funding from learning disability into the NHS and local government. In response to the investigation of learning disabilities in Cornwall, the Government&#146;s commitment was to strengthen the commissioning of learning disability services, including giving consideration to a stronger role for local authorities. The current <I>Valuing People Now</I> consultation is seeking views on a proposal to transfer funding of commissioning responsibility for the social care elements of learning disabilities from PCTs to local authorities. I am not answering the question of &#147;when&#148; because my brief does not tell me, but I will find out and write to the noble Viscount.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000077"></a>I think that I have nearly run out of time, but I want to address all the other issues raised by noble Lords. I shall make two more points. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, quite rightly raises the issue of joining up on every occasion. The concordat <I>Putting People First</I> was signed by six departments. The review for the

I hope that we are making progress. The noble Lord always recognises when we are.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000078"></a>The Green Paper needs to have practical solutions. The options put forward by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Sir Derek Wanless are being considered. They will provide a menu of options that will need to be considered when the Green Paper is published.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000079"></a>The needs of those with learning disabilities are a central policy issue that is being considered in a number of high-profile government agendas. The Green Paper on the reform of care and support systems is a unique opportunity for the Government to consider the needs of large numbers of people with learning disabilities who are living fuller and longer lives. It offers those with learning disabilities an opportunity to create a new system aimed at fulfilling the roles and responsibilities of citizenship by enabling them to have choice of and control over the support they need to live their everyday lives.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>

<p><a name="08032775000082"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08032775000348"></a>Baroness Scott of Needham Market</b> asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government what actions they are taking to tackle the issue of fly-tipping.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000083"></a>The noble Baroness said: Contrary to the Order Paper, this debate is about fly-tipping&#151;not &#147;fly-tapping&#148;, which sounds much more interesting, but it is not a problem of which I am aware.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000084"></a>Fly-tipping makes one&#146;s blood boil, particularly when out in the countryside, enjoying a walk and one comes across a pile of rubbish. It can absolutely incense people. It also appears to have given rise to a whole new industry. Last week, I saw a van with the words &#147;Aquatic Retrieval Unit&#148; on it. Mystified, I asked the driver what he did, and he said, &#147;I fish Tesco trolleys out of the river&#148;. That is another example of the costs generated by this very anti-social behaviour of fly-tipping.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000085"></a>I have mentioned the fact that it is a blight on the countryside, but 88 per cent of fly-tipping incidents occur in urban areas&#151;it is just more obvious if one is in otherwise pristine countryside. According to figures issued by local authorities, there has been a 4.5 per cent increase in incidents in the past year.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000086"></a>I would have thought that reporting fly-tipping would be quite a straightforward matter, but as usual it is not. Having looked into the matter a little more, I have discovered that there are local authorities that will count someone who puts out their bin bag a day early as a fly-tipper. That makes it difficult to work out the exact figures. I am assured that such local authorities have been removed from the figures that I have just given. Clearly, there is a serious problem.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000087"></a>The costs are very high. Local authorities estimate that they spend &#163;74 million clearing up fly-tipping and another &#163;25 million on enforcement and the Environment Agency has costs on top of that. It is so depressing as this problem need not exist. It is not due to some enormous social or economic ill; it is a combination of certain circumstances, to which I shall turn later, and predominantly downright anti-social behaviour.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000088"></a>I am not excusing fly-tipping in the least, but we need to make it simpler for people to dispose of waste easily. I shall take a moment to tell the Committee what happened to me three years ago. I was clearing some ground at my new cottage and I was filling up a skip. A piece of asbestos&#151;about the size of an A4 piece of paper&#151;was in the rubbish. The skip lorry driver would not take it, which was fine, so I drove to the civic amenity site, where I was told that they could not take it and that I would have to go to the main tip. That was a 12-mile drive. There I was made to fill in a form, drive over the weighbridge, drive for 10 minutes through the site, come back, be weighed again and pay &#163;70. That was for a piece of asbestos of that size. I suggest that very few people would have gone to that trouble. We have to make it easier for people who are genuinely trying to help.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000089"></a>To an extent, that exemplifies a problem that we see all through modern life: everyone is so keen to manage their own costs and keep within their own framework that they tend to shunt costs on to someone else or on to the public and do not think about the impact that such a policy might have on the behaviour of the public. Certainly, the Environment Agency has argued that the costs and complexity of managing waste lawfully encourages some people to dump their waste and to fly-tip. We should certainly not ignore the Environment Agency, which after all is the expert in this area. The law of unintended consequences is familiar to all of us.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000090"></a>Operators of civic amenity sites often install height barriers; they create bureaucratic systems. They do so for good reasons&#151;for example, to sort out commercial from domestic waste&#151;but there are many examples of people who get caught out by them. They are simply householders who are trying to behave in an orderly way and find themselves unable to do so. It is increasingly the case that small contractors who come to change the kitchen or perhaps the bathroom will not take the old goods away because they do not want to pay for them to be tipped, which leaves the householder with them. Some householders, who are unable or unwilling to deal with them in any other way, will simply dump them. I am not sure that the name &#147;civic amenity site&#148; is terribly useful. A lot of people do not know what it does. I am not sure why we call it that.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000091"></a>Local authorities probably do not pursue fly-tippers as vigorously as they might because there is a high cost involved. The debate is similar to that which we used to have about speeding fines, where the police would not stop people for speeding because it cost more to prosecute them than to let them speed. Is there not a solution in that? Should we not consider hypothecating fine income? What happens to fines for  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC127"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fly-tipping offences? The Environment Agency says that its court actions last year resulted in &#163;422,000 being levied in fines. Does that go the Exchequer?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000092"></a>The Government&#146;s waste strategy is very helpful&#151;I know that they take it very seriously. Their proposals with regard to recycling, reducing packaging and a more draconian enforcement regime are welcome. There is a maximum penalty in the magistrates&#146; court of &#163;50,000, but, according the Environment Agency, the average fine per prosecution &#163;3,298. Is that because there were no cases serious enough to warrant the maximum fine, or is it because magistrates are reluctant to impose high fines?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000093"></a>The waste strategy also proposes an increase in the landfill tax escalator of &#163;8 per year. Having served on the board of the regulator, Entrust, for eight years, I am familiar with the landfill tax. The landfill tax credit scheme has certainly provided funding for many useful projects. However, I am worried that the increase in the level of landfill tax will encourage people to fly-tip. The bulk of landfill tax money simply goes straight to the Treasury. Have the Government considered giving some of the income from the escalator to local authorities and the Environment Agency to clean up if more fly-tipping results from the increase?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000094"></a>Last year&#146;s local elections were rather odd in that they did not seem to be won or lost on political lines. They were &#147;bin&#148; elections, where councils across the country won or lost according to whether they were moving to fortnightly waste collections. A lot of high-flown rubbish was written about what was going to happen, some of it apocalyptic. Where are the Government on that subject? How much do they know about what is likely to happen if we move to fortnightly waste collection? Is there any evidence that it encourages fly-tipping? That question is even more relevant to &#147;chip and bin&#148; schemes. Will the Minister update the Committee on the Government&#146;s thinking, especially on how it is possible to create incentives which should in theory create less waste but may also provide an incentive to fly-tip?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000095"></a>I am grateful to other noble Lords who have agreed to speak in this short debate. I look forward to their contributions and to the response of the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000096"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08032775000349"></a>Viscount Goschen:</b> I welcome the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, and agree with everything that she said about this problem. It is an area where the balance between penalties and incentives is wrong. The problem is getting away from us. Incidences of fly-tipping are increasing dramatically, but we are not managing to defeat the problem by bringing prosecutions with the current level of fines. I believe that we have the balance wrong between the factors that affect law-abiding people who try to do the right thing by disposing of their waste correctly, the level of penalties that can be applied and the vigour used to pursue illegal fly-tippers.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000097"></a>Much of the problem is caused by jobbing builders of one sort or another&#151;small-scale firms for which the hassle and cost of disposing of their waste is just too much for them. It is all very well to say&#151;and I shall be absolutely staggered if the Minister does not  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC128"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>say it at some stage during his remarks&#151;that the polluter should pay. Of course the polluter should pay, but the way in which the incentives are structured at the moment, it is not the polluter that pays but householders through their council tax and also landowners. The levy is just too easy to evade. The countryside is a big place and fly-tipping takes place in urban areas as well. People will be irresponsible and they will dispose of their waste similarly irresponsibly. I in no way condone that but we have to recognise that as a fact.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000098"></a>Therefore, first, I think that we should at least seriously consider whether it would be more economically and environmentally effective to allow trade waste up to perhaps a weight of one tonne or a volume of two cubic metres&#151;approximately what can be carried in a pick-up truck or light van&#151;to be disposed of for free, as for a householder. If we did that, we would remove at a stroke a significant degree of fly-tipping in this country. I should like to know whether the Government have done a cost-benefit analysis of making such a change&#151;what it would cost and what the benefits might be in terms of a reduction in fly-tipping. Perhaps this is something that could be trialled as a local issue and we could see the results. Such a suggestion would also be helpful to householders who turn up in anything that looks like a commercial vehicle. These days, plenty of people own pick-up trucks, SUVs or a trailer&#151;perhaps a horse box or something of that nature&#151;and want to dispose of rubbish, but they are faced with bureaucracy at waste disposal centres. The other day at Question Time I heard the Minister rebutting that but I have had experience of it. One is made to feel not quite a criminal but when trying to do the right thing one is put through the wringer before being allowed to dispose of waste.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000099"></a>Secondly, I think that we should forget all thoughts of bin taxes and recycling penalties for householders. That will lead only to more plastic bags being slung out of cars&#151;and all to avoid a tiny penalty for something which then costs a fortune to clear up. If we apply financial incentives for misbehaving, we should not be surprised when that happens. The noble Baroness referred to the law of unintended consequences. They may be unintended but they are fully foreseen, and many people, including Members of your Lordships&#146; House, have warned about them. We see the landfill tax increasing, and if people have incentives for disposing of their rubbish illegally, I am sure that they will continue to do so. Therefore, let us make it easier for people to obey the law.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000100"></a>Thirdly, we have to get on top of the enforcement fees. Can the Minister tell us the ratio between instances of fly-tipping and successful prosecutions? According to the figures given by the noble Baroness, the figure for the latter is minuscule. I have some personal experience of this. Near to where a relative of mine lives, repeated fly-tipping takes place in the lane that is used to access the house. One day, this got too much for me. I sorted through the rubbish and found an envelope with a name and address on it. I then got out my map and went round to the householder whose address was on the envelope. I asked what had happened and was told that a firm of jobbing builders had come to pitch for some work replacing guttering&#151;the rubbish that had  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC129"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been disposed of was guttering. Feeling like Hercule Poirot, I then contacted the local authority to say that I had the rubbish, the piece of paper, the evidence from the householder and the name and address of the building firm that had dumped the rubbish, and I asked the authority to move to a prosecution. I was asked, &#147;Did you see them dumping it?&#148;. I did not, but that is rather like saying that, unless you actually see someone murdering someone else, it is not possible to prosecute them. That struck me as an extraordinary attitude. It turned out that this family firm was very well known for this sort of thing. The local authority officers were intimidated by the extended family and decided to take no action.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000101"></a>My third suggestion is that we should consider whether private contractors should be allowed to pursue fly-tippers on a &#147;bounty&#148; basis to bring forward successful actions. We know the vigour, for example, in London with which one is pursued for being more than one second over the time allowed on a parking meter. One is suddenly presented with a fine of &#163;100 for that terrible offence. Compare that with the illegal dumping of rubbish. These are two totally different things, but, if one has a firm with people highly incentivised to pursue misdemeanours, why can they not use the investigative qualities demonstrated in that instance? It would be welcome if the Minister could address that.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000102"></a>Finally, I would like to ask the Minister about rats. We are told that instances of rodent infestation were up 32 per cent in the last period. Is there any thought that this is connected with the improper disposal of rubbish?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000103"></a>Fly-tipping is a serious problem. It blights the countryside. The economic costs are huge. With a better balance between the stick and carrot I believe that we can make some progress on it.</p>
<h5><a name="08032775000325"></a>3.16 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08032775000104"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08032775000350"></a>Lord Dear:</b> I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, for introducing this short debate. Fly-tipping is a serious problem whether you live in urban or country areas. I understand that 93 per cent of rubbish is fly-tipped in urban areas, and that leaves 7 per cent in rural areas. It seems in the rural areas to be bigger; it is certainly more unsightly and more obvious. It is that small area that I want to focus on this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000105"></a>I declare an interest as a member of Countryside Alliance, which has produced this very good and timely leaflet that has already been mentioned&#151;<I>Time for Action</I>. It contains a lot of information and a lot of useful and worthwhile suggestions. The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, has already talked about landowners. I want to amplify some of his points. Fly-tipping is a big problem for landowners. The acreage involved for the landowner is immaterial. All you need to have is a driveway, a gateway or a lay-by alongside your land and you will be a target for the fly-tipper. We understand that it is a major problem for three-quarters of all landowners. Put another way, it affects 67 per cent of all farmers. I live in a rural area, and all the farmers I have spoken to have, without exception, said, &#147;We have a big problem&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000106"></a>The cost of getting rid of the problem, so far as Defra is concerned, is the &#163;47 million visited on the farmer or the landowner, but I would think that that is a highly conservative estimate; one could easily speculate that it could be half as much again, or even more.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000107"></a>What do you see? We have all seen everything from cars and used nappies to fridges, furniture, and mattresses. Fifty per cent of rubbish tipped is in black bags, which you can conclude comes from domestic sources and not just from the jobbing builder; and 53 per cent&#151;again roughly half&#151;of what is dumped is estimated by volume to have come from a small van or a car. There is an indication of the sort of people who are fly-tipping in the countryside.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000108"></a>We have speculated on the reasons for fly-tipping. They are fairly obvious. It could be because of increased charges for disposal of rubbish from your home; laziness plays a big part; perhaps increased regimentation in how councils are beginning to put out a whole range of different coloured bins for us to sort our rubbish, and some people just do not want to do that; and of course the hike in the landfill tax, which has already been mentioned.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000109"></a>What is the landowner to do? I focus on the landowner, as I said at the beginning of this short address. He will find that local authorities will vary between those who are sympathetic to his plight to those who are at the other end of the scale&#151;almost bone-headed.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000110"></a>The landowner has the problem. The rubbish is dumped, by definition, on private land; if he moves it to the verge, which is an obvious answer for him, he immediately runs the risk of committing an offence of depositing litter in a public place from a private place. He is open to prosecution. He is all right if he has already entered into some sort of verbal contract with the local authority, because some local authorities will pick the rubbish up from the verge and take it away for him. It is lucky for the landowner if that is what happens, but many local authorities will not do that. He is then faced with either leaving the litter on his land and ignoring it, certain in the knowledge that one lot of litter will attract more to it like a magnet, or he can pick it up in his own trailer, pick-up truck or lorry and moves it to a civic community site. There, as we have already heard, he can be met with a variety of responses. He may get a helpful response, which allows him to dump it on the civic community site, but more often than not at the site&#151;which may be managed directly by the local authority or by an agent on its behalf&#151;he will be met with an interrogation which frequently finishes either with him paying a fee to dump it as a commercial user or with him being turned away. What does he do with the rubbish then? One option is to dump it in some other neighbour&#146;s yard or field&#151;but I leave that question open because the point that I make is fairly self-evident.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000111"></a>The problem is similarly met by do-it-yourself handymen, who have a sink, a bath and a couple of bits and pieces of rubble. They are met with the same problem at civic community sites. That leads me to say the obvious&#151;that there is a need for a sympathetic standardisation of approach at civic community sites  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC131"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for people seeking quite properly to get rid of their rubbish in that way. It is very unfair to penalise and make life difficult for the landowner, who is after all at the very end of the litter trail. We do not penalise people who have been inconvenienced or sustained damage to their properties in a burglary or assault. Those are both criminal offences&#151;and this, too, is a criminal offence. The victim in this sense is the landowner who has found the car or mattress on his land, who is penalised because he very often has no redress and it is a lottery according to which local authority area he lives in.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000112"></a>We should not ask the Government to legislate on this, as we have too much legislation in the public domain already, but the Government are well placed to use their best offices to influence local authorities&#151;probably through the LGA&#151;to sort out a code of best practice for themselves to make life easier for those trying to use those civic community sites. As has been said, we should try to encourage magistrates to take the subject seriously, not through Defra but through government ministries. Then we could see just what a problem it is, where according to statistics half the litter in the country is fly-tipped. I hesitate to say whether those figures are true or not, but that is what we are led to believe. There is a problem, however, and magistrates need to be aware of the size of it.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000113"></a>Putting a cart before a horse, I think that we should press for more and better enforcement from local authorities. The noble Viscount has already spoken about that&#151;although there has been a 46 per cent increase in enforcement from 2005-06 to 2006-07. We need to look at local authorities providing more adequate civic amenity sites. I live in a rural area in north Gloucestershire, where we have just gone through the exercise of having new bins and a new regime to collect rubbish, for which we are paying. In the literature that came to me through my door last week, I was told with a note of pride that there are two civic amenity sites that I can use; the nearest are in Cirencester and Wotton-under-Edge. That is fine, except that one is 30 miles away and the other is 48 miles away, for me or anyone else who wants to use them. The distance to be travelled really defies anyone wanting to use that sort of service.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000114"></a>I conclude by echoing the words that have been said and precursing some of the words that will be said in this short debate. It is not really for government to do anything other than influence others, but the real problem lies with the local authorities and can be remedied by them. I ask the Government to use their best offices in that direction to encourage them in a more standardised and sympathetic approach.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000116"></a>She mentioned the fly-tipping of domestic waste. This practice has an educational element because an unfortunate by-product of the increasingly rigorous categorisation of waste, and the EU directives on which much of it is founded, is that fly-tipping becomes a way of getting around it.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000117"></a>I declare an interest as a farmer whose business has benefited from the recovery of old railway sleepers, telegraph poles and a great deal of second-hand equipment. I hope that the Environment Agency does not try to gold-plate some of the regulations, one of which is that anything that has not been used for 12 months should be classified as waste. On a farm, as long as items are kept tidy, a use can be found for them long after 12 months of not being used.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000118"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dear, mentioned that 67 per cent of farmers suffer from fly-tipping, some of which can be costly to remove. There is a question of how to distinguish between fly-tipping, which is the main subject today, and litter. A great deal of the disfigurement of the countryside is caused by litter, which people throw from their car or from their backpacks and leave lying around. The most extreme example in our area&#151;this raises embarrassment with the police&#151;is that people go to a shop such as Millets, buy a tent, camp out in a remote area and then walk away and leave the tent when they have had their night&#146;s camping. Someone will see that the tent has been sitting there for a day or two and inform the police that there might be a dead body inside it. Several policemen then have to investigate the situation, only to find that the tent has been abandoned. These are the kind of strange developments that our throwaway society can produce.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000119"></a>One of the current problems for the ordinary public is to know what rules and regulations the local authority has at its disposal sites. Do the Government publish any guidance on best practice&#151;I am treading on the same area as the noble Lord, Lord Dear&#151;which would enable greater publicity and transparency for the public? Obviously each local authority will invent its own rules but it would help if there was a general guidance which set out what materials a local authority tip will accept. Again, the question of quantity and whether a tip will accept only a certain amount may arise. It is obviously terribly frustrating to turn up with rubbish and for someone to say, &#147;I am afraid your car is too big. We cannot let you in here. It is a question for the commercial dump&#148;. We should somehow urge local authorities to show more flexibility and gear the hours when the sites are open to more useful times of the day so that people can carry out their own domestic disposal.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000120"></a>Has any correlation been made between fly-tipping and the scarcity of local authority disposal points? This is as much an urban question as a rural one, although in rural areas people are geared up to drive a little further than people in urban areas.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000121"></a>We have touched on the introduction of bin taxes. The Minister will be familiar with our dealings on the Climate Change Bill and the introduction of his five pilot schemes. It is important that the Government should monitor whether there is some correlation between fly-tipping and the areas where the pilot schemes are running to see whether they are having any effect.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000122"></a>On the question of the increased categorisation of what constitutes waste, the Minister will know that his colleague in another place announced that the statistics for Flycapture, the Government&#146;s scheme, showed a massive increase in the incidence of fly-tipping between  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>2004-05 and 2005-06. In fact it went up from just under 1 million to over 2.5 million incidents in one year. Statistics are always open to interpretation.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000123"></a>Another point was referred to by my noble friend Lord Goschen: if someone is found fly-tipping, what powers does a farmer or an occupant have? He referred to the fact that if you have not actually seen someone fly-tipping, there is nothing you can do. Even if you see it happening, the problem is that a guy with the back of a lorry open just has to put his foot on the accelerator and you will have a hard job catching up with him.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000124"></a>I think we would like to see&#151;it may be up to the individuals concerned&#151;more information for magistrates on what powers are available to them. I know that vehicles can be confiscated&#151;I hope that that will be applied to repeat offenders&#151;but it is obviously a very stern disincentive to anyone who might carry out that activity. There are those who have a reputation for fly-tipping. I gather that the Environment Agency may have a power to take vehicles when the offence is discovered. Perhaps the Minister could tell us how that is likely to apply.</p>

She is to be congratulated. People feel strongly about the subject and many feel that nothing is being done. I do not accuse the Government of that. Much may be being done but the perception is otherwise. I too am grateful to the Countryside Alliance for their briefing.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000126"></a>I shall start my contribution by relating direct experience. I declare an interest as a farmer and someone who, in many ways, is a victim of fly-tipping. This morning, I spoke to my nephew who has to deal with it daily. He said, &#147;Can I have a video link so that I can tell them?&#148; I thought it might be more dispassionate if I relate what he said to me.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000127"></a>I wish to do justice to the anger felt by those who regularly have to deal with fly-tipping on their property. As he said they are losing the battle and the problem is getting worse. I do not live near a large metropolitan area; I live near a country market town; but my nephew tells me that at least once a month he has to send out a tractor and trailer with a couple of chaps to clear up the rubbish that he has discovered around the place. He is not prone to exaggeration and I believe that that is an accurate account of how frequently he has to do that. He also has a truck and frequently picks up stuff. He has to collect litter from roadside verges, green lanes, hedges, dykes, gateways and sometimes well into a field. People will not take rubbish to a tip but they will put it 50 yards into a field. It is quite unbelievable. It can be just general rubbish, as my noble friend the Duke of Montrose has mentioned, but much is in plastic bin liners, so people have put it in bags but have failed to put it out for domestic collection and it is dumped on someone else's land. There are tyres, fridges, TVs and general builders&#146; rubble, frequently containing asbestos and sometimes clearly hazardous waste. That is dangerous for cattle  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and livestock, it is damaging to farm machinery and it blocks drains, dykes, sluices and pumps in the fens, which is a major problem for drainage boards that have to deal with such waterborne rubbish.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000128"></a>Theoretically, local authorities will come along and clear roadside verges, but they are overwhelmed. If one does nothing about it and waits for them, one just encourages more litter. As the noble Lord, Lord Dear, said, litter encourages litter, and fly-tipping encourages fly-tipping. Local authorities will collect things from the yard, such as WEEE items, but we have to pay. For asbestos, we may have to ask a specialist contractor to take it away; otherwise, we have to take it to the site to get rid of it.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000129"></a>As has been said, 67 per cent of farmers report incidents of fly-tipping, though I suspect even more experience it. The Flycapture report states that local authorities prosecuted in 2006-07 only 1,371 people. There seems to be a disparity between people&#146;s experience of the problem and how often people are brought to book for it. My nephew tells me that he has found envelopes with addresses on them, taken them to the authorities and said, &#147;Look, this person has dumped rubbish on my land&#148;, but no prosecution has ever resulted from such an incident.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000130"></a>A Written Answer of 3 December 2007&#151;in Commons <I>Hansard</I> at col. 777W&#151; lists fly-tipping incidents reported in the West Midlands during the three years ending in 2007. The region contains 34 councils which are responsible for waste disposal, 20 of which, including Birmingham City Council, did not report a single prosecution. Some incidents involved very hazardous and polluting materials&#151;we are talking of genuine criminal activity in certain cases.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000131"></a>Many of the problems that trouble private landowners and public authorities&#151;they, too, are victims of fly-tipping&#151;are low-level. They are a consequence of idleness, unwillingness to pay and a minimal risk of being found out. However, someone has to pay; in many cases, it is the farmer. A report for the Environment Agency, which the Countryside Alliance has reproduced, cites &#163;47 million as the per-annum cost to land managers and farmers. I believe that it may be more.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000132"></a>The guidance on fly-tipping from the Environment Agency, produced in 2004, states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08032775000314"></a>&#147;if someone dumps rubbish on private land the landowner must get permission from the appropriate agency before paying a registered waste carrier to take it away ... if someone dumps rubbish on private land the landowner must devise a transfer note to accompany the rubbish should he wish to accumulate it on a neighbour&#146;s property ... if someone dumps rubbish on private land and the landowner decides it will rot down he must register the site for composting&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000283"></a>Is this guidance still operational? If so, does the poor landowner have to pay for the various permissions and does the Minister find such charges fair? Does the Minister agree with Joan Ruddock, who said in a Written Answer on 20 February that,</p>
<ul><a name="08032775000315"></a>&#147;to place a duty on the authorities and the Environment Agency to remove waste from private land would create a fly-tippers' charter&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 27/02/08; col. 1625W.]</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000284"></a>If so, will he explain the reasoning behind that comment?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000133"></a>As I said, I do not accuse the Government of doing nothing. The Minister will no doubt tell us that the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 give local authorities and the Environment Agency powers to tackle fly-tipping, and courts the power to impose penalties. The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 introduced specific measures to deal with fly-tipping&#151;I have the details in front of me. The Government have a waste strategy for England which they produced last year. So I do not accuse the Government of doing nothing, but we can do more. There is no quick fix, but we can do some things, which I hope have emerged in the debate today.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000134"></a>Everyone has mentioned the issue of improved access to civic amenity sites. The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, gave a vivid illustration of the difficulties she had with her single sheet of asbestos. The noble Lord, Lord Dear, made it quite clear that in some cases the tips are so far away from where people live that it is difficult for them to get there. My noble friend the Duke of Montrose mentioned the hours that the tips are open. They are civic amenity sites and should provide a civic amenity.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000135"></a>I am fortunate to have a sunshine home in France, which I enjoy greatly. There they have a different approach which may be worth considering. This does not remove all fly-tipping but it localises the centralisation of the municipal tip. The d&#233;chetterie is nearby&#151;most people can get to it&#151;and you can recycle everything. There is no doorstep collection in rural areas in France; people have to take their waste to a central depot. So what they are saving in that they are reinvesting in this. There is less fly-tipping there than here at home.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000136"></a>We should also encourage greater support for the relationship between local authorities, farmers and public bodies who have to deal with this problem. It should be solved by co-operation, not by putting landowners under the pressure of feeling almost the guilty party when they seek to dispose of waste that has been illegally dumped on their property. I hope we can give a proper briefing to prosecuting authorities and magistrates on the and cost of fly-tipping and the damage it causes.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000137"></a>I do not know whether the Flycapture database includes every reported incident that takes place on private land. It has been mentioned before that the statistics are questionable. Certainly a million incidents in Liverpool seems beyond belief. It is difficult to reconcile with figures from elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000138"></a>My noble friend the Duke of Montrose referred to the Climate Change Bill and the five pilots therein. It is important that we encourage the local authorities which commit to these pilots to monitor fly-tipping incidents in parallel, both before and after the introduction of the schemes, because we would not want a situation arising whereby in order to provide more efficient local waste collection systems we also increase the amount of fly-tipping. There needs to be a reconciliation between these issues. The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, has some interesting ideas about ways in which we might ameliorate this problem.</p>

It has been really useful. We could have spent more time discussing this issue in the Climate Change Bill, although it is ancillary to the five pilots. No pilot will be allowed to go ahead unless it has an active plan for dealing with fly-tipping; that is part of the process. Any council which wants to become one of the five pilots to test out different systems for household collection recycling has to have certain rules for the kerbside collection of a number of different items and a good plan for dealing with fly-tipping.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000141"></a>I, too, compliment the Countryside Alliance on its report. It is first class. It came out some time ago now and nobody has done anything better. If I could stand here and say that we could accept and implement all the recommendations I would be happy to do so. They are all sensible and practical. Of course there are cost issues on some of them.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000142"></a>This week, Joan Ruddock, the Minister for fly-tipping&#151;and this is the first time this week that no one has blamed Defra, which is nice&#151;met the Countryside Alliance to discuss its report. So there are ongoing discussions about this. As I have informed my colleagues, when they get the Climate Change Bill in the other place I suspect that there will be a lot more interest from the elected Members of Parliament on the clauses at the end of the Bill relating to waste, than there was in this House, simply because of the pressure from local authorities and constituents. I suspect that they will hone in very much on that.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000143"></a>Funnily enough, this morning I was on a brief visit to look at some areas of catchment-sensitive farming practices alongside the River Kennet near Hungerford. Although it was not the purpose for my visit, as I was leaving I said to one of the two farmers that I had met, &#147;I have got to go now and get back to the House of Lords, but, by the way, what is the story on fly-tipping around here?&#148; His immediate estimate was that it had doubled in the previous two or three years. I did not see any rubbish this morning. I was around tracks; it was certainly fly-tipping country. I do not want to encourage anybody, but the view was that it had doubled and was becoming a real nuisance. So it is a serious issue.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000144"></a>I think that I can answer most of the points when I turn to my speaking notes. I turn to the statistics. Noble Lords will have read the briefings and those from the department, and I read the very interesting brief from the Countryside Alliance. I knew that Liverpool was the culture capital of Europe this year, but I do not think that it really wanted to be the fly-tipping capital of England. The way the figures are recorded has made it so. It is quite clear that it has penalised and counted people as fly-tippers who have put out rubbish a day early. It is not good for us in  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC137"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>terms of policy making if you do not have common statistics. Nobody has made a point about different local authorities, and I do not want to bandy those statistics around, but there are some serious issues.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000145"></a>There is no argument that, whether it is rural or urban, fly-tipping undermines the quality of life. The noble Lord, Lord Dear, is right that although the percentages look smaller for the countryside, the impact on life is greater because the rubbish is not hidden up back alleys and so on. It is visible and dumped in such a way that it encourages others.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000146"></a>We are in the early stages of collecting data on this. There is no doubt that over recent years fly-tipping has increased. We have 1.3 million recordable cases in England. We use the figure of 1.3 million. It would be ludicrous to use the 2.6 million because the other 1.3 are all from Liverpool. It just does not make sense. We have examples. I will not name the authority, but I will give an example. A small district council in 2005-06 had 41 recorded incidents. The other district councils in that country had around about 300 to 400, and one had 900. The following year, 2006-07, all the other councils were still about the same, but the council that had 41 now had 277. Clearly, the 41 figure was wrong; it was undercounted. It is a serious issue. It really does not matter what the statistics are. It is costing landowners and local authorities a fortune, and it is diminishing the quality of life for people in urban and rural areas. We have to do more about it.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000147"></a>The <I>Waste Stra</I><I>tegy for Engl</I><I>a</I><I>n</I><I>d</I>, published in May last year, included a waste crime action plan. That sets out measures that we are introducing over a period of time to deal with fly-tipping. It focuses on better prevention measures and simplifying legislation and guidance to encourage compliance. That is fundamental, as is simplifying access to the recycling sites. I agree that they should all be called recycling centres. It is a complete nonsense to have different titles for what are, in effect, the same things.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000148"></a>The plan also focuses on enabling more joined-up action and prosecutions by the Environment Agency and local authorities. There is a fear in local authorities that the lawyers and compliance people will say to them, &#147;You can&#146;t spend all that money on prosecutions. It isn&#146;t worth it. You don&#146;t get the money back, because the money goes to the Treasury. Give them a warning&#148;. Some local authorities are more active than others in this regard. I do not have the figures to back this up but I am told that Leeds, in particular, is very vigorous and has succeeded in cutting the amount of fly-tipping. This morning, I was given the example of two adjoining counties, one of which has a much more vigorous attitude to prosecution. The local people I was with from the Environment Agency and Natural England said that there was less fly-tipping in the county where it was known that prosecutions were followed vigorously. Therefore, taking such a stance can have an effect on people&#146;s behaviour, and we want to ensure that the enforcement tools are practical.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>

The plans will strengthen the duty of care requirements and force construction businesses to track more closely the waste that they produce. In enforcing the plans, local authorities will have an extra tool at their disposal for dealing with the 30 per cent of fly-tips which involve construction waste.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000150"></a>Later in the spring, we will consult on our plans to strengthen the powers of local authorities to stop, search and seize vehicles suspected of being involved in illegal waste activity. I think that that partly covers one of the questions that I was asked about seizure. Effectively, there will be a consultation process. These powers will allow local authorities to take habitual offenders out of action much more easily and, it is hoped, undermine their illegal activity. I fully accept that local authority officers can sometimes be intimidated by these people, and I appreciate their difficulties.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000151"></a>We will also consult on our plans to reform controls on the transfer of waste. We need to ensure that waste producers and carriers take responsibility for the waste in their care. Householders and businesses can be duped into paying illegal operators whom they believe will deal with their waste and relieve them of their responsibility, but then these operators dump the waste around the corner. The waste duty of care is the main control that we have to ensure that waste is handled responsibly, and we have to ensure that the registration system is more effective and user-friendly. We also need to make sure that people are more aware of their responsibilities by giving them access to the information that they need to be certain that their waste is being removed legally. The fact that there is a duty to do that is important.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000152"></a>Believe it or not, we are still going to spend money on research into why illegal waste activity occurs. It is evident from what noble Lords have said that it tends to happen where the sites are some distance away. However, the one that I use near Bishop&#146;s Cleeve seems to be a bit closer to where the noble Lord, Lord Dear, lives. It is within Gloucestershire, so it should be all right for him to use it. Although I cannot say that people are not turned away, I have never seen it happen. There may also be an issue of practicality&#151;for example, there may be a problem relating to the size of vehicles or the opening hours. Some sites open seven days a week and close only on Christmas Day. However, others do not open seven days a week and that causes real difficulties. Opening is also restricted during hours of darkness.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000153"></a>We hope to do some further research into organised waste crime. In some parts of the country, waste disposal is an organised criminal activity. There is a lot of money to be made from it because payment of the necessary taxes can be avoided. I know that we are dealing with England but my experience in Northern Ireland was certainly that organising the illegal disposal of waste was a major activity. On the other hand, the more we can do to encourage recycling and the creation of businesses and assets out of recycling, the more people will realise that there is gold in waste. There are plenty of examples of that around the country but on a much smaller scale.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000154"></a>Many authorities work closely with landowners. I fully accept the difficulty that landowners face. With regard to the fly-tippers&#146; charter, it was thought that if everyone knew that what got dumped in the countryside would be taken away, that would simply encourage people to avoid the proper landfill arrangements because they could have their waste taken away for free. However, the present situation is clearly unsatisfactory. We need to build up a better picture of the problem of fly-tipping on private land, and we are exploring the possible development of the Flycapture database to capture such incidents.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000155"></a>At a national level, Defra and the Environment Agency meet bi-monthly with major stakeholders such as the NFU, the CLA, Network Rail and the National Trust through the National Fly-tipping Prevention Group. Their objective is to explore ways of improving the system of controls over fly-tipping. I understand the concerns that have been raised, and I will write to noble Lords regarding the detail of some of the points. If a landowner has to move fly-tipped waste from his land, he must use a registered waste carrier, and it is very unfair on him if he has to make arrangements to do that.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000156"></a>Standardising practice in recycling centres, as I call them, is difficult because each local authority has to deal with its own area and you cannot have a one-size-fits-all system. It might be possible to do something about the days and hours of opening and about not excluding cars. Someone said that their car was too long to be able to use a recycling site. However, if it was a car, it was not a van, and there is a limit to what you can get into a car, however big it is. It is ludicrous for someone to be turned away because their car is too big. If you take an estate car to these sites, you should not be turned away. We shall need to look at this matter because difficulties can arise where people live on boundaries between local authorities.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000157"></a>The ratio of prosecutions to fly-tipping incidents is low but, as I said, local authorities will have to be told that they must act proportionately, and they will be given that information by their lawyers.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000158"></a>Data show that there is no obvious correlation between collections on alternate weeks and an increase in fly-tipping, but there might be if the nature of the collections, charges and penalties and so on were changed. Therefore, the five pilot areas must have an anti-fly-tipping strategy in place; otherwise, they will not be allowed to act as pilot areas.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000159"></a>We will certainly take any ideas that have been put forward today and put them into the pot for the Minister. We may need to look at different methods of enforcement. If you give people a financial incentive and create businesses, it is possible to snuff out&#151;or at least control&#151;an activity. That has happened with parking, although the system is abused by the clampers, but it has certainly been better at keeping the traffic moving than was the case in the past.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000163"></a>The noble Lord said: First, I thank the British Council for its work on the migrant integration policy index. My thanks also go to the Migrant Policy Group in Brussels, which co-ordinated the contents of the research that provides the basis of my contribution today. The debate comes at a crucial time, with the Prime Minister and the President of France today discussing the issue of immigration. Only this morning we saw a most disturbing report on the treatment of asylum seekers in this country.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000164"></a>MIPEX uses indicators to compare the legal provisions across Europe to promote the integration of non-European Union migrants. This is a timely measure. There is often a confused debate in this country about a cohesive society, particularly when issues of multi-ethnicity and multi-culturalism surface. There is a kind of schizophrenia on matters of immigration on the one hand and community cohesion and a pluralist society on the other. The progress that we have made in achieving some sort of multi-culturalism is too valuable to be played in a cynical manner. This is often backed up by a perception of the majority population that, despite all our history and all our pride in tolerance, the majority is somehow not able to live as part of a community of communities.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000165"></a>Some of us have spent a lifetime of work in the field of race relations. The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of legislation and other machinery to establish equality of opportunity for all our citizens. There is now a strong emphasis on race, disability, gender, age, faith and sexual orientation. The law puts a new emphasis on promoting good relations between people of different groups. It is clear that bench-marking is commonly used in the private sector and particularly in the field of justice, security and freedom; however, the exercise remains a relatively new phenomenon for immigrant integration. It is here that MIPEX provides a constant and reliable stocktaking with the ability to track policy advances and reversals.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000166"></a>Let me at the outset avoid the confusion about migrants. We are talking about&#151;MIPEX uses the term in this way&#151;third country nationals legally residing in an EU member state. It covers six policy areas which shape a migrant&#146;s journey to full citizenship. I am delighted that the debate in the UK has moved to citizenship. The six policy areas that are covered by MIPEX are labour market access, family reunion, long-term residence, principal participation, access to nationality and anti-discrimination.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000167"></a>There is clear evidence that now links MIPEX with debates on the impact of European co-operation in the areas of national law, measuring integration outcomes and other indexing exercises. The outcome has demonstrated that best practices flow from such initiatives. It would be helpful to know the Minister&#146;s response on this point. How often do we use such information and has this assisted our law-making process on matters of  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC141"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>integration and citizenship? I have always argued that the pull factor on immigration is not just restricted to the United Kingdom but affects other EU countries as well. It is estimated that more than 16 million people from non-EU countries form the migrant diaspora across Europe. Commentators, both politicians and in the press, have pointed to the impact of globalisation, devolution, asylum and immigration issues as relevant to this process. Thomas Huddleston, the MIPEX research co-ordinator, has pointed out:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000297"></a>&#147;We expect to see further synergies activities in the upcoming year, as the MIPEX, one of the few sources for comparative information on integration policies in Europe, stimulates new projects that aim to move forward national, sub-national, and European debates&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000285"></a>I want to ensure that we, in this country, are part of this process. It would also be helpful to have an assurance from the Minister that the Government will use the study at many levels of governance. This is a positive way to take the integration debate forward.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000168"></a>We all accept that the old political spectrum of left and right is less important now and politicians are competing to promote concepts such as community cohesion. However, frequent political debates and statements lack strategic thought. Political agendas often fail to take into account the systematic benefits of planned migration. MIPEX has moved national agendas forward by raising potential areas of improvement and greater European co-operation. The conclusion reached by MIPEX was that making policies themselves the subject of evaluations, through good indicators, may bring significant improvements to the appropriateness and quality of a country's integration strategy. It is for this reason that a viable national policy on immigration and integration must take into account the European dimension and that best practices identified by MIPEX ought to be at the core of such debates.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000169"></a>Other important issues are identified by MIPEX, such as equality and access which have been the cornerstone principle in many of the definitions of integration policy across Europe. There can be little dispute that equality of opportunity and access allows migrants to have full confidence to lead an active and purposeful life. The United Kingdom has a proud record of anti-discriminatory legislation. Successive Race Relations Acts have helped to outlaw discrimination, but the promotion of equality of opportunity and good relations between different groups is established in our legislation.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000170"></a>However, the reality is different. The former Commission for Racial Equality has repeatedly reported an increase in race discrimination cases. Law is an unequivocal statement of public policy in a democratic institution. Citizenship and nationality mean very little if that process is flawed. MIPEX found that when this is translated into laws and policies across Europe, the six policy areas covered by the MIPEX report favourably about traditional countries of immigration. I am glad to record that the United Kingdom fits into this category.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000171"></a>Some European countries seek out best practices from countries such as the United Kingdom. To an extent this has helped to frame the legal framework in  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC142"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those countries. We should therefore exercise great care that policy formulation on migrants is based on objective criteria, as explained by MIPEX. Nowhere is this more important than the matter of family reunion. Of course, practices such as forced marriages, human trafficking and abduction should have no place in a civilised society. We are right to outlaw such practices.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000172"></a>However, we must respect a right to a family life. If there is one criticism I have to make of our Government, it is their subjective approach to marriage and family reunion. The MIPEX report stated that reuniting families gives a migrant a sense of social and cultural stability in their countries of residence that makes for more stable diverse societies. A fair, flexible, transparent, expeditious procedure does not introduce bureaucratic conditions that aim to keep families apart. The state aims to protect a migrant resident's right to live in a family. Based on the equal treatment of men and women and the rights of the child, the country ensures that a migrant and his family members enjoy the same set of rights. Independent status and equal access promotes equality within the family and offers opportunities to integrate into all areas of life in the country. I hope that any policy consideration on such matters in future legislation will ensure that bureaucratic considerations do not keep families apart. The Minister will be aware that the migration in the 1950s and 1960s was predominantly from male members and in the case of Bangladesh it took years before family reunion was established. That had a direct impact on those communities.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000173"></a>I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to matters relating to access to nationality. The UK's policy scored fifth, although to be fair most first-generation migrants are eligible for British citizenship after five years. MIPEX reports that migrants are compelled to pass conditions that score halfway to best practice, including the newly introduced test. The test is based on a government-provided study guide, though the significant failure rate has been blamed on the guide's historical inaccuracies and the test's obscure questions. The applicant's individual abilities are not taken into account. Those who have been naturalised can lose their citizenship for various reasons. We should note that the UK's score decreased in this second edition of MIPEX due to the additional vaguer ground for withdrawing nationality,</p>
<ul><a name="08032775000316"></a>&#147;if the Secretary of State is satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public good&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000286"></a>which is contained in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act of 2006. Has any individual had his or her nationality withdrawn under this Act?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000174"></a>I conclude by saying that MIPEX has shown a way that will help the process of integration leading to the cohesive community for which we all strive. Let us hope it will be the basis of future policies on immigration and integration in this country.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000176"></a>The migration integration policy index is the product of practical and pragmatic study. It offers dispassionate, collated evidence of the conditions encountered by people migrating inside and into Europe by focusing on the six policy areas listed by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, all of which are clearly among the prime factors that determine whether people have satisfactory conditions for employment opportunities and basic human security.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000177"></a>In our time, the levels of provision and practice in these areas patently have particular significance for two main reasons: first, and very obviously, a combination of economic realities, transport, technological advances and statutory freedoms of movement within Europe mean that migration in and into our continent has increased and if demographic deficits are to be countered and economic growth sustained, that migration needs to continue. Secondly, in those circumstances, insularity is unrealistic, indeed, unattainable, as well as economically negative, and the movement of large numbers of people is a reality and a necessity. Effective integration of those people in the societies to which they move is therefore a vital safeguard of employment and civil rights for incomers and, I emphasise, for the host population as well as being an essential ingredient of social stability and serenity. However, such integration is feasible only if there is manifest equity in the treatment of newcomers and if accurate information about that treatment is available to migrants, host populations and local, national and international policy-makers.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000178"></a>The index therefore exists to provide that information by assessing the policies of individual countries with objectivity, by making comparisons between the records of those countries and by benchmarking that performance mainly against standards set in EU directives agreed by member states, in Council of Europe conventions ratified by member states or in European presidency conclusions. In short, the body of information produced by MIPEX for use by policy-makers and the general public has substantially been compiled with reference to standards which democratic Governments have already agreed. There is therefore particular authority in the MIPEX analysis of what has been achieved, what has not been achieved and what needs to be improved in establishing and operating policies that will foster integration and through that, benefit migrants and host societies.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000179"></a>It is clear that the assessment of policies in the index is thorough and factual; that the comparisons are made with the constructive objective of clarifying best practice and identifying areas in which that standard is or is not met. They are not made for any invidious purpose or with any naming and shaming motive. It is also clear that the intended outcome of this work is to provide a common framework for informed public and political debate which can, it is to be hoped, lead  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to advances in policy design and policy application by Governments and by other major influences on the statutory, economic and civil environment in which migration is taking place. It is that which gives particular resonance to the Question of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and I hope that my noble friend Lord West will be able to give a positive response which recognises the utility of the migrant integration policy index for informed debate and for policy development based on that debate.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000180"></a>I am grateful for the opportunity given by this short debate to say why the British Council is strongly engaged in the MIPEX project. As the Committee knows, the British Council has been the UK&#146;s leading international organisation for cultural relations for more than 70 years, successfully sustaining its primary mission of promoting understanding and appreciation of the United Kingdom by anticipating and responding to changing realities and changing needs. That is happening now in this post-Cold War, globalised, increasingly interdependent, interactive, mobile century where as well as being a dynamic enriching asset, cultural diversity in social proximity can also be a source of tension between human beings.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000181"></a>In such conditions, the British Council has recognised that migration and the success or failure of the integration of migrants is manifestly central to cultural relations. It is therefore quite naturally involved in MIPEX with its purpose of clarifying what is happening at high and low standards of migration and integration policy performance, promoting reasoned discussion and encouraging alignment between declared national policies and applied national practices. If that consistency between policies and practices is attained, it is more likely that social cohesion will be strengthened without sacrifice of identity or of freedom by migrants and host societies. If that consistency is not achieved, the millions will still move, but that is likely to be accompanied by avoidable inequities, avoidable resulting resentments and avoidable social and economic division and disability for those who arrive and for the communities which receive them.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000182"></a>Obviously no research project can prevent such appalling negatives. It can, however, help to chart a course to productive positives. I hope my noble friend, with his distinguished professional expertise, will ensure that the Government navigate that positive course.</p>

For the first time in 10 years, at least in my opinion if not in the opinion of many others, I am breaking my rule because, having had my attention drawn to this index&#151;of which, I confess, I had never heard&#151;I realised its importance and potential value. I wanted, by the very act of imprudently standing up, to make the point that  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it is very important and valuable in enabling us to know ourselves and, in the light of that knowledge, to identify opportunities for action to make our community more integrated and at ease with itself.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000185"></a>I shall illustrate the importance, or potential importance, of indices to those who will read them. In December 2006, UNICEF published indices of the well-being of children in economically advanced countries. Out of 21 countries, we were bottom. It was a shock. It may be that the analysis was not perfect, but the message was very strong. There were two areas in which we came resoundingly bottom&#151;in matters relating to parenthood. I cannot argue that those indices published in December 2006 were the cause of the measures that the Government have taken since, which are so relevant. There is an old Latin tag which I forget that warns against such presumption. But to recapitulate, there was the creation in the summer of a Department for Children, Schools and Families, which brings together those matters that are so central to the well-being of children. There has also been the Children and Young Persons Bill, which has just been debated, to strengthen delivery of welfare services to children and to state the clear duty of the Secretary of State to promote the well-being of children in England. The Bill makes provision to strengthen our arrangements, including those for immigrant children. Then, on 1 November, the Prime Minister announced the Government&#146;s intention to consider extending the right of parents of six year-olds to ask for flexible working hours to children of older years&#151;the very years in which young people were most at risk of embracing some of the practices of their elders that are not to their own good. So there we have an example of a shock from an index followed by action. I cannot argue&#151;and happily it is not the case&#151;that the MIPEX index points to any such great basis for shame. However, it has the potential in what it says to draw attention through the indices to better practice overseas in stimulating policy initiatives.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000186"></a>The reason why I wanted to speak, underlined by speaking from no knowledge, is the danger we are in from having an increasingly fractured society&#151;based very much, to give one dimension, on increasing disparities in wealth and incomes and the creation of ghettoes and disadvantage, which leads to fissures in society. Then there is the challenge to the wholeness and integration of society of the increasing rates of immigration, to which we have to respond. That has led to tensions relating to income policy of communities&#151;for example, in the north of England some years ago. Fundamental to the integration of immigrants, particularly those from distant countries with very different cultures, is language and facility in the use of the English language. I understand that there are proposals that financial support for lessons to enable immigrants to increase their facility in English will be limited to those who are unemployed and on income support.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000187"></a>I question the wisdom of that because it is so important to integration that they all should come to have a greater facility in the use of the language. We must do much more proactively for the poor and unemployed, for whom languages will be available without charge, to cause them to come into learning. I  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC146"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>am thinking, for example, of mothers from distant countries who come to this country with no language. They live in poverty because, without the language, it is difficult to get a decent, full-time, regular job. There are many households of this kind without anyone in it having a full-time, regular job. Such people are diffident about going out and sitting down in a class to learn the language. They need to be coaxed, encouraged and offered the opportunity in an environment where they feel at home.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000188"></a>We have to look abroad to discover what lessons we can learn from there and, perhaps, look at the indices and what emerges from them to see what we can do. I endorse the tail end of the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, in which he invited the Government to use this material. I believe they should use it not only in debates but also in policy-making. I hope the Minister will feel able to encourage us on that matter.</p>
<h5><a name="08032775000331"></a>4.27 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08032775000189"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08032775000357"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> I congratulate my noble friend Lord Dholakia who, as always, has raised an important subject. The Committee will be grateful to him for drawing attention to it because many of us did not know about the existence of the index. I was particularly interested in the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, who is chair of the British Council, in which he explained why the British Council became involved.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000190"></a>One of the difficulties with the debate around immigration and societal cohesion is misinformation, and anything which can improve the position is to be welcomed. Sections of the media, extreme political parties and others use misinformation to create a feeling of fear and apprehension. The best counter to that is to have correct facts of the kind laid out here widely available. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, quite rightly mentioned the current topic of fractures and tensions in society. This is explored in an interesting way in the BBC&#146;s &#147;White Season&#148;. The programme examines these issues and is a particularly worthy attempt to examine some of the more complex feelings surrounding how we choose to live together.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000191"></a>The Government&#146;s recent announcement of its citizenship proposals were met, at best, by a lukewarm response. The real work on making cohesion happen has to be undertaken at community level. Given the enormous variations between cities and small towns, rural areas and the north, south, east and west of the UK, the most that should be organised centrally is a framework and an aspiration. The index that we are debating today considers the framework and tests how adequate it is against a benchmark. That is why it is an especially useful piece of work.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000192"></a>My noble friend mentioned the scale of what we are talking about: 16 million people from non-EU countries form the migrant diaspora across Europe. The index does not address illegal economic migrants, asylum seekers or those moving within the EU. All too often, people coming from abroad are defined in the resident population as falling within the same category, and it is very useful to concentrate the mind on exactly what we are talking about.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC147"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000193"></a>Of the six categories covered by the index, access to citizenship causes the most contention in policy terms. Liberal Democrats have a significantly different policy on it from that of Labour or the Conservatives. We would open a path to earned citizenship for those who are already here but are currently in limbo. They are unable to contribute to the tax base. If they work, they are doing so illegally, with poor access to all kinds of services. They are a much more pressing issue than those who may yet arrive in the UK. The Government&#146;s response has been to impose a much heavier penalty on employers, which has had astonishingly awful results for members of the Chinese community, for example.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000194"></a>We Liberal Democrats believe that there should be a route to earned citizenship. The index is a helpful tool in debating this matter, because it enables us to see clearly what is happening in the rest of Europe. As legislators, we are constantly asked to debate and approve changes in immigration policy. To make good, informed decisions, the index provides exactly the kind of information that we need.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000195"></a>We need to know the norm across Europe; we need to ensure that legislative changes are producing a more integrated society. Apart from helping us get better in areas in which we do poorly, the index would help us track situations where we are getting worse, which is important, because policy does not always produce an upward trajectory. However, it is not all bad news. Seeing where best practice is producing especially good results should be encouraging, because I appreciate that this area of policy is an uphill struggle for whichever Government are in power; it is not simple. The index is updated bi-annually, so it will not become out of date. It will give us a clear benchmark as to how we compare with our European neighbours.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000196"></a>Preparing for this debate gave me the opportunity to study the index. I liked especially the interactive maps. As I tried them out, I was surprised to find that the UK scored as well as it did, because the constant background hum of negativity around immigration made me think that we would come out worse. A desire to change the background noise is not to be equated with having a totally open-door policy to mass immigration, but it is often taken as such. It increasingly takes brave politicians to point out the immense benefits that immigration has brought and continues to bring.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000197"></a>It is our responsibility to ensure that the legislative frameworks are informed by fact and not the background hum which the media, particularly the red-top newspapers, encourage. I have mentioned the good practice adopted by the BBC in encouraging a more informed debate. I accept that legislative frameworks are only the beginning of the process. Public perception, economic push-and-pull factors, access to public services and availability of housing all play a role that is at least as, if not more, important.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000198"></a>Before we become complacent, it is worth noting that we score very poorly on political participation&#151;I was disappointed, although not entirely surprised, by that. Political participation is critical, because ensuring that communities have their rightful voice in the democratic process is an essential step in making sure  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC148"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they are part of it, want to be part of it and see democracy alone as the route to change. If I took away one lesson from the index, it was that.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000199"></a>I thank my noble friend for introducing this debate and for drawing my attention to the index. I look forward to developments involving it over the years.</p>
<h5><a name="08032775000332"></a>4.35 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08032775000200"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08032775000358"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, for introducing this short debate. Having listened to other Members, I say with less temerity than I might otherwise have that I did not actually know about the index before the debate was generated. I am grateful for having a whole new world and lots of maps opened up before me. I accept that this is, and will remain, a very important instrument for those of us who have to deal with immigration policy.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000201"></a>The Government's record on immigration in general hardly bares scrutiny. Belatedly, they are trying to catch up with the new points system, but a previous absence of any sense of urgency about bringing in immigration controls and the fact that the citizens of 25 EU countries have unfettered access to our country, means that stable doors are not only being slammed after the horse has bolted, but are still more than half ajar.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000202"></a>The migrant integration policy index is not totally complimentary about the inadequate preparation by the Government for the arrival of migrant workers from the new EU countries in 2004. The arrival of such large numbers has led to problems for local government and the police, although many of those who have come have brought skills and expertise with them, for which this country has great need. However, as with migrants from all parts of the world, they have to be helped to integrate where they want to live, to be housed, employed, educated and, in many cases, supported both financially and practically, particularly when they cannot work, find a suitable job, or speak English sufficiently well to integrate fully.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000203"></a>The migrant index concentrates on policies for integration. Other noble Lords have already listed the main areas: access to the labour market, family reunion, long-term residence, political party participation&#151;I was very interested in the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller&#151;access to nationality and anti-discrimination.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000204"></a>Some countries&#151;not just this country but all 25 EU states, such as the newer EU states&#151;are given very poor ratings for their efforts at integration. As has been said, this country has a long and proud record of welcoming migrants over the years. So it is disappointing that in some of the measures it does not fare at all well. Does the Minister accept that at least part of the problem is that there are just so many people coming in so fast that many parts of the country are simply being overwhelmed?</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000205"></a>One of the greatest problems of uncontrolled immigration is ensuring that those who are coming here to live permanently are absorbed into the local communities in which they live. Community cohesion has become a byword for describing the need to enable mixed communities to not only live amicably  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC149"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>together, but to pass between them the many benefits of their cultural and national peculiarities. This requires a maturity from the indigenous population and those joining it. It is not helped by those who promulgate division and separatism, undermining our society, and, sadly, often drawing young people into disenchantment or, at worst, extremism.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000206"></a>Community cohesion is not the same as multiculturalism, which has developed connotations of being the retention of separate identities and communities, rather than a coming together. No one expects that people from other nationalities and cultures will not want to congregate together to share common memories, customs and experiences, but that becomes destructive when it is not combined with the acceptance that to live in the adopted nation means to become part of it. On the other side of the coin, it becomes discrimination when distrust builds antipathy to those who are trying to live their new lives in their new communities.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000207"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, so rightly pointed out, the power of language is central to promoting cohesion, as well as an ability to live fully in society. So one of the first requirements of migrants must be that they commit to learning to speak the language of the country to which they migrate&#151;in our case, English&#151;either before they come or shortly after arrival, if they do not do so adequately when they come. Without access to language, education, jobs, leisure and communication on a social basis become impossible, and integration is not a reality.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000208"></a>While the Government say it is up to local councils to manage migration into their areas&#151;and I support that because it is to some extent a local problem&#151;success depends on the support and help they are given by the policies and framework of central government, which have, in many cases, been woefully lacking. There has been a tendency&#151;the Government have acknowledged being at fault&#151;to assume that one size fits all. Any of us who live in areas with a multiplicity of cultures, as I do, know that that cannot work. Each local council must be able to adopt practices and policies that support variety and recognise the diverse customs and expectations of its residents old and new.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000209"></a>I am enormously grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, is here; if he had not been, I would have had to ask what the role of the British Council in this was. However, I dare not do that now as we have been given a great explanation and, with the chairman of the British Council here, I would not dare go any further. I might have asked the Minister about the nature of the British Council&#146;s support and whether it helped with the compilation, and influenced, financed or researched, I do not now dare. I would not want to put those words anywhere near the Minister.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000210"></a>Migration within and to the European Union is a fact of life. There is a great need for comparability and access to information about how migrants are absorbed. Inevitably some of the migration will be short-term because an improvement in the circumstances in their own state, family ties or disenchantment with their new lives will mean that some migrants will return  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>home, but others will move permanently or semi-permanently, become part of the communities they join and seek citizenship. We welcome that, and a lot of the policies have developed towards it. Perhaps it is not only the Government who will need to use the migrant integration policy index, but all those who have a responsibility in the area of helping migrants to become part of their local communities. They can compare what is happening elsewhere and see if there is good or different practice that they can develop. It is clearly valuable to have real-time research and a means of monitoring what is going on across the whole of Europe. I can see that my internet bill will go up enormously as I download all sorts of fascinating information from this index. I do not even have to do that&#151;there is a book! I will consult the one on the opposite Bench.</p>

I also pay tribute to his strong commitment to bringing about real improvements in cohesion and racial equality through his work with the Commission for Racial Equality and the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain. His tireless energy in seeking to tackle racism and disadvantage is something that all of us in this House welcome, support and commend.  I also thank other noble Lords who contributed to a useful and lively debate, and I will try to deal with the points they raised. I thank my noble friend Lord Kinnock for his work with the British Council and its involvement, with other bodies, with the Migrant Integration Policy Index. At lunchtime, I spoke to Thomas Huddleston, because like some other noble Lords&#151;I am glad they admitted it first&#151;I knew nothing about this matter before this debate. It is a terrible thing to have to admit, but I am glad to say that the civil servants in the Home Office knew a lot about it, which was very reassuring.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000214"></a>Having looked at it now&#151;I have not read the whole thing, but I have looked at the introduction and been through some of the graphs&#151;I commend the authors for their efforts in producing a very helpful and independent assessment of strengths and weaknesses of integration policies across the EU. The six topics that they chose for assessment, pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia&#151;labour market, access and so on&#151;are all areas that we should seek to develop and to improve if we are to continue to be seen by others as a country that champions fair play and as a key player on the global economic stage. That is all part and parcel of this because there is no doubt that migrants bring a huge amount to the country. While I believe that the United Kingdom has done well&#151;ninth out of 25; the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, was a  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>little disparaging about that, but I thought it was quite good and perfectly acceptable&#151;that is not a ground for complacency because there are still things to do.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000215"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, referred en passant to asylum policies&#151;a report came out today. As a Government, we are totally committed to upholding our traditions of offering protection to those who need it. We fulfil our international obligations under the UN refugee convention and human rights commitments. The system is balanced. As I said on the Floor of the House the other day, each one of these cases is an individual tragedy which is part of the problem and that is why they are so difficult to deal with. One needs a policy. I believe that we are fair and rigorous in the assessment of claims.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000216"></a>I have been to Croydon and talked to the people involved. We have some very dedicated and hard-working case workers who have huge loads but they take their jobs very seriously. Each case is very difficult to deal with. The case workers are also humane. One may be able to point out examples where that does not appear to be so, but overall we are humane. The accommodation that we provide may not be the best in the world, but I have visited Tinsley House at Gatwick where the family accommodation was rather better than the first married quarters I was offered as a young lieutenant, but that is not an excuse for having to put people there. No one wants to put families into detention, but it is normally the last resort before they leave the country. We try to make the accommodation nice but we have to be firm as well as humane, which is where the difficulty comes in.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000217"></a>A large number of people do not want to leave, which clearly is a personal tragedy. I do not believe that the picture is as black as people paint in the media and in some of the reports. Many people work very hard to maintain a sensible policy. There is no doubt that, in terms of the numbers of asylum seekers, the matter has got a little out of hand over time, but now it is within a sensible framework.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000218"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, also mentioned the links with MIPEX and co-operation in the EU in areas of national law and the development of integration policies. I am glad that my noble friend recognises that the UK is one of the countries to which others turn for examples of best practice. That keeps us on our mettle and it means that we have to do better. We are a key player in a number of expert groups: the EU National Contact Points on Integration network and the Forum on Intercultural Dialogue that was instigated by Germany when it had presidency of the EU. There is a constant exchange of good practice and ideas among those groups, which is invaluable and extremely useful. Part of this document has caused that. We look to countries mentioned by the noble Lord and others to see whether we could use some of their ideas.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000219"></a>On family life, which the noble Lord mentioned, immigration rules make clear provision for people to come to the UK on the basis of family reunion. The importance of that is reaffirmed in the Green Paper, <I>The Path to Citizenship</I>, referred to by a number of speakers, where there is a key route to naturalisation for family members of British citizens and permanent residents. It is important to ensure that the necessary  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC152"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>application process is smooth and efficient to make it easier for them, as the noble Lord mentioned. We always take into account human rights issues, including the right to family life, and the MIPEX comments as we take forward our work on all those proposals.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000220"></a>On a point of detail, the noble Lord mentioned that the significant failure rate in the citizenship test was attributable to historical accuracies and obscure questions. The test questions are not in the public domain and, although there is a chapter on history, no questions are based on it. The chapter was revised extensively for the new edition of the handbook in April 2007. There are still no questions on history and, despite the test now covering a wider range of topics, the current success rate is some 74 per cent. That probably suggests that we have a meaningful test with the right balance of accessibility and difficulty. It is interesting that the new citizenship test introduced in Australia last year effectively copied ours, so I think that we probably have it about right.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000221"></a>We felt that it was right to have some provision to enable deprivation of nationality, albeit in exceptional circumstances. In fact, only one naturalised person has been deprived of citizenship under these provisions, which include a right of appeal through the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000222"></a>I have already referred to my noble friend Lord Kinnock. I support wholeheartedly his ringing endorsement of the report: it is a superb publication. As a number of speakers have said, in a way it is a shame that we do not have that sort of guidance in other areas, because it is a very useful piece of work on which to draw.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000223"></a>I also agree with my noble friend Lord Kinnock that we need migrants&#146; skills. Our country is successful partly due to the quality of migrants and what they have added to our vibrancy and economic capability. The new points-based system that we are introducing&#151;it went live on 29 February&#151;is designed to help to attract more individuals with the talents and skills that we need. The use of the English language was mentioned, and we will expect the vast majority of workers to speak English. That will enhance their ability to integrate, and points will be awarded on advice from the new Migration Advisory Committee, which we have created to attract to the UK people with the right skills. We need such people and they need to be fully integrated into our society, as has been touched on.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000224"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, referred to children and gave the example of indices to show how something can stimulate us into action. I think that the Government now have a good tale to tell in terms of what we are trying to do in relation to children, although there is no doubt that the UNICEF report was rather shocking. One can argue about the data and so on, but we are now doing a raft of things to improve the situation. The noble Lord touched on those and I thank him for that.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000225"></a>We agree with the noble Lord about the importance of language. When we have asked the British public for their view, they have made it plain that they feel very strongly that people should learn English if they come to this country. Last year, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills introduced a new  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC153"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>series of language programmes, and the ESOL for Work suite of qualifications focuses on those skills. Therefore, again, I think that we have a very good tale to tell in that regard.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000226"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, touched on the Green Paper concerning the new deal for citizenship, where the rights and benefits of British citizenship are matched by responsibilities. I mentioned how we had talked to a large number of people around the country&#151;ordinary citizens and interest groups&#151;about this, and there is no doubt that there is a feeling that people who come here should speak English. People want them to work hard and pay tax. They should obey the law and get involved in, and contribute to, community life. The vast majority of those who come here want to do that, and indeed do so. I was also very glad that the noble Baroness touched on the fact that there is too much negativity in relation to some aspects of immigration. On some things, we do rather well.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000227"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, also mentioned political participation, which is an important area. Although there has been some generic research into that, it has been fairly limited and I think that more can be done. It is crucial and I share her view.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000228"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, always tries to luff me up or cross my stern. I cannot agree with her that the Government&#146;s policy on immigration is a shambles I do not think that she quite used those words but that was the feeling that I got. In fact, I believe that we have a remarkable grip on the issue. Speaking as a new boy, I think that perhaps over many years the matter has not been tackled as well as it should have been by lots of people and lots of parties. Now we are beginning firmly to get to grips with it. We need to because the British public expect it. We are doing rather well and the fact that we are ninth out of 25 is quite a good sign. As to uncontrolled numbers, the new Migration Advisory Committee achieves a great many things for us in this respect.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000229"></a>I round off by emphasising the sweeping reforms that we have taken forward. First, we have robust border controls now, managed by a unified border force, and the introduction of compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals, which is a good thing. Secondly, we have the new points-based system which went live on 29<sup></sup>February; there are some very good things there. Thirdly, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Schools introduced last year a new series of language programmes, which are very satisfactory. Fourthly, on 20 February we published our Green Paper, <I>The Path to Citizenship</I>. The noble Baroness said it was not well received. I am not so sure; I think it was quite well received. This shows that we are thinking and going in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000230"></a>Finally, the United Kingdom has a long history of welcoming to its shores migrants and those seeking better opportunities, as well as those fleeing persecution. I can assure noble Lords that the Government value the insight that the migrant integration policy index&#151;a very useful document&#151;has given to our integration policies. We shall, of course, take account of its findings as we determine the future direction of our policies on integration, and we will continue to encourage newcomers

<h5><a name="08032775000334"></a>5 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08032775000232"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08032775000362"></a>Lord Butler of Brockwell</b> asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government what steps they are taking to improve the preparation of legislative proposals to Parliament.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000233"></a>The noble Lord said: With the publication earlier this week of the Government's draft Constitution Renewal Bill, this is a well timed debate. I am very grateful to the Leader of the House and others of your Lordships here present, one magnificently accoutred, for being here to debate it. I begin by acknowledging what the Government have already done in the area covered by this Question. It was immensely encouraging that the first act of the new Prime Minister's administration last July was to publish the <I>Governance of </I><I>Britain</I> White Paper, which included proposals to redress the balance between the Executive and Parliament. That theme was carried forward in the Statement from the Lord Chancellor this week, when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000298"></a>&#147;The accountability of Government is fundamental to the health of our democracy&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 25/3/08; col. 21.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000234"></a>Again, it is Parliament, the seat of our democracy, that is central to the programme of constitutional renewal.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000235"></a>What gives the greatest hope is the Government's apparent recognition that enabling Parliament to play its proper role is good for governance, good for the people of this country and therefore ultimately good for the Government themselves. It may seem curmudgeonly to use the word &#147;apparent&#148;, from which your Lordships will deduce my view that there is more that the Government could do to the end than they have stated. It would be naive to deny that there is a paradox in the relationship between the Government and Parliament. Because part of the role of Parliament is to scrutinise the Executive, there is bound to be an adversarial relationship, which is enhanced by the fact that Parliament is the platform for the opposition parties. In consequence, over nearly 200 years, the Executive have progressively sought to corral and dominate Parliament, with a good deal of success. Even so, I grew up professionally in a Civil Service tradition that honoured Parliament; not only honoured it but found it exciting. It was the cockpit in which our Ministers stood or fell. We shuddered at the thought of causing the Minister inadvertently to give inaccurate information to Parliament. We would not have dreamt of doing so advertently.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000236"></a>The imbalancing of the relationship between the Executive and Parliament is reflected in how successive Governments have brought legislation before Parliament. Because the Executive can take it for granted that they can get their legislation through, they produce too much legislation and do not prepare or even argue for it properly. One gets the impression that some White Papers are produced with an eye more on soundbites  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC155"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the media than critical analysis, although I am told by people more expert than me that the recent White Paper on nuclear energy was a distinguished exception to that. We can all produce examples of the Executive taking Parliament for granted.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000237"></a>An example which particularly struck me was when I had occasion to look up the parliamentary proceedings on a section of the Finance Act 2005, which contained 106 clauses, 11 schedules, amounting to 202 pages of law in all, covering income and corporation tax, trusts, film relief, stamp duty and various anti-avoidance measures. But I could not find any discussion of the section in which I was interested, because in the lead-up to the general election 2005, the House of Commons passed all stages of the Bill in one day, four hours and two minutes, and your Lordships passed it in 24 minutes on the following day.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000238"></a>A system which can pass complex and important legislation as cursorily as that, even as part of a desk-clearing exercise before an election, cannot be right. Nobody could say that such cursoriness was necessary, since, following the election, the Government introduced a further Finance Bill three months later, which covered much the same ground with a further 72 clauses and 11 schedules and added a further 159 pages to the statute book.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000239"></a>No one would defend a proposition that legislation be introduced when it is not necessary or that policy proposals be ill-prepared. Why should anybody defend it? I am asking today that the Government commit to processes designed to avoid those outcomes by adopting standards against which they can be held to account and tested by Parliament.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0006.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000240"></a>We all know that there have been approaching 70 Home Office Bills in the past 10 years. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, has said, if the people could be given a voice, the cry which would be most likely to go up would be:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000299"></a>&#147;For God&#146;s sake, leave us alone&#148;.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000241"></a>I have been working with an all-party group, the Better Government Initiative, preparing proposals in this area for Parliament and government to consider. The proposals are wide-ranging and interlinked, and can be found at the Better Government Initiative website, which is www.bettergovernmentinitiative.co.uk. The proposal to which I want to draw particular attention is the suggestion that the Government commit to accompanying their policy and legislative proposals with a public document that certifies that they have gone through the steps of: exploring why action is desirable and, in the case of legislation, operationally necessary; analysing the costs and benefits and defining the objectives in terms suitable for post-legislative scouting; setting out the reasons for the preferred action and showing its practicability; and carrying out consultation with those principally affected. I think that we would all agree that all those steps are good practice. In Germany, I understand, legislation requires the Government to satisfy these tests, but I do not propose that they should be added to the constitutional renewal Bill; for one thing, it would be yet more legislation.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000242"></a>A parliamentary resolution would be sufficient to have an effect. It would be similar to that which the Government are proposing in order to commit the  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Executive to consult Parliament about decisions on going to war. Such a resolution would commit the Government to these unimpeachable principles for proposing legislation, and impose a parliamentary requirement that the Government declare that they had observed them. If that served to increase the quality of legislation, even at the cost of reducing some of the quantity, it would be no bad thing.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000243"></a>Above all, such a move, like other proposals in the <I>Governance of Britain </I>White Paper, would be in the interests of good governance and the public, which is the point of government itself. I urge the Government to consider this move as part of their proposals for improving government, and I urge colleagues in both Houses of Parliament to press them to do so.</p>
<h5><a name="08032775000335"></a>5.10 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08032775000244"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08032775000363"></a>Lord Howe of Aberavon:</b> It is a pleasure and a privilege to follow the noble Lord in this debate. I underwrite and agree with everything he has said and I share his respect for the relationship between government and the Civil Service. I have had the privilege of working alongside him for longer than I care to remember&#151;certainly from my first Budget of nearly 20 years ago. As I say, I underwrite his search for improved preparation in legislative proposals, starting with his emphasis on the need to improve the quality of law in that sense. I also underline his subsidiary point of the need to consider not only the quality of the law that is introduced but also the quantity. The sheer volume under all Governments has been, and continues to be, excessive.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000245"></a>A long time ago a young man, here depicted, produced a pamphlet entitled <I>Too Much Law?</I> That was in 1977, when I committed the incoming Conservative Government to make fewer laws and to make laws fewer. We did not do too well at it but my commitment remains unchanged.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000246"></a>However, it is not only the quality or quantity of law that I am concerned about. I underline the interest of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, in this matter; in regard to the quality and quantity of the underlying policy. The quality of law, the draftmanship and so on are important and need to be improved, but it is the extent to which the underlying policy proposals have been thought through, examined and scrutinised by Parliament ahead of their introduction that is the main concern.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000247"></a>That is why I was slightly less than polite when we had the Statement this week on the Government&#146;s proposed constitutional consolidation or reform. The sheer volume of that alarmed me, as did the prospect of a torrent of what could so easily be half-baked upheaval. In an example I gave at the time, I said that the abolition of the Lord Chancellor&#146;s office involved 150 subsidiary provisions in the legislation. I apologise for having misled the House: it was not 150 but 250. That is a measure of the scale of change foreshadowed in that Bill.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000248"></a>It is important not to have too much faith in too much law. Indeed, I hesitate to enthuse over the formula proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, because I am wary of the belief that by merely passing a code of that kind we might persuade ourselves that we have solved the problem. I have often repeated my proposition  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC157"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that law is greatly exaggerated in the importance of its impact. I said earlier this week that, as Lord Milton said, there are three great domains of human conduct. The first is where our actions are limited or forbidden by law. Then there is the domain of free personal choice. But between these two there is a third domain, that in which there is neither law nor unfettered freedom, where people do what is right because they know they have to do it for themselves.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000249"></a>Edmund Burke said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000300"></a>&#147;Manners are of more importance than laws. Upon them, in a great measure the laws depend&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000287"></a>Judge Learned Hand, a notable American judge, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000301"></a>&#147;I often wonder whether we do not rest our hopes too much upon constitutions, upon laws and upon courts&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000250"></a>It is easy to believe that by having established a code one has achieved what one wants to achieve, but it is the way in which one responds to the spirit of that and the way in which one conditions one&#146;s approach to policy change that is so important. We need, therefore, not much less law but, in my judgment, much less change. The temptation to say, &#147;We are a reforming Government&#148;&#151;there is a temptation for the candidates in the American election now to say, &#147;We stand for change&#148;&#151;implies that one should be living in a period of constant institutional upheaval. We have seen a great deal of that under the present Government&#151;not uniquely&#151;in the whole of the licensing legislation, the whole of the gaming legislation and the whole of electoral law; and, as the noble Lord, Lord Butler, pointed out, the whole of criminal justice has been changed so much and so decisively that a great deal of wisdom has been cast to one side. One very striking example of that arrived helpfully in my mail this morning. It is the document produced by the demised Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. Its document started by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000302"></a>&#147;The Commission may be unique as a public body in that only months after it became operational it was informed that following a review of &#145;arms-length&#146; bodies&#151;it would be quickly abolished. This change in Government strategy ... was followed by five Government postponements of the actual closure date ... Over the five year period there was little clarity of direction and Government leadership&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000288"></a>and so on. That is one example of upheaval before one round of constitutional change had even set.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000251"></a>My concern, therefore&#151;I come to what the noble Lord, Lord Butler, said&#151;is that we need not just fuller consideration of policy and pre-legislative consideration, but fuller, deeper and more patient consideration in advance of policy by Parliament, ahead of the production of a White Paper or a Green Paper. There is a huge mount of talent in both Houses of Parliament. Governments should have greater confidence in the ability to consult with that talent and to slow down the pace of change and upheaval. As the noble Lord said, when I go into any boardroom, committee room or staff room as a politician and ask, &#147;What would you like us to do?&#148;, the response is invariably, &#147;For God&#146;s sake, leave us alone&#148;. I do not mean do nothing, but be thoughtful and careful, and be ready to consult with Parliament at a measured pace before one proceeds, with or without legislation.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000252"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08032775000364"></a>Lord Richard:</b> This is, indeed, a timely debate for all the reasons the noble Lord, Lord Butler, gave. I congratulate him on his choice of subject and for raising it this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000253"></a>It is always a little daunting to follow the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, with his great experience in all sorts of fields; it is even more daunting when he honours us by appearing in front of us so splendidly arrayed.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000254"></a>Recently, there has been increasing concern about how legislative proposals are put to Parliament and, flowing from that is the relationship between Parliament and the Executive. I share those concerns. There are two stages: first, how is policy formulated; and, secondly, how is it enacted when it gets to the parliamentary stage? I am concerned that so much legislation comes from the House of Commons in a form that has not been sufficiently scrutinised and, indeed, in some cases has not been scrutinised at all. The illustration given by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, of the Finance Act is certainly not unique. The result is that the quality of legislation overall produced by Parliament depends increasingly on the efforts made by the second Chamber to remedy the faults of the first. That is no way to legislate properly. It throws on the Government a greater obligation to produce legislation in the first instance which is comprehensive, precise and thorough. Unfortunately, as we all know, that is not always the case.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000255"></a>However, if there is a perceived need for reform, how do we best go about it? Merely to complain that the House of Commons does not do its job properly is no real answer. The issue raises fundamental questions about the relationship between Parliament and the Executive.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000256"></a>For some years now, the power of the Executive has increased and the consequent power of Parliament has declined. Furthermore, within the Executive, the power of the Prime Minister and the diminution of power by the Cabinet has produced a constitutional distortion. It surely should be basic that in any major decision the Cabinet should be consulted on the basis of proper Cabinet papers and proper discussion in Cabinet itself. While I realise that that may be time-consuming, even frustrating, for Prime Ministers, cabinet government is after all supposed to be the fundamental principle of our parliamentary constitution. Fortunately, I understand that the present Prime Minister is infinitely more assiduous in implementing this principle than perhaps was his predecessor.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000257"></a>Even if cabinet government were to be properly restored, as I think it is now on the way to being, there remains the issue of what the relationship between Parliament and the Executive should be. I share the views of the noble Lord, Lord Butler, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, on the desirability of a parliamentary resolution. That would seem to be an admirable way of establishing the scope and nature of the relationship between the Executive and Parliament.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000258"></a>Reading the text of a possible resolution, there is very little in it with which Ministers could disagree. On the other hand, it is easy to pay lip service to the  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC159"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>terms of the resolution and much more difficult to implement it in practice. I shall illustrate. A possible resolution that has been floated is that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000303"></a>&#147;Ministers have a duty to Parliament to ensure that their policy and legislative proposals to Parliament have been thoroughly prepared&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000289"></a>That is unarguable. Everybody could accept it because it is, of course, true, but it would be very difficult to implement. It would require a heightened degree of political commitment to ensure that Parliament was placed in a realistic position to consider that legislation properly. The terms of a possible resolution would also have to include the main elements of the thorough preparation that would be necessary for legislative proposals to be properly considered. They are again basic and difficult to disagree with but, if implemented, they would undoubtedly have a profound effect on the quality of legislation produced by Parliament.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000259"></a>I shall illustrate that by taking two of the possibilities: First,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000304"></a>&#147;Defining the problem and explaining why action is desirable or, in the case of legislation, why it is operationally necessary&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000290"></a>That is again unarguable and everyone would accept it, but if it were implemented it would help Parliament enormously, and at present it does not happen. Secondly,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000305"></a>&#147;Setting out principles and arguments which lead Ministers to the proposed option.".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000291"></a>I have made the point twice already and will not repeat it. Indeed, one is sometimes driven back to the somewhat mournful conclusion that what is required more than anything else is a decision by the Executive that relations between them and Parliament have to improve. Once that is accepted, a great deal becomes obvious and possible that is at present opaque.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000260"></a>I am pleased that my noble friend the Leader of the House will respond to this debate, but I urge her and the Government to be open and generous in their response. A great deal depends on it, but the issue must not be left here. A one-hour debate in the Moses Room late on a Thursday afternoon is no substitute for proper consideration by the House as a whole. Indeed, if ever there was a matter that should be considered by the House as a whole, this is it. While I understand, of course, that my noble friend will not be able to commit herself to the expenditure of parliamentary time&#151;no Leader of the House ever can, although he or she is often asked&#151;nevertheless an indication that the Government would like the issue to be further discussed would be very helpful.</p>
<h5><a name="08032775000337"></a>5.23 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08032775000262"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08032775000365"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> I, too, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, on raising this important Question. In terms of the preparation of legislative proposals, the time may be coming when we need to review fundamentally the way in which we draw up legislation in this country. Despite improvements in recent years, the basic nature of the process lends itself to confusion, certainly to the public and even to Members of both Houses. However, in the limited time available, I wish to focus on the process as it exists. Out of the several points I would have liked to make, let me focus on two. They stem from the premise  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that there needs to be greater rigour in the legislative process, and they follow the distinction made by the noble Lord, Lord Richard.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000263"></a>My first point first relates to pre-legislative scrutiny. The Constitution Committee in its 2004 report on the legislative process&#151;I chaired the committee&#151;stressed the value of pre-legislative scrutiny. The Government accepted the value of such scrutiny and have continued to do so. However, there has been something of a regression. In 2003, the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, Phil Woolas, said that it was the Government's intention to increase the amount of legislation that was subject to pre-legislative scrutiny and in a Westminster Hall debate the following year he stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="08032775000317"></a>&#147;a Bill should be published in draft form unless there are good reasons for not doing so&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 24/2/04; col. 19WH.]</ul>
<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000264"></a>However, that particular Session&#151;2003-04&#151;proved to be the high point as 12 Bills were published in draft. As the more recent report of the Constitution Committee on pre-legislative scrutiny in the 2006-07 Session has shown, the number has declined since then. In the 2003-04 Session, the ratio of draft Bills to Government Bills was 1:3. In 2005-06 it was 1:15, and in 2006-07 it was 1:9.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000265"></a>Why are more Bills not published in draft? In response to the committee&#146;s latest report, the Leader of the House in a letter of 20 March, somewhat echoing the Government&#146;s response to the Liaison Committee in the other place, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000306"></a>&#147;The main practical obstacle remains the need to have the freedom to bring forward much legislation on a timetable which does not allow the publication of the proposed legislation in draft form&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000292"></a>Can the noble Baroness explain exactly what that means? I can understand the Government not wishing to tie their hands by committing themselves to publishing every Bill in draft. The Constitution Committee recognised that that was not always possible. However, it does not really explain why more Bills are not published in draft. If Bills are introduced on a staggered basis and subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny, then they are eligible for carry-over. The so-called &#147;practical obstacle&#148; to more Bills being published in draft is not really an obstacle at all. Following the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, I suspect that the obstacle is the culture in some departments or the attitude of certain Ministers. It may be that the Leaders of both Houses are keen on pre-legislative scrutiny but that they face resistance from particular departments&#151;hence the noble Baroness&#146;s expression of disappointment in her letter at the number of Bills published in draft.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000266"></a>Is it not time that the Government embraced the recommendation of the Constitution Committee and, in effect, the words of Phil Woolas to ensure that every Bill is published in draft unless there is a compelling reason not to do so? If a Bill is not published in draft, can we ensure that in the Explanatory Notes there is a statement by the sponsoring Minister explaining why that has not been done? That, at least, will constitute a useful starting point.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000267"></a>My second point&#151;some comments have already been made about this&#151;concerns being clear about the objectives of a Bill and how its effectiveness can be

We now have impact assessments, and the template process requires policy-makers to be mindful of post-implementation review and to identify policy objectives and the intended effects of the policy. This is clearly relevant to post-legislative scrutiny, and I very much welcome much of what is contained in the Government&#146;s response to the Law Commission report on post-legislation. I say &#147;much&#148; because there is one omission that I will deal with when we debate the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000268"></a>However, on the preparation of legislation, the commitment to identify policy objectives and the criteria for review following enactment is to be welcomed. The crucial point, as I think the Minister will concur&#151;I believe this is the point that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, was making&#151;is to ensure that the Government&#146;s good intentions are translated into practice. Here, I revert to the recent report of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee on <I>The Management of Secondary Legislation: </I><I>F</I><I>ollow-up</I>. The key comment to which I wish to draw the Minister&#146;s attention is in paragraph 35. Referring to failings in respect of establishing clear and realistic criteria in two particular cases, it stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000307"></a>&#147;This is poor management and demonstrates a tendency by Departments to use IAs as a tool &#145;to justify policy rather than a policy-making tool&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08032775000293"></a>It is vital that this does not become a formulaic or ticking-the-box exercise. The good intention is there but it is essential to ensure that departmental cultures change if the setting of objectives and measurable outcomes are to be achieved.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000269"></a>The Government&#146;s response&#151;in effect, its stated good intentions&#151;is a necessary but not sufficient condition for improving the preparation of legislation to Parliament. Again, I think that is the point that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, was making. There has to be the political will to deliver. That is the real challenge. I look forward to hearing how the Government intend to ensure that departments do deliver.</p>

As I reflect back on what has changed over the years, it seems to me that Parliament has, if anything, improved its act over legislation. Pre-legislative scrutiny is a vital and important breakthrough. In the Commons now, although not alas in your Lordships&#146; House, Public Bill Committees&#151;what used to be the useless Standing Committees&#151;take evidence before they go through a Bill, which is a tremendous step forward. In your Lordships&#146; House, we spend much more time on Bills and are far less willing to accept a ministerial &#147;no&#148; than used to be the case, with the result that Commons Ministers are finally waking up to the fact that they must take account of the views of this House if they are to get their legislation through. Therefore, it seems to me that Parliament is doing better than it did.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000271"></a>The problem arises with the raw material with which Parliament is asked to work in the form of legislative proposals that come before us. I am not a  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>great one for golden- ageism. The first piece of legislation that I came across in detail was the Housing Finance Bill, which was before Parliament when I started work for Tony Crosland. The Bill was the brainchild of the great Walter Ulrich, one of the finest civil servants of history. As your Lordships will of course recall, the Housing Finance Act was designed to achieve a faster rise in council rents than would otherwise have occurred, but, because of the inflation that then took place, it had the immediate effect of achieving a slower rise in council rents. Therefore, legislative proposals, even in those days, were not perfect. However, there are regards in which I think there has been a decline, and I want briefly to single out just one&#151;White Papers.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000272"></a>It would be wrong to claim that White Papers never contain unclarities&#151;even in the 1970s, when I first came into Whitehall and government. However, you knew then that, if there was an unclarity in a White Paper, it was there for a reason. There may have been something that had to be disguised or papered over but which might later be resolved. However, when you read White Papers now, I am afraid you feel that a lot of the unclarities are there not for a reason but because someone could not be bothered or did not have the ability to write the right words to encapsulate what they were trying to say. Too often today, I pick up a new White Paper in a spirit of hope only to find that I have in my hands, once again, an exercise in vacuity, a triumph over reasoned argument of contentless guff. Parliament and the people deserve better.</p>

<p><a name="08032775000273"></a><b><a name="80327-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08032775000367"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> I, too, am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, for initiating this debate. Because it is a very short debate, I begin by accepting both his diagnosis and his principal recommendation to deal with what is wrong in our legislative process. In my opinion, his recommendation that Parliament should pass a resolution put before it by the Government has the merit of being a simple proposal that could be grasped without legislation and advanced quickly. Having said that, I do not think that it goes far enough. I would wish it to happen but I do not think that it goes nearly far enough to address a number of the issues that were alluded to very forcefully in the committee&#146;s recommendations on the Better Government Initiative, to which the noble Lord belonged and which was chaired by Sir Christopher Foster.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000274"></a>This is not a problem unique to this parliamentary democracy. It is, I think, sensible to consider what is done in other countries and to consider whether at this time, when the Government are contemplating a considerable process of constitutional reform designed to strengthen Parliament, there are ideas and lessons to be learnt in other parliamentary jurisdictions. I draw the Government&#146;s attention, in particular, to the experience in New Zealand. In a notable speech made about a year ago, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, concluded&#151;he might have been talking about the United Kingdom&#151;</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08032775000308"></a>&#147;From where I sit the real problem is that we still legislate too easily. We give insufficient thought to what we are trying to do when we legislate. And then, having legislated, we do not examine whether we even achieved what we were trying to. We amend too readily when often we should start again. We fail to assess

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000275"></a>In New Zealand there are two advisory committees in place to try to achieve some of this betterment. Sir Geoffrey has admitted that he does not think that they are sufficient and has suggested that they should be &#147;melded&#148;, to use his word, into one.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000276"></a>Another example that we should look at is that of the Council of State in the Netherlands, which is a body considered to be one of the high councils of state, appointed by the Government. It is a relatively small body but it has a very large staff; it provides a very useful service, considering whether the problem being addressed is one that could or should be solved by legislation. It asks whether a Bill is necessary and whether its necessity has been demonstrated, whether the proposed legislation will be effective and the proposed solution efficient and balanced as regards costs and benefits. It asks, too, whether it will be possible to apply and enforce the Bill or to monitor its effects. This comes at a time when the future of this Chamber is under consideration and its very important revising role is to some extent at risk. Let no one imagine that a representative body of elected Peers will perform its revising role in anything like the same manner as the present House of Lords does, because it&#151;like the House of Commons&#151;will be looking for the political headlines. Should we consider a third institution as part of Parliament? I believe that we should.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000277"></a>Sir Geoffrey Palmer, in looking at the experience of New Zealand&#146;s advisory council said that the trouble with it was that it was not at the heart of the legislative process. I think that that is what we need; there should be a council of state of people appointed who reflect the kind of expertise that there is in this Chamber&#151;not only lawyers, as in New Zealand. The body would have pre-legislative and possibly post-legislative scrutiny role. The elected second Chamber could then act as it will, as a political Chamber, holding the Government to account and ending&#151;even blocking&#151;legislation, without the close, detailed work on legislation being sacrificed by those political considerations. I saw it reported this week that 450 Members would be elected to an upper House. That may be utter nonsense, but you would need something like that to bring together the expertise that you have. It is inconceivable that we would have an elected Parliament of 1,000 Members.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08032775000278"></a>I commend that in outline to the Lord Chancellor as a field of inquiry.</p>

Like him, I have had the privilege to take part in the Better Government Initiative, where this issue, which affects the relationship between the Executive and Parliament, was extensively discussed. It is important because that relationship in turn affects the attitude of the public to their institutions and the extent to which they think that representative democracy serves their needs.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000002"></a>There have been a number of reviews and reports on this subject produced by both governmental and non-governmental bodies over the years. It is a reflection of the intrinsic importance of the issue being discussed, even if it does not immediately grab widespread attention. It is regarded as something with which the experts are inclined to deal, but we are not necessarily wrong in being interested. The quantity of law is going up, which I do not regard as particularly beneficial, but the quality of law is not keeping pace. As my noble and learned friend Lord Howe&#151;this bird of plumage next door to me&#151;said, the underlying policy can be affected by that and a situation could arise in which the Executive can pay the price of poor law being passed, because poor law is harder to implement in good policy.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000003"></a>Let me give some practical illustrations of the kind of difficulties we can get into. The number of Bills published in draft form has fallen since 2004. Only seven out of the 30 Bills in this Session were so presented. I hope that this debate will revitalise the Government&#146;s commitment to enforcing their own proposals, for which I commend them. It is important to live up to your standards and not just rest on fine words.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000004"></a>There has been a thorough exploration of how pre-legislative scrutiny can be expanded and clear proposals have been made. The noble Lord, Lord Butler, rightly, has again put forward guidelines of a kind which the Government should take seriously. But the 2003 standard text on parliamentary procedure, <I>Griffith and Ryle on Parliament</I>, states that the development of pre-legislative scrutiny,</p>
<ul><a name="08032780000030"></a>&#147;depends more on Government than on Parliament&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08032780000028"></a>We can say what we like, but it crucially depends upon the Government taking seriously their role in relation to Parliament. The Government&#146;s enthusiasm, or lack of it, for implementing these proposals will be key to them becoming standard.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000005"></a>You can see the price paid when this does not happen. Look, for instance, at the Government&#146;s legislative timetable for this Session and you realise how badly prepared Bills can damage the Government&#146;s programme. In 2004, the Pensions Bill took nine months to proceed through both Houses. In the process it had 78 new clauses inserted and 450 government amendments were made to it. As the shadow pensions Minister of the time commented in another place,</p>
<ul><a name="08032780000031"></a>&#147;if ever there were a piece of legislation that cried out to start its life as a draft Bill and be subject to the pre-legislative scrutiny procedures of both Houses, this is it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 16/11/04; col. 1192.]</ul>
<p><a name="08032780000029"></a>I am sure one could say the same thing about other legislation. Another example with which we are living now is the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which has limped through eight days in Committee and has just started Report. It has had countless clauses and whole parts added and removed at all stages. The Government have admitted that many of their amendments are to correct flaws resulting from lack of consultation. It is time that we learnt some of the lessons.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000006"></a>It is a remarkable fact, for example, that the provisions inserted to place the Commissioner for Prison Complaints on to a statutory footing were so ill-thought-through that even the commissioner publicly opposed them while supporting the intention that lay behind them. That must be a waste of time.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000007"></a>The properly managed resources and expertise of the private and charity sectors form an important part of the consultation process. We all recognise that these days the charity sector, the voluntary sector&#151;the Government call it the third sector but I prefer to call it the voluntary sector&#151;plays an increasingly important part in our public life. How is it brought in? How are its views heard? One of the important ways in which that can be done is through the process of pre-legislative consultation. If the Government are able to develop and implement rather more thoroughly their own guidelines in future, that would be a very good thing.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000008"></a>I contrast with that the benefits of pre-legislative consultation. I take as an example the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, which deals with enormously controversial issues, as we now see in another place. However, the quality of the debate in this House has been widely commented on and was very great. One reason why it was so good was that the Bill had been through a process of pre-legislative consultation, so the issues had been identified and clarified to a greater extent. The quality of the debate here and the service that this House was able to give to the legislative process was accordingly greatly enhanced. It is interesting that the Bill came to public notice and got picked up by the media only when it reached the Commons, but I have no doubt that the other place will benefit greatly from the work that we were able to do in this House on the basis of pre-legislative consultation. The case is made for greater effort and attention being given to that stage of the process.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000009"></a>A previous speaker rightly said that, even if it is very careful and diligent in its scrutiny of Bills, this House or a future House cannot compensate for defects that could be remedied in other ways. Bad-quality legislation causes enormous difficulties for those trying to implement and enforce it. The noble Lord, Lord Butler, set out some steps that could be taken to improve all this and they seem to me to be good guidelines for this Government and future Governments. It would be helpful if the Minister could say why the Government have not published more Bills in draft and whether she feels that they will be able to remedy the situation in future. It would be good to hear that the Government&#146;s intentions in this area will be reflected in their future conduct.</p>

I, too, pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Butler, who was kind enough to give me an indication of the issues that he wished to discuss, both in the context of the work that he and others have been doing and also specifically for today. I thank all noble Lords who have contributed and agree that this subject is worthy of greater discussion. It may feel a little introspective at times but it is very important. As my noble friend Lord Richard said, as Leader of the House I cannot possibly commit anyone to anything in terms of time, but there may be many opportunities where we can do more on this, and I would welcome that.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Butler, began extremely well in describing what <I>The Governance of Britain</I> was trying to do to redress the balance between government and Parliament and with regard to accountability to Parliament. That is precisely where my right honourable friend the Prime Minister was seeking to take this debate. I think the noble Lord said that it is good for governance and for the people of this country and therefore it is good for the Government. I endorse that. We achieve that by anything that we do that ensures that Parliament and accountability are put in a proper framework&#151;a better framework, perhaps.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000013"></a>I also agree that there is more to be done&#151;this is an ongoing process. Noble Lords have taken a slightly different view from my noble friend Lord Lipsey about how Parliament has progressed, although I saw noble Lords nodding when my noble friend talked about what is happening in another place&#151;for example, Public Bills receiving evidence&#151;but we should be ever-watchful because there is more to be done.</p>

<p><a name="08032780000015"></a>On the specific point about passing Bills before elections, a lot of work goes on with what we lovingly described as the &#147;usual channels&#148;. These are not deeply controversial Bills. Some Bills that I would have expected to have gone through that process&#151;for example, the Charities Bill&#151;did not as there were issues to be resolved. So it is not quite as simple as was perhaps suggested.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000016"></a>I will not comment on the length of Bills as I do not have the statistics for that, so do not trip me up on that. On the number of Bills, in 1979 a new eager Government came in and there were 251 Bills between 1979 and 1983. In 1997 to 2001, there were 159 and in the last full Session there were 136. So, in theory, the number of Bills is dropping. I take the point, which I know somebody will leap up and say if I do not&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Norton, is nodding at me&#151;about the length of Bills. None the less, it is important that we get the perspective on what the Government seek to do.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000017"></a>Noble Lords have talked a lot about the importance of recognising the Bill as part of a package. As a Minister in a different department, it is often difficult to explain to other organisations&#151;this is particularly true of the voluntary and charitable sector in many but not all cases&#151;that a Bill is merely a part of what one is offering in terms of policy for government. People tend to focus on &#147;the Bill&#148; as being the way we take forward a policy. But noble Lords are completely right that the package is important. One of the things that I feel quite strongly about is that as parliamentarians and politicians in government we need to get better at explaining where a Bill fits into a package that is on offer to people, because it is often only a narrow part of what is there.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000018"></a>My noble friend Lord Richard supported the noble Lord, Lord Butler, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, and other noble Lords on the idea of a resolution. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, said that it was a simple proposal that did not go far enough. My difficulty with it is that I cannot see&#151;but this may be my fault&#151;how it could be enforced. I wonder whether one would not fall into the trap of looking at how you would assess whether it is implemented, because it could in a sense be a political judgment. Whether we have implemented something depends on where you sit in the grand scheme of things, or it can on occasion. I do not accuse the noble Lord, Lord Butler, of that, but I will accuse my colleagues in the political parties of looking at what happens post-legislation in the wider context of thinking through what has happened. Those are my reservations about the idea of a resolution as a solution. I thoroughly endorse the principle behind what the noble Lord seeks to do in terms of trying keep a watch on ensuring that we have better legislation. I shall talk a little about that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="08032780000019"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, who is looking stunning, had a fabulous pamphlet with a very attractive young man on the front of it. I was wondering who he was. I want to say something about the underlying proposals. Consultation is a very important part of what government should and, I believe, do&#151;certainly in my experience&#151;to try to get to the point of working out what is the package and what within it should be the essence of the law that needs to be changed or added to, if that is what has to be done. I agree with noble Lords about the value and importance of pre-legislative scrutiny. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in his tiny intervention, and the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, described the particular role of the committee that was looking at what became the Human Embryology and Fertilisation Bill. I agree that the work done on that committee and in your Lordships&#146; House will be of immense importance to another place as they begin their discussions and deliberations on it. The noble Lord, Lord Norton, spent a bit of time focusing on that.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000020"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, and other noble Lords asked about the numbers of Bills that have pre-legislative scrutiny and the reasons why we do not always do that. There are many. One reason, which noble Lords would accept, is because there is not time. With proposals that are considered urgent&#151;Northern Rock is perhaps the latest example, but there  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are others&#151;it is not possible to do so. We encourage departments to publish draft Bills when we do not get a successful bid for legislative time. Indeed, the Courts and Tribunals Bill, which I consider to be one of my greater triumphs, was published ready for a programme in which it did not have a place. I relied on the fact that not all Bills are ready at the right moment, and indeed I was right. Noble Lords may recall it was the very first Bill into your Lordships&#146; House in the previous Session. It was a good example and was held up as such to departments of how they can get the legislation into either House by having it ready to roll, as it were.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000021"></a>The number of Bills that we expect to publish this Session is seven. It is not, as the noble Lord, Lord Norton, said, the three-to-one ratio that we had in 2003-04, but at least it is heading back in the right direction. We encourage departments to try to do it as far as possible; I cannot give one explanation that would cover why Bills are or are not presented in that way. I agree particularly with what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, when he used the phrase &#147;complex Bills&#148;. The examples that we have seen, particularly this latest example of the human embryology Bill, demonstrate the value of having that pre-legislative scrutiny on something that is complex to understand but needs to be understood for people to be able to reach the conclusions that they need to reach, whatever they may be, rather than be bombarded&#151;as can happen with issues such as this&#151;by external media or others, who wish to put a particular point of view that may or may not be one that noble Lords would agree with. So we are pushing to ensure that we do as many as possible in draft&#151;and I shall use the fact that your Lordships have pushed me even further on this to take that back as a business manager and say that we really need to do more. That way, as noble Lords have said, we end up with a better Bill that can potentially go through more smoothly&#151;although I flag up the case of the Legal Services Bill. It had pre-legislative scrutiny, but it did not help me one bit when it came to putting it through your Lordships' House.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000022"></a>At the other end of the spectrum, on post-legislative scrutiny, the noble Lord, Lord Norton, made a very important point about making sure that we look at what happens. Noble Lords will have seen proposals that have been published and memorandums produced between three and five years post the legislation and the Select Committees in either Chamber to have the opportunity to determine which they wish to scrutinise, for obvious reasons. I hope that those will go some way to ensuring that we do this, as I have always believed that it is very important to look back and to see what happened as a consequence, not least because I am sure that over the history of legislation there are occasions when consequences that have come about are not necessarily those intended. It is also good to go back and to see what has been successful and how it can be built on. I take the point that occasionally that means no amending&#151;that it means going back to the beginning and saying that it is better if we look at that more effectively.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000023"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, said that we should remember what reforming Governments mean and not just change things for change&#146;s sake. I agree with that&#151;but I am very mindful,  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC169"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>too, that circumstances change all the time. We live in a world that I would argue becomes faster and faster in terms of the changes that take place, which means that one has to be mindful of the law that follows. It does not mean change for change&#146;s sake. But there is a balance to be struck there.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000024"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Norton, talked about the impact assessments. There is a whole history of better regulation that goes back to the previous Government, the Deregulation Task Force and so on. I completely accept that the previous regulatory impact assessment process had its faults; we reviewed it and the process that we have put in its place is a much better one. It answers some of the points that have been raised, such as what the objectives of the policy are, why we need to intervene, what options were considered and when the benefits will be reviewed to establish what actually happened, as well as what the costs and benefits were, doing the cost-benefit analysis to underpin it. That will take us in the direction that noble Lords are looking for, not using it as an excuse to justify but rather to confirm that the process is proper and the outcome is to be desired&#151;in other words, that it is the best way in which to achieve what is proposed.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000025"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Lipsey that the programme that is now in operation, particularly in another place, is better. I take his point about guff  


<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC170"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column GC170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and White Papers, although I shall not comment further on that. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, has addressed his point to me before, with regard to his ideas. The problem is that it is worthy of a debate in itself. Sir Geoffrey Palmer&#146;s words are very important; we should not make legislation too easily, we need to assess whether it is successful and so on. I do not accept the premise that revision cannot be done by an elected Chamber, but I take the point of ensuring that it has the right role and responsibilities to do it effectively.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000026"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, says, we are trying to move to the point when we do not have poor law. I agree that if you have poor law, it is much harder to understand, never mind implement.</p>

<a name="80327-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08032780000027"></a>I cannot comment on the Pensions Bill. Sometimes we have lots of amendments because, in your Lordships' House for example, lots of good ideas come forward, so I cannot always say that amendments are a negative thing&#151;quite the opposite. My experience is that we get far better amendments when we sit down and work out together what ought to happen. Sometimes government amendments are noble Lords&#146; amendments transferred. The business managers are important players in this and do their very best to ensure that the legislative programme runs smoothly.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08032766000002"></a>Children: Byron Review</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08032766000014"></a><b><a name="80327-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08032766000134"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Lord Adonis):</b> My honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08032766000015"></a>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham) and I today welcome the publication of the report of the Byron review of the risks to children of potentially harmful or inappropriate material on the internet and in video games. A copy of the report, <I>Safer Children in a Digital World</I>, will be placed in the Library.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08032766000016"></a>In September 2007, the Prime Minister asked Dr Tanya Byron to lead an independent review to helpparents and their children to get the best from new technologies while protecting children from inappropriate or harmful material. This review has been jointly sponsored by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08032766000017"></a>The objectives of the Byron review were: to undertake a review of the evidence on risks to children&#146;s safety and well-being of exposure to potentially harmful or inappropriate material on the internet and in video games; to assess the effectiveness and adequacy of existing measures to help to prevent children from being exposed to such material and help parents to understand and manage the risks of access to inappropriate material; and to make recommendations for improvements or additional action.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08032766000018"></a>Dr Byron&#146;s final report, published today, sets out a detailed analysis of the evidence on the risks and benefits of new technologies and evaluates the work already being done to protect children online and to ensure appropriate access to age-rated video games. In doing so, Dr Byron recognises the need to develop a shared culture of responsibility with families, industry and government all playing their part to reduce the availability of potentially harmful material, to restrict access to it by children and to increase children&#146;s resilience and ability to understand and manage risk. We welcome and support this approach.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08032766000019"></a>To achieve this, Dr Byron recommends reforming how government and stakeholders work to improve our children&#146;s safety when using the internet through the following measures:</p>

<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08032766000020"></a>The creation of a new UK Council for Child Internet Safety, established by and reporting to the Prime Minister, including representation from across government, industry, children&#146;s charities and other key stakeholders. The council is to be chaired jointly by the Home Office and DCSF. DCMS will play a key role given its important policy responsibilities and expertise in this area of media and content regulation. A range of other departments will also be closely involved.</p>




<notus-date day="27" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS64"></a><b>27 Mar 2008 : Column WS64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08032766000021"></a>The development by the council of a three-pronged national strategy for improving child internet safety:</p>
challenging industry to take greater responsibility in supporting families through: clearer advice; establishing independently monitored codes of practice on areas such as user-generated content; improving access to high-quality parental control software and safe search; and better regulation of online promotions;developing a comprehensive public information and awareness campaign on child internet safety, including an authoritative &#147;one-stop shop&#148; on child internet safety. This is to be led by the Government but using the support and expertise of all council members; andputting in place sustainable education and children&#146;s service initiatives to improve the skills of children and their parents around e-safety.
<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08032766000022"></a>On video games, Dr Byron recommends a range of high-profile and targeted efforts to help to inform parents and children of the appropriateness of different video games and to restrict inappropriate access such as:</p>
 lowering the statutory requirement to classify video games to 12+, which is consistent with film classification and easier for parents;putting in place a hybrid classification system, using both PEGI and BBFC mechanisms with one set of symbols, from BBFC, for parents to understand;having clear and consistent guidance for industry on how games should be advertised; andchallenging industry to provide sustained and high-profile efforts to increase parents&#146; understanding of age ratings and improved parental controls. 
<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08032766000023"></a>We accept Dr Byron&#146;s recommendations in full and commend her for delivering a groundbreaking report that will make a real difference to children and young people&#146;s lives. In particular, we would like to congratulate Dr Byron on conducting such a thorough and open process, giving all those with an interest an opportunity to engage with the review on this important debate. The Government will develop a comprehensive action plan in response to Dr Byron&#146;s recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08032766000025"></a>The Government&#146;s plans to reform the coroner system were set out in the draft Coroners Bill, which was published in June 2006.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08032766000026"></a>Some of the changes have been announced already, such as the addition of provisions to strengthen the public protection role of coroners and a return to the current position on the reporting of inquests. Other

<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08032766000027"></a>The briefing note refers to the removal from the Bill of a provision on restricting the reporting of some inquests. Instead, I have been working with the Press Complaints Commission to produce a short discussion paper on how its press code can be improved to protect bereaved families. The discussion paper also considers how the code, and the role of the commission, can be better brought to the attention of families. This paper is also being published today.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08032766000032"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) and I wish to make the following Statement to the House. It concerns the Government&#146;s response to recommendations made by the coroners following the inquests into the tragic deaths of Gareth Myatt, at Rainsbrook secure training centre in April 2004 and Adam Rickwood at Hassockfield secure training centre in August 2004.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08032766000033"></a>In reply to a letter from HH Judge Richard Pollard, who presided at the inquest into Gareth&#146;s death, we promised a full response to his recommendations. To that end, we have drawn up an action plan that sets out the measures that the Government and the Youth Justice Board have taken, and are taking, in response to Judge Pollard&#146;s recommendations and those of Mr Andrew Tweddle, who presided at the inquest into Adam&#146;s death.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08032766000034"></a>We are placing copies of the action plan in the Library of the House.

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="08032766000099"></a>On behalf of the Secretary of State, I have signed regulations made under Part 1 of the Welfare Reform Act 2007, which are laid before the House today.This is an important set of regulations, which provide the benefit structure and rules for the new employment and support allowance (ESA), which will be introduced from 27 October 2008.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a><a name="08032766000100"></a>This is a further significant step in the Government&#146;s welfare reform strategy and addresses a key area for simplification by providing a single income replacement benefit for people who are not working and have a health condition or disability.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="08032766000101"></a>The Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 prescribe the conditions of entitlement and benefit regulations for those who claim on the basis that their capability for work is limited by their physical or mental condition. ESA will be payable in respect of new claims arising from 27 October and will replace incapacity benefit and income support paid on the grounds of incapacity or disability. Incapacity benefit and income support will continue in payment to existing customers.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="08032766000102"></a>For ESA, new medical and capability assessments, collectively to be known as the work capability assessment, will focus on what a person can do and identify what steps they might take towards taking up work. We intend to apply the new medical test to existing claimants as their benefit entitlement comes up for reassessment, starting in 2010. We expect all existing claimants to have been assessed using the new test by 2013.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="08032766000103"></a>For the majority of new claimants, ESA will provide, through a series of six mandatory work-focused interviews, the necessary personal adviser and other support to enable them to realise their potential and gain independence by moving into the job market. This will be delivered through the successful Pathways to Work

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="08032766000104"></a>ESA will be payable to those with the most severe health conditions or disabilities without them having to undertake any mandatory work-focused interviews&#151;they will be part of the support group. However, no one in the support group will be written off. They will be able to volunteer to receive the same support as the majority of claimants, who will be in the work-related activity group.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="08032766000105"></a>The regulations set out the rates of new benefit and ensure that a single person in the &#147;support&#148; group claiming income-related ESA will be guaranteed an income of at least &#163;102.10 a week&#151;&#163;17.60 a week more than the long-term rate of incapacity benefit. This will be done by automatically passporting them to the enhanced disability premium, as part of our commitment to fairness for the most severely disabled.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="08032766000107"></a>This Statement is an update for the House on the progress made in implementing the changes to the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) following the government announcement on 17 December 2007.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a><a name="08032766000109"></a>The consultation for the first package of draft regulations finished on 20 March. Subject to parliamentary passage, those regulations will increase FAS payments to 90 per cent of accrued pension and will enable us to pay people from their normal retirement age, subject to a lower limit of age 60. We are now considering the responses that we have had to the consultation.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a><a name="08032766000110"></a>We have also consulted on changes that we are proposing to annuity factors used in certain circumstances to convert cash sums into rates of notional pension to facilitate the calculation of assistance. This consultation is open until 18 April.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="08032766000113"></a>The second set of regulations contain provision for early reduced payment for certain qualifying members who are unable to work due to ill health; for extending the FAS to members of certain schemes that wound up underfunded with a solvent employer; for speeding up initial payments; for enabling the board of the Pension Protection Fund to advise in the development of the new FAS arrangements; and for removing the option to apply for reinstatement into the state additional pension for those eligible for FAS.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="08032766000114"></a>To reflect the particular nature of the content, the written consultation period for these draft regulations will be a period of six weeks. Although less than the customary 12 weeks, we consider that a six-week period for written consultation provides an appropriate time for stakeholders to consider and respond fully and will allow us to make the changes as quickly as we reasonably can. We have been in regular contact with stakeholders, including the Pensions Action Group, and will be sending the consultation document directly to relevant pension scheme trustees.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="08032766000115"></a>Good progress continues to be made and we will maintain the effort required to ensure that these changes, and therefore the assistance to scheme members, are in place with the minimum of delay.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="08032766000116"></a>The consultation documents are available on the department&#146;s website at <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications">www.dwp.gov.uk/publications</a> /dwp/2008/FinancialAssistanceScheme (MiscellaneousAmendments)2_Regulations2008.pdf or alternatively via the FAS website.</p>

<a name="80327-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a><a name="08032766000117"></a>In the first two packages of draft regulations, we have focused on introducing the key parts of the reforms to FAS announced on 17 December 2007: payment at 90 per cent from normal retirement age; allowing early reduced payment for those scheme members unable to work due to ill health; and allowing certain pension schemes with solvent employers to qualify for FAS.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a><a name="08032766000118"></a>There will be a third package of regulations, published for consultation later in the year, aimed at delivering all the remaining parts of the extension, which will move FAS to a position where financial assistance payments are calculated on a basis that is broadly comparable to that of the PPF.</p>

We are supporting the Government of Afghanistan's National Drug Control Strategy, which is based on approaches that have worked in Thailand and Pakistan. Over the period 2005-08, we will spend in excess of &#163;290 million to support counter-narcotics, including &#163;130 million to promote the development of alternative livelihoods for Afghan farmers. There has been some success: improvements in security and governance in the north, centre and east of Afghanistan have led to a dramatic reduction in poppy cultivation. The Afghan Government are aiming for at least half of provinces to become poppy-free in 2008 (from 13 in 2007 to 17 in 2008). We are working to sustain these gains and are focusing our efforts on the south where poppy cultivation is becoming increasingly linked with insecurity and the insurgency.</p>

 enhancing interdiction efforts to disrupt the operations of drugs networks and to weaken their links to the insurgency;assistance to Afghanistan's Poppy Eradication Force, including incentives to governors to undertake eradication of poppy cultivation;expertise to strengthen the criminal justice system, which has processed over 500 narcotics cases;providing 59 policing experts to Afghanistan to help train the Afghan National Police and the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan;funding drug treatment centres in six provinces, which have treated over 5,450 addicts; andfunding the National Solidarity Programme, which has financed over 34,816 projects including: water supply and sanitation; transport; irrigation; power; agriculture; education; rural development; public building; and health and emergency response.<a name="wa_subhd_1"></a>

As the fire occurred towards the end of the current fishing season, we expect the impact on Tristan's economy to be minimal. The next fishing season will begin as normal in July 2008. Ovenstone are planning to process the next season's quota aboard its vessel, the <I>Kelso</I>, rather than on-island. Therefore, we do not expect any reduction of the income Tristan derives from lobster fishing. Some casual staff employed at the facility will be unemployed until the facility is rebuilt, but regular employees will continue to be paid by Ovenstone.</p>
