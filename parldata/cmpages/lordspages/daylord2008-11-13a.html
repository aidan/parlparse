However, the International Maritime Organization estimates annual carbon dioxide emissions from international and domestic shipping at approximately 1,019 million tonnes, which is 3.3 per cent of total global emissions. Work is continuing to estimate the global climate impacts from the emission from ships of black carbon and nitrogen oxides, which are more uncertain.</p>

Since more than 90 per cent of world trade is carried by ship, shipping is naturally a large contributor to global gas emissions. On the other hand, it is the most efficient form of transport. In view of the various proposals for regulation that have been put forward, does the Minister agree that a global system under the IMO is likely to be far more effective than a regional system? If one has a purely European system, there is some danger that the competitive position of British shipping, which is of great importance to the UK economy, not least with regard to the balance of payments, could be jeopardised, so any system has to be flag-neutral.</p>

We strongly support that way forward. The most likely scenario for progress within the IMO by 2009 is agreement on a CO2 design index for new ships, as proposed by Japan, along with a voluntary operational CO2 index, a management plan for current ships and a range of voluntary operational and technological improvements so that we get the global approach that the noble Lord seeks.</p>

Would it not be better to hesitate a little until the situation has clarified?

However, two years after the end of the civil war, the Nepal Army is still resisting police investigation, which is quite legitimately required by civilians, into cases of alleged extrajudicial killings. There were 47 cases of alleged killings, disappearances, torture in custody or rape committed by the security forces between 2002 and 2006. That figure does not include the atrocities by the Maoist forces. Will the Minister confirm that he met the army chief of staff, General Katawal, who gave him a personal reassurance that the army would comply with these investigations? What can the international community and the UN do about this to further the cause of human rights in Nepal?</p>

There is now a new, democratically elected Government in Nepal, of whom the leading party is the Maoist movement. Like any new democratic Government, they have to assert their authority over the national army. The noble Lord is right: I have raised this twice with the head of the national army, both in Nepal and in London. Compliance is critical, but Nepal is a country badly in need of a truth and reconciliation commission of some kind. The human rights abuses were on all sides and the process of healing needs the truth to be arrived at about atrocities committed by not only the Maoist side but also the national army.</p>

Is he aware that much of British business, and post offices, are now in a battle for survival? Almost 5,000 post offices have closed since 1997 and it is anticipated that, by the time of the next general election, around a third of the entire network will have been lost on this Government&#146;s watch.

I have already met Mr Hooper, and his findings are at an advanced stage.

<a name="81113-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08111379000110"></a>I hope that with this amendment I can set the tone for today&#146;s considerations. I am sure noble Lords will have welcomed the Government&#146;s constructive response on this issue when the Bill passed to the other place. We have listened to the powerful and thoughtful arguments that noble Lords and others have put forward on whether those responsible for running the immigration system should have a legal duty to make arrangements to ensure that, consistent with their primary duty to secure our borders, their functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children&#151;in other words, a duty equivalent to that required of other public bodies and persons listed in Section 11 of the Children Act 2004.</p>

<a name="81113-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08111379000111"></a>We agree that making the UK Border Agency subject to this duty is the right thing to do for children and young people, and now is the right time to do it. My right honourable friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families, Beverly Hughes, committed to making the UK Border Agency subject to such a duty in Committee in the other place. However, rather than using this Bill, which will apply only to England and Wales as the legislative vehicle, we believe that the Immigration and Citizenship Bill is more appropriate. I know that I am not allowed to do this, but I have the draft Bill in my hand. In particular, it allows for a UK-wide solution which I know was the will of this House and will mean it can be appropriately scrutinised along with other immigration reforms.</p>

<a name="81113-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08111379000112"></a>As noble Lords are aware, on 14 July 2008, the Home Secretary published a draft partial version of the Immigration and Citizenship Bill, which included in Part 11 Clause 189 on the duty regarding the welfare of children. I hope that noble Lords are reassured that it will have the same effect in relation to the UK Border Agency. The clause uses the same terminology by providing that arrangements must be made to ensure that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111379000406"></a>&#147;any function of the Secretary of State in relation to immigration or nationality ... is discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000355"></a>The duty will also apply to designated officials when they are exercising immigration functions and to those contracted by UKBA to provide any services in relation to the discharge of relevant functions.</p>

<a name="81113-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08111379000113"></a>Officials in my department continue to work extremely closely with those in the Home Office, and the draft clause will be refined further to ensure that there is a statutory power to issue guidance and a requirement in law to have regard to it. This ensures a complete read-across to the Children Act 2004 Section 11 duty, which also includes provision requiring those subject to the duty to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="81113-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08111379000114"></a>The agreed intention between the Home Office and the Department for Children, Schools and Families is that the guidance planned to underpin the duty provided for in the Immigration and Citizenship Bill will be joint guidance, developed by both departments, and will build on the existing UKBA code of practice for keeping children safe from harm to provide a blueprint for effective safeguarding practice and the promotion of child welfare within the Immigration Service.</p>

<a name="81113-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08111379000115"></a>I know that noble Lords share the Government&#146;s view that the effectiveness of the new planned duty can only ever be judged by the extent to which the cultural shift which has already begun within the Immigration Service continues and becomes embedded fully. Of course there will be new independent inspection arrangements to help monitor the changes we expect.</p>

<a name="81113-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08111379000116"></a>I am confident that we have taken an important step forward, a step that is a testament to the powerful argument, expertise and experience of this House. I am also confident that the draft clause in the partial draft Immigration and Citizenship Bill, subject to further minor refinement, will, as I have described, provide the right degree of parity with agencies subject to the Section 11 duty in the Children Act. Given the progress I have highlighted today, I am sure that this House will support these amendments.</p>

I am pleased that now the Bill has returned to us from another place, we are faced with a more robust piece of legislation. There has been genuine cross-party co-operation to get to this stage; we welcome that, because we all have a keen interest in the welfare of children. The more improvements we can make to that welfare, the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08111379000119"></a>We are, and not for the first time, dealing with some of the most vulnerable groups in society.

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08111379000121"></a>For the benefit of anyone who may have been confused by the amendment which came back from the other place, which seeks to remove the clause that your Lordships&#146; House had added, I should state that I am delighted that the Government have thought seriously about this issue and am enormously grateful that they have decided that the measure would have more thorough application if an equivalent clause was inserted into the forthcoming Immigration and Citizenship Bill. For the sake of protecting vulnerable children, those provisions cannot arrive soon enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08111379000122"></a>Barnardo&#146;s has voiced a number of concerns, which the Minister has addressed. However, we share with it one concern: that the transition between the code of practice to safeguard children, to be issued under Section 21 of the UK Borders Act 2007, which will be laid before Parliament shortly and come into effect in the new year, must take into account the new stated policy intention of promoting children&#146;s welfare. There must be a seamless transition between the codes and the guidance for staff working on the ground.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08111379000123"></a>I said that the Bill has seen true cross-party co-operation. We on these Benches have been encouraged by the Government&#146;s constructive approach. We look forward to the outcome of the pilot social care practice schemes, and hope that positive findings will be acted on in due course. We of course welcome the greater support offered for disabled children and their parents, and the greater emphasis that is to be placed on family fostering and fostering closer to home.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08111379000124"></a>As the Minister said, we must do all we can to ensure that children do not enter the care system in the first place. We have taken important steps towards this goal in the Bill.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08111379000125"></a>I look on the progress that we have made with great pride. We have taken a good Bill and made it better. As I am stepping down as spokesperson for the Opposition on the children and families brief at the end of this parliamentary Session, I am delighted to end on such a happy note.</p>

I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, because it was her amendment that led to your Lordships&#146; House initially discussing this issue, to which the Government have listened so effectively. It is a great tribute to her work that she is able to step down from her portfolio&#151;we regret that she is doing so&#151;on such a high note. I thank her for all our cross-party work together during the years since she joined your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08111379000127"></a>I share her concern about whether the new clause in the Immigration and Citizenship Bill should be equivalent to what your Lordships had done. The Minister has today reassured us on that matter, and did so in writing in her letter of 7 November, for which I thank her. She has also made it quite clear that her department will remain engaged with the Home Office on this issue throughout the process. I share the concern of  


<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_794"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 794</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, too, about the transition phase, but I am encouraged that the Minister&#146;s letter makes it clear that she will continue working with the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium group of organisations. I am sure that keeping them closely engaged with the process will ensure that the Government make sure that the transition is as good as we could have wished. It is regrettable that it has been postponed, but let us hope that it will have been in a good cause.</p>

It is an excellent Bill. Those of us who spent great time on it could never have expected the outcome that we are hearing today. I am sure that we are all extraordinarily grateful to the Minister for pursuing the matter in the way that she has, because we have at last established the principle that all children within the borders of this country will be treated as children who can be safeguarded and whose development can be considered. However, will she say something about the training of the staff who will be dealing with this in the UK Border Agency, and how they will be absolutely clear about protecting children? I work in an organisation that spends a lot of time thinking about safeguarding, and we still have problems ensuring that every member of staff is clear about the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08111379000129"></a>I add my congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, on the Opposition Front Bench. She has made a huge contribution to children and families services and will be missed in that context&#151;although, no doubt, she will make her contribution elsewhere.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08111379000130"></a>I look forward to the implementation of this legislation. I ask the Minister for reassurance about implementation timescales, because, having worked in this field for many years, I know that while we have lots of legislation, implementation is what really makes it count&#151;and then the monitoring of how that implementation moves forward. I feel privileged to have worked on this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08111379000132"></a>We all congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, on the work she has done; we shall miss her leadership on discussion of the new Bill. Like her, I was slightly concerned when I saw the Commons amendment in its bare form, because of the time that it will inevitably take to introduce a new Bill. Time is my concern, because of the very large number of immigrant children who have disappeared beneath the radar.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08111379000133"></a>During the passage of the Bill, we discussed the possibility of local child protection agencies and others being made to conduct a census in their own area to try to discover how many such children there are, about whom we know nothing. They are not in the care of the social services or on any book. This must be wrong. So my one concern is that, during the period of working on the new Bill and taking it through, the momentum generated by this Bill should not be lost and the movement to conduct censuses of that kind should not be stopped until the new Bill has laid the duty on various authorities. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>

That is exactly what has happened with this Bill, which was a good, gallant and noble Bill when it first came to this House but has been greatly improved. I, too, join in congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, on her sterling efforts in that connection.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08111379000135"></a>Without going into detail, I am very conscious that the improvements contained in these amendments show a greater sense of trusteeship and commitment on the part of the Government towards children in need. The reaction has been imaginative; the duty at every possible opportunity to seek out and identify need is at the heart, core and kernel of the answer to this problem. Whatever our efforts are, even our noblest efforts will fall short of the needs of these children, but a great deal of progress has been made and a great deal of further progress set in train by this amendment.</p>

I thank the Minister for the Government&#146;s helpful and encouraging response to those concerns, which I know they very much share.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08111379000137"></a>I encourage the Minister to meet Mr Oppenheim, the children's champion in the Immigration Service appointed by her predecessor, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, to discuss these matters further if she has not yet had the opportunity to do so. The Children's Commissioner for England recently visited Yarl's Wood family detention centre, about which he continues to have concerns, so I hope that she will be able to make the time to meet Mr Oppenheim at an early juncture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08111379000138"></a>I also join in welcoming the Bill. It has been a pleasure and a privilege to have been involved in some parts of it. I do so as the joint chair of the All-Party Group on Children and Young People in Care. It is a great step forward and shows the Government&#146;s commitment to improving the chances of these young people, who have been so regrettably let down in the past. Recent events highlight the continuing need, despite the welcome efforts made by the Government, to improve the status of social work and to support social workers. Far more still needs to be done to ensure that there is a proper professional framework in which social workers can operate in difficult circumstances and with such vulnerable children and families. I welcome the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08111379000140"></a>I emphasise the concern that we all share about children in the immigration scene. I back the idea of continuing to keep an eye on the terrible problem of children who have disappeared out of sight since arriving in this country. Our lack of knowledge and activity during the time that that has been going on is shameful and we have not done as much as we could have done. I hope that the Minister will be active in that respect.</p>

As someone who has joined the proceedings on the Bill at the very last stage, I have been made aware of the incredibly rich, important and significant debates that have taken place. I should like to offer a little more reassurance on the questions that noble Lords have raised. First, the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, highlighted the question of momentum. The Bill has certainly generated momentum and we will be moving quickly onto the next Bill. But I am happy to reassure him and other noble Lords that we will continue the momentum that this Bill has generated.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08111379000142"></a>I can also reassure noble Lords about the code of practice. I know that some noble Lords have been concerned that there will be a considerable gap in time before the new duty in the Immigration and Citizenship Bill can take effect. I am therefore pleased that the arrangements provided for in the UK Borders Act 2007 requiring the Border and Immigration Agency, as it was then known, to have regard to a code of practice for keeping children safe from harm will remain in place. It will have been reinforced by the clear new direction of travel.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08111379000143"></a>The code of practice has been consulted on widely and a response to that consultation, together with a revised code, is expected to be published in early December, when the original duty in the UK Borders Act 2007 will be commenced. In time, the planned provisions in the Immigration and Citizenship Bill will replace those in the UK Borders Act 2007, so we can expect a phased introduction of these new measures designed to safeguard children and promote their welfare: first, from this autumn, a duty on UKBA to have regard to a code of practice for keeping children safe from harm; and then, subject to the passage of the Immigration and Citizenship Bill, a stronger duty to discharge functions having regard to the need to safeguard children and, picking up on the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, to promote their welfare, and to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08111379000144"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, referred to training. All border and immigration staff have received training on child awareness issues to keep children safe from harm, with two further levels of training aimed at those staff members whose work directly affects children. The UKBA&#146;s culture is changing and, given what I have said today, there should be no question of our commitment to ensuring that culture change continues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08111379000146"></a>Like all noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate, I wish to put on record my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton. She and I are members of the class of 2004. She has made a tremendous contribution to this House. I am disappointed that I will not be able to work with her more often as we take forward the huge amount of legislation that will be introduced in the next Session. I hope that noble Lords will accept my commitment from the Dispatch Box to maintain the momentum that we need to ensure that we keep the interests of all children within the UK borders at the centre of our approach.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08111379000154"></a>This is a small group of minor and technical amendments. I shall try to explain succinctly their effect and rationale. Commons Amendment No. 2, and its counterpart Commons Amendment No. 9, although lengthy, are in fact minor and technical, concerned with the establishment of an independent review mechanism relating to approval of foster parents, similar to the existing mechanism for prospective adopters. By restating paragraphs 12(d) and (g) of Schedule 2 to the Children Act 1989, the amendments provide for transitory arrangements in advance of the new substantive provisions coming into force.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08111379000155"></a>The Bill already contains provisions in Schedule 1 that enable the Secretary of State in England, or the Welsh Ministers in Wales, to make regulations to set up an independent review mechanism for foster carers. The independent review mechanism will allow all prospective and existing foster carers whom the fostering service provider proposes not to approve as foster parents, or whose approval the provider proposes to withdraw, the option of having their case reviewed by an independent panel. So it is offering those who may not go forward as foster parents the option to have that decision reviewed. Our intention is to establish the new IRM for foster parents from April 2009, but the enabling provisions in Schedule 1 are linked to Clause 9 and to the restatement of Section 23 of the Children Act 1989, and our timescale for bringing those provisions into force is longer. This is why we need a separate, parallel transitory provision to enable the fostering IRM to be established next April.</p>

This amendment makes it clear that the power to share information is not limited to information about the particular circumstances of the death and would include, for instance, information about where the child had been living.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08111379000157"></a>Finally, Commons Amendment No. 3 is a minor drafting change to Clause 14, to ensure that subsection (2) correctly cross-refers to an order made under Clauses 12 and 13. I hope that, given that brief explanation, noble Lords will accept this group of amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08111379000159"></a>It is unfortunate that, despite everything that the Government have done, we are still having too many violent deaths of children; even one is too many. It is very important that we should have every possible opportunity to learn lessons from the deaths of children. I refer not just to the terrible recent case in Haringey, but to the two more child deaths in Manchester, of which I heard only this morning. I have no doubt that lessons will emerge from that case too. It is important that professionals everywhere have every single opportunity to learn all the lessons that they can from all those unfortunate occurrences.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08111379000162"></a>This group of amendments relates to children who are provided with accommodation for three months or more under education and health legislation, the great majority of whom are disabled. The particular needs of this vulnerable group have been the subject of much debate, both in this House and the other place. Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that we have returned to this topic.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08111379000163"></a>We have made it clear throughout the debates on this issue that we share the ambition to ensure that social services are actively involved in a timely and appropriate manner when a decision is taken to accommodate a child away from home, so that consideration is given in every case to the child&#146;s social care needs and to the needs of members of his or her family for support, to enable them to sustain their involvement in their child&#146;s life.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08111379000164"></a>Having listened carefully to the persuasive and passionate speeches on this subject, my honourable friend, and my predecessor as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families, Kevin Barron, undertook to explore with the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign group whether there was anything more that the Government could do to promote the welfare of this vulnerable group of children. I believe that we have developed a package of primary and secondary legislation, supported by improved statutory guidance, which will make a significant contribution to improving services for these children.</p>

<a name="81113-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08111379000165"></a>Commons Amendment No. 6 requires the local authority to have an appropriate tailored package of services suitable to meet the needs of children who are provided with accommodation under health or education legislation. In particular, the local authority will be expected to provide services that support the continuing active involvement of the parents in their child&#146;s life. It will complement the new duty in Clause 19 of the Bill to arrange social work visits which will provide ongoing supervision for the placement and ensure that the local authority is aware of any significant change in the child&#146;s circumstances and is able to step in where necessary.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81113-0004.htm"/>


<a name="81113-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08111379000166"></a>I hope that one of the most important services that local authorities can provide is to take all reasonable steps to promote contact between the parent and child. The amendment specifically refers to services,</p>
<ul><a name="08111379000408"></a>&#147;necessary to enable the child to visit, or to be visited by, members of the family&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000357"></a>and to,</p>
<ul><a name="08111379000409"></a>&#147;assistance to enable the child and members of the family to have a holiday together&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000167"></a>We already expect agencies to work together when making long-term plans to accommodate children away from home.</p>

<a name="81113-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08111379000168"></a>Nevertheless, we recognise that in some cases interagency working arrangements are not as effective as they should be, and so we will use powers in Clause 19 to require a visit to take place within the first seven working days of a placement, or notification of a placement, unless an initial social services assessment  


<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_800"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 800</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has already been carried out as part of the placement decision. This will provide reassurance for parents and children that children&#146;s social care professionals will be involved from the start of the placement.</p>

<a name="81113-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08111379000169"></a>It remains the responsibility of the home local authorities to assess and provide services to meet the needs of children being placed out of area under health or education legislation. Commons Amendment No. 5 makes this position clear beyond doubt. Of course, in practice, it will often be appropriate for the home and receiving local authorities to reach an arrangement for some aspects of service provision.</p>

<a name="81113-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08111379000170"></a>I recognise that, unfortunately, for many children in long-term placements parental engagement may be difficult to establish or sustain, and we will strengthen statutory guidance to make clear that one of the visitor&#146;s responsibilities will be to develop a relationship with the child and provide support to their parents. For that reason, the visitor should be available to speak with the parents and the child between visits. The guidance will also provide greater detail on the considerations around parental involvement and the child&#146;s needs, and when it would be appropriate for the local authority to assume responsibility for providing accommodation under Section 20 of the 1989 Act, and thus for the child to become looked after.</p>

<a name="81113-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08111379000171"></a>This is a comprehensive package of measures that was developed in partnership with Every Disabled Child Matters and has been warmly welcomed by it. The package significantly improves the safeguards for this group of vulnerable children and will promote their welfare by providing support to keep the child and family in touch. I am committed to continuing the constructive dialogue with EDCM, other stakeholders and honourable Members. This will be vital in taking forward the development of the regulations and statutory guidance. I am confident that noble Lords will support this improvement to the Bill.</p>

It is also important for the local authority to measure its response so that it does not lessen the parents&#146; involvement. Therefore, I was very pleased to hear what the Minister said about all the steps taken to promote contact between the child and any family that he may have, and I welcome the amendment.</p>

This is a consequential technical amendment to Clause 3. Clause 3 allows employment tribunals to increase or decrease an award by up to 25 per cent for unreasonable failure to comply with any relevant code of practice relating to workplace dispute resolution. Tribunals will be able to adjust awards under the jurisdictions set out in new Schedule A2. This schedule replicates the jurisdictions that are already listed in Schedule 3 to the Employment Act 2002. It covers the vast majority of the jurisdictions of claims accepted by employment tribunals.</p>

<a name="81113-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08111379000188"></a>Following the Third Reading of the Bill in this House, the Cross-border Railway Services (Working Time) Regulations 2008 came into force on 27 July. These regulations transpose a European directive on working conditions for railway workers on cross-border railway services and replace conditions previously covered by the working time directive.</p>

<a name="81113-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08111379000189"></a>Regulation 17 allows a worker to complain to an employment tribunal if his employer has refused to permit him to exercise rights under the regulations relating to rest or break periods. The regulations insert Regulation 17 into Schedule 3 to the Employment Act 2002 as a jurisdiction to which the adjustment of awards for non-completion of statutory procedure applies. Amendment No. 2 therefore makes a consequential amendment to add Regulation 17 to new Schedule A2 as a jurisdiction to which the new adjustment provisions will also apply after repeal of the existing provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08111379000193"></a>Amendment No. 2 addresses an issue raised in the Vulnerable Worker Enforcement Forum&#146;s report, which was published together with the Government&#146;s response in August. Once the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate has started an inspection, it is currently a criminal offence to disclose information obtained during that inspection. Inspectors therefore cannot inform Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, which enforces the national minimum wage, if they come across indicators of non-compliance with the minimum wage. This legal restriction on minimum wage officers being able to share information also means that they are not able to inform employment agency inspectors of details of non-compliant employers in order for inspectors to follow up possible non-compliance issues with the employment agency legislation.</p>

<a name="81113-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08111379000194"></a>Amendment No. 2 would remove these barriers to information sharing between those who enforce the national minimum wage and those who enforce employment agency legislation. Amendment No. 4 provides for Amendment No. 2 to be commenced by order.</p>

For my sins, I participated in the National Minimum Wage Bill in the other place, where we had one of the longest Committee sittings ever&#151;over 24 hours&#151;to discuss it at great length. It is good that the issue has been addressed again in the Employment Bill, and vital that compliance is achieved, as many of us will know from our contact with small businesses and those working in them. Usually we would be concerned about information being passed from one hand to the other, but on this occasion, in view of the great need to ensure that we tighten up on all the possible avenues for things to go wrong, we on these Benches support what has been put forward.</p>

<a name="81113-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08111379000197"></a>I wonder whether this could not be classified as a way of tracking down people. In that connection, were we in a different place, we might be wishing to track down Joe the Plumber, a case which has recently received a lot of publicity. I am not sure whether Joe was a mythical figure, but I welcome the fact that we will be able, through these means, to contact those not implementing the regulations as required. I urge the Government to pursue this matter and to continue to keep their eye on the implementation of the national minimum wage.</p>

Under the commencement provisions in Clause 21, the provisions in Clauses 15 to 17 relating to employment agencies come into force either on 1 October 2008 or, if the Act obtains Royal Assent after that date, on 6 April 2009. As we are now discussing the Bill on 13 November 2008, the option to commence these clauses on 1 October can no longer be exercised. Amendment No. 3 therefore removes the option from the Bill.</p>

<a name="08111379000210"></a><a name="81113-0004.htm_spmin4"></a><b><a name="81113-0004.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="08111379000550"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend, James Purnell, in the other place. The Statement is as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a Statement on the future of the Post Office card account<I>.</I></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;This Government created the Post Office card account in 2003. We announced that there would be a successor in 2006 and, based on the legal advice we received at the time, we put the contract out to tender. During that process, I have been unable to comment publicly or privately on this matter. I know that that has been frustrating to honourable Members, and I thank them for their understanding.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I know that all honourable Members would agree that the post office is at the heart of their community. It reaches the places and people that no one else does. That is why the Government have invested &#163;2 billion in the Post Office since 1997; that is why we have for the first time set out access criteria to guarantee its reach; and that is why we will invest another &#163;1.7 billion between now and 2011.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;There is no doubt that the Post Office card account is central to maintaining a viable post office network. It not only generates a key part of the Post Office&#146;s income but brings with it vital footfall to individual sub-postmasters. Post Office card account customers have shown how much they value the service through the postcard campaign over the past few months, which has resulted in the large postbags of honourable Members.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;It is also clear that maintaining a viable post office network is even more critical now than it was two years ago. The financial turbulence that began with the American banks, and the string of consequences which followed from it, have understandably made many people, particularly the most vulnerable in our society, more concerned about financial transactions. The Post Office, with its trusted brand, is seen as a safe, secure and reliable provider of services.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Now cannot be the time for the Government to do anything that would put the network at risk, particularly as post offices are often the only providers of banking services in both rural and deprived urban areas. The Post Office also has a proven track record of being able to move billions of pounds in cash safely around the country to ensure that the money is there when customers need it, and prides itself on meeting the needs of vulnerable customers. Sub-postmasters know their customers and provide a social service as well as a banking service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Delivering that vital social service for groups in our communities who need it most is not only an objective of the Post Office. It is an objective shared passionately by the Government as well.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_806"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 806</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;To safeguard that service, we must help and support a viable post office network. For that reason, I can announce today that the Government have now decided to cancel the current unfinished procurement exercise and to award a new contract for the continuation of the Post Office card account directly to Post Office Ltd, within the terms of the relevant EC regulations. The contract will run initially from April 2010 to March 2015 with the possibility of an extension beyond that.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I recognise, of course, that this decision will disappoint those other bidders who had reached the final stage of the competition. I emphasise to the House, as I have done personally to the companies in question, that my decision does not reflect in any way on their ability to have provided the services in question. Nor is that a step that we have taken lightly. We recognise the importance of competition in the awarding of public contracts, but we have concluded that, in the current circumstances, protecting vulnerable groups by preserving a viable post office network justifies the award of a contract outside the competitive process. These are exceptional times, and we believe that this is a proper and proportionate response.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Post Office considers that this decision, along with the extra money invested by the Government, will ensure a commercially viable future for the post offices that will be in place after the modernisation programme is complete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I said that I would make a decision as soon as I could. I said that I would not rush the decision. I said that what was important was that we made the right decision. I believe that this is the right decision. This decision is good news for our constituents; it is good news for Post Office Ltd; and it is good news for sub-postmasters. I trust that it will be welcomed by honourable Members and I commend the Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

He must be aware that it contains a fiasco with a happy ending. It has been awaited for a very long time. We were told by the Government that it would come before the Summer Recess. The Summer Recess came and went. Then we were told that it would come in October. October came and went. Then we were told that it had been held up by the Glenrothes by-election. That came and went. Now, at last, we have it.</p>

<a name="81113-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08111379000213"></a>It comes as a great relief to post offices and to the many people&#151;in particular, pensioners&#151;whom they serve. Five thousand post offices have already gone since the Government started dithering on the matter. If the Post Office card account had not been re-awarded to post offices, there is no doubt that that would have led to an even greater number of closures. Indeed, we heard during Questions today of an estimate of one-third of post offices being lost by the time of the next election, had this happy event not occurred. So why does the Statement say:</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_807"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 807</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08111379000397"></a>&#147;There is no doubt that the Post Office card account is central to maintaining a viable Post Office network&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000358"></a>What led the Government, kicking and screaming perhaps, to reach this conclusion&#151;a conclusion which the public and their MPs have been telling them for months? We have even had debates in your Lordships&#146; House, led not least by my noble friend Lady Byford on this exact subject.</p>

<a name="81113-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08111379000214"></a>The Statement appears to blame this fiasco on lawyers. I suppose the Government have to blame someone when considering the future of the Post Office card account. Lawyers apparently said that it would have to go out to tender. This is indeed what happened. However, the Statement says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111379000410"></a>&#147;the Government have now decided to cancel the current unfinished procurement exercise&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000359"></a>Have the same government lawyers pronounced on that? If so, this advice is not really consistent.</p>

<a name="81113-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08111379000215"></a>The announcement today is not permanent relief for post offices or their millions of customers. It amounts to an extension of the current arrangements for, in the first instance anyway, only five years. Did the lawyers advise on this, too? What is the significance of &#147;the relevant EC regulations&#148; in the Statement? Where do they fit into all this? How much has all this abortive tendering exercise cost?</p>

<a name="81113-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08111379000216"></a>Finally, DBERR is at last grappling with the undoubted problems of the Post Office, and I congratulate the Secretary of State, who I am afraid is absent. I rather see his hand in much of the Statement, such as the bit about the Post Office&#146;s potential role in becoming even more involved with financial products, because the Post Office is seen as what the Statement quite rightly calls,</p>
<ul><a name="08111379000411"></a>&#147;a safe, secure and reliable provider of services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000360"></a>That remark stands out.</p>

<a name="81113-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08111379000217"></a>Exactly those thoughts were in a letter from the Secretary of State to the Prime Minister, which was leaked to the <I>Guardian</I> on Tuesday. I do not know whether the Minister heard the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, the other day, but he was here,</p>
<ul><a name="08111379000412"></a>&#147;to toil, not to spin&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 16/10/08; col. 861.]</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000361"></a>We all thought that at the very least he would have remained in the House this morning either to give or to hear the Government&#146;s Statement, given his new-found great interest in the future of the Post Office. Had he been at the Dispatch Box this morning, I, or perhaps my noble friend who is his opposite number, would have asked him whether he would institute a leak inquiry. I therefore ask the Minister whether there will be one.</p>

<a name="81113-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08111379000218"></a>In the past two years, the Government&#146;s handling of the Post Office has undermined its business and has caused painful turmoil and growing pain for postmasters and communities. Post offices, communities and many of the country&#146;s most needy people will today breathe a sigh of relief that the Post Office card account has been re-awarded to the Post Office.</p>

It is bizarre to suggest that we somehow deferred this decision until after the Glenrothes by-election. We were able to win it without this good news. Goodness knows what we would have done if we had announced this earlier.</p>

<a name="81113-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08111379000224"></a>The noble Lord said that we blamed this all on lawyers. That is not so. As the Secretary of State has made clear, being able to call a halt to the procurement process was key, and it was the advice of lawyers in the current circumstances to proceed without a competitive process. The previous advice, which was clearly based on the circumstances at the time, was that we needed to go out to competitive tender, which we did. The Secretary of State again requested advice, given the turbulence that we face and the importance of the Post Office brand and the stability that it is seen as providing in communities up and down the country. The advice came back that we did not, in these circumstances, have to proceed by competitive tender, which is why we have been able to take this decision. Tendering is obviously subject to EC regulation, but no requirements are imposed on us with regard to state aid under those provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08111379000225"></a>The noble Lord also asked about cost in all this. All the bidders who were left in the competition made proposals that were below current terms, and clearly the end result will mean a better deal for the taxpayer.</p>

She asked whether this was a permanent change. We have made it clear that the award is a contract to 2015, with the possibility of renewal. She also asked whether we will compensate bidders for their costs. We are certainly prepared to entertain reasonable claims for costs for bidders who remained in the final process. This will add to the viability of the Post Office network. At Question Time today, my noble friend Lord Mandelson explained his focus on this and his determination that the Post Office should be sustainable and viable for the future.</p>

The point to bear in mind is that we are in turbulent financial circumstances in which particularly vulnerable people question the use of bank accounts or accounts of any sort, and whether they should have faith in the financial system. Given the strong brand that the Post Office has, it seems to be increasingly important that we do everything we can to make sure that its viability is sustained. It will be an added opportunity to encourage people into bank accounts, quasi-bank accounts and accounts such as the Post Office card system, which is different from where we were a couple of years ago. That fundamental backdrop and focus on the overriding public policy issue has generated this change.</p>

I believe that my noble friend Lord Mandelson was very clear on that first point at Question Time today in response to my noble friend&#146;s questioning. Issues around the Royal Mail are subject to review at the present time. I think that we share a desire to make sure that the Post Office and the Royal Mail are sustained in a robust form.</p>

It is a common drive, which I first raised during the passage of the Pensions Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is nodding. I have two direct questions. Will this announcement require the Post Office to look at those post offices whose future has already been put under jeopardy and will they be reviewed again? In his response earlier, the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, said that he will talk to various government departments about ways in which they could get more trade going through post offices. Will the Minister particularly pay attention&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, will not agree&#151;to the way in which the DWP does business? Clearly, the pensions and benefits department put enormous pressure on anyone who is entitled to a benefit to have it paid through their bank if they have one. That is not fair to post offices. I hope that the Minister will say that that practice will not continue.</p>

Although I think that it was an omission the first time around, in leaflets now being prepared to notify people who are paid by cheque or giro about the alternatives to bank accounts, the Post Office card account has been added to that list of facilities which people are encouraged to use. The statistics are that, of the payments made by the DWP, something like 78 per cent are made into more mainstream bank accounts, 20 per cent into POCA accounts and 2 per cent are still made by giro. Under these new contractual arrangements, there are improvements to the Post Office card account. Card account holders can access their accounts through ATMs and the opening of such accounts will be more streamlined. That has been a bit bureaucratic and has deterred people. People will also be able to have the benefit of the fast-track payment system that is part of the financial services system.</p>

If that decision had been made earlier, would more post offices have been able to stay open? We believe that the answer is no. Post Office Ltd has been making unsustainable losses and lost &#163;500,000 a day last year. The network change programme reflected the need to restructure the network to reflect changing customer demands and habits. The programme has improved the viability of remaining offices through migration of customers from nearby offices which have closed.</p>

But I should like to press the point made by my noble friend that this solution for the five-year period will develop into a permanent solution. In response to the question asked by the noble Baroness, the Minister seemed to imply that the closure programme would carry on even had this agreement been instituted before today. That makes me very worried that the Government are not committed to a permanent answer for post office services as more businesses depend on the local post office for their transactions. An experiment was carried out which delivered services of one sort or another&#151;it could extend to the services for small businesses&#151;through the post office system, and it was abandoned. We are looking for a permanent solution.</p>

I do not think that I could put it more eloquently than my noble friend Lord Mandelson did at Question Time on the Government&#146;s determination to build and sustain a viable network for Post Office Ltd. The noble Lord asked again about the term of the award of the contract. It is a five-year contract. The current contract ends in 2010, but with the prospect of renewal thereafter. That does not seem to be an unreasonable length of time for a contract and would give some assurance to Post Office Ltd.</p>

I hope, as I am sure that other noble Lords will do, that, as a result, sub-postmasters take the opportunity to build their businesses to ensure that they are used. A sizeable chunk of the post offices that closed in the past year had fewer than 20 transactions a week. Consequently, if we do not use post offices and if they cannot or do not provide the services that we all want to see, they will not survive and enjoy the footfall rightly referred to by my noble friend.</p>

<a name="81113-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08111379000240"></a>I was concerned when the noble Baroness seemed to suggest that it was the DWP&#146;s responsibility to pay over the odds, if necessary, for transactions in order to keep afloat an institution which we all want to see stay afloat for social grounds. Perhaps my noble friend would remind the House of the cost per transaction of a DWP benefit payment, whether it be a pension or whatever, into a bank account, via POCA and a paper transaction. Perhaps he could give us a steer as to the relative costs, which used to be very alarming.</p>

It is right that the comparative cost of paying people by cheque or giro is significantly greater than doing so through bank accounts and the Post Office card account. As I indicated, all the bidders in the final stage came forward with terms that were, in a sense, more favourable than the current arrangements, although obviously those are contractual terms between DWP and Post Office Ltd. How those terms translate into the cost of individual transactions is not something I can respond to specifically at the moment, but I will follow up the point and give my answer in writing. What is absolutely clear is that encouraging people to be paid by means other than through the giro system is safer, more secure, more flexible and generally better for them and considerably cheaper for DWP and HMRC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08111379000247"></a>I have some specific questions to put to my noble friend. First, can he put to bed once and for all the idea that Post Office workers and sub-postmasters serving behind counters are not allowed to promote Post Office business? There have been instructions not to talk about the Post Office card account and to refer to other forms of banking. Secondly, building on what the Minister said at Question Time today, does my noble friend consider today&#146;s decision to be a building block on the way to getting a people&#146;s bank, something to which I referred earlier? There is no need to reinvent the wheel. We need only to take down the file for National Girobank, when the bank was given to the Alliance &amp; Leicester Group, and start it up again. It would be as successful as it was during the 22 years of its existence. Specifically, I ask my noble friend this: when the Secretary of State says, &#147;Let us look at all these products&#148;, will that be taken into account?</p>

<p><a name="st_114"></a>

He referred to the Government taking business away from the Post Office, but we live in a changing environment. In the debate just last week reference was made to the fact that many more people are now doing business via the internet, which has driven some of the changes that have been necessary in the network.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08111379000249"></a>On the proposition that Post Office employees and sub-postmasters are not allowed to promote Post Office business, I simply do not believe that that is the case. The market for the Post Office card account has declined from its peak of 4.3 million cardholders down to around 3.9 million at the moment. One development is that some people are moving from the Post Office card account, which has the advantage of simplicity as a channel for benefit payments&#151;that is quite important in relation to the current legal advice that we have received&#151;on to more traditional, mainstream bank accounts. By doing so, they can use the facility of direct debit, which as we know is one route to getting discounts on utility bills. Obviously we want to encourage that opportunity.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08111379000250"></a>My noble friend also raised the issue of the people&#146;s bank. This is a matter for colleagues in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, but again the remarks made this morning by my noble friend Lord Mandelson were as clear as they could be on his determination to explore a range of options in the financial sector and possibly others to enable the Post Office to flourish.</p>

However, some of the most disadvantaged people&#151;those who need it most&#151;are not able to get an account with a commercial bank.

I am sorry that I cannot give as full an answer as I might like in relation to plans around a people&#146;s bank and broadening the business opportunities for Post Office accounts. That is simply because those issues are not the responsibility of DWP. I know that I answer for the Government today and I apologise for the somewhat restricted presentation I have made. However, I take the point that it is right that everyone should be able to have a bank account. In many ways, it is the best route for the most vulnerable, for the reasons that I have just set out&#151;lower utility bills and the assurance that their finances are as secure as anyone else&#146;s. A range of bank accounts and bank facilities can currently be accessed through Post Office Ltd&#151;I have forgotten the exact percentage, although it is in my brief&#151;and there is the basic bank account, which must be provided through the Post Office network. There is much to build on and I will liaise with colleagues in DBERR to ensure that the issues raised by my noble friend are rightly pressed.</p>

That should be the first of many developments. Will my noble friend comment on the point, not so far mentioned, that Her Majesty&#146;s Government is, at least in part, responsible for a reduction in choice for the consumer in banking services by allowing rather rapidly a merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS, which will reduce the number of clearing banks from five to four? The reduction in choice for customers could be made up for if, out of this crisis, the development of the Post Office becomes a government objective.</p>

It is interesting that the Post Office can add some diversity to the financial services system, which has been made less diverse by current arrangements. My noble friend will understand why the merger was proposed and is proceeding and why other arrangements have been put in place to recapitalise the banks and to provide liquidity in the financial services sector. This is not to support those institutions in themselves but because the banking and financial services systems underpin everything else that we do in our day-to-day living and the trade and commerce on which we all depend. I note again the comments about a people&#146;s bank. I am sure that that issue was recognised by my noble friend Lord Mandelson earlier today.</p>

The Minister has answered the questions with his customary skill. However, there have been frequent references to the Secretary of State. The reason why the Works and Pensions Secretary made the Statement at the other end is that the Secretary of State responsible is at this end. If the Lord President were in her place, I would ask her&#151;as I certainly shall&#151;to raise this issue. When a major Statement is made where the Secretary of State is a Member of this House, it should be made by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08111379000260"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, noble Lords will remember the many excellent debates we had during the passage of the Housing and Regeneration Bill, which was much improved by the contributions of Members of this House. Today we are considering the draft of an order, the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2008, which will make a number of amendments to legislation which are necessary once certain provisions of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 are commenced.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_816"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 816</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81113-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08111379000261"></a>Before going into the substance of this technical order, I should perhaps explain how it fits as part of a wider package of orders coming forward. In addition to this affirmative order, there are also two orders subject to the negative resolution procedure before the House. The first, the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (Consequential Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2008, is similar in nature to this one save that it amends secondary legislation. The second, the Transfer of Housing Corporation Functions (Modifications and Transitional Provisions) Order 2008, transfers the existing functions of the Housing Corporation to the HCA and the TSA. All of these orders are linked in timing to the commencement of Section 5 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. There is nothing special about Section 5, other than that it is the first section that we have not yet commenced. All being well, this will all come into effect on 1 December 2008.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08111379000262"></a>It was a great pleasure to take the Housing and Regeneration Bill through the House because of the tremendous amount of cross-party support for the main purposes of the Act&#151;the creation of the Homes and Communities Agency, bringing together investment and delivery, and the creation of a new regulator of social housing in line with the recommendations of the Cave report, <I>Every Tenant Matters</I>&#151;and the many interesting and constructive debates we had on issues around these central principles. Noble Lords may be aware that these new bodies have been created, albeit in very limited form for now so that they can, for example, appoint board members. This order will come into force when the main powers and functions are turned on by or transferred from the existing bodies&#151;the Commission for the New Towns, the Urban Regeneration Agency and the Housing Corporation&#151;to the new ones.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08111379000263"></a>The purpose of the majority of the amendments in this order is, quite simply, to update references to predecessor bodies and other references in existing Acts to ensure that these reflect the position once the HCA has been created and the predecessor bodies abolished. There is nothing pertinent to the regulator in this order. Where taxation matters are concerned, the intent is to leave the current position substantially unaltered. So the effect of these amendments, other than in the rewording of existing Acts, is extremely limited. They do not contain substantive policy issues; they are simply technical in nature. They effectively change the name of the relevant organisation to the HCA in legislation and they therefore pass the existing powers and functions from the URA, the CNT or the Housing Corporation to the HCA. The amendments are aimed, quite simply, at maintaining the status quo.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08111379000264"></a>I suspect that noble Lords&#151;especially those who were here at midnight last night&#151;would not thank me for going into the detail of every individual amendment and so, on balance, I will not do so unless I am bound to under challenge from noble Lords. I have a line-by-line explanation but I shall forego that. However, it provides an opportunity to briefly update the House on what has happened since the Bill left here, received Royal Assent and became an Act. I say again how much the Act was improved by the contributions of this House, for which I was very grateful.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08111379000265"></a>Following on from that, work has continued apace to ensure that the HCA and the TSA can be up and running on 1 December 2008, four months ahead of the date originally planned. This work has included developing the necessary secondary legislation: the first commencement order, which allowed, among other things, the HCA and TSA to appoint board members, was laid in September; this affirmative order and the two negative orders that Parliament is currently considering; and a second commencement order giving the HCA the bulk of its powers and responsibilities is currently being prepared and is expected to be laid before the end of this month in time for 1 December.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08111379000266"></a>The HCA and TSA chairs, boards and senior management are in place. The HCA has conducted, and will continue to conduct, a series of regional stakeholder events setting out how the HCA will work and deliver. I am very impressed by the way in which Sir Bob Kerslake has involved the entire staff of the HCA in the formulation of the new body. It has been a very open and energetic process and is thoroughly to be commended.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08111379000267"></a>The department&#146;s sponsorship arrangements are being finalised and staff are being appointed. The various necessary pieces of corporate documentation for both agencies are either agreed or in the final stages of being agreed. The continuity of transferring CLG programmes has been safeguarded by 42 staff agreeing to transfer on secondment to the HCA, and those secondments vary in length between a few months and three years. HR and payroll systems are in place for both agencies and, where appropriate, have been tested. Arrangements are in place for the physical transfer of staff and data. Also with a view to a smooth transition to the new organisation, the HCA finance and IT systems have been tested successfully. The TSA financial systems are in place and are fully operational.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08111379000268"></a>To achieve the benefits expected from it, therefore, the HCA will need to create a truly single agency from its component parts, which also means a single culture. That process will start immediately after 1 December with the development of a new regional structure for the agency and will include a wholesale review of the agency&#146;s accommodation requirements and continuing work to create a distinctive culture for the HCA.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08111379000269"></a>The benefits offered by the HCA are already evident in the department&#146;s developing a response to changing market conditions. I shall take a few moments to talk about this because it is such an important part of what will be done. The HCA&#146;s scale and the flexibility that comes from having housing and regeneration programmes delivered by the single agency are valuable additions to our policy armoury. Further benefits will flow in the next CSR period when it may be possible to redesign existing programmes to fully exploit the synergies that are available from the single agency.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08111379000270"></a>The HCA is coming into being in a very different context from that in which it was conceived. To pick up the point made last night by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, we are looking at a very different situation. There is unlikely to be any area of the HCA&#146;s business that is unaffected by the credit crunch. House purchasers and house builders and developers are unable to access  


<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_818"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 818</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the funding they need, and activity is slowing markedly. The scale and speed of the downturn in the housing market have been striking. In the context of a wider economic downturn, the role of the HCA is likely to be significant. There continues to be a significant gap between supply and rising demand for new homes, and the HCA will be central to addressing that gap.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08111379000271"></a>To support that, the Government are pressing ahead with the reforms that are needed to focus on the long term and condition the market and industry for growth, including repackaging surplus public sector sites and ensuring better infrastructure co-ordination. The HCA will obviously have a key role to play in that, as it will in the administration of HomeBuy Direct and the purchase of developer stock, both of which form key planks of the Government&#146;s response to the current economic downturn.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08111379000272"></a>As a means of delivering in this changed climate, the HCA has identified its key immediate priorities as having a close understanding of what is happening on the ground now and likely to happen in the near future, adopting a proactive, flexible and creative approach to ensure that as much market activity as possible can continue, and developing new approaches to broadening the base of providers and accessing new sources of finance. As a means of delivering against those priorities, the HCA is therefore developing plans to find effective ways of focusing on the delivery of social and affordable housing and housing supply; working closely with the RDAs on regeneration projects that are most at risk or in danger of stalling; making sure that money invested in regeneration and infrastructure assists in job creation; working as flexibly as possible with the housing developers by, for example, releasing smaller parcels of land, even if that is marginally less cost-effective; working with the financial sector to find new ways of funding that can help unlock the supply of homes; supporting local authorities and regions in their role in housing delivery, regeneration and development; developing, as quickly as practicable, original and innovative solutions and working flexibly to maximise the synergies across the programmes so that every penny counts; and involving local people and communities to make sure that its investment solutions are wanted and deliver what is needed. The HCA has to do all that without ever losing sight of the need for long-term sustainable development to create high quality places and housing and help combat climate change.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08111379000273"></a>The implementation of these plans should enable the HCA to continue to deliver against its objectives throughout this period of economic turmoil and leave us well positioned for the world that emerges from the current economic conditions.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08111379000274"></a>I have taken the liberty of explaining a bit of the context in which the HCA is now working. I hope that noble Lords will find that helpful and will approve the order.</p>

To that extent, this is not particularly controversial. I am also grateful for her update on progress in the establishment of the Homes and Communities Agency and the housing regulator. It is good to know that that programme is going well, and the fact that it is likely to be completed ahead of the original schedule is a matter of satisfaction to everyone who has been involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08111379000277"></a>The questions that derive from the information I have received relate to the Minister&#146;s summing-up of the changing circumstances in which the whole construction industry finds itself. Behind the regulation a cost-benefit analysis was done, which we have all received. I wonder if the Government have had any opportunity to review those figures in the light of the very different economy in which we are now working and, if so, what their conclusions might be.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08111379000278"></a>I am bound to say that I had some difficulty here, but that may be because I do not understand the statistical background in resolving the actual figures that the cost-benefit analysis appeared to reveal. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain to me how that work was done, if that is not too technical a question, and tell me whether any attempt has been made to update those figures in the light of the changed circumstances.</p>

I have only one question on the order and one closely related to it, which is certainly related to what both noble Lords have said.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08111379000281"></a>With regard to taxation matters, I think the words that were used were, &#147;the position is substantially unaltered&#148;. I am sorry; it has only just occurred to me to probe that. I do not know whether that means &#147;unaltered save for title&#148;, or whether there is anything more. I think the phrase, &#147;leaving everyone as far as possible in a tax-neutral position&#148; was also used, which raises the question of what is not possible. Is that disadvantageous? I should perhaps be looking in a different direction for this question.</p>

<a name="81113-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08111379000282"></a>The Minister talked about the context of the order and referred to the rather different situation in which we now find ourselves, even though it seems only five minutes ago that we finished the Housing and Regeneration Bill. Local authorities up and down the country are working on local economic recovery plans, and I wonder whether the Minister has anything more that she can add about ways in which the HCA is working and intends to work with local authorities, because not every one will be the same. Are the Government satisfied that the model that we created in a spirit of co-operation is actually the right one?</p>

We also have the capacity for innovation to work in different ways, whether it is with local housing companies and local authorities or the opportunities that local authorities are considering regarding funding for the purchase of stock from developers, for example. The Housing Corporation will be involved with local authorities in all the initiatives we have put in place to try to free up the housing market.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81113-0007.htm"/>


<a name="81113-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08111379000284"></a>As of 2 October, of the &#163;200 million a year marked for the purchase of stock from developers, the Housing Corporation has allocated &#163;72 million, which will deliver 2,160 affordable homes. That obviously involves close conversations with local authorities. There will be a premium on what we can do by way of innovation and social housing, because this is where it will bite most specifically.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08111379000285"></a>All the information I have received from the HCA shows that it wants to work as flexibly as possible and is open to good ideas. That means working as flexibly as possible with housing developers. I talked about releasing smaller parcels of land as well as looking at what else local authorities can do in their allocations policy and the way in which priority groups are coming forward with their housing needs. The HCA will also work closely with the regions on housing delivery. One needs to look at the sustained pressure for more homes as well as the obvious failure of developers to access the cash to do the start-ups. We are looking at clearer leadership, less fragmented funding and more effective partnership. All that will benefit relationships with the HCA.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para2"></a>

The views that I express are my own and not those of the committees, except to the extent that I quote what they say.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08111379000291"></a>Before going into detail, I have a comment on the commonly used phrase &#147;business plan not working&#148;. That is a description which applies to Bradford &amp; Bingley; it has been freely said that its business plan did not work. What meaning can we attach to the phrase? Both the constituent parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley were founded in 1851, and I think the meaning has probably been the same since 1851. It is risky to borrow short and to lend long. The reason why a mortgage finance company&#151;probably a better description of Bradford &amp; Bingley than a bank&#151;does this is to try to achieve interest differentials which favour its profit and loss account. But the process is risky, and if the short-term market dries up, what then? Presumably, it is something along these lines that happened to Bradford &amp; Bingley, although, as will become clear as I bring out other points, we are very short of information.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08111379000292"></a>During the passage through the House in February of the Act dealing with Northern Rock, there was controversial discussion of Section 2(2)(a), on which the Treasury relies for the power to do what it has done to Bradford &amp; Bingley. There were suggestions that the power was too wide and that it went on for too long, but there it is in the Act. It is under that section that the Treasury has taken the draconian action of confiscating the shares in Bradford &amp; Bingley and simultaneously transferring property for &#163;612 million to Abbey Santander. Into this story so far, the company itself, the board and the staff do not seem to have come. There has not been much in the public domain about discussions with the company, what the board thought about those discussions and what would happen to the staff. That is in sharp contrast to Northern Rock. Yet the Government have frequently said that they do not wish to manage banks. But they have sold off the continuing business and left themselves with the run-off of the existing book. That was all done on 29 September, in a great hurry.</p>

<ul><a name="08111379000413"></a>&#147;10 days ago, we had to deal with the problems at Bradford and Bingley. We transferred the savings business, the branches and the related jobs&#148;&#151;</ul>

There was not much that was urgent about it; there certainly was no hint that there was a serious threat to the financial stability of the United Kingdom. This takes one back to what was said when the Act went through and when these powers were taken.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08111379000296"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, whom I am pleased to see in his place, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08111379000398"></a>&#147;I emphasise again that the powers that we are taking are triggered only in the most extreme circumstances&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/2/08; col. 293.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000363"></a>On the 19 February, the Chancellor had gone rather further. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="08111379000399"></a>&#147;There must be a serious threat to the stability of the financial system before the powers are exercised. That is a high test to be met, and the action must be proportionate. The Treasury must consider alternatives. The circumstances go way beyond simply a threat to depositors&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/2/08; col. 175.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000364"></a>That is the background.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08111379000297"></a>I deal now with the concerns of the Delegated Powers Committee. The House will remember that the committee thought that an order such as this should be subject to the affirmative, and not to the negative, procedure. The chairman of the committee, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made at Second Reading of the Banking (Special Provisions) Bill on 20 February, at cols. 210-11 of <I>Hansard</I>, a detailed and strong representation to the House that the order should be affirmative. Circumstances seem to have proved the committee to be right, because such action as has been taken with Bradford &amp; Bingley requires explanation and debate. Indeed, if the situation on 29 September was so urgent and threatening, one could argue that Parliament should have been recalled. Given that it was not, what permitted the holding-over of the situation until 6 October? As events have shown, the procedure should have been affirmative. Perhaps there was, and still is, some mismatch between what was said in February and what happened in September. In these times, when confidence is vital, it is not good for the Government to have said one thing some months ago and then to do another later.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08111379000298"></a>I turn to the Merits Committee. This is a long and complicated statutory instrument, considered on 7 October and reported on on 9 October. The committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08111379000400"></a>&#147;This Order is drawn to the special attention of the House on the ground that it gives rise to issues of public policy likely to be of interest to the House&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000365"></a>Otherwise, all that the committee could do was to describe what was set out in the statutory instrument, because the Explanatory Memorandum and the regulatory impact assessment were short and sketchy.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08111379000299"></a>What did we learn from the two documents? We learnt basically that the Treasury considered that it had the power to do what it was doing under Section 2(2)(a) of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act and has done it. There were only three new things in the two documents. The first was the phrase in the Explanatory Memorandum, &#147;temporary public ownership&#148;. We knew what that meant in relation to Northern Rock, because it was to be a continuing business, eventually to be sold back into the private sector. It is not the same with Bradford &amp; Bingley. It  


<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_823"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 823</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be interesting to know what the Minister thinks the phrase &#147;temporary public ownership&#148; means in current circumstances.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08111379000300"></a>The second new thing was the appearance of the Financial Services Authority on the scene. The regulatory impact assessment states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08111379000415"></a>&#147;the Financial Services Authority has determined that a deposit taker is no longer meeting its threshold conditions for authorisation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000366"></a>That no doubt referred to Northern Rock. There was no detail or argument as to how that was connected with the decision to take Bradford &amp; Bingley into public ownership. I thank the Library for looking for the FSA&#146;s determination with the best of its ability, which is greater than mine&#151;I looked for it, too. We eventually received an answer from the FSA which stated that, for commercial reasons, its determination was not available to the public, nor to Parliament.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08111379000301"></a>The third new thing was the business plan. The RIA stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08111379000401"></a>&#147;The government will put in place arrangements for a business plan to be developed for the remainder of Bradford &amp; Bingley plc&#146;s business&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000367"></a>That is a pretty conditional statement. A competent administration team for a run-off of a mortgage book would probably take about seven days, possibly 10, to work out a business plan, but, six weeks later, we have heard nothing but a short announcement that Sir Philip Hampton and Mr Kingman will get round to it later with the independent board of Bradford &amp; Bingley, about which we know nothing.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08111379000302"></a>Much was missing from the Explanatory Memorandum and the RIA. There was nothing much on Part 5; there was nothing at all on Parts 6, 7 and 8. Part 6 relates to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which is an important part of what is being done. There was no description of the potential cost. As we saw earlier, on 6 October the Chancellor made reference to the sharing of cost, and it must have been to the relationship with the FSCS that he was referring.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08111379000303"></a>The Chancellor said also that it was the Treasury&#146;s duty to consider other options. All that the Treasury said to us about that was that the Government had considered a number of other options, including other expressions of interest from the private sector, and that it considered this to be the best solution. It gave no detail at all, not even a minimum description of what other options it had considered or a reason for its deciding that they were not suitable.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08111379000304"></a>The two documents are unsigned and no Minister is named, which is completely outside all practice for the submission of statutory instruments to Parliament and through the Merits Committee. Was nobody willing to sign? The central issue is why the Treasury considered it right just to record its power under Section 2(2)(a), but saw no need to give evidence for its view. Even the Treasury can be wrong. Nor is it self-evident, given the facts, that it has the power.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08111379000305"></a>Bradford &amp; Bingley has a &#163;42 billion book and about a 3.5 per cent share of the mortgage market. The book was surely not,</p>
<ul><a name="08111379000416"></a>&#147;a serious threat to the financial system of the UK&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_824"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 824</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08111379000368"></a>If it was thought to be so, I ask how&#151;of course, in some sense, it still is. Bradford &amp; Bingley&#146;s &#163;20 billion of retail deposits in the UK and the Isle of Man were held by 2.7 million retail depositors with an average deposit of &#163;7,500. I repeat what the Chancellor said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08111379000402"></a>&#147;The circumstances go way beyond simply a threat to depositors&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/2/08; col. 175.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08111379000369"></a>Were the depositors threatened anyway? How many of them had deposits of more than &#163;35,000? After a wait of only three or four days, the figure increased to &#163;50,000. It does not seem that the depositors were threatened, and there were no queues as far as I know at the Bradford &amp; Bingley offices.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08111379000306"></a>What was actually happening to Bradford &amp; Bingley? By then, the banking crisis was in full view, which was not the case when the legislation was passed last February. Bradford &amp; Bingley relied to too great an extent&#151;unwisely, as it turned out&#151;on wholesale money. But surely it was more a victim of the circumstances than a threat. Its size was small, and the problems of the banking system were very large. The sums of money being quoted and the whole scheme at the beginning of October for the bailout of the banks was in figures that were way beyond anything that Bradford &amp; Bingley could bring to bear on the financial stability of the United Kingdom. We need an explanation of the judgment that on 29 September Bradford &amp; Bingley triggered the purpose of the Act, which is,</p>
<ul><a name="08111379000417"></a>&#147;maintaining the stability of the UK financial system in circumstances where the Treasury consider that there would be a serious threat to its stability if the order were not made&#148;.</ul>

I declare that I sit on the same Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee with him that has given rise to the questions he raised. In this matter, he is absolutely right in his analysis that circumstances did not justify, under the criteria set by the original order, the draconian action being imposed on Bradford &amp; Bingley in this case.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08111379000309"></a>I shall go back a further stage to suggest, as I have believed for a very long time, that the Government have been fundamentally wrong, root and branch, in their perception of how to mount a rescue of these banks that have gone into trouble since the days when the Northern Rock issue first crossed the horizon. Although the Bradford &amp; Bingley is significantly less of a danger than Northern Rock was at the time, I still thought that the better solution for Northern Rock, and the right course of action for the bank, would have been to proceed down the path of regarding it as a conventional business workout and place it in the hands of an expert bank that could undertake this work along the lines of the Lloyds Bank proposal at that time. Today, that looks as though it would have been infinitely the cheapest solution available to the taxpayers in resolving that problem. It would also not have created the atmosphere of banking panic and crisis which eventually swept up Bradford &amp; Bingley in  


<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_825"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 825</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its wake. I feel very strongly that the Government developed an appetite which then grew on that it did feed upon; they decided that they liked getting control of banks and that Bradford &amp; Bingley became another vulnerable one that they could sweep up on the way.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08111379000310"></a>I shall not go down the same erudite and precise course of analysis that my noble friend did, because he has said it all and said it very well. However, I shall add two thoughts not so far aired in this House arising from this crisis and bring them to the attention of the Minister responsible for banking activities.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08111379000311"></a>First, to go back to the real core origin of the crisis, I suggest that it lies in the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which came in after the second coming of the Wilson Government and was brought about by the fact that, in the first coming of that Government, they relied very heavily on hire-purchase controls as the means of taking the heat out of the economy. In doing so, they inadvertently wrecked the British motor industry, leading to the formation of British Leyland and, eventually, to the bankruptcy of that business. In the course of that, they moved the Japanese market share of British car sales from 3 per cent to 22 per cent in a year, which gave rise to a massive impact on the balance of payments adversely to this country, which has never been corrected or repaired.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08111379000312"></a>The Government went to Professor Goode of London University and asked him to come up with a completely new credit package that could be translated into law, which came out eventually as the Consumer Credit Act. The banks did not like it very much because it did not give them any asset-backing security for the loans that they were making, which is what gave rise in turn to the creation of second mortgages, or sticking the additional finance for a car on the back of a house loan. That tended to give a huge emphasis to the importance of accruing values for houses as the only means of financing both the domestic economy and personal needs, and &#147;taking the waiting out of wanting&#148;, in the dreadful phrase of the time.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08111379000313"></a>As time went on, the banks realised that by putting the credit for a motor car at a few thousand pounds into the back of a house loan, they were not doing as well as they had done in the old days of hire-purchase, because they could have charged higher and got a bigger profit out of it. So they decoupled the arrangement and started to work on the basis of a specific second mortgage, to which they could apply a different set of turns and rates. However, they went a stage further&#151;and here is where I would like the Minister to give very careful thought. They separated the methodology by which they analysed the profitability of a loan, separating the interest from the capital repayment portion of each instalment.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08111379000314"></a>At that time, the banks relied on a ludicrous method called the rule of 78th, which is what you get if you take the months of the year from one to 12 and add them together. If you then take the months of the year and write them down in reverse against the one to 12, you get 13 against one, and so on. They decided that if, for example, you had &#163;200 a month to pay back to a bank under one of these arrangements and you paid back &#163;600 after three months, you had not paid back a quarter of the interest in that time. They added the 12,  


<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_826"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 826</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>11 and 10 together, which came to 33, and expressed that as a percentage of the total 78, which gave them something like 42 per cent&#151;which meant that 42 per cent of the &#163;600 that they had collected in three months gave them &#163;240 of interest, which they claimed as their profit. That also had the disadvantage for the borrower that he still owed a higher proportion of capital, which was very unfair and has remained unfair ever since.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08111379000315"></a>From that position to what we have now, we have reached a situation in which banks that were created as banks after the demutualisation of the building societies went down this path and were able to show a massive advance in profitability, arising in comparison with conventional clearing street banks, because they were using this old hire-purchase-type profit extraction formula. As a result, the stock market loved them, rights issues were snapped up, money flooded in and a disproportionate amount of money came in to the least responsible, newest and most inexperienced arm of the banking community and drove it up to the point where it unbalanced the national economy by creating purchasing power with what was really false money. It did not exist; it was being put up and subscribed on a myth.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08111379000316"></a>I suggest to the Minister that one of his first priorities should be to discuss with the Accounting Standards Board the methodology by which a single formula could be established for the extraction of the profit content of all lendings and repayments, whether for clearing banks or building societies. In future, we could take the heat out of the overgrowth of the secondary banking market and never have this awful situation occur again. That would be the first and biggest thing to take us out of the boom and bust cycle that could be done by this Government, which they have not done so far.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08111379000317"></a>Secondly, I suggest that one thing could have been done very simply a long time ago, which should now be done. We should ask the auditing profession to do a little more to earn its money. It gets very well paid and it could do one thing for us all that could very well save us from having this panic-stricken crisis situation occur again. That is, we should ask them in all audit certificates in future ever signed on behalf of a lending institution of any sort&#151;and on behalf of anyone in, say, the <I>Times</I> top 1,000 as well&#151;to have a certified working capital certificate for 12 months from the date of the signing of the audit certificate. That certificate should make it clear that it has been reviewed and assessed in the context of the known business plans of that company concerned. It would not have stopped Northern Rock going bust, but it would have given us a year in advance to decide what to do about that while we decided what the industry could do to save it.</p>

<a name="81113-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08111379000318"></a>I make those two recommendations. My noble friend has given a very reasonable argument why this provision was wrong on this occasion, but none of us would be here today if we had had those two changes in the law previously.</p>

I am also grateful to the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee for its important work on the instrument.

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08111379000322"></a>Before I respond to the points raised in the debate, it may be helpful if I set out the record of how we got to this point. Following extraordinary turbulence in global financial markets, Bradford &amp; Bingley found itself under increasing pressure as investors and lenders lost confidence in its ability to carry on as an independent institution. The noble Viscount asked what we meant by &#147;the business plan not working&#148;. We simply mean that the business plan which hitherto had worked was no longer working because of a serious loss of confidence in the institution on the part of those placing deposits with it.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08111379000323"></a>On Saturday, 27 September, the Financial Services Authority determined that Bradford &amp; Bingley no longer met its threshold conditions for operating as a deposit taker under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and the FSA&#146;s own rules. At that point, the Government, on the advice of the FSA and the Bank of England, in accordance with established tripartite practice, acted immediately to maintain financial stability and protect depositors while minimising the exposure of taxpayers.

Quite frankly, to have detailed with any precision those discussions, while it may have satisfied our curiosity and wish to better understand the circumstances here, would, in the judgment of the Government, have severely impeded the opportunity to have similar discussions should they be required at some further time in the future.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08111379000325"></a>The Government concluded that a transfer order under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 best delivered the Government&#146;s objectives of maintaining financial stability, protecting consumers and protecting the taxpayer. This action taken in relation to Bradford &amp; Bingley demonstrated that the Government stood by, and continue to stand by and ready, to do whatever is necessary to maintain the stability of the UK financial system, and confidence in that system.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08111379000326"></a>The noble Viscount quoted my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer as setting a high test for the exercise of such orders. I assure him and other noble Lords that in our judgment the circumstances here were such that a failure to take action to protect the interests of the depositors of Bradford &amp; Bingley and to reassure people that they could have confidence in the British banking system would have had adverse consequences had we not taken that action. The fact that there were no queues outside Bradford &amp; Bingley does not mean that this was not a serious situation. The fact that there were no queues is largely a consequence of the decisive action taken by the tripartite authorities.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08111379000327"></a>That is how Bradford &amp; Bingley got to this point. I thank the noble Viscount for his erudite summary of the finances of that institution, in particular his important observation that this organisation had, with the benefit of hindsight, become overly dependent on wholesale deposits. Since 1851, Bradford &amp; Bingley had largely funded itself from its own retail deposits, but it changed its whole culture and business ethos as a consequence of or immediately after demutualisation. In so doing, it significantly increased its riskiness.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08111379000328"></a>As noble Lords are aware, the flexibility in the Banking (Special Provisions) Act allowed for an immediate transfer of Bradford &amp; Bingley into public ownership and for the onward transfer of the retail deposit business to Abbey National. That was crucial for maintaining financial stability and ensuring that customers retained access to their accounts. The noble Viscount described that as &#147;draconian&#148;. I would beg to suggest that most of Bradford &amp; Bingley's depositors were delighted that that action was taken in order to ensure that their interests were well protected and, in so doing, others could see that the interests of depositors with British institutions would be similarly protected in similar circumstances should that be required.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08111379000329"></a>This is the second order under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act since it was passed by Parliament in February this year. As noble Lords will remember, the Government used an order under the Act in February to transfer Northern Rock into temporary public ownership. Unlike that order, the Bradford &amp; Bingley transfer order which we are debating today exercises   


<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_829"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 829</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the power to make a further transfer following a transfer of a bank to the public sector. Let me summarise for noble Lords some of the key components of the transfer order.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08111379000330"></a>First, the order transferred Bradford &amp; Bingley into public ownership through the transfer to HM Treasury of the company&#146;s shares. Secondly, the order was used to transfer Bradford &amp; Bingley&#146;s UK and retail deposit business, its branch network and its shares in its Isle of Man subsidiary to Abbey National plc. The liabilities were backed by a contribution from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and the Treasury. The balance of Bradford &amp; Bingley&#146;s business remains in public ownership. That includes its mortgage book, personal loan book and headquarters.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08111379000331"></a>The decision to make the second transfer of the retail deposit business was based on the need to protect depositors in the then prevailing market conditions of a wholly private sector solution. As I explained to noble Lords, the authorities explored possibilities for a private sector solution. The Government concluded that Bradford &amp; Bingley was not sustainable to be run on a stand-alone basis in a circumstance where it had lost the confidence of depositors.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08111379000332"></a>Through the two transfers under this order, a stable resolution for the whole of the bank was achieved. It has been effective in enabling the Government to protect depositors and maintain financial stability. The transfer of the retail deposit business to Abbey National, a stable institution, was achieved without any disruption to customer service and maintained financial stability.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08111379000333"></a>The Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 also provides for a compensation order to be made. The Treasury will define a scheme for determining the amount of any compensation payable to the former shareholders and others who may have been affected by the transfer of shares into public ownership. To this end, the Treasury will lay a compensation order within three months of the transfer order, as defined in the Banking (Special Provisions) Act.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08111379000334"></a>I draw noble Lords&#146; attention to issues surrounding the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and the triggering of payments. Following the FSA&#146;s determination that Bradford &amp; Bingley was unable, or likely to be unable, to satisfy claims against it, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme was triggered. Therefore, under the transfer order, the FSCS paid out approximately &#163;14 billion to enable retail deposits held in Bradford &amp; Bingley and covered by the FSCS to be transferred to Abbey. The Treasury made a payment to Abbey for those retail deposit amounts not covered by the FSCS, amounting to approximately &#163;4 billion. That was the top-up over and above the maximum amount guaranteed by the FSCS. These amounts should be repaid by Bradford &amp; Bingley from the realisation of the assets of the remaining business. The company will pay down its liabilities to FSCS and HMT as it is wound down over time; that is to say, as assets are sold and mortgages are repaid by Bradford &amp; Bingley&#146;s customers.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08111379000335"></a>I draw noble Lords&#146; attention to the new Banking Bill and how it will affect similar situations, should they ever arise in the future.</p>

<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="08111379000337"></a><a name="81113-0008.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81113-0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08111379000586"></a>Lord Myners:</b> I thank the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, for that question. As I explained, that is the amount paid over and above the amount covered by the FSCS&#151;the guarantee of all retail deposits. In preparing the permanent replacement to the Banking (Special Provisions) Act, the Government have sought to refine and develop the powers in that Act. This has included extensive consultation with interested stakeholders. The new Banking Bill provides a package of permanent measures which we believe will be a significant improvement on those previously available to handle such a situation.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08111379000338"></a>In taking Bradford &amp; Bingley into public ownership, we put in place a number of additional controls to ensure that taxpayers&#146; interests were protected. The Treasury has published on its website a shareholder framework document with Bradford &amp; Bingley and I have laid a copy in the Library today. This framework document sets out an appropriate corporate governance structure for the day-to-day interactions between HM Treasury and the company and the people who will be managing the company. It sets out HM Treasury&#146;s delegations to the company and where the Treasury&#146;s approval is necessary to protect its interests in Bradford &amp; Bingley.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08111379000339"></a>As announced by the Chancellor, there will be no compulsory redundancies, other than the job cuts previously announced, for the six months following 29 September. However, we are working closely with Yorkshire Forward and other agencies to handle that situation as effectively as possible. Bradford &amp; Bingley is currently developing a business plan. I am in awe of the ability of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, to produce a business plan in seven days. I have some modest experience in business. However, the circumstances facing Bradford &amp; Bingley are such that a few more days than seven are probably required to produce a viable business plan for the business going forward. Particular care will be required because the business plan will need to satisfy European Commission state aid requirements. A state aid restructuring notification will be submitted to the Commission for approval within six months of the grant of emergency state aid; that is, by March 2009.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08111379000340"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, also referred to the establishment of UK Financial Investments under the chairmanship of Sir Philip Hampton, and the role that institution will play in overseeing the Government&#146;s investment in Bradford &amp; Bingley. I assure the noble Viscount that, from my perspective, the Government have no wish to manage banks or to have any more banks in their portfolio. However, the risks that we faced as a result of a collapse in confidence as a consequence of the global financial crisis were such that we clearly had to act in order to forestall further problems. Confidence is a fragile flower and if people believe that they cannot be confident in a UK deposit-taking institution, they will begin to query any other institution which they fear is at risk of not being able fully to honour its obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08111379000341"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, asked what we meant by temporary public ownership. The best answer I can give is, not in permanent public ownership; that is, we will, as our response to Bradford &amp; Bingley&#146;s business plan, and within the framework agreement that we are establishing between HMT and Bradford &amp; Bingley, fully explore all opportunities to realise value from ownership.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08111379000342"></a>The noble Lord, Lord James of Blackheath, provided the House with a most informed explanation with smatterings of Shakespearean quotations and historic perspective. I am indebted, as, I am sure, are many others, to the noble Lord for his explanation of the background to consumer credit legislation. I was pleased to be reminded about the rule of 78s, which I had forgotten. He made important points and invited me to consider accounting and auditing issues. I assure him that I will do so. I may well invite him to join me for further discussion on those matters. I respect his considerable knowledge on such matters.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08111379000343"></a>I should like to clarify for the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that the existing structures for regulation, supervision and the operation of the tripartite arrangements remain intact. From my perspective, the tripartite structure is architecturally sound and robust. In the case of Bradford &amp; Bingley, the opportunity for Government to be advised by both the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority certainly proved effective.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08111379000344"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, asked why the instrument was not signed. I hope that I may reply to him in writing on that as I am not fully advised on it. However, if this was an oversight, I apologise for those who failed to comply with the appropriate process.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08111379000345"></a>I hope that I have managed to cover the main points raised by noble Lords. If there are any that I have failed to cover, I will be more than happy to write with a full and complete explanation to those who have taken part in today&#146;s debate. In the circumstances, I hope that the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, will feel able to withdraw the Motion.</p>

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="08111379000346"></a><a name="81113-0008.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81113-0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08111379000587"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> My Lords, I thank those noble Lords who have participated. I hope that my noble friend Lord Howard considers that his question has been answered; no doubt if he did not, he would be able to look after himself.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08111379000347"></a>My noble friend Lord James has expertise in workouts. In that part of what he said, he was really saying that confidence was more damaged by the way in which the Bradford &amp; Bingley problems were dealt with than it would have been if it had been allowed to go into a conventional workout, given the fact that the depositors were, in the great main, guaranteed under the guarantee scheme. I think he was telling us that that would not have cost as much money in the long run. Indeed, we are still very short of any idea of how much this exercise is going to cost the taxpayer.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_832"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column 832</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81113-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08111379000348"></a>I am very grateful for the detailed exposition given by the Minister, which was part of my intention in holding the debate. We are going to be in a state of some disagreement, talking as a member of the Merits Committee, as to how much of that explanation could have perfectly properly been in the Explanatory Memorandum and the regulatory impact assessment. I venture to suggest to the Minister that the Treasury is a minimalist department in the matters of explanation and justification. Quite a lot of things could have been in there that would not have prejudiced any of the things that the Minister mentioned. Indeed, it is quite possible that public confidence would have been improved, rather than the reverse.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08111379000349"></a>I have three points. I got the impression from the Minister&#146;s statement that we may not be in run-off, because a business plan for a run-off is a totally different matter from a business plan for, if I may mention them, Marks &amp; Spencer or Courtaulds Textiles, of which I was chairman, which was Marks &amp; Spencer&#146;s largest supplier of clothing. We had to have a rather detailed business plan to live with Sir Richard Greenbury, who was the chairman at the time. A run-off of a mortgage book is not a very complicated matter. I have been responsible for mortgage finance companies in places as far apart as Hong Kong and Nairobi, and it is really not a complicated matter. If we are not going to be in run-off with Bradford &amp; Bingley, that is a different matter.</p>

<a name="81113-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08111379000350"></a>Finally, I appreciated the Minister&#146;s explanation, but I did not really get to know whether it was the Government&#146;s view that this was a serious or systemic threat to the stability of the United Kingdom financial system. Given everything else that was going on, and given the lack of confidence in Bradford &amp; Bingley that the market had expressed all through the summer&#151;it did not just come in September; it had been ongoing for quite a long time&#151;was this really the right way to deal with the matter? I suppose it is always possible that someone will test the proposition and seek evidence to try to determine whether there really was a serious threat on 27 September. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08111374000008"></a><a name="81113-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="81113-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08111374000055"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> In the early hours of Sunday 11 December 2005, a number of explosions occurred at Buncefield oil storage depot, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. At least one of the initial explosions was of massive proportions and there was a large fire, which engulfed a significant proportion of the site. More than 40 people were injured, although fortunately there were no fatalities. Damage occurred to both commercial and residential properties in the vicinity and a large area around the site was evacuated on emergency service advice. The fire burned for several days, destroying most of the site and emitting large clouds of black smoke into the atmosphere. The damage to the site and the escape of the stored fuel, plus large quantities of fire-fighting materials, resulted in contamination of the groundwater in the vicinity of the site by fuel, fuel-related contaminants and surfactants needed to control the fire.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08111374000009"></a>Following the explosion, a major incident investigation board (MIIB), independently chaired by Lord Newton of Braintree, was established and has overseen an extensive investigation into the causes of the accident and ways to avoid or mitigate similar incidents in the future. The MIIB has now published eight reports, four of which were progress reports, with the other four setting out findings and making recommendations concerning the design and operation of fuel storage sites; emergency preparedness for, response to and recovery from incidents; the explosion mechanism advisory group; and land use planning and the control of societal risk around major hazard sites. The recommendations are aimed mainly at site operators and the COMAH competent authority, but there are also recommendations for various government departments to consider arising out of the findings and recommendations on emergency preparedness and land use planning.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08111374000010"></a>I am pleased to announce to the House that I have today placed in its Library a report detailing the response of the Government and the competent authority to the MIIB reports on the design and operation of fuel storage sites<I></I>and on emergency preparedness for, response to and recovery from incidents.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08111374000011"></a>I would like to take this opportunity to thank Lord Newton and his board for their very thorough reports, which will lead to improved safety, environmental protection and resilience at and around major-hazard sites.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08111374000012"></a>Overall, I can report that good progress has been made against the recommendations. With regard to the MIIB report on design and operation of fuel storage sites, both the competent authority (comprising the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Environment Agency and Scottish Environment Protection Agency) and industry have acted promptly on the implementation of the recommendations, and this work has delivered real improvements in the prevention of major incidents.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS56"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column WS56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08111374000013"></a>On the second MIIB report, covering emergency preparedness for, response to and recovery from incidents, government organisations, notably the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) and the Cabinet Office, have responded to the challenge with a programme of action. As announced in the <I>National Security Strategy</I>, published in March 2008, the Cabinet Office has embarked in 2008 on a review of Part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act (CCA) 2004. Delivered through the CCA enhancement programme, the review will ensure that the CCA continues to provide a modern, consistent and effective platform for civil protection in the UK. The review will directly address relevant recommendations highlighted in the second MIIB report.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08111374000014"></a>The devolved Administrations have also been fully engaged. This is coupled with positive work at a local level to enhance the resilience and effectiveness of emergency response, supported by new guidance from the Government. I am pleased to see these improvements, and we are already better prepared for any future emergencies at major-hazard sites.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08111374000015"></a>I would also like to take this opportunity to update the House on recovery and regeneration in the Buncefield area, which I am pleased to say is progressing well, with substantial financial assistance from central government and the East of England Development Agency (EEDA). In conjunction with the local authority and key local stakeholders, EEDA is also developing innovative proposals to combine a series of significant funding programmes to help to finance major infrastructure improvements identified in the local masterplan as key to driving growth in the area. In terms of recovery, 22 million litres of contaminated firewater stored at Maple Lodge and Blackbirds sewage treatment works has been treated and disposed of safely. The remaining firewater was safely disposed of by high-temperature incineration earlier this year. A parcel of land adjacent to the Buncefield site is in the process of being sold and developers were invited to submit proposals to EEDA by September.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08111374000016"></a>With respect to regeneration, based on Dacorum Borough Council&#146;s programme of development, CLG has made a provisional award under the housing growth areas scheme for 2008-09 of &#163;2.71 million and an indicative provisional award of &#163;3.814 million for the period 2009-11. The East of England Development Agency has also provided &#163;4.5 million to date&#151;some &#163;2 million pre-incident&#151;and has pledged a further &#163;2 million of any public gap-funding required to enable phase one of the Maylands gateway masterplan to proceed. This includes funding for a Maylands partnership and recovery director as a focal point for recovery and regeneration activity and around &#163;1.8 million of funding for a business support centre. Industry has also contributed a substantial sum to the restoration of business activities and regeneration in the local area.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08111374000017"></a>EEDA is working closely with Dacorum Borough Council and local stakeholders, developing proposals to designate the area as a new town improvement district. If agreed, following a vote by local business, this will create a substantial funding stream beginning as early as April 2009, directly controlled by local businesses, to further fund local infrastructure investment.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08111374000024"></a>Today the Government are publishing the response to the consultation <I>Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007&#151;Relevant Third Party</I>. A relevant third party (RTP) is someone who can make an application on behalf of a victim of forced marriage without first requiring the permission of the court. Other applicants on behalf of a forced marriage victim must obtain the permission of the court.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08111374000025"></a>Responses to the consultation generally supported the use of local authorities in England and Wales to act as the RTP for victims of forced marriage under the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007. The Government agree with this view. When designated, local authorities will be able to make applications without the court&#146;s permission for forced marriage protection orders on behalf of someone who is or who has been forced into marriage.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08111374000026"></a>While we believe that local authorities are best placed to serve as RTPs, we recognise that the role that the voluntary sector plays is an important one and should be explored further. The success of the independent domestic violence advisers (IDVAs) has shown how the voluntary sector can play a strong support role in helping those who are the subject of domestic violence in the criminal courts. While IDVAs are currently limited to the criminal court, they have expertise in dealing with issues like forced marriage, are experienced multi-agency workers and work under an accredited scheme. Therefore, we will also carry out a pilot using a local IDVA scheme as a RTP. If this proves successful, we would look at extending the RTP provisions more widely across IDVAs as well as other voluntary sector organisations.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08111374000027"></a>The Lord Chancellor may make an order specifying a person or description of persons who may act as a relevant third party under Section 63C of the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007. An order will not be made until local authorities are sufficiently prepared to act as RTPs, having ensured that they will operate within an appropriate framework and in accordance with guidelines that help to safeguard the best interests of the victim.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08111374000028"></a>During the time it will take for this to occur, it will be possible for anyone, including local authorities, to apply on behalf of a victim if they obtain the court&#146;s permission. This will ensure that victims of forced marriage can obtain the protection of the court where they cannot apply for a forced marriage protection order themselves. The court&#146;s scrutiny of an application for permission to apply for an order will ensure that the victim&#146;s best interests are safeguarded.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="08111374000030"></a><a name="81113-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><b><a name="81113-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="08111374000057"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> I have today published an addendum to the Department for Transport&#146;s consultation on proposed amendments to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 (SI 3072) to slow down the rate of increase of the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) and to add two new fuels to the renewable fuels eligible for certificates under the scheme, launched on 15 October. This addendum proposes additional amendments to rectify a discrepancy recently identified in the 2007 order and to delete provisions from the order as a consequence of changes to the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 made by the Finance Act 2008.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08111374000031"></a>The discrepancy concerns the definition of relevant hydrocarbon oil in the order. This definition identifies the category of fossil fuel which must be taken into account when determining whether a supplier is subject to the RTFO and, if so, how many certificates showing supply of renewable fuel the supplier must produce. The intention was that the definition of relevant hydrocarbon oil should include fossil fuel that is blended  


<notus-date day="13" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS59"></a><b>13 Nov 2008 : Column WS59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with biodiesel or bioethanol as well as fossil fuel that is supplied unblended; this is how the order has been interpreted by the Renewable Fuels Agency and suppliers. However, the current drafting of the definition does not include fossil fuel that is blended with biodiesel or bioethanol before it passes the point at which the requirement to pay duty takes effect. This means that only fossil fuel that is supplied separately from biodiesel or bioethanol or is blended after it passes the duty point can be counted.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08111374000032"></a>The addendum that I have published today proposes additional changes to the 2007 order to rectify this discrepancy so that the fossil fuel component of bioblend and bioethanol blend supplied from the beginning of the next RTFO obligation period, April 2009, will count towards the obligation. Due to the constraints of the primary legal powers, we will not be able to amend the order retrospectively to change the definition for this obligation year and the department is advising fuel suppliers of this fact.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08111374000033"></a>The consultation period for the addendum is shorter than normal and ends on 17 December, the date when the consultation launched on 15 October ends. Any amendments to the RTFO order are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and the shorter consultation period is necessary to ensure that the amendments can be included in a single draft order that can be laid and debated in Parliament before it is made to come into force in April 2009. The nature of the amendments is such that a shorter consultation period is appropriate. The amendments to deal with the discrepancy give effect to what was previously thought to be the meaning of the order and the other amendments are purely consequential and do not change the meaning of the order.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08111374000034"></a>The content of this addendum does not affect any of the other issues that are the subject of the consultation launched on 15 October&#151;proposals on slowing down the rate of increase of the RTFO and on the addition of two new eligible renewable fuels under the scheme. The Government remain committed to ensuring that UK biofuels policy promotes development of a sustainable biofuels industry, by proceeding with caution until the wider environmental and social impacts of biofuels are better understood.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08111374000038"></a>In June, we launched the National Challenge, backed with new resources of &#163;400 million to transform schools where less than 30 per cent of young people gain five or more higher-level GCSEs, including English and mathematics. I would like to pay tribute to the way in which local authorities and schools have drawn up plans to support sustainable improvements in individual schools. I am pleased to announce that I have today agreed proposals for National Challenge improvement plans in 48 local authorities. Two local authorities, Bristol and Lincolnshire, are already in a position to outline their plans today.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08111374000039"></a>I welcome the way in which many local authorities, in consultation with school heads and governors, are now bringing forward imaginative and ambitious proposals including transformational plans for new academies and National Challenge trusts. These plans also include support for improvements in teaching; for more high-level teaching assistants; for individual help to meet children&#146;s learning needs; and to support stronger middle and senior leadership. They are all designed to meet particular schools&#146; needs according to their particular context. We are continuing discussions with other authorities about the funding packages necessary to support their National Challenge schools, and I will update the House in due course.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08111374000040"></a>While it is right that we give extra support to those schools with the lowest results and facing the most challenging circumstances, there are other schools where, despite higher GCSE results, pupils do not fulfil their earlier promise and could achieve much more. Such &#147;coasting&#148; schools have not yet done enough to realise their pupils&#146; potential.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08111374000041"></a>Every child has the right to a good education that stretches them and helps them to realise their full potential. That is why today I am publishing a strategy to help these schools to raise their game and to kick-start improvement in schools that are coasting. This strategy will be supported by funding of up to &#163;40 million to bring about improvements in these schools.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08111374000042"></a>We will be asking local authorities to identify and work with the schools that they consider to be &#147;coasting&#148;. These are schools that have shown too little improvement in attainment and progression over a period of years. They are schools that may be achieving good enough GCSE results to earn a reasonable reputation but whose performance conceals poor progress, sometimes among its more able pupils and sometimes among those who face additional barriers to learning such as SEN. Schools like this need and respond well to challenge, but they have not always had it. They are not performing badly enough to receive an inadequate judgment from Ofsted, or to risk significant numbers of parents choosing to send their children to another school. None the less, they should be achieving better outcomes for all their pupils and providing a more exciting and challenging learning experience.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08111374000043"></a>We know what the very best schools do to make significant improvements. They do not rest on their laurels; they are characterised by a &#147;we can do better than this&#148; attitude. They set ambitious targets for their pupils and monitor their progress, and if pupils fall off trajectory they intervene to put them back on course. This focus on progression is backed up by a personalised

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08111374000044"></a>Every partner will have their role to play in this strategy and we want to focus the attention of parents, governors, heads and local authorities on what they should be expecting their school to achieve. We want to raise expectations of parents and empower them to challenge schools to deliver the very best for their child. We will work with local authorities to identify the schools that could benefit from this programme and engage with parents, head teachers and governing bodies to take the action needed to challenge these schools to improve. If schools do not improve, we will step up the level of challenge and expect local authorities to use their existing intervention powers.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08111374000045"></a>We will be offering these schools the support from other schools and leaders who have the experience of raising performance in their own schools to help them to unlock their potential. Schools in the programme will also have access to additional funding to form trusts and federations should they want to formalise the benefits of collaborative working. Extra funding for schools to draw down additional resource will also be made available, as will training to improve their assessment for learning, tracking pupils&#146; progress in order to inform future planning and teaching. We will also support schools to provide high-quality after-school study to re-engage those pupils, particularly those with SEN, who have become bored and demotivated. All this will be brokered by school improvement partners, further empowered through additional training and an extra four days per year to drive improvement in these schools.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08111374000046"></a>This strategy is a key part of the 10-year vision in the <I>Children&#146;s Plan</I> to make this country the best place in the world for children and young people to grow up. It is part of our drive to deliver the ambition that we outlined in the <I>Children</I><I>&#146;</I><I>s Plan</I> and continued with the National Challenge: the ambition to raise attainment and aspirations, narrow the gap and ensure educational excellence for everyone.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08111374000048"></a>The Government are taking action today to counter tax avoidance schemes involving the leasing of plant or machinery.</p>

<a name="81113-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08111374000049"></a>Action is being taken against schemes that have been disclosed to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) under the avoidance disclosure regulations and which:</p>
involve the lease or sale and leaseback of plant or machinery to obtain relief for more than the original cost of the asset;seek to avoid tax on the granting of a long funding lease; andinvolve the sale of a company that is an intermediate lessor of plant or machinery.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08111374000050"></a>In addition, the Government are taking action to remedy a technical defect in the Capital Allowances Act that could lead to a loss of tax when a long funding lease ends.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08111374000051"></a>The Government have also become aware that partnerships that have in the past invested in films are attempting to avoid tax by means of converting existing leases into long funding leases of plant or machinery.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08111374000052"></a>This continued abuse of the tax rules on leased plant and machinery and by film partnerships is unfair on the majority of taxpayers, who comply fully with their tax obligations, and can undermine the funding of public services.

For example, in England and Wales the average cost per prisoner in a male dispersal prison (category A) is more than double the cost in a male open prison.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="08111375000020"></a>The Northern Ireland Prison Service is substantially smaller than that in England and Wales and the scope for benefiting from economies of scale is considerably less. Staffing levels are higher due to complexity and inefficient building designs. In addition, salaries are historically higher in Northern Ireland due to the management of terrorist prisoners. Steps are being taken to align salaries to those paid elsewhere.</p>
