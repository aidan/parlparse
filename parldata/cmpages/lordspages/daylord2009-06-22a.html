Funding for all forms of stem cell research has doubled from about &#163;30 million in 2005-06 to more than &#163;60 million in 2007-08. Support comes from the research councils, regional development agencies, the Department of Health and devolved Administrations, and from investments to catalyse business innovation by the Technology Strategy Board. The Government also provide indirect support in the form of infrastructure costs and public engagement.</p>

Is my noble friend aware that last month some leading scientists in stem cell research dealing with multiple sclerosis met in London? They felt that Britain had made great progress but that we would lose the advantages we had gained if we did not allocate some of the stem cell research money to multiple sclerosis. Will my noble friend consider that as a possible way forward?</p>

Stem cell research has huge potential to address some of the most debilitating and awful conditions that face people. However, the science is challenging and decisions about the allocation of funding on stem cell research, like all forms of government scientific research funding, are made through the peer review process under the Haldane principle where Ministers do not interfere in judgments about which projects to support. However, we recognise that the leadership that the UK has achieved in stem cell research, in part through the excellent regulatory framework which this House has contributed to form, is one in which we need to continue to invest.</p>

Is it not the case that there are more than 80 treatments worldwide and 300 clinical trials using adult stem cells and yet this country collects less than 0.2 per cent of stem-cell rich blood cord compared with 20 per cent in Greece, 18 per cent in Spain and 12 per cent in Portugal? Is this not something that we should be putting our resources into?</p>

We believe that this is a fast-moving field of research whereby we have to maintain investment in all forms of stem cells&#151;adult, embryonic, induced and pluripotent&#151;and that that requires us to be open minded about the pace at which development can take place in them all. We have to recognise that the field of adult stem cell research has been in existence since the 1950s whereas embryonic research has been with us only since the 1990s. It is therefore too early to judge whether that field has a full potential to be realised. The noble Lord&#146;s point about the collection of blood from human cords is a fair one, which I shall look into further.</p>

How far does he think that that, and in particular the recruitment and retention of scientists, might be under threat as a result of the rather more liberal attitude taken by the Obama Government towards such research?</p>

Because of the approach that we have adopted, with a combination of investment in research, world-class science and the regulatory framework that our Parliament has provided, the United Kingdom has the world lead in that area.</p>

<a name="90622-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09062210000009"></a>The fact that the United States has now recognised the full potential means that we have to continue to invest. We also need to explore collaborations with the United States; for example, to build on the existing memorandum of research understanding that we have with the state of California and develop that into collaborations with the whole of the United States. We are actively pursuing that.</p>

Notwithstanding that arm&#146;s length relationship, can the noble Lord assure us that, when grants are given for stem cell research&#151;or, indeed, for any other very high-technology research&#151;every opportunity and encouragement are given to the researchers to talk broadly and publicly about their research so as to gain public support for what they do?</p>

Therefore, we are encouraging scientists to do that by reflecting on how scientific research is judged, through the new research excellence framework, taking into account their engagement in public debate for their science.</p>

Therefore, these matters need to be kept in balance. It is the responsibility of the scientific community to avoid hype when talking about the potential of their science. We take that very seriously within Government.</p>

<a name="90622-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09062210000014"></a>As I have already mentioned, we see a balance of research funding at the moment that is approximately 50:50 between adult and embryonic research. The balance is a judgment for the scientific communities, not for Ministers. Through the peer-review process and the excellence of science, we have the structures to get that balance right.</p>

We have more than doubled the science budget and, within that, over the past few years we have seen our research budget allocated to stem cell research more than double. While investing in the underpinning components that maintain Britain&#146;s excellence in science, it is not for Ministers to judge which science is backed. That is for the research community itself under the long established peer review process.</p>

Restoring transport services is important to everyone, but the priorities must be to preserve life and public safety, to deal sensitively with any fatalities, and to collect evidence. The Government do not issue operational guidance, but we encourage emergency services and transport authorities to work together on how to deal with accidents and minimise disruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09062210000019"></a>In an accident, no one objects to traffic being held up to rescue the injured. However, where there is a clear fatality&#151;say a suicide on the railways, however tragic that may be in personal terms&#151;should not the emphasis be on restarting traffic to enable those affected to continue their travel and their lives, as it were, rather than having a lengthy and laborious scene-of-crime investigation?</p>

<a name="90622-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09062210000021"></a>I have great sympathy with the point that the noble Lord makes. The British Transport Police, which is primarily responsible for dealing with the sort of incident on the railway to which he refers, has a remarkably good record in getting lines open again. It has a target of 90 minutes; last year it exceeded that and achieved a reopening time of 76 minutes, and I am told that it hopes to do better again this year.</p>

<a name="90622-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09062210000022"></a>The police have to be absolutely certain that no crime has been committed before they can reopen the roads, and have to work with the other emergency services. It is important, particularly in the hours of darkness, that evidence is not lost because of a too hasty opening of the operation. If it is possible to improve co-ordination between the emergency services, we should look at that, and we can always do better.</p>

Can my noble friend&#151;I, too, congratulate him on his well merited appointment&#151;tell the House why, when deaths occur regularly on our roads, there appears to be no equivalent independent investigation to that which would follow a train accident death to see what lessons can be learnt and what remedial action can be taken to avoid a recurrence? Is it not in the interests of safety that we put an end to the culture that road deaths are somehow an inevitable aspect of that form of transport?</p>

He is absolutely right: as a country, we accept all too unthinkingly the 3,000 deaths a year that occur on our roads, but when an incident occurs on our railway&#151;it would obviously be a much higher profile incident&#151;there is enormous media attention. The emphasis must be on reducing the number of road casualties and getting the country much less used to believing that it is acceptable to kill and injure the number of people who currently suffer from road accidents.</p>

Does he not agree that there would be a lot of benefit in rationalising the roles of some of those organisations so that the work was done more quickly? Is he aware that there was a suspected fatality between Didcot and Reading recently, where a man was seen lying beside the track and trains were delayed for many hours? It turned out that the man was asleep and drunk and then just walked away.</p>

It occurred on 20 May alongside the track at Pangbourne. A gentleman had, indeed, had too much drink at lunchtime and lay down to sleep alongside the line. The driver of a passing train thought that he had seen a body and quite rightly the line was closed and the police investigated. As the police arrived, he got up and staggered away. On that occasion, the line was reopened, not many hours later, as my noble friend said, but 45 minutes later. But I accept his point that there were 3,000 minutes of delay to other trains. The police acted expeditiously and it is important that we encourage them to do so in such cases. As far as co-ordination between the various bodies is concerned, it is important that the blue-light services, the county police and the other forces are brought in and work together in as co-operative a manner as possible.</p>

<ul><a name="09062210000280"></a>&#147;take urgent measures to address the intolerance and inappropriate characterisation of children, especially adolescents, within society, including the media&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90622-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09062210000068"></a>Negative media and the raft of legislative measures to deal with youth crime and anti-social behaviour have created a climate in society where any children&#146;s activity may be seen as anti-social. For example, the Standing Committee for Youth Justice is aware of a number of cases in which complaints about anti-social behaviour have turned out to be about young people playing football in the park. In this context, there is a significant risk that public opinion based on negative stereotypes of young people, as distinct from informed public judgment, could result in policing priorities that are skewed against the interests of this group. This could seriously undermine the approach of existing multi-agency partnerships, both within and without the criminal justice sector, to tackling youth crime. The Government&#146;s recent youth crime action plan, the YCAP, recognised the high incidence of children and young people as victims of crime, and this must also be reflected in these provisions.</p>

<a name="90622-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09062210000069"></a>Evidence submitted to the Good Childhood Inquiry, commissioned by the Children&#146;s Society, illustrated that children and young people have strong views about crime and anti-social behaviour in their local communities. An 11 year-old boy said, &#147;When I go out and I see so many teenagers swearing and littering, it makes me ask myself if the Government realise what goes on&#148;. To this end, I believe that it is vital that consideration is given to the question of how police will ensure that they obtain the views of children and young people. In the past, many crime and disorder partnerships failed to take into account the views of children and young people in their planning processes. Children and young people are important members of the community and their views and ideas can make a positive contribution to improving community safety. I ask the Minister how the police will canvass public opinion about what policing should focus on and, specifically, how this will include the views of children and young people. I beg to move.</p>

Before I do so, and because it will be relevant during the course of the Bill, though not necessarily on this aspect of it, I declare two interests&#151;one as a sitting magistrate in both the adult and family courts, the second as an elected member of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which will be relevant when local government issues become pertinent to the discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09062210000071"></a>The matters raised by the noble Baroness have shown how important it is to ensure that there is increased public involvement at all levels of local policing, and that this is done in a sensible way. We agree strongly that the police must become more accountable to the public&#151;our policies on police reform, which I will not go into today, go much further than this modest amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09062210000072"></a>The danger with adding &#147;just one more&#148; matter that a police authority must have regard to is that there is no clarification of how the new matter will interact with the existing priorities, and what will actually change. Will the police authority continue much as before, but now take note of when an initiative is particularly popular or unpopular? Or will it seek to integrate a concern for public views into policing priorities?</p>

<a name="90622-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09062210000073"></a>In a very helpful brief that the Minister sent to me, for which I thank him very much, he says that Section 96 duties require police authorities to obtain information for consultation, but that, except when drawing up their priorities, they are not required to do anything with the information. That is clearly the reason why these amendments on consultation have been tabled. The new duty means that police authorities must consider information whenever they exercise their functions, which will ensure that the views of the public are a core part of any and all work that the police authority does. That is a direct lift from what the Minister said to me, and clearly underscores the reason why these amendments on consultation have been tabled.</p>

<a name="90622-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09062210000074"></a>Local communities have a valuable contribution to make to effective policing and we do not want to see the provisions watered down to the point that they become just a PR exercise. As the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, highlighted when moving Amendment 1, if attention is not paid to implementing this clause properly, that could be counterproductive. Without an impartial process that analyses the public&#146;s views, there is a danger that the police will end up selectively listening to those who agree with established priorities while disregarding those that seek a new focus. Together with the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, I would be grateful if the Minister will give us more detail about how the police will seek out the public&#146;s views. How will that consultation be undertaken? As my amendment suggests, I would like to know whether they will rely on those with a strong opinion writing in or whether they will prioritise any sector&#146;s views above another. If the police rely on the public to come to them with concerns, there is a great danger that only the most vocal views, and probably those that are the widest apart, will be heard. Many sectors of the community lack any form of representative body, while others have numerous organisations that are accustomed to making representations.</p>

<a name="90622-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09062210000075"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment quite rightly deals with the concern that the perception that has developed significantly in the past 10 years of children and young people as a threat will or might colour police attitudes to criminal behaviour and further isolate young people from the institutions and organisations that are there to protect them. I take her point that if children and young people are involved in the consultation, their views are being expressed in a way. We have had young people&#146;s parliaments, we have young people&#146;s citizens&#146; juries, and it is amazing how adult they can be when they are asked to put those views forward. That is an important aspect.</p>

<a name="90622-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09062210000076"></a>Perhaps equally important is the fact that we know that we are in the middle of an outbreak of violent crime that is flourishing around the knife culture, which has become rife, and that young people do seem

As we may not quite understand why that is happening, perhaps a consultation that included young people would be helpful.</p>

<a name="90622-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09062210000077"></a>My honourable friend in another place asked whether the police take enough account of the impact that crime and disorder have on businesses, so I have included them in the list of sectors that I suggest should be listened to and whose views would be sought under this amendment. The British Chambers of Commerce highlighted the fact that the police response to business communities&#146; concerns is inconsistent across authorities and fails to appreciate the growing cost of damage that crime inflicts on businesses. Therefore, it is essential that business is included.</p>

<a name="90622-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09062210000078"></a>Will the Minister say whether there is any intention of reviving the national Commercial Victimisation Survey, or whether the Government are making any effort to assess what help can be given to the business sector to protect it against the damage that crime can inflict on it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09062210000079"></a>The other bodies included in my amendment are local authorities and the voluntary sector, which has an enormous role to play in preventing crime and supporting various people in the community. As this Bill goes ahead, it will also have a role to play in the judicial process. We therefore seek a clear understanding of this consultation. We recognise that there is already a requirement on the police authorities to consult, but that does not seem to have a huge impact. Will the consultations be published, and will there be meetings&#151;if so, how will they take place&#151;to improve enormously on what is there already?</p>

However, I must express a certain doubt about the desirability of imposing a statutory duty on police authorities to consult children and young persons specifically. The noble Baroness did not define &#147;children&#148; and &#147;young persons&#148;, and I assume from other parts of the law, such as employment law, that &#147;young persons&#148; normally means those between 16 and 18 and that, when the phrases &#147;young persons&#148; and &#147;children&#148; are alongside one another, &#147;children&#148; presumably covers those below 16. While I have some feeling that consulting young persons may be worth while and beneficial to everyone concerned in judging what the police should or should not do, I am rather doubtful about children if they are to be defined as those under 16. I know that we have youth parliaments and so on; they are of great educational value, to help people debate and understand and listen to others. But the idea that the police authority should seriously sit down with children&#151;presumably, to be representative, they would have to be not just under 16, but some of them under 10, or under 8, or maybe even under the age of criminal responsibility for all I know&#151;seems to be taking liberalism too far.</p>

Young people are quite capable of expressing themselves in a very serious way about very serious issues. Over the weekend, in fact, I was reading about a local authority that was setting up a junior children&#146;s safeguarding board, to consult children about matters as serious as safeguarding other children in their community.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09062210000082"></a>My other point is this. The police authorities obviously want the arrangements that they make for policing to work, and many of those who are most affected by policing arrangements are young people, including the arrangements made to ensure that young people are safe when they go about their local community and the arrangements for ensuring that when minor misdemeanours are committed, the police do not overreact with young people and drag them into the criminal justice system in an unwarranted way. All those arrangements really do affect young people&#146;s lives.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09062210000083"></a>There is such a thing as the &#147;not invented here&#148; syndrome. I think that we are all aware of it. We are much more likely to co-operate with something of which we take ownership ourselves. We take ownership of something when we are consulted and we have our own input. The Government are very aware of the &#147;not invented here&#148; syndrome. Only this morning, I was talking about two reports on the primary school curriculum, one of which was commissioned by the Government and the other of which was not. I am sure your Lordships will have a very good idea of which of those two the Government are taking notice&#151;the one that they commissioned themselves. They have ownership of that report and not of the other one.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09062210000084"></a>If we want young people to co-operate with the police&#151;and we do&#151;then it is very important and beneficial to the whole community, not just to the young people, and to the police in their ability to do their job well, that we should consult young people. Local authorities already have duties to consult young people on a whole raft of issues. That means that they have already developed the skills needed to talk to and listen to young people and to interpret what they are saying&#151;even very young children in some cases, as in relation to the provision of nursery places. So, with local authorities, the skills are already there and are developing all the time. The need is there, and the benefits are obvious.</p>

Of the two amendments under discussion, I prefer that of my noble friend Lady Hanham, because her proposed new subsection (2A)(d) would cover what is in Amendment 1. It specifies:</p>
<ul><a name="09062210000281"></a>&#147;any other people or organisations they consider relevant&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062210000243"></a>It is far more important for the police to discuss the position with parents rather than children because they need the parents&#146; co-operation. To some extent, the problems of young people today arise because parents very often do not start to teach their children discipline and the difference between right and wrong at a young age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09062210000086"></a>The children covered by Amendment 1 could be as young as three or four. They may well have to be consulted if this amendment becomes law. I do not

The police could go and talk to youth groups or clubs. That would be an opportunity for those young people&#151;those approaching 16 or over 16&#151;to talk to the police and answer their questions on community policing. I would prefer Amendment 2 to go forward because Amendment 1 is misconceived.</p>

Presumably that means that they will take a much more active line with them.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09062210000088"></a>Anti-social behaviour is always difficult and needs to be dealt with. However, it is interesting that the Home Secretary chose to use the example that young people may become subject to an ASBO for sitting on a wall in front of an elderly person&#146;s house because, as he said, they have nowhere else to go. The elderly residents of a street may well have asked for an ASBO to be imposed after they had asked the youngsters to move and the youngsters had said no, perhaps quite rudely. Young people tend to use different and sometimes offensive language, which can be intimidating to older people. Nevertheless, they would not have committed a criminal offence; they would be assembling as they have done for ages.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09062210000089"></a>I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. Of course parents have a role, but young people over the age of 10 and up to 18 have been a problem ever since I can remember. Often their parents, with the best will in the world, are unable to deal with them because the behaviour may take place between school and home or when they are out on a Saturday afternoon. You cannot keep them locked up in the house, nor should you&#151;they have to learn to be independent and to deal with the world.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09062210000090"></a>If we pass this Bill, yet again, if the Government have their way on everything&#151;the provisions on alcohol misuse, for example&#151;we will be passing legislation aimed at young people who have done nothing criminal and it will impinge on their freedoms in the same way as ASBOs do. It behoves us&#151;it certainly behoves the Government&#151;at the same time as bringing in further laws that affect young people in these ways, to consider how we are going to ensure that the authorities, such as the police, that deal with these issues take a more proactive approach to young people, who otherwise will feel further alienated.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09062210000091"></a>I know that the record of most police forces is extremely good, but that is not always the case. The people who write letters to the press or sit behind their PCs and fire off letters to their MPs asking for more action to be taken on young people are all adults; very often we do not hear the young person&#146;s side of the story. As I said, the Home Secretary said that the young people may be sitting on the wall in the first place because they have nowhere else to go. It is important that we keep the necessity of engaging with their views at the forefront of our minds when considering the Bill.</p>

I am heavily involved in that area and with a number of other charities, one of which gives sponsorships to youngsters in the areas of sport, music, the arts and so on. So I am involved in this area to an extent.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09062210000093"></a>I agree to an extent with the noble Baronesses, Lady Harris, Lady Walmsley and Lady Miller, that at times it seems that we are down on youngsters when they are doing what youngsters do, such as hanging around; certainly I was a bit of a scallywag when I was younger. However, I have some sympathy for what the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, said: back then, when I was admittedly very naughty, there was a certain inherent respect that I believe has somehow been undermined. We are down on youngsters too much, but we are in a slightly different place from where we were. We should remember, though, that youngsters are youngsters and, from my experience of the cadet forces and other groups, given half an opportunity and something to focus on, we have some remarkable and wonderful young people in this country. We always need to remember that.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09062210000094"></a>This is a difficult area. As we saw from the debate between the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, my noble friend Lord Borrie and the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, there are a lot of differing views and one has to think about that. I agree with noble Lords that the views of children, young people, local authorities, the business sector and the voluntary sector all need to be considered when the police authority carries out its functions. In that regard, I accept the principle behind the amendment, which I understand. However, this clause is not the right place to make that point.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09062210000095"></a>Police authorities have long been required to obtain the views of the public under Section 96 of the Police Act 1996 and any amendment to how views are obtained or whose views are relevant would need to be made in or under that section rather than here. I would not wish to apply this amendment to that section either, though, for one simple reason: it has too few items on the list. The Bill refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09062210000282"></a>&#147;people in the authority&#146;s area&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062210000244"></a>which is a very wide standard. The Government are clear that that can include the views of people who live and/or work in an area, including children and young people, people in businesses in that area, people in the local authorities in that area and people in the voluntary sector organisations in that area. We therefore accept that all the people specified by noble Lords should be included, but trying to list everyone who should be consulted runs the risk of excluding all the groups that are not on that list. Why should we specify children but not parents who live outside the area whose children attend schools there, or those who visit elderly relatives or other vulnerable people in the area? There is an endless list of people and groups that deserve a say in   


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1358"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>how an area is policed, but it would not be sensible to try to put an exhaustive list in this Act&#151;and a partial list, as always, risks exclusions.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09062210000096"></a>Furthermore, merely adding that police authorities must engage with people whom they consider relevant, as Amendment 2 seeks to do, would not solve that problem. In fact, it is difficult to conceive of a situation where a police authority would consider a person to be relevant and yet not consult them. We should not be too prescriptive; we should treat these people as mature people who do these things, as indeed I think they do.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09062210000097"></a>What would the additional duty add? The measure is too subjective to have any real-life effect. That is why the Police and Justice Act 2006 amended Section 96 of the 1996 Act to allow the Government to make regulations that may include provision about who must be consulted. The Government will therefore make such regulations setting out the arrangements that authorities must make for obtaining the views of people in their area, which will allow a more flexible approach so that the list can be changed when appropriate. It will, however, provide a specific set of principles by which the police authority will be bound rather than the sort of general catch-all proposed in the amendment, which, as I say, is too prescriptive. The Home Secretary will bring regulations to set out minimum standards for engagement and those regulations will include specific provisions for groups that are harder to reach, such as children.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09062210000098"></a>While noble Lords make an excellent point, which I accept, I suggest that the clause is not the most appropriate place, nor is this the most appropriate way, to do what is suggested. I ask them kindly not to press their amendments.</p>

I am now slightly concerned that the Minister has suggested regulations. There is no room for regulations in this Bill because it does not say anything about them, which means that there is no possibility of them coming to this House. We may later have to insert an amendment that says that the regulations on consultation must be brought forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09062210000100"></a>To widen this a little further, my amendment would amend Section 6(2) of the Police Act, which is what we are talking about. The Minister suggested that it would not, but it would. Clause 1(1) says that the Police Act, as it is presently structured, states that the police authority &#147;must have regard&#148;. That is a very wobbly phrase and I wonder how it got through parliamentary scrutiny. It might mean absolutely anything. From what the Minister has said, I suppose that the regulations will point out how they &#147;must have regard&#148;. That is not here. We do not have any information at all about how the police authorities will be asked to carry out this important duty. I accept what the Minister says: in lists there are always difficulties over making sure that everybody is included. However, my amendment mentions,</p>

As I have said, it is rather like mission command, where you give the mark for where you want to go and then let people get on with it. However, regulations and changes to regulations would be under existing Section 96 of the Police Act 1996. That is how that would be done. It will be constantly looked at in discussion with the people involved, to see how we need to amend, if necessary, that section of the Act.</p>

My noble friend Lady Walmsley talked about the benefits to the whole community when young people are consulted about how they can see crime improving in their area. In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, I point him to the example that I gave of the young boy who talked about being concerned about swearing and littering. He was 11 years old. There are many young people below the age of 16 who attend youth clubs. Their concerns can be expressed very clearly through youth clubs and other youth societies. The police should take note of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09062210000104"></a>I also hear what the Minister said about being naughty when he was a boy, but in those days there was respect for older people. Young people today can be more respectful if they are consulted. They become better young citizens if they are asked what their views are. It is very important to take that on board. I also accept that, at the moment, the Minister does not feel that this is the right place in which to make the point. I was going to ask him whether he would consider putting it in regulations, but he neatly answered that point by saying that there would be regulations on a set of principles. I thank him for that small concession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09062210000105"></a>I will withdraw the amendment but we may decide to bring it back at a later stage to see whether something a little meatier could be inserted at another point in the Bill. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

If the Committee were to accept the argument that I propose, a number of consequential amendments would in practice be required to give effect to this amendment. At present, chief executives of police authorities do not enjoy the same statutory  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1360"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1360</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>protection as chief executives of local authorities. For that matter neither do the other statutory officers, the treasurer and the monitoring officer. The amendment is intended to rectify this anomaly.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09062210000107"></a>Section 4 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 requires a relevant authority to designate a head of paid service. In practice, that is usually the chief executives of the authority. The definition of &#147;relevant authority&#148; in this section of the Act does not include a police authority, although a number of other sections apply to police authorities. In 2001, the Local Authorities (Standing Orders) (England) Regulations were introduced, part of which dealt with incorporating into authorities&#146; standing orders certain provisions about disciplinary action that could be brought against the head of paid services, the chief finance officer and the monitoring officer.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09062210000108"></a>At the time of the 1989 Act police authorities&#151;as I well remember, having been a member of one&#151;were still a committee of the local authority rather than the independent bodies that they now are. However, it is not clear why police authorities were not included in the 2001 order, because by that time they were independent bodies, other than in the City of London, where I understand that the police authority continues to be the Common Council of the City of London.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09062210000109"></a>In 2001, chief executives of police authorities were called clerks. I remember participating in a police Bill a few years ago that managed to get their title changed to that of chief executive, about which they were all very pleased. One can speculate that in 2001 many chief executives of police authorities were also chief executives of a local authority, so that they headed police authority secretariats on a part-time basis. To that extent, chief executives had relevant protection through their mainstream employment; they were part time on both sides. However, even then not all statutory officers of police authorities were also local authority employees, and now it is almost definitely the case that very few are.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09062210000110"></a>Now that there is increased emphasis on strengthening police authorities and making both members and officers more accountable, is it not time to rectify this anomaly? I want to ensure that not only chief executives but police authority treasurers and monitoring officers&#151;sometimes they are the same person&#151;benefit from the same protection as their counterparts in local authorities. I beg to move.</p>

In doing so, I declare an interest as the president and a past chair of the Association of Police Authorities. I support the amendment on the grounds that this matter has clearly not been updated in line with the various pieces of legislation that have been passed in the past few years and on grounds of equity. It seems to me that this is a very important change that should be made to safeguard the position of chief executives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09062210000112"></a>As the noble Baroness has said, chief executives are now in a very different position from the one that they had 10 years ago.

I have also noted the position of the Association of Police Authority Chief Executives on this matter. Police authority chief executives and other officers perform a hugely important and, possibly, underrated role in the operation of the police service in this country. I know that Home Office officials often find the Association of Police Authority Chief Executives to be a useful and expert adviser on policing matters.</p>

<a name="90622-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09062210000114"></a>I agree that it seems strange that police authority chief executives do not have the clear protections and status in law that their local authority counterparts enjoy. As previous speakers have said, that was, perhaps, an accident of history due to the evolution of policing governance and the role of police authority clerks and chief executives. Police authorities are, especially from a corporate perspective, similar in many respects to other local authorities. They are not, however, identical and there might be a need to have more tailored provisions regarding the position of police authority officers. Therefore, while the amendment certainly warrants serious consideration the Government must give the position much more thought before they could offer it their backing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09062210000115"></a>I will make a commitment, however, that Home Office officials will engage with the Association of Police Authority Chief Executives and the Association of Police Authorities with a view to evaluating what changes may be needed. In doing that, there should be a full comparison of the duties of police authority and local authority chief executives to see whether a separate legal status is warranted. We could look to effect any changes, if they are needed, in the light of that exercise. Therefore, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw this amendment, with a view to the Government discussing the proposals with the APA and the Association of Police Authority Chief Executives. That will enable the Government to give these proposals the close consideration that they require.</p>

It might only be my own ignorance, but I do not quite understand why the police authority chief executives have been left out on what appears to be a limb, rather than being included like most other public body chief executives. I wonder what the difference is between a police authority chief executive and, for example, a chief executive in the National Health Service, or in any other public authorities. The Minister may not know the answer to that, but before he comes back to this issue it might be worth having a look at whether they are alone in this particular problem, or whether it goes across public bodies and needs to be looked at differently.</p>

I know that the chief executives will, certainly, be looking carefully at what he had to say, while knowing that the Home Office might be in consultation with them to look at the legal vagaries here.

It examines the best-value case once again. Those of you who have heard me speak on policing legislation in the past will be familiar with the theme, but I return to it in the hope that some progress may be made. Best value was of course originally introduced through the Local Government Act 1999 but, if there is one piece of legislation more in need of consolidation and rationalisation than the various policing Acts, that is most definitely it. For that reason, the amendment is only probing, as in reality many more consolidating changes would be needed to give effect to it. However, the broad intention is to disapply best-value legislation from policing.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09062210000120"></a>I am sure that the Minister will remind me that, among other things, that would remove powers to inspect police authorities. It would also remove from police authorities the power to oversee continuous improvement within their forces. I reassure him here and now that I fully support police authority inspection&#151;I have for many years&#151;and police authorities' important role in making sure that their forces strive to improve. However, it would be altogether much better either to place the powers in policing-specific legislation, or to completely revise the original legislation. Then it can be honed to do a precise job and take into account the subtleties of the policing context, where governance and delivery are separated into two different bodies&#151;the police authority and the force.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09062210000121"></a>As things stand, this local government legislation has been applied, in policing, to a context for which it was not originally intended. That has been exacerbated   


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1363"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1363</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by almost constant amendment, re-amendment, counter-amendment and partial disapplication, followed by even more partial reapplication; I think that I said those very words at Second Reading. I suspect that few understand now where we are with it. The original aim of the legislation was laudable; it tried to apply, to the public sector, key principles originally developed in the private sector about making improvements while remaining efficient. However, as so often happens, in translation it became mangled into a vastly bureaucratic process, made worse by almost constant tinkering with the underlying legislation.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09062210000122"></a>I want a return to the clarity and simplicity originally intended, and seek reassurance from the Minister about whether and when serious consideration will be given to achieving that. I beg to move.</p>

Although the Government accept that police authorities are in many ways distinct from other local authorities, surely the financial and corporate affairs of police authorities are substantially similar to those of other local authorities. They have a similar imperative to provide value to the public and to be efficient and effective, and must be held to similar public scrutiny. On the latter point, the new police authority inspection regime is built on the important foundation of the best-value legislation, as was stressed and supported by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09062210000124"></a>The effect of this amendment would be that police authorities would no longer be required to produce statements of accounts, would no longer be regulated as to their procurement, and could no longer be inspected by the Audit Commission. I am aware that this is a probing amendment. While removing police authorities from the best-value framework may deserve some consideration, as the noble Baroness recognised, it would not be a simple exercise. As noble Lords will appreciate, this cannot be achieved though one or two clauses. It would need careful unpicking, and dedicated legislation would almost certainly be necessary if we choose to take that route. Such a review would take some time and could not be completed during the passage of this Bill.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09062210000125"></a>Therefore, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw this amendment with a view to the Government discussing the proposals further with relevant partners.

My reason for tabling it is that the Government are, in any case, looking at whether the FOI Act is wide enough in the organisations it covers. The Prime Minister opened a consultation in February 2008 on whether Section 5 of the FOI Act should be extended to persons who perform functions of a public nature and contractors who provide services that are functions of public authorities. On 13 May 2009, at the very interesting Information Commissioner&#146;s conference, Justice Minister Michael Wills MP announced that there will be an expansion of the number of institutions to which the Freedom of Information Act applies. So against that background I am tabling this in hope.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09062210000128"></a>There seems to be no good reason why the Freedom of Information Act should not apply to ACPO. The status of ACPO is quite confusing but rather well laid out by the Minister in a Written Answer to a Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, about funding:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09062210000259"></a>&#147;As an independent organisation of chief officers from the police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, ACPO is accountable to its members. Chief officers are in turn accountable to police authorities and the public. As it is a private company, the Freedom of Information Act does not apply to ACPO, since Schedule 1 to the Act does not include a definition which covers ACPO&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 2/6/09; col. <I>WA64</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="09062210000245"></a>So ACPO is public/private in terms of the FOI Act.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09062210000129"></a>Clearly, ACPO has very public functions and is often setting strategy, which suggests that the FOI Act should apply to it. To its credit, ACPO states on its website that it is willing to place as much information as it can in the public domain. It argues that as a small organisation it has too few members of staff to be able to conduct the necessary research and compile the responses. However, other small institutions have to deal with FOI requests&#151;university departments, for example. The size of an organisation should not dominate a decision on whether it should be subject to FOI requests. It should be made on whether it is performing functions of a public nature.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09062210000130"></a>The FOI Act creates a general right of access to information held by bodies fitting into a description in Schedule 1 to that Act, which are mainly public bodies. However, my amendment makes use of the power

This is appropriate because, as I have explained, the boundaries between public and private bodies are increasingly blurred.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09062210000131"></a>ACPO is funded by a combination of Home Office grant, contributions from the 44 police authorities, membership subscriptions and the proceeds of its annual exhibition. Given that the majority of ACPO&#146;s funding is provided by the public in one way or another and that its leading representatives are generally serving senior police officers, it is effectively a public sector entity operating as a private company. It is responsible for leading the development and direction of police authorities in England and Wales; so its public functions are obvious. It co-ordinates strategic decisions among police forces and much of that decision-making process is opaque and unminuted. The counterargument that the Minister and others may choose to put is that if ACPO is to be subject to the FOI Act and feels sensitive about it, that will drive any decision-making process underground. But that is not in the spirit of the FOI Act and I hope that that would not happen.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09062210000132"></a>Perhaps I may give your Lordships an example of one area of ACPO&#146;s work which is of crucial public interest and much debate&#151;the police policy on tasers. ACPO&#146;s evaluation report on taser trials has been cited by the Home Office and states that tasers are safe enough to be deployed to non-firearmed police. ACPO has received information requests for the evidence for that but has not released it. I submit that that information is in the public interest and would enable better public debate. Apart from that, the very keeping of that information as a secret creates the wrong impression.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09062210000133"></a>Therefore, against that background and what I have described the Government are considering, it is important that ACPO is in the forefront of bodies to which the FOI Act needs to apply. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09062210000137"></a>raises the question of whether this legislation makes ACPO a statutory body. The position that it will be given by the legislation in terms of the appointments panel represents the first time that ACPO will be named in legislation as having a role. That is important in addition to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, as regards how the scrutiny and safeguarding of what ACPO does will be ensured.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09062210000138"></a>Concern has been raised in the past few months, and the Flanagan review highlighted the confusion that has arisen from a lack of a clear understanding about roles and responsibilities of various bodies and organisations in the policing sector. Shoe-horning ACPO into the legislation in a statutory role, without proper clarification of its responsibilities and without scrutiny, does nothing to help the implementation of the review recommendations.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09062210000139"></a>The question of whether ACPO should be covered by the Freedom of Information Act&#151;I am sure that it is not at the moment&#151;is a perfect example. If ACPO is to have a statutory role in senior appointments, it will have to have proper accountability. Later amendments will address the question of what accountability the appointments panel will have, but the nominating organisations should also have responsibility to be accountable to the wider public, not just to their members, if they are to be included legislatively as the people who have to do all that is required under the legislation.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09062210000140"></a>I understand that ACPO has some concern about the inclusion within the schedule placing too high a burden on its members. The noble Baroness has referred to that. I hope that the Minister can give us a little more detail on how many of the requests for information that are currently received on ACPO&#146;s role can be answered by ACPO and how many are refused, if such information is available. Much more importantly, we need to understand the status of ACPO, not just as an organisation with members but now in its position of having a statutory role in appointments.</p>

<a name="09062210000141"></a><b><a name="90622-0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09062210000393"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> I support the amendment and do so because I have been concerned about this organisation for a while and have tabled Questions for Written Answer. The noble Baroness is nodding so she has obviously seen them. A body that is financed in part by the Government and in part by the police authorities ought to be under public control.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09062210000142"></a>I received a Written Answer on 7 May as to the scope of the work of ACPO, which is very wide indeed. If noble Lords will allow, I shall read the Answer given by the noble Lord, Lord West. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09062210000260"></a>&#147;The Association of Chief Police Officers is an independent organisation made up of representatives of forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which works in partnership with both the Government and the Association of Police Authorities to co-ordinate the direction and development of the police service.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09062210000261"></a>ACPO plays a key role advising the Government on behalf of the police service as a whole on major national projects aimed at developing the capacity of the service. It also advises on how to tackle serious and ongoing strategic threats that might put the public at risk. In times of national need, ACPO is specifically tasked with co-ordinating the strategic policing response on behalf of all chief officers.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09062210000262"></a>ACPO is funded by a combination of Home Office grant, contributions from each police authority, membership subscriptions and the proceeds of its annual exhibition&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>7/5/09; col. <I>WA 130</I>.]</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09062210000143"></a>Those powers are very wide indeed. I was even more surprised and concerned when a later reply told me that ACPO was not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. I congratulate the noble Baroness on tabling the amendment today. My broader view is that such an organisation is rather more than an association. It has power and will advise the Government on serious matters, so it ought not to be a private organisation. It should be under public control. It should be financed completely by the public. Indeed, its activities should be transparent and obviously, then, open to the Freedom of Information Act. I hope that the noble Lord will take note of this, and, indeed, that when he answers my latest question as to whether ACPO should be privatised, he will give me a very encouraging answer.

<a name="09062210000144"></a><b><a name="90622-0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09062210000394"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> I would like to ask the Minister how an organisation that is not subject to public scrutiny can set up a unit to monitor political and environmental groups. That question was raised by Henry Porter on Tuesday, 10 February, in the <I>Guardian</I> online. He referred to it as a &#147;sinister unit&#148;; I certainly do not do that. But it does encapsulate some of our concerns, which have been so well expressed by my noble friend and by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09062210000145"></a>ACPO is not governed by any statute; rather, it is a company limited by guarantee. It is not a staff association; it consists of members who are senior police officers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has about 280 members. As we have heard, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 does not apply to it. The company&#146;s objectives include leading and co-ordinating the direction and development of the police service and developing the ACPO brand&#151;whatever that is. ACPO publishes advice and guidance on a wide range of policing issues and contributes decisions and comments to a wide range of contemporary debates.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09062210000146"></a>What is the constitutional role that ACPO plays? Is it an external reference group for Home Office Ministers? Is it a professional association protecting the interests of senior officers? Is it a public authority which issues guidance and good practice to local forces? Is it a national policing agency? Is it a campaigning pressure group arguing for greater police powers? These are questions that need answering before ACPO is given a statutory role, as it is under Clause 2.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09062210000147"></a>ACPO has already been included as a body that the Secretary of State must consult with before making particular orders or regulations. Is it time to reflect on the nature of ACPO and consider the appropriateness of involving it in decision-making processes? The Government have missed an opportunity properly to define the role of ACPO in the Bill. The constitutional role and make-up of ACPO has not been adequately debated and defined. Until that is done, it is impossible to know whether it is appropriate for a representative of ACPO to be consulted before any senior police appointments are made.</p>

We have not opened up the FOI parameters as yet, and ACPO is an independent voluntary organisation. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, mentioned, it is not a public authority. It is a registered private company limited by guarantee and it is directly accountable to its members, not to the public. It is therefore not open to FOI requests. Its members, however, are chief police officers who are themselves accountable to police authorities and the public. All individual police forces are already subject to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act. Furthermore, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller,  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1368"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>said, ACPO already seeks to place as much information as possible in the public domain&#151;for example, on the web&#151;and of course the details of its accounts are available to be viewed at Companies House. As the noble Baroness said, it receives some public money as it represents the leadership of the police service.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09062210000149"></a>In response to a question by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, ACPO provides effective representation for chief officers at a national level, in part because it is not on a firm statutory footing but is instead able to operate independently to represent the interests of its membership. I have some sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said about tying it down a little. It has been rather a thorn in my flesh and tying it down a little more might be quite useful because it sometimes proves extremely difficult for the Government. However, I think that that is one of the benefits of having it in its current form.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09062210000150"></a>As was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, ACPO is referred to in statutes&#151;for example, in Section 37A of the Police Act 1996, which places a duty on the Secretary of State to consult both ACPO and the APA on strategic priorities. Therefore, I think that it has a very useful role to play.</p>

<a name="90622-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09062210000151"></a>Because of what one might call an anomaly but what I consider to be quite a useful status, ACPO is able to make a very effective contribution to the development of policing in this country. I am not sure that it would be able to do that if we put in all the controls that are being talked about, and the Government do not intend to undermine that by seeking to interfere in the operation of what is a private organisation. I certainly would not be keen to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09062210000152"></a>I understand that in recent debate there has been a lot of interest in ACPO&#146;s status and structure. I know that the party opposite has been looking at this in some detail. However, as I said, I think that it performs a very useful duty. Although it can sometimes prove very uncomfortable, I have found it valuable in doing my job as it holds my feet to the fire. I therefore ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09062210000154"></a>My noble friend Lady Harris of Richmond asked a very relevant question: what sort of beast are we dealing with? The Minister has insisted that it is a private organisation, but how can senior police officers who are paid by the public purse to serve the public&#151;we have just been debating a clause about how accountable they should be&#151;have an association that is entirely private and not subject to FOI? I am afraid that I am taken back to my childhood and conversations between very concerned people as to whether members of the police force belonged to, for example, the Freemasons. I do not want to draw a parallel between the Freemasons and ACPO because that may well not be appropriate. Nevertheless, an association of senior police officers needs to have a better constitutional footing and we need to be much clearer about what sort of animal we

As my noble friend said, it is leading and co-ordinating the direction and development of the police services and developing the ACPO brand. There should not be an ACPO brand, because being a senior police officer in this country is more about serving the public. That worries me. In his reply, the Minister told us what ACPO is and is not, but he did not address the question of whether it is appropriate. Does he think that its constitutional standing, which we have explored this afternoon, is appropriate?</p>

It is not a satisfactory position. I would not go so far as Henry Porter did in his article when he suggested that it is an immense conspiracy; but he raised a number of valid points that should give even the Minister great cause for concern. We cannot, under Clause 1, debate how accountable the police are, and then, when debating the very next clause, start debating how appropriate it is to keep from the eyes of the public all the discussions that senior police officers have about strategy. That is not appropriate and not what we should allow to happen in the Bill. I will come back to this on Report, when I have gathered more information.</p>

I have already declared an interest as president of the Association of Police Authorities. I declare an interest also as chair of the Security Industry Authority.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09062210000160"></a>These two amendments take different approaches but deal with the same concern, which is to ensure that the national influence in appointing the most senior police officers does not outweigh the local interest. Much of the strength and credibility of British policing lies in getting this delicate balance right. If we get it wrong, the consequences will be serious.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09062210000161"></a>First, I apologise to the Committee, because both amendments have slight errors in the form in which they appear on the Marshalled List. For clarity, I will explain what is meant when I reach the relevant sections. My first amendment takes the simplest approach. It is intended to remove the whole clause, apart from subsection (2), which relates to delegated functions and the role of HMIC. I accept that HMIC should no longer have delegated functions to carry out the Secretary of State&#146;s role in approving senior appointments, given its new and more independent role as set out in the Green Paper. However, the amendment as shown in the Marshalled List suggests that subsections (3) and (4) should also remain. This is an error, for which I apologise. If the main part of this clause is removed, these subsections must go, too. This is covered in Amendment 11, which should really be debated alongside Amendment 5A. When we come to debate Amendment 11, I shall seek to withdraw it.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09062210000162"></a>The amendment would result in the senior appointments panel remaining a non-statutory body. I listened carefully to the Minister at Second Reading, and I support his desire to make the senior appointments panel more independent and more proactive, but I am afraid that I do not see why it needs to be a statutory body to operate in this way. This will merely inject unwelcome additional bureaucracy into the appointments process and hand greater powers to the Home Secretary of the day, and to his or her officials, to direct this body in favour of national requirements to the detriment of local interests and requirements.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09062210000163"></a>It might be worth reiterating that the local police authority has the power to appoint chief officers, not the Home Secretary, whose role is to approve appointments made by police authorities. My noble friend therefore has yet to convince me that a statutory body is necessary for the Home Secretary to carry out this role of approval effectively or for police authorities to take heed of advice on the wider national strategic requirements. As noble Lords will notice, I am taking a twin-track approach here, so I argue that a statutory body is not necessary. If we accept that it is desirable, I am concerned about the precise nature of some of the proposals that are set out in Clause 2, so my second amendment deals with that situation.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09062210000164"></a>Again, before explaining exactly what my concerns are, I must apologise to the Committee for an error in the amendment on the Marshalled List. Proposed new subsection (18) should refer to subsections (12) and (13)&#151;that is, to the respective functions of the Secretary of State and police authorities to approve and make senior appointments.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1371"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90622-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09062210000165"></a>Broadly speaking, my Amendment 6 is designed to introduce precisely the more independent and proactive approach to which my noble friend has alluded, without the centralised approach that risks upsetting the national/local balance. The amendment makes it clear that the make-up of the panel needs to be balanced so that the Home Secretary&#146;s appointees cannot outnumber the appointees nominated by police authorities and chief officers. It would also enable the panel to elect its own chair, rather than leaving this appointment to the Home Secretary. It would provide independence to the panel to determine its own arrangements for conducting its business, rather than those arrangements being set out by the Home Secretary.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09062210000166"></a>Perhaps most importantly, my amendment is more explicit about what the functions of the panel should be. Specifically, it includes the ability to give general advice not just to the Home Secretary but to police authorities. If the Home Secretary needs advice on approving chief officer appointments, it is only sensible that that advice should also be given to the bodies that make the appointments.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09062210000167"></a>The functions also include the critical duty of developing a more consistent and robust system for setting out the criteria for prioritising vacancies and considering candidates for them. This problem has long existed and has never been satisfactorily resolved. It always means that some authorities must wait much longer than others before it is their turn to interview available candidates. It also means that, for those who come later in the queue, the pool of available candidates tends to be smaller. In the past, this has been dealt with by a process of negotiation reaching eventual consensus. That has not been without problems, however, and a new and more proactive panel should be required to see whether there are ways of improving the system.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09062210000168"></a>Finally, the amendment would give the panel the flexibility to carry out any other functions that may be necessary to fulfil its main duties. This would replace an order-making power for the Secretary of State to confer additional functions.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09062210000169"></a>All these proposed provisions in Amendment 6 are based on practical experience of the workings of this body. If the body is to be made statutory, it should be made statutory to improve its workings and to make it a more effective body for all the parties concerned&#151;the Secretary of State, the police authorities and senior police officers. In moving this amendment, I hope that my noble friend will agree that the amendment would genuinely provide for an independent and proactive panel that is properly balanced between the tripartite policing partners and national and local requirements. I beg to move.</p>

I have been interested to hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, had to say. My question was why the senior appointments panel needs to be a statutory body. Once again, the Secretary of State will be granted new powers to make arrangements or orders about the make-up, functions and proceedings of this new body.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09062210000171"></a>It is the primary responsibility of police authorities to appoint their chief officers, after which the Secretary  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1372"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of State approves, or otherwise, that appointment. Therefore, I am extremely concerned that the balance of responsibility for ensuring that police authorities get the right chief of police for their area could be skewed away from them and towards the Secretary of State. The noble Baroness, Lady Henig, clearly pointed that out. If that is not political interference with local decision-making, I do not know what is.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09062210000172"></a>This panel must have a genuine tripartite balance in its membership. As it stands, the wording is so wide that it could allow a future Home Secretary to appoint more government representatives and so upset that very delicate balance. Government representatives should not outnumber police community appointees, so I ask the Minister to look again at this and ensure that the wording is tightened.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09062210000173"></a>I have spent many years on policing matters. I have gone through many interviews with chief officers&#151;from chief constables through to deputies and assistants&#151;and so have a wide-ranging knowledge of how they are selected to come before a police authority and what then happens when they do. As the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, said, the Secretary of State could say, &#147;No, I do not particularly want that person to go before a selection panel of police authorities&#148;. That simply is not good news. A transparent process is what is needed in the Bill. There are no criteria by which decisions are made about when and which officers can apply for posts. SAP must develop mechanisms to address these concerns. I hope that the Minister will be able to assuage some of my concerns in this area.</p>

She has raised several points about the panel&#151;in particular, the role that the Secretary of State will play in the appointments process&#151;and about the ongoing development of the panel.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09062210000175"></a>A shake-up is clearly needed in the appointments process. The difficulty of attracting sufficient numbers of appropriately qualified candidates to apply for available positions is an indication that much more needs to be done to support and train candidates to prepare them for senior roles. However, I agree with both noble Baronesses who have spoken that some concerns remain, certainly among outside organisations, that the Government have not established the panel on the best footing to achieve this. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us more detail on exactly how he envisages this legislation improving how the panel currently operates. The role is to be put on a statutory basis, as the Government propose. However, in the previous arrangements, if the Secretary of State had wanted to consult the non-statutory appointments panel, there was nothing to stop him.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09062210000176"></a>We generally support this clause as a welcome sign that the Government have turned their attention to a pressing problem and hope that the panel will be able to make an important contribution to the process. We agree, however, with the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, that the changes that need to be made are not ones that can be legislated for; they need to be made in government and in the police bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09062210000177"></a>I turn to the details of the provisions&#151;and this is where we very much agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Harris&#151;and how they differ from the proposals in the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment. The noble Baroness is quite right to highlight the significant powers that the Secretary of State is taking over the constitution of the panel in the future. We understand the need for some flexibility, but the failure to specify the number of members or the relative proportions of the representative members means that the future make-up of the panel could well be very different from the model envisaged by the Government. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us more detail on this matter.</p>

<a name="09062210000178"></a><b><a name="90622-0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09062210000405"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> Taken alone, Amendment 5A, tabled by my noble friend Lady Henig and the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, would remove the statutory senior appointments panel from the Bill. However, Clause 2 is an important part of the Bill and the Government are committed to working, through the tripartite, to get the best possible leaders for the future in policing. A more proactive, strengthened statutory senior appointments panel will play a key role in delivering this. Amendment 6, also tabled by my noble friend Lady Henig and the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, would replace the majority of the Government&#146;s clause establishing a senior appointments panel and alter the composition and functions of this panel. They are fairly major amendments.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09062210000179"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Henig for highlighting the importance, as I said at Second Reading, of streamlining, making better and sorting out the appointments panel so that we get the best senior policemen we can, in a co-ordinated fashion, across a disparate group of police areas in this country, which has always been so difficult to achieve in the past. The Government agree with the principle that the tripartite contribution to the panel should remain balanced. The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, mentioned this and we share her view, which we see as important. That is why the Bill specifies that that ability is required to keep the tripartite well balanced.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09062210000180"></a>As set out in the policing Green Paper, which is where this stemmed from, the Government believe that the new panel should have a greater independent element so that there is a broader perspective on leadership. This is established by Clause 2. The provision in new Section 53B(2)(a) will be used to appoint independent members according to the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments principles. The Government also share the view that the panel should publish reports, but new Section 53B(5)(b) already provides for arrangements to be made for publishing those reports. The Government made clear in the Green Paper and in the debate in the other place that these reports would be published and the detail would be set out in the panel&#146;s constitution.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09062210000181"></a>Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary will continue to have an important role as an adviser to the panel. Work is ongoing with those involved to ensure that the key needs of the appointments system are identified; it is envisaged that the key additional functions will relate to the co-ordination of the  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1374"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1374</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appointment rounds. While I understand the intention of the amendment to set out in detail the functions of the panel, I do not believe that doing so will give us the flexibility that we need, working as tripartite, to deliver the best senior appointments arrangements for the future. For example, the amended clause would not allow the necessary scope for the greater co-ordination of the appointments round, which was mentioned by my noble friend Lady Henig. This is crucial, because we have found that, when these matters have been done in a disparate way, we end up with some poor choices for those further downstream. We committed ourselves in the policing Green Paper to move forward on this. The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, correctly identified the need for a shake-up, which is what we are trying to achieve and are achieving.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09062210000182"></a>The new panel will not make appointments directly. The function of a police authority to appoint the senior officers set out in the Police Act remains in statute. The panel retains a powerful advisory role on ministerial approval of candidates and will increasingly take a more strategic overview of the talent pool. That is absolutely crucial. I was surprised when I came into this area for the first time that, unlike in the military, there is not an overall view to develop the best officers to go to the top of the profession.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09062210000183"></a>When the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of this House reviewed this, it did not consider the absence of parliamentary control over the panel&#146;s arrangements to be inappropriate. The committee is also content that Clause 2 provides appropriate parliamentary oversight for conferring additional functions. Before conferring additional functions, the Secretary of State must consult the panel, giving all panel members&#151;both independent and tripartite representatives&#151;an opportunity for full discussion. Parliamentary scrutiny committees look at all orders laid before the House, providing an additional check and an opportunity to scrutinise. All those issues are important.</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09062210000184"></a>I therefore believe that the current provision provides the framework needed most effectively to oversee and manage the important issue of policing appointments, which all of us in this place agree needs a shake-up. I invite my noble friend to withdraw her amendment.</p>

We briefly touched in our last amendment on ACPO&#146;s role in nominating. Will the Minister say a little more on ACPO&#146;s role in advising the panel and how that will change under the Bill?</p>

<a name="90622-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09062210000186"></a>Secondly, the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, is interesting in what it leaves out. She leaves out from proposed new Section 53C:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09062210000265"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may refer any report made by Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectors of Constabulary to the panel&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062210000246"></a>That means that HMIC can ask the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State will refer. One wonders which reports HMIC deems so important that it has to go via the Secretary of State to ask the panel to consider them that do not fall into subsection (4), which the noble Baroness has included.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1375"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1375</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90622-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09062210000187"></a>I ask the Minister for two explanations. The first relates to the nomination process for members of the panel. As I understand it, in the past ACPO and APA used to work in an advisory capacity on putting forward nominations, but here they are now both with statutory responsibility. The second is the interesting aspect of what HMIC is going to be referring or asking the Secretary of State. Indeed, the provision does not specify that, so the Secretary of State may refer of his own volition an HMIC report to the panel. What might that report be on?</p>

<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="09062210000188"></a><b><a name="90622-0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09062210000407"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> I fear that I will not be able to be specific on either of the points. All I can say is that ACPO is very much seen as part of the tripartite in the new system with the APA and the Secretary of State. Perhaps I may come back to the noble Baroness in writing about the differences between now and the future, as I am afraid that I am not able to articulate that clearly now. Similarly, to give a specific example of what the Secretary of State demands of an HMIC report, I will have to come back in writing; I do not have the information at my fingertips.</p>

I agree with the Minister that we need to make the system of senior appointments work more effectively; we all want to do that. He feels that greater co-ordination is crucial. One of the problems relates to remarks by the noble Viscount about poor choices for those downstream and some of the appointments; the problem lies not at senior appointment level but lower down, in the numbers of senior officers coming forward and coming through the selection process. That is where the action needs to be taken. I have sat on many bodies that the Home Office has set up over the years to try to improve diversity and the flow of appropriate candidates coming through. More action is needed at that level. Increasing choice at senior appointments level is not a matter for the senior appointments panel; that lies lower down the chain.</p>

<a name="90622-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09062210000190"></a>I hear what my noble friend said about his surprise when he came into the post that a military model was not followed for police officers. Many of us have debated that point long and hard over the years. Both senior police officers and police authorities value the element of choice. There are police officers who have family concerns and preferences. They do not wish to be moved around, as might be the case with a military career. They might not want to move their children out of schools. There are many legitimate family issues for police officers to pursue in wanting to have a certain amount of choice in the appointments that they go for. Similarly, if locality means anything, it means that police authorities may themselves want a choice about the sort of police officers whom they are looking for. I say respectfully that I do not think that the military model is an appropriate one, and I have said so for the past 10 years. So far I have managed to beat off this idea that the senior ranks of the police should be moved around and that we should develop cadres that have a military way of proceeding, but I can see that I am going to have to fight the battle for

At the end of the day, the tripartite structure is important to all of us and we want to preserve it. That means allowing choice at local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09062210000191"></a>My reservations centre on the role of the Secretary of State. Is this going to be the thin end of the wedge in giving the Secretary of State more power in an area that a lot of us feel is central to maintaining democratic accountability over policing and the powers of local authorities? While I will withdraw the amendment at this stage, I may wish to return to the issue on Report.</p>

Although we welcome the creation of a body capable of driving through the changes necessary to ensure proper career development within the police force, and hope that the advisory functions will allow for a useful relationship between the panel and the Home Office, new Section 53D potentially opens up a much larger role for the panel in future. We on these Benches are sensitive&#151;and it is possible that the Liberal Democrats sometimes feel the same&#151;that this is far too much legislation going into secondary legislation. What additional functions do the Government envisage giving to the panel in future? If there is a useful role that the panel could play in other areas, why has that role not been drafted into this legislation already? I beg to move.</p>

While the chief inspector will continue to have a key role in advising the senior appointments panel, he will no longer chair it, as it would no longer be appropriate for him to hold this role under the new system as HMIC takes on the strengthened role of performance improvement. The power to delegate the Home Secretary&#146;s approval role to the chief inspector therefore does not reflect the chief inspector&#146;s new role, and is being repealed. An independent chair and members will help to bring a wider perspective from people who do not represent organisations with a direct stake in individual chief officer appointments.</p>

The Bill ensures that the panel is subject to all relevant equality duties by amending the Race Relations Act to apply the race equality duty to the panel. The equality duties for gender and disability will apply to the panel, since it will be carrying out public functions. In future, I fully expect the panel to be subject to the requirements of the equality duty set out in the Equality Bill. It is important that a body that has a role in helping to improve the diversity of senior appointments has the appropriate statutory equality responsibilities. As an example of extra co-ordination, by allowing this not to be in the Bill we want to achieve greater flexibility in future. As soon as we tie it in to the Bill, we are tied down to something and it does not necessarily cover everything that we will want to do in the future. Therefore, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

However, I believe that the amendment is unnecessary since the Secretary of State already has the power, under Section 54 of the Police Act 1996, to require HMIC to prepare reports on particular functions of a police authority, which could include the workings of the senior officer appointments process in that force. More broadly it is also the responsibility of the panel itself, which will publicly report on the functioning of the appointments system and the strategic challenges to address. This will take into account the views of APA, ACPO and others, as well as the professional input of the inspectorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09062210000202"></a>In the debate in the other place that was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, the Government made clear the intention, set out in the policing Green Paper, for the panel to publish reports to increase the transparency of the senior appointments process. This requirement will be set out in the senior appointment panel&#146;s constitutional arrangements, which will be made under Clause 2. Therefore, I hope noble Lords can see that, while I have much sympathy with the principle behind the amendment of having a transparent and accountable senior appointments panel, I believe that the amendment is not necessary, since we are already achieving that. I hope that, on the basis of those reassurances, the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

I very much hope that that will happen and that reports will be made so that these appointments, all that is involved in them, and what the panel is doing, are well understood. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I am unclear of the intention behind the amendment. I think that I now understand it better given the previous description of it but it still has the problems to which I have referred.</p>

<a name="90622-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09062210000208"></a>I take the view very strongly that the new appointments panel must be subject to the relevant equalities and freedom of information legislation if it is to command the confidence of officers, police authorities and the public. The equality duties for gender and disability will apply. However, specific provision is needed to ensure that the panel is subject to the race equality duty in the Race Relations Act.</p>

<a name="90622-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09062210000209"></a>The race equality duty will require the panel to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination. It would be a serious anomaly if the panel were not subject to this duty. It is important that a body which has a role in helping to improve the diversity of senior appointments has the appropriate statutory responsibilities. Given that the panel has a particular advisory role for appointments, and that increasing diversity is a key challenge, it is especially important that this is done. I do not believe that the amendment intended to remove that duty but that is what it would achieve. I hope that I have helped to clarify it a little. The other aspect of it was debated earlier. On that basis, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09062210000213"></a>In another place the Minister for crime and policing made the rather surprising remark that the clause did not seek to fix any problem. Therefore, one does not know whether a problem is anticipated in the future. Presumably the Government anticipate that there might be a problem with officers seeking to terminate their employment prematurely or having their employment terminated. Perhaps the Minister can give us examples of why either of those situations might occur. There is a great deal more in this part of the Bill regarding co-ordination and co-operation which might legitimately lead to a situation where there was a vacancy or one was created. We need to understand a little more about what the clause is about and why it is included. I hope that the noble Lord will be kind enough to explain this and, if possible, relate it to other aspects of the legislation. I beg to move.</p>

If that is the case, no doubt my noble friend will respond on that specific point. I should be grateful if he will also respond on the wider question of incentive payments to senior officers because it is my understanding that some police authorities make extremely generous payments outside the normal negotiating board arrangements, thereby distorting the payment arrangements for senior officers in different parts of the country. If that is the case, rather than narrowing the ambit of this clause, as the noble Baroness proposes, we might want to see it widened to cover those additional bonus payments that are, I think, made in some police authority areas.</p>

A key theme of the policing Green Paper is greater local accountability. Therefore, ensuring that police authorities have all the options necessary to act in the best interest of communities is important. The new chief officer appointments framework will increase the focus on chief officers&#146; performance. However, the Government recognise&#151;although I cannot give a specific example&#151;that there easily could be a circumstance where, as a result of the changing needs of the force or of the individual, the current chief officer is no longer the best person to lead their force.</p>

In employment law, I would have thought that there was always a right for an authority to terminate employment. It gives no indication of whether this would be done under employment law, or of the sort of levels of payment that there might be. It gives no indication of whether that payment would fall on the pension fund, because so often early retirement&#151;which is what this would be&#151;amounts to that.

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09062210000220"></a>It is a very broad statement to say that payments can be made. There is nothing to give any substance to what that is going to be.

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09062210000229"></a>I will now raise yet again the issue of the large number of regulation-making powers in the Bill for the Secretary of State. I am afraid that you will hear a great deal more from me on the subject as the Bill progresses. It is fundamentally an unsatisfactory way to make laws. The powers tend to be wide-ranging and non-specific to make sure that every future possibility is catered for, but that is completely unclear about what is intended in the first place. This clause is no exception. What precisely is meant by,</p>
<ul><a name="09062210000284"></a>&#147;steps to be taken in connection with the appointment of senior officers&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="09062210000247"></a>That is very wide-ranging. Might it include, for instance, limiting the number of candidates put forward for interview, which follows on from the issues discussed on Clause 2 about the role of the senior appointments panel? I am also not clear whether the new paragraph on payments to senior officers is designed to mandate or prevent large golden handshakes being doled out to failing senior officers who depart prematurely. I had a lot of experience of that over the years when I was chairing my own police authority.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09062210000230"></a>I understand that one key driver for the provision was a concern on the part of ACPO that chief officers were not always fully consulted by police authorities before the authorities made appointments at deputy or assistant chief constable rank. However, I understand from the Association of Police Authorities that protocols governing the topic have now been agreed between it and ACPO in principle, which looks like a good move. I do not see any reason to regulate on the subject at all if the main reason that drove the inclusion of the clause has been removed. It remains the job of the police authority, not the Home Secretary, to appoint chief officers and to determine the pay and conditions on which they are appointed. Regulation-making powers of this nature look like an attempt to erode and blur this important line and they are to be greatly resisted.</p>

Enabling police authorities to act in the best interest of the force to ensure it has the right leadership to enable it to deliver for the public is critical. The new chief officer appointments framework increases the focus on the performance of chief officers. However, the Government recognise that there could be circumstances when there is a need to change the individual, as I discussed before, and Clause 3 allows police authorities to exercise their discretion in agreeing the appropriate compensation.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09062210000233"></a>Additional functions would relate to the appointment of senior officers and would be conferred by the Secretary of State, following consultation with a panel. These may be required so that the work of the panel can evolve to best meet the needs of the tripartite. I do not believe this gives too much power to the Secretary of State. It is necessary to have order-making powers to confer additional functions on the panel. We are creating a more flexible structure and allowing further consultation with stakeholders. Before conferring additional functions, the Secretary of State must consult the panel&#151;so the Secretary of State is not acting in an autocratic way&#151;giving all the panel members, both independent and tripartite, an opportunity for a full discussion. Parliamentary committees looked at all the orders laid before the House, providing an additional check, so there are checks and balances.</p>

I was unable to be present in your Lordships&#146; House for Second Reading and, thereby, to make early comment on Clause 4 and give notice of my intention to table an amendment. I know convention does not demand that I give reasons for that omission, but as a matter of courtesy and good practice, I shall do so. Only a few days ago, I returned from a course of post-stroke therapy, which has kept me from attendance in your Lordships&#146; House, but I hope that it will now enhance my involvement, enabling me to speak without juxtaposing words and to stand before you more steadily.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09062210000236"></a>I have tabled this amendment with the full knowledge and support of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. It accords with his wishes and reflects his fears for the future accountability of the commissioner and my fears for the further politicising of policing. This amendment applies only to London, our capital city, since it already has an elected mayor and regional government. I declare an interest and past involvement as a former chief constable of a large provincial constabulary, and as a former Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Yes, I am the archetypal yesterday&#146;s man or, perhaps more correctly, the day-before-yesterday&#146;s man. None the less, this gives me some insight into the present system of selections. Having observed how the office of Metropolitan Police Commissioner has, in the last few years, been buffeted backwards and forwards in a party-political cauldron, I firmly believe it is time to take policing out of politics and to take politics&#151;as far as possible political influence and most definitely political direction&#151;out of policing.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09062210000237"></a>I repeat my emphasis that my amendment refers only to our capital city. The arrangements for appointing the commissioner and deputy commissioner should, however, remain unchanged because of their national responsibilities. Similarly, the arrangements for selecting chief officers in other parts of the country would remain as envisaged in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09062210000238"></a>Since the creation of the post of Mayor of London and the amendment to the Greater London Authority Act, which enables him to chair the police authority, there is enhanced accountability for the commissioner in London, with potentially significant consequences. If that accountability almost by osmosis turns into increased direction and operational control by political appointees, we will have moved a significant step towards a system obtaining under totalitarian regimes where the reigning political power has operational control and direction of policing. Freedom to demonstrate peacefully has long been cherished in this country and authority to march or hold a protest meeting should be given only on public order grounds and without political consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09062210000239"></a>I have a short anecdote. A number of years ago I was considered to be a leading police figure in the fight against terrorism and in the art of negotiation. I

When I went to the capital city of a particular large but friendly state, as a matter of good practice I visited the commissioner of police before I began a series of lectures to police, military and government personnel within his country. His office was on the 18th floor of the police headquarters. I returned to the city three years later and took the lift to the 18th floor, ready to pay my courtesy call on the boss. &#147;Sorry, sir&#148;, said the local officer who accompanied me, &#147;the commissioner has now moved to a lower floor. These upper offices are now occupied by the police Minister and his staff&#148;. I got the message immediately, as had everyone else, no doubt. Operational decisions, direction and control were firmly in the hands of the politicians.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09062210000240"></a>Policing is too important to be left solely in the hands of politicians or indeed solely in the hands of the police. We must find a way to get the right balance for the benefit of the public we serve. Will we one day see a future mayor with an office on the upper floors of New Scotland Yard? I return to my main theme. If the mayor as chair of the authority can hold the commissioner and his or her top team to account, it is only right that the commissioner should have the power to appoint that top team. I understand that the outgoing Home Secretary, the mayor, the chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority and the deputy mayor for policing have acknowledged the good sense of the commissioner&#146;s suggestion that this should be the way forward.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09062210000241"></a>This is about leadership. The leader of an organisation like the Metropolitan Police with a staff of more than 30,000 personnel must have a vision of how to improve policing of the metropolis for the benefit of all law-abiding residents and for those who work in, visit or pass through this great city. He or she must articulate that vision, obtain public acceptance and then, together with loyal disciples, put it into practice. If those who are to turn the vision into reality are selected by anyone other than the commissioner, they may, because of influence from elsewhere, be going down a different path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09062221000001"></a>I re-emphasise that I do not advocate any change in the Bill relating to the selection of senior personnel in other than the Metropolitan Police. From my experience there is a much more transparent and&#151;dare I say?&#151;civilised approach, to such matters elsewhere. In my time as chief constable of Thames Valley Police, the selection board comprised the non-political chairman of the police authority and two members from each of the major political parties. As chief constable, the merits of the various candidates were discussed with me. Although the selection was rightly carried out by those members of the police authority, they would not have selected someone to whom I was opposed or have gone against my advice&#151;an altogether civilised approach to get the best, most suitable candidate for the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09062221000002"></a>London, however, is a different kettle of fish.

Let us not mince words. Sir Ian Blair was sacked. We can pussyfoot our way around with fine words about an amicable discussion, but the end of the story is that he was fired. He had to go; no alternative. The mayor had been voted in and he was not going anywhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09062221000003"></a>If the chairman of Thames Valley Police Authority, when I was chief constable, had said that he would no longer give me his support in running the force, I would have known which way he was pointing. I commend the amendment as a way of reducing the risk of party politics becoming unnecessarily involved in or influencing policing in our capital city.</p>

I have enormous respect for the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, whose views on most matters to do with policing I listen to with great interest, and I usually agree profoundly with what he says.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09062221000005"></a>On this occasion, however, I disagree profoundly with what he says. I think that he has misunderstood the current situation in London and the position of some of the key players. First, the amendment is a retrograde step, which goes against the philosophy and changes proposed in the Bill. It goes against the spirit of giving more control and say to local communities in the running of the police service, and it goes against ways of opening up the police service to the influence of the local community.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09062221000006"></a>I was distressed to hear the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, say that the amendment was proposed with the full knowledge and support of the present Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis. I have no reason to doubt that that is the case, but if so, it is a serious breach of faith between him and the police authority in London. This matter has not been discussed with the Metropolitan Police authority. It may have been the subject of private discussions with the Mayor of London and the deputy Mayor of London with responsibility for policing, but they have not expressed the views of the Metropolitan Police Authority. Were the amendment to be carried, it would increase rather than diminish the risk of politicisation of policing decisions in London. We would create a situation in which the commissioner was more likely to be set against the views and wishes of the police authority than one where the commissioner was working with the authority.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09062221000007"></a>In my time, I have chaired appointments panels for a large number of commanders, deputy assistant commissioners and assistant commissioners of the Metropolitan Police. I have participated in a number of such appointment panels subsequently. In all of those the commissioner has been an important adviser. As I understand the Bill, that position would be strengthened to give the commissioner the power essentially to veto. I think that it would be a veto if a commissioner said that he was not happy with a particular candidate. The proposal suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Imbert&#151;</p>

The arrangements in the Bill provide all the safeguards that the commissioner needs to have the sort of management team and people that he wants, but at the same time it makes clear the relevance and importance of public accountability of other senior officers. An assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is the equivalent of a chief constable outside London. Under this Bill, assistant chief constables and deputy chief constables will be clearly appointed by the police authority. This amendment would make London different. The result is likely to create more of a gulf between the commissioner and the police authority to which the person is accountable.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09062221000010"></a>In practice, if you are to carry the public of London with the difficult policing decisions that need to be taken, it is important that they, through the police authority, have confidence in those holding significant office. The arrangements that have been put in place will set up confidence rather than diminish it. The amendment would be a retrograde step and I hope that when responding, my noble friend will say that the Government also think that it is a retrograde step. As I say, I have the most enormous respect for the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, on most policing matters, but I hope that he will recognise that perhaps this is not a sensible way forward.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09062221000012"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, that party politics have absolutely no place in policing. I am sure that we all agree on that. I understand the concerns lying behind the amendment and the worry of a commissioner, or any chief constable who has to be judged by the team around them. They fear that while others choose the team, they will be judged on the team&#146;s performance, which could lead to problems. The fear is misplaced because appointments tend to be made by the chief and the police authority working closely together. It is rare for it not to work that way, but I understand the fear.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09062221000013"></a>As my noble friend said, outside London police chiefs are locally accountable to their authorities. I think that the same principle should apply in London. For those elements of policing that are relevant to London the commissioner has to be accountable to the Metropolitan Police Authority. I accept that there may be national functions for which the commissioner has direct responsibility to the Secretary of State. That is where policing in London differs because it has that twin element to it. For me, political proportionality is absolutely key. No police authority should be dominated by a political party one way or another. The biggest change that I have witnessed in policing since the 1990s is that many people who have worked with police authorities in the past 10 to 15 years have worked to make policing and police authorities non-party-political. To make the Association of Police Authorities an all-party-respected national body is crucial to this discussion. If I felt for a minute that the  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1388"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1388</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>police authority in London was unduly politicised, I would be much more concerned. I would certainly be more mindful to support the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09062221000014"></a>My worry is not for now but for the future; in this amendment, we see the dark shadow of the future. If we go down the road of direct election to police authorities&#151;if we go down the road of elected commissioners&#151;this issue about the politicisation of policing will come back to this House. That is why I am so vehemently opposed to some of the proposals I have heard. Police authorities and policing have to be above politics. That is a crucial principle, with which I am sure we would all agree.</p>

We heard everything he had to say, and while colleagues who have spoken so far may not have agreed with him, he has made his case clearly. I have no doubt the Minister will be glad that the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, has spoken in the way he has, with his long experience in police forces, not only as head of the Metropolitan Police, but also, of course, outside London.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09062221000016"></a>I find this an extremely difficult issue. In favour of the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, is the point that the Commissioner wants the very senior police commissioners and assistant commissioners around him on a day-to-day basis to work together as a coherent, harmonious team. That is in the interest of the running of the police force and, of course, in the public of London. On the other hand, there are the points that my noble colleagues have already made; one wants in the team surrounding the Metropolitan Commissioner&#151;assistant commissioners and commander&#151;people who are independently minded and who have their own views; people who will contribute, sometimes strongly, and perhaps to the irritation of the Commissioner, their views. It is important that the group surrounding the Commissioner is independently minded. It is also most important to avoid the risk, and the reality, of cronyism, which can come from appointments all being made at the top level by the Commissioner himself.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09062221000017"></a>I find this extremely difficult. Because it is so difficult, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, will consider the matter&#151;especially in the light of comments that were made by colleagues earlier in the debate; perhaps he will consider withdrawing the amendment. Ultimately, the accountability to the police authority is probably what should count in the creation not only of the Commissioner himself but of the most senior deputies and assistants who surround him; they are the equivalent, as one of my noble colleagues said, of a &#147;chief constable elsewhere&#148;, and therefore ought, perhaps, to be appointed by the authority itself.</p>

He is in fine form, having completed whatever course it was; the noble Lord&#146;s charming wife has been the regimental sergeant-major who has driven him down this route, and I have been filled with admiration for that as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09062221000019"></a>I would like to thank the noble Lord for raising the important issue of the senior appointment arrangements in the Metropolitan Police Service. As he knows, Clause 4 of the Bill already corrects an anomaly. Previously, the Commissioner had no formal voice in the appointment of officers at the rank of assistant commissioner, deputy assistant commissioner and commander. We have ensured that there is a formal role now for consultation.</p>

<a name="90622-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09062221000020"></a>The noble Lord is not alone in making the case to go further. The Metropolitan Police is unique in the scale of its operations and in the national functions that it carries. Under current arrangements this has meant that the MPA has to appoint a far larger number of senior officers than in any other force in this country. The Government are sympathetic to the view that this may not reflect the best balance of police authority oversight and leadership of the organisation by the Commissioner. After all, it would seem entirely reasonable for the most senior and accountable member of an organisation as large and with such wide-reaching functions as the Met to be able to have a full role in appointing his or her own senior staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09062221000021"></a>I take the point made by my noble friend Lord Borrie about the importance of having independence among one&#146;s subordinates, but it is always a question of balance. I would not have liked, on a ship of mine, a second in command who tried to run a totally different ship from the one I wanted. However, were such a change to be made, I am of the view that there should be a balancing change to the legislation concerning the removal of senior officers at the ranks that the Commissioner took responsibility for. It would be unusual to lead on the appointment of a senior team and then not even to be consulted were removal to be considered. Indeed not having this role may not be the best basis for generating confidence in those seeking appointment, and therefore potentially undermine such appointments at a very basic level.</p>

<a name="90622-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09062221000022"></a>However, I am also aware that there are differing views on this matter, for example those articulated by my noble friends Lord Harris of Haringey and Lady Henig. There are significant issues to consider. In particular, we need to ensure that any new arrangements for Met appointments will deliver improvements both to the strength and the diversity of leadership within the force. They will also need to ensure accountability and transparency so that the Commissioner could be held to account for the increased responsibility for appointments.</p>

<a name="90622-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09062221000023"></a>A key issue is where the line is clearest drawn between the oversight functions of the MPA and the leadership of the Commissioner, and whether this would include a change in the lead role for the strategic rank of assistant commissioner as well as the broader senior team. I welcome debate on this matter, but the MPA continuing to lead on assistant commissioners&#146; appointments would mean that the top three levels in the organisational structure were not appointed by the Commissioner, equivalent to the strategic appointments role taken by police authorities nationally.</p>

I do not see that position written into this clause, yet the present incumbent of that post had a great deal to do with the removal of the previous commissioner and the appointment of the new one&#151;and a very good choice it was. Is it intended that he, too, will have a hand in this? If so, where might that be written?</p>

<p><a name="09062221000130"></a>Is it intended to mean that candidates who are appointed will have been through the senior appointments panel before the appointments process or is it adding yet another stage to the appointments process so that after candidates have been through the senior appointments panel, having been short-listed and interviewed under a police authority process, they then have to go back for final approval by the Secretary of State? If it is the former rather than the latter, it seems a very cumbersome legislative way of expressing it. If it is the latter&#151;that is, if there is a three-stage process with candidates first having to be vetted by the senior appointments panel, then being appointed by the police authority in consultation with the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and then going for approval by the Secretary of State&#151;I think that we will have created a new situation. It seems to me unnecessarily cumbersome, with an element of control-freakery, for the Home Office to control who fills senior office in the Met.</p>

He seems to be saying that this is genuinely a three or perhaps a four-stage process. The first stage is that the Secretary of State gives approval to candidates to be interviewed through the senior appointments panel. The second stage is an interview by the police authority, and the third stage is consultation with the commissioner. However, there is then a fourth stage in which the Secretary of State either gives or declines to give approval to someone who has been through that process.

This took place just before local county council elections, which would have determined the political appointees to the police authority. It is they who are in the majority when the precept is agreed&#151;they must be in the majority. When the people of Surrey support the police authority&#151;which they did&#151;is it right that the Government should say, &#147;You have had your say, you have said that you want these people and what they are doing, yet in the interests of local democracy we know better, and we set aside your decision&#148;? Police authorities are aware of the need to keep the council tax down. They are also well aware of the efficiency opportunities in their area that they could take advantage of to do so. The Government are going beyond their role in stepping on what local people want.</p>

The proposed new clause suggests that police authorities do not already have the ability to determine their own local precepts. In fact, they already have the powers suggested by this amendment&#151;under Section 40 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, read with Section 19 of the Police Act 1996&#151;and will continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09062221000051"></a>More worryingly, the proposed new clause seeks to remove the Government&#146;s powers to cap police authorities. Ministers currently have powers under the Local Government Finance Act 1992&#151;amended by the Local Government Act 1999&#151;to cap excessive increases in council tax. These important powers protect council tax payers from excessive increases in council tax; but they are reserve powers, and are not used lightly. The Government are reluctant to cap, but cannot stand back and ignore circumstances where council tax payers are being subjected to excessive increases. It was a manifesto commitment that we would cap where such action was appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09062221000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, mentioned the Surrey police authority. The Government imposed a cap on its precept because, for the second year running, it was the only authority in England and Wales to propose an excessive increase in its precept. The noble Lord said that council tax payers in Surrey were happy about the increase. I do not know whether a survey showed that they were happy about the increase to their council tax&#151;in most places in Britain, people are not happy about such increases. The matter of the Surrey police authority has been raised a number of times in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09062221000053"></a>When capping action is initiated, authorities have a right to challenge their proposed caps, and Ministers are bound to consider their representations carefully before taking a final decision. Authorities can be confident that, under the current system, they can present their case and ensure that Ministers are fully aware of their circumstances before taking a final decision. This is being done. When a decision is taken to cap an authority in-year, or in advance for the following year, it is subject to the approval of the House of Commons unless an authority has accepted its proposed cap.</p>

<a name="90622-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09062221000054"></a>The proposed new clause goes on to remove the powers of the Secretary of State to make strategic policing priorities, performance targets and codes of practice. There will always be a need for national co-ordination of policing, so we will always need a national strategic framework to ensure that policing is being delivered efficiently and effectively. Strategic policing priorities, and the targets that flow from them, are vital to achieving this, as is the power to establish codes of conduct. They are always set at a very high level, stating what the Home Secretary thinks should be considered by police authorities when exercising their functions. They do not dictate how an authority acts or how it should act, but merely allow for a modest degree of national co-ordination of priorities. Removing them would mean that each authority would have to consult individually with the Secretary of State, and there would be no co-ordinated setting of priorities, as there is now.</p>

Their aim is to make collaboration effective. To do that, we have to make clear where the responsibility needs to lie to ensure that there is collaboration and that it does not undermine existing accountabilities.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09062221000059"></a>Ever since the Police Act was passed in 1996, each police authority has had a statutory duty to ensure that the police force for its area is efficient and effective. In addition, new arrangements were brought in three years ago under the Police and Justice Act, which gave a police authority the statutory duty to ensure that its force collaborates where this improves efficiency and effectiveness in policing for a wider area, not just for the area of its own force. Amendment 19 is therefore consistent with a police authority&#146;s existing duties. Against this, it is not currently the primary duty of chief officers to determine what is efficient and effective, which the amendment makes clear. The Bill allows room for confusion to be created about who should determine efficiency and effectiveness in the context of collaboration.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09062221000060"></a>One would hope that disagreements about whether to collaborate would rarely, if ever, arise between a police authority and its chief officer, but if this were to happen the Bill&#146;s wording would simply result in deadlock. Potentially, this could be fully resolved only by the police authority firing the chief officer, which would be a rather unsatisfactory resolution, not least for the chief officer. The legislation therefore needs to be clear about who has the ultimate accountability for ensuring collaboration. The amendment would achieve this by removing the reference to the chief officer&#146;s judgment about efficiency and effectiveness. The key driver would then become the provision in the clause that follows: that a chief officer may make a collaboration agreement only with the approval of the police authority. That is consistent with current legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09062221000061"></a>The second amendment in the group&#151;Amendment 21, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, will speak&#151;reinforces this approach and the overarching role of the police authority to determine what is efficient and effective.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09062221000063"></a>The noble Baroness has already spoken about the background to the amendments, so I will not repeat it. I agree with her that the Bill needs to be clear about where the ultimate accountability rests in order to ensure collaboration. I also agree with her that this is not clear at the moment, for the reasons that she outlined. Collaboration is really too important to leave this open to interpretation.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09062221000064"></a>My amendment would add to Amendment 19 and make this crystal clear. It would provide that a police authority could approve a police force collaboration agreement only if it believed that the agreement was in the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of one or more police forces. This is consistent with the police authorities&#146; existing powers and would reiterate this in the context of force collaboration agreements.</p>

I particularly take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, that firing the chief police officer would be a draconian move. I also very much support the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond.</p>

It is right that efficiency and effectiveness should be the test used in assessing whether a joint approach is the best approach to follow when considering such an agreement. Police authorities have the central function of ensuring that the policing of their areas is efficient and effective, so they have a wider responsibility to support these aims for the community through collaboration.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09062221000067"></a>My noble friend Lady Henig talked about the chief officer being asked to judge efficiency and effectiveness. There is no question but that the ultimate judgment of efficiency and effectiveness should be made by police authorities. This links into one of their core functions and goes to the heart of their purpose, but that does not mean that a chief police officer should have no regard to these considerations. It is also important to remember that a chief police officer is depended on for his professional judgment of operational effectiveness, and it would be wrong to undervalue the importance of his advice on how policing is best delivered in our communities.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09062221000068"></a>The concern behind these two amendments is that this position should be upheld. Amendment 19 would remove the consideration of efficiency and effectiveness from chief officers, while Amendment 21 would clarify that it was the basis on which police authorities must approve agreements. However, these changes are not necessary as, under the provisions that we are bringing forward, the police authority&#146;s judgment is the deciding one and the police authority would not approve the agreement if it did not consider it to be in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09062221000069"></a>In addition, the amendments may overlook the fact that police forces are expected to deliver efficient and effective services, for which their authorities hold them

Therefore, both the chief officer and the police authority can be relied on for their professional judgment to propose agreements that will deliver operational effectiveness. Both the chief officer and his authority will bear in mind the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal when considering the options for collaboration and I suggest that any alternative position should be questioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09062221000070"></a>Nothing in Clause 5 contradicts the existing statutory responsibilities of police authorities to deliver an efficient and effective police force, so I suggest that the amendments are unnecessary and ask that they not be pressed.</p>

I have listened carefully to what my noble friend has just said. I agree with him that the police authorities have an absolutely central function in ensuring efficiency and effectiveness. I also hear what he says about the chief officer needing to have regard particularly to operational effectiveness. This takes me back to the old days when police officers used to say to us, &#147;That is operational and you can&#146;t interfere&#148;. We have moved on from those days. We have agreed that there are strategic discussions to be had and that the police authority shares with the chief officer the responsibility for strategic oversight and has this very important judgment to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09062221000072"></a>I was pleased to hear my noble friend say that the police authorities&#146; judgment was the deciding judgment. If that is the case, we do not seem to be carrying this logic through. If the police authority has this deciding role, in the interests of clarity that needs to be underlined and made clear in the legislation. I submit, with respect, that the situation is not clearly defined at the moment. I do not totally support my noble friend&#146;s argument, as logic suggests that we should not be afraid of spelling out what this entails, which is that the police authority should be the deciding voice, as my amendment suggests. I will withdraw the amendment, but we might need to return to this at a later stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09062221000075"></a>Such agreements, which are being strongly promoted by Home Office Ministers, would see individual forces creating collaborative arrangements to deliver protective services across their respective force areas. This push for collaboration arose from an HMIC assessment that protective services, particularly in relation to serious organised crime, murder or counterterrorism, were patchy across different forces. The union&#146;s concern over collaboration agreements is that they will have major implications for the location and, potentially, terms and conditions of its members who are police staff. Police staff involved in collaborative projects may have to relocate to another force area and come under the management of a different force while remaining the employee of their parent force.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09062221000076"></a>The amendment would require each chief constable to consult his or her UNISON branch to ensure that all workforce matters work properly and are at least properly considered in the context of collaborative plans. The union has discussed the amendment in principle with the Police Minister, Vernon Coaker, and, although the Government indicated that they would not support putting the amendment on the face of the Bill, they had intended that the intention behind the amendment would find expression in the statutory guidance to follow the Act. Therefore, David Taylor MP&#151;a good friend of mine in the other place&#151;tabled the amendment at Report stage in the House of Commons with the aim of this intention being confirmed in<I> Hansard. </I>Unfortunately, the amendment was not debated, due to the volume of business being considered&#151;and, if I might add, due to the inadequate arrangements for scrutiny of legislation in the House of Commons. I hope that my noble friend will look sensitively at this amendment today. I beg to move.</p>

I am at a bit of a loss to understand how their terms and conditions might be affected, as I understood the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, to say they might be if staff were moved to a different area. Again, there would have been consultation&#151;certainly in the police authority areas that I know that are good employers&#151;with the police authorities and certainly with the chief constable. If statutory guidance is going to be given under the Bill, I would welcome that, because this needs reinforcing if it is felt that it is lacking at the moment and that the Bill does not cover it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09062221000079"></a>It would be inconsistent with other provisions in the Police Act to include a provision in the clause on police collaboration agreements to mandate consultation with bodies representing employees, as there is no similar provision about consulting them on other strategic

I think that it would be unnecessary, too. It is well recognised that collaborative working impacts on the work of some police staff. For this reason, the statutory guidance supporting the revised framework will make clear the need to involve unions and staff associations representing the interests not only of employees but of warranted officers. I think that that was the statutory guidance to which my noble friend referred. That will be done from early on in the development of collaboration projects. This is one of the lessons learnt by those already engaged in collaborations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09062221000080"></a>The essence of the amendment is certainly very good advice, and we encourage the approach, but it does not need to be enshrined in statute. In developing the statutory guidance, unions and staff associations are among the wide range of interested parties being consulted. I might point out that UNISON, which represents the majority of police authority employees, and the Police Federation have both signalled their desire to contribute and are doing so through the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales.</p>

This clause did not appear when the Bill was first published; an even more draconian variant was included at the Committee stage in the other place. This was subsequently replaced at the Report stage and Third Reading with the current wording, for which much thanks&#151;or some thanks.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09062221000087"></a>The problem with the clause lies in the complexities of the employment status of police staff. They are employees of the authority but, as long as they are employed to assist the force as opposed to the authority, they remain under the direction and control of the chief officer. Under the collaboration provisions, police authorities are directly responsible for making agreements that relate to support services, including making collaborative arrangements about payroll services, fleet management and so on, but in practice this will be administered by police staff who are under the direction and control of the chief officer.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09062221000088"></a>The clause, therefore, again muddles responsibility and accountability for collaboration. It suggests that a police authority must seek the permission of the chief officer to use staff whom it employs to provide support to an agreement for which it is responsible. This effectively gives chief officers a veto over police authority collaboration agreements. This is totally unacceptable, as it hampers authorities in fulfilling their statutory duty to secure collaboration.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09062221000089"></a>In addition, the current wording would have the effect of reinstating the provision that was in the old Section 15 of the Police Act 1996. This was removed through the Police and Justice Act 2006 but, prior to that, an authority effectively had to get its chief officer&#146;s agreement to provide human resources for itself.

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09062221000090"></a>The amendment more accurately reflects the situation that should exist, which is that a police authority should consult a chief officer before entering into a collaboration agreement that affects staff who are under his direction and control, but it should not have to seek his permission to collaborate. Noble Lords will require no prompting from me to recognise the absurdity of the situation. The police authority is the governing body of the police force&#151;we keep repeating that&#151;and to suggest that it should have to seek permission from the body that it governs in order to fulfil its own duties is to turn governance completely on its head.</p>

<a name="90622-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09062221000093"></a>The amendment would enable police authorities to include plans for police staff under a collaboration agreement without needing first to get the approval of the chief officer who has been delegated control over them. They are all employees of the police authority, because the police force is not empowered to be an employer. However, to all intents and purposes, they work for the police force under the chief officer&#146;s direction and control. If a chief officer were to challenge a police authority proposal under these provisions, the authority should take account of his concerns. One would expect that such a discussion would follow the normal course of debate between the chief officer and his authority in order to reach an agreement weighing up the concerns of both sides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09062221000094"></a>The power of direction and control is a necessary part of a chief officer&#146;s operational independence. If it were made open to interference, his authority would be undermined. However, having heard the debate, I should like to look into the matter a little further. It seems that there might be an anomaly and I should like to clarify it. On that basis, I would ask for the amendment to be withdrawn. I will look at this in detail and come back on that specific point.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09062221000097"></a>At the heart of this lies a tension between lines of control and lines of accountability under what are, essentially, joint ventures. These arrangements cross defined geographical boundaries in a situation where different bodies are responsible for governance and for operational responsibility. Under existing collaboration agreements, difficulties have arisen about indemnities relating to grievance and other claims against police officers who are acting under the terms of collaboration agreements. At present, the &#147;home&#148; force of a police officer retains responsibility to indemnify or otherwise cover any grievance or other claims which arise from that officer&#146;s actions. This remains the case even in a situation where that officer is acting under a collaboration agreement which places him under the command and control of another chief officer. In effect, this means that forces and authorities must provide indemnity for police officers against actions over which they may have no control when a collaboration agreement comes into play.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09062221000098"></a>The amendment closes this loophole. It enables responsibility for indemnities to be transferred to the force responsible for command and control where this is the most appropriate course of action. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="09062221000099"></a><b><a name="90622-0010.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062221000218"></a>Baroness Henig:</b> I strongly support the amendment which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, said, covers the loophole that currently exists. It provides a stronger basis for ensuring that collaboration arrangements operate effectively and that indemnities are given to cover situations as necessary.</p>

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="09062221000100"></a><b><a name="90622-0010.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062221000219"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> The two amendments raise the sensible point that indemnities which may need to be part of the detail of a collaboration arrangement should be considered before any agreement is made. The agreement may also need to set out where the responsibility for indemnities lies. It is a sensible point and sound advice.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09062221000101"></a>However, a permissive provision of this kind, in addition to the provisions already set out in proposed new Section 23B on payments, is not necessary to enable the inclusion of these details. I can confirm that it is intended that indemnity arrangements can and should be included by virtue of this new section.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09062221000102"></a>While I do not believe it is necessary to state indemnity specifically in statute, this is a useful piece of advice that will be included among the planned recommendations in the statutory guidance that the Secretary of State will be issuing to support the provisions along with many other subjects. It would be inappropriate to include all such details in primary legislation and trust that this House would agree that guidance based on best practice is a sensible place. The fact that it is in <I>Hansard</I> has been extremely useful. I thank the noble Baronesses for making this important point and placing it on the record with the fact that indemnity should be included along with other payments in proposed new Section 23B. I hope that on that basis the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.</p>

This provision is unnecessary and is more likely to kill collaboration than encourage it. First, police authorities must already report collaboration agreements to the Secretary of State as efficiencies in one form or another, largely through their policing plans, which must still be lodged with the Home Secretary, although information on other efficiencies is also gathered through performance frameworks and audit. I am not altogether clear between these existing reporting arrangements and the overarching duty on police authorities to secure efficiency and effectiveness what the Home Secretary adds by being consulted in this way.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09062221000107"></a>On the contrary, there seem to be a number of disbenefits. It would add another layer of bureaucracy when the Home Office claims to be reducing bureaucracy. It would lead to delays in decision making and consequently delays to bring improvements in policing. It seems to fly in the face of the Green Paper proposals for more local devolution. If the intention is to retain a strategic grip at the centre, why is there no de minimis provision? Even low value minor agreements will require consultation with the Secretary of State if they involve more than six parties, as proposed, which begins to look like micromanagement.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09062221000108"></a>For example, a number of police authorities might decide to share a member of staff to help with technical interpretation of forced performance information, or they might put in a joint bid for funding, perhaps to support an initiative linked to anti-social behaviour. Does that really need the Secretary of State&#146;s permission?  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1406"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1406</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Taken together, those requirements are likely to act as a deterrent and disincentive to collaboration. Collaboration should be encouraged by incentives, not stifled by bureaucracy. Speaking in the sixth sitting of the Public Bill Committee on the Policing and Crime Bill on 3 February, my honourable friend Paul Holmes said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="09062221000161"></a>&#147;It would be a huge culture shock for any Minister&#151;be it policing, education, or health&#151;to give up micro-managing all these aspects of life. The Minister said that it could not happen and it could not work, but it does in most western democratic countries where central Governments do not have power over decisions on local health provision, the police force, education and so forth. It is a culture shock that one day, hopefully, the British Government will get to grips with&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Policing and Crime Bill Committee, 3/2/2009; col. 209.]</p>

<p><a name="09062221000132"></a>I agree with his sentiments and hope that the Minister will be able to give me some reassurance.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09062221000109"></a>Finally, it is completely unclear to me how &#147;six parties&#148; is defined. If police authorities and police forces enter agreements together, does it mean that the provision will be triggered if more than three police areas wanted to work together on something? I beg to move.</p>

We have not explored in great detail the Government&#146;s proposals about collaboration. As I understand it, collaboration could extend from anything to do with IT and amalgamating the behind-office organisation to security and employing detectives across the piece. There seems to be a host of areas where such collaboration could take place. There is interesting wording, which is not six or more other &#147;authorities&#148; but six or more other &#147;parties&#148;. How is &#147;parties&#148; to be defined? The collaboration agreements as I understand them are to be with other police forces, but parties is a different word. I wonder whether there is an expectation that collaboration can take place with, for example, a local authority.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09062221000111"></a>An agreement to have an arrangement to share payroll with a local authority would open up a wider debate on where the collaboration is going to take us. Perhaps when the Minister replies he could expand a little more on where the collaboration agreements are going to go, how widely they are going to go and whether they can be wider than between police forces.</p>

I would like to reassure them that the Bill&#146;s provisions are not intended as a form of micromanagement being imposed on the police service because the Home Office does not trust it to make its own judgment on collaboration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09062221000113"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, properly pointed out, the police have been carrying out collaborations for a long time. For that reason there is no blanket requirement for all collaboration plans to be given the Government&#146;s stamp of approval. However, where agreements are so geographically extensive that they exceed even the largest of the ACPO policing regions&#151;six police force areas being the largest for these regions&#151;that would represent a strategically significant development of which the Government would want to be aware as  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1407"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1407</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>early as possible. It is possible that such planned agreements could work against broader plans nationally. The Home Office and its police partners would need to ensure that such a conflict did not arise. That is why we are looking at that provision. Under the new provisions, individual collaboration agreements can be made only by forces or police authorities. A collaboration involving six forces and six authorities will therefore be formed using two agreements of six parties each under the legislation. Therefore such collaboration would not trigger the safeguard, but if it was greater, it would.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09062221000114"></a>That concern was raised by Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary during the consultation with the police service on the legislation&#146;s development. There was general agreement that a mechanism was needed with as light a touch as possible to guard against that eventuality. I am happy to clarify that we are determined that the process of seeking approval in such a case would not impose any significant burden, although I appreciate that timing can be an issue. Large-scale agreements are not made overnight and early notice of such plans on the scale being considered should allow the Secretary of State, with the advice of HMIC, ample room to confirm within the appropriate time frame that there is no conflict.</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09062221000115"></a>In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, we are trying to look at collaboration across the board at all levels, covering almost everything, so that we can work better and more closely together. As I say, we are looking at these larger-scale collaboration agreements as ones where we would like to monitor and take action, while in the smaller-scale agreements we would let people get on with it themselves. For the reasons I have given, I cannot agree to the proposed amendment. I hope that, on the basis of these assurances, the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09062221000117"></a>In my area, North Yorkshire, a very large rural area crossing the whole of England almost at the top of the country, we collaborate with West Yorkshire, Humberside and South Yorkshire. That is an enormous region. Is it then considered necessary for that huge rural area with a mix of urban and rural forces&#151;mainly urban, with South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire&#151;to collaborate with, say, Cleveland just over one side of the border and Cumbria on the other? Would that trigger the six parties? Would the Home Secretary say that those two little forces that made up the six had triggered his wanting to know what was going on?</p>

<a name="90622-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09062221000118"></a>I ask this because it seems strange, although and I do not know whether the Minister is able to reply. Little Cleveland has a tiny force just to the north of North Yorkshire, where everyone can be hurled together in 30 minutes&#151;the whole of the police force can be at police headquarters in that time. Cumbria may not be quite like that but, again, it is a big rural area, on the edge of North Yorkshire. I still do not see the point of the six parties being specified so clearly. Will the Minister comment on that before I think about withdrawing my amendment?</p>

As I understand it, the collaboration agreement can be entered into by either the police authority or the chief officer, in which case both sides have to consult the other. A police authority cannot enter a collaboration agreement without having consulted the chief officer, and a chief officer cannot enter into a collaborative agreement without the agreement of the police authority. If they all agree to the collaboration, that is fine&#151;but what if they do not agree, to stop it? How does the consultation go again?</p>

Or, the other way around, the chief officer who entered into it thinks it ought to stop, but the police authority does not think so. Where does the authority actually lie for terminating those agreements if there is a disagreement between one police authority and its chief officer?</p>

They must therefore show a degree of commitment that I believe collaborations require. That protects the group as a whole from the dangers of losing a partner, and I argue that it is more important to protect the group than to allow each party the freedom to unilaterally withdraw once that agreement has been made.

Equally, it could be argued that if the participants were not prepared to make this commitment, the case for a particular collaboration may need to be questioned.

It has consulted with its chief officer, who has said, &#147;OK, I don&#146;t mind doing that&#148;. After two years, though, the police authority says, &#147;This absolutely is not working&#148;, or, &#147;It is far too expensive&#148;, or, &#147;We think that it&#146;s time that we viewed it again&#148;, and the police authority on the other side of the agreement is quite happy about that. However, the chief officer, with whom they consulted originally and whose agreement they had to have, says, &#147;I don&#146;t agree with you. The chief officer on the other side and I think that the agreement is wonderful and is working spectacularly well&#148;. Who has the authority to finally decide that the agreement can be ended? This is a disagreement in one particular police authority between that police authority and its chief officer.</p>

The first paragraph would make it explicit that police authorities and their police forces could enter agreements jointly. I am not convinced that this is currently clear in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09062244000002"></a>On the contrary, the way in which the Bill is drafted makes an absolute distinction between operational agreements&#151;to be entered into by police forces&#151;and agreements relating to support services, which are to be entered into by police authorities. This distinction also implies an absolute separation of the two functions, which is much more sharply drawn than in the current legislation governing collaboration. It is true that this allows for separate force and authority agreements, but it is less precise about the exact nature of these agreements. Because existing legislation is, in some senses, more permissive than the replacement now being proposed, it has been customary to enter into many collaboration agreements jointly, as between force and authority. This makes sense where an essentially operational agreement requires support services to make it effective. In fact, it is hard to think of any area of collaboration that is so operationally focused that it would not require some element of administrative back-up. Perhaps, to a lesser extent, the argument also holds the other way around, when collaboration might focus on administrative support but impact on some element of operational policing.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09062244000003"></a>The point of this section of the Bill is to improve on existing legislation to better enable collaboration and bring greater clarity to the respective roles of the authority and the force. This is to be supported, but I fear that, unless the Bill explicitly permits joint arrangements, it will have the opposite effect. I know the Minister will argue that this is unnecessary because there is nothing in the legislation that says joint agreements cannot be entered into, but I am not convinced that it is so straightforward. The existing wording at least implies that joint agreements are not possible because of the absolute separation of functions. If this is so, it would render most existing collaboration agreements unworkable and prevent, rather than encourage, a significant proportion of new agreements.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09062244000004"></a>The second paragraph ensures that any police force collaboration agreement that commits a police authority to a financial or legal liability must include that police authority as a party to that agreement. This refers largely to the position of police authorities as both employers to the police and budget holders for their force, with a duty of care to their employees and a financial stewardship for the budget. The amendment acknowledges this position and puts in place arrangements that prevent an authority&#146;s legal liabilities being compromised through agreements that might otherwise be outside their control. In moving this amendment, I reiterate that it is designed to be helpful and bring greater clarity to the impetus to encourage more widespread and effective collaboration. I beg to move.</p>

There is no need for me to reiterate what the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, has said.

It would be very helpful if that distinction could be cleared up.</p>

It has been suggested that such a separation indicates that police forces cannot engage with their authorities and come to agreements with them about the details of the collaborative work that they want to do. This divide is not new; it is also in the current legislation. Both the current and new provisions provide for separate agreements to preserve the important distinctions between the functions of forces and authorities. It would not have made sense to confer power on chief officers to agree matters relating to the exercise of functions by their police authority, and vice versa. Neither would it have made sense for two chief officers to decide how they are to be held to account. These two groups will be signing up to wholly different agreements, reflecting their own responsibilities. However, this is not to say that authorities and forces will not work together to ensure effective collaboration. In practice, a substantial collaborative enterprise normally involves both kinds of agreement in parallel. These new provisions continue to support agreements in which all the parties come together and sign up to an arrangement where each agrees to their specific role.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09062244000007"></a>The wording of the amendment is intended to ensure that police authorities will always be party to agreements by their forces when police force collaboration plans impose a legal liability on them. Under the provisions that we are bringing in, police authorities will have to be involved in all police force collaboration agreements. Under Section 23(6) they must approve all police force agreements. Therefore, they will need to approve any liability imposed upon them. They will also need to consider their own agreements to facilitate jointly the force collaboration. Under new Section 23D the authorities must agree on the arrangements to be followed to ensure that accountability for the force collaboration will be delivered, and must publish those arrangements alongside the details of the collaboration agreement.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09062244000008"></a>The agreement between the forces and the agreement between the authorities will most likely take the form of a single collaboration document that satisfies the legislation in both the current Section 23 and the new provisions. There is no need to specify that both sorts of agreement can be combined in a single document but this practice will no doubt continue and indeed will be provided for in example agreements that will be included with the supporting guidance that we intend to publish. On the basis of this assurance that the intention of the amendment is already served by the draft provisions, I ask that it be withdrawn.</p>

Amendment 28 aims to put beyond doubt the arrangements about police accountability under the collaboration provisions set out in this section. It strengthens the other parts of the section, which I welcome as a genuine attempt to bring clarity to this tricky area, aiming to set out how chief officers will be held to account under collaboration arrangements. This has proved difficult in practice under existing arrangements, and it is crucially important to get this right under the new proposals. While I agree that the Bill makes a good start, I am not convinced that the existing wording adequately covers collaboration arrangements overseen by joint committees of the police authorities involved. The amendment is therefore specifically designed to address this situation.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09062244000011"></a>The existing wording in this clause seems merely to reiterate that a police authority holds its own chief officer to account, which is something that authorities do under existing legislation in any case. It does not seem to deal adequately with the complexities of holding to account for arrangements that extend beyond the boundary of the police authority concerned. This might occur when a force&#146;s chief officer conducts operations in another force area under a collaboration agreement. There are difficulties in squaring this accountability circle at present. On the one hand, there is uncertainty as to whether the home authority can ask a chief officer to answer to it over conduct outside its area. On the other, there is doubt about whether the authority in whose area the officer is operating can hold him or her to account. This is generally overcome by those authorities forming a joint committee, but in the past some chief officers have questioned the authority of a joint committee to hold them to account. While joint arrangements are mentioned in subsection (3), these are oblique and do not seem explicitly to deal with accountability. Because accountability and answerability are fundamental in getting collaboration right, the arrangements to make this work in a joint context need to be clear and beyond doubt in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09062244000013"></a>At present, unlike other local government bodies, a police authority is not allowed to arrange for any of its functions to be discharged by another police authority. This prohibition is set out in Section 107 of the Local Government Act 1972. In 1972, when this Act came into force, police authorities were still committees of local authorities, as I explained earlier. In those circumstances, it was inappropriate for police authorities to have an independent legal status outside of their councils, and to arrange for another police authority to carry out their functions. But since 1995, police authorities have had an independent legal status, yet remain covered by arrangements which are no longer appropriate in this respect. This restriction has a particularly detrimental effect on joint procurement. Local authorities that wish to make joint procurement arrangements will usually nominate one authority to take the lead on behalf of the other authorities involved. This is usually the authority with the most expertise and experience to manage the procurement process, while other authorities contribute to the cost on a pro rata basis.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09062244000014"></a>However, these arrangements are predicated on being able to delegate certain functions. So this option is denied to police authorities, which cannot arrange for another authority to discharge their functions, including arranging for and awarding contracts. In practical terms this means that every authority or force taking part in collaborative procurement arrangements has to be a legal party and signatory to the procurement contract, to avoid falling foul of this section of the 1972 Act. Naturally, the result is needless bureaucracy and a disincentive to collaboration. The amendment would resolve this situation and so facilitate much greater collaboration, particularly in relation to procurement, which has driven significant efficiencies in local government.</p>

As regards collaborative arrangements, it is extremely important that a mechanism is set up to see that joint arrangements are working. I suspect that there would have to be&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, suggested&#151;a joint committee made up of members from each of the authorities involved. Given that the police authorities are not able to delegate, it is vital that proper arrangements are in place to ensure that the collaborative work can be carried out satisfactorily in terms of legalities and supervision. There is a lot to be said for this amendment and I hope that the Minister will be able to accept it.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09062244000017"></a>However, the Local Government Act 1972, by virtue of Sections 101(1) and 107(1)(a), already allows police

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09062244000018"></a>Amendment 36A also concerns the Local Government Act and its provisions regarding the exercise of the functions of police authorities. As already noted, this Act is useful in allowing joint police authority committees to deliver accountability functions under a collaboration agreement. In this way a police authority can already deliver some of its duties jointly under the Local Government Act, such as that of holding a chief constable who is leading a collaboration agreement to account for his work on that joint endeavour.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09062244000019"></a>However, the principle that the police authority is ultimately responsible for policing in its own area is sound and should remain at the core of what a police authority is all about, whether it exercises that responsibility collaboratively or independently. Even in those cases where collaboration takes a lead force approach, each police authority needs to continue to be involved as the body with overall responsibility for policing of its area.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09062244000020"></a>There may be some merit in the suggestion which has been put forward recently by the Association of Police Authorities that some employment and procurement difficulties in collaborations might be eased by the ability to delegate to each other some of the functions relating to those areas. These are complex areas and we would not want to make any such amendment before examining the detail and the extent of any such proposal, and giving it close consideration.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09062244000021"></a>But I beg to suggest that this amendment is too sweeping in its wording and would allow a police authority to divest itself of any or all of its core functions. I question whether this House would support enabling one police authority to delegate to another all responsibility for holding its chief officer to account for the delivery of policing on, say, counterterrorism, or its responsibility to promote equality and diversity.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09062244000022"></a>I know, however, that a number of police authorities are firmly of the opinion that an amendment of some kind to the police authority provisions in the Local Government Act would be of genuine benefit to collaborations on procurement in particular&#151;procurement is an issue very close to my heart&#151;and I would welcome further work between the Home Office and the association to examine such an approach.

That would be useful for police authorities, police forces, local government and anybody else who has a role in the matter.

<a name="09062244000029"></a><b><a name="90622-0011.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09062244000147"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> I was delighted to see that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, spotted the irony of the amendment, which I have to say runs the risk of adding significant unnecessary bureaucracy for those who have entered into a collaboration agreement. It could deter some from entering into joint working arrangements; I am not convinced that it would do that, but it would add to bureaucracy. Since the Flanagan review, cutting back on bureaucracy has become an important aim of the Government, something about which we have been whipped by a number of people, so we take it very seriously. In that sense, the amendment would be a backward step.</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09062244000030"></a>The Government have a clear role in setting the strategic direction and steering police collaboration in a way that benefits policing in the round, but the role of the centre should be limited to when it is really needed. That balance will not be achieved by the amendment. I understand why the amendment was tabled but police authorities already have, and under this clause will continue to benefit from, a clear remit to hold to account and oversee how policing is delivered in their policing area. That is no different for collaboration, and Clause 5 makes adequate arrangements for that. At the local level, the authorities need to pull data together; I agree that it would be useful to draw on that to see how collaboration is working. However, the amendment would do nothing other than add to bureaucracy, so on that basis I ask that it be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09062244000032"></a>We are all interested in getting rid of bureaucracy, but we ought to ensure that we learn lessons. None of this legislation may work; it may work beautifully, but it may not. There is a responsibility on those legislating to know how it is working.

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09062244000034"></a>The Secretary of State remains on stage, because the amendments in this group seek to explore the involvement that the Secretary of State will have in collaboration agreements. We have been discussing the subject in other forms today. The Bill allows for both guidance and directions. Is it really appropriate for the Government to give directions about an agreement directly to a chief officer, over the head of his police authority?</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1417"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1417</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90622-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09062244000035"></a>Do the Government intend to publish guidance under new Section 23F, or is it being introduced as a reserve power in case authorities and officers do not implement these agreements as intended? Is the direction power there merely to back up the guidance if it proves insufficient, or does the Minister imagine the Government taking a proactive role in seeking out opportunities for collaboration agreements and forcing authorities to engage in them?</p>

<a name="90622-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09062244000036"></a>Given the intrusiveness that the two new sections allow, Amendment 31 in this group, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Harris and Lady Miller, seems very wise. Indeed, it seems sensible to require the consultation of not only ACPO and the APA, but the affected authority or chief officer. Similarly, Amendment 34 seems entirely in line with the Government's intentions and is another amendment we would support. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09062244000038"></a>Amendment 31 is relatively straightforward and would ensure that the Secretary of State had to consult the APA and ACPO before issuing guidance about collaboration. That is only common sense, as they are the bodies responsible at national level for the other legs of the tripartite police governance arrangement. They are also the bodies with the practical experience of collaboration to be in a position to ensure that any guidance is workable.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09062244000039"></a>My remaining amendments essentially approach the same problem in slightly different ways. That problem is, of course and yet again, the wide-ranging powers for the Secretary of State set out in the new section about directions. The powers are particularly pernicious, because at best they can generously be interpreted as micromanagement, but at worst they represent a means by which policing could be restructured through the back door. I am sure that the Minister will assure me that that is definitely not the intention of the Government but, once the powers are there, someone someday might find it convenient to use them in a way which was not originally intended.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09062244000040"></a>My first and preferred solution would be to remove the powers altogether. That is the approach taken in Amendment 32. Incidentally, that would also apply to the following new section, which is about terminating collaboration agreements, but one amendment in that respect will suffice to make my point. However, I am sure that the Minister will remind us all how important the future stability and resilience of policing is. No doubt he will argue that the Secretary of State should, in extremis, be able to exercise powers to ensure that the police service is fit to meet the very real challenges it faces from serious crime and other such threats.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09062244000041"></a>Therefore, I have also suggested an alternative approach to moderating the way in which the powers of direction can be used. Amendment 34 levels the playing field to ensure that the Secretary of State must use the same criteria demanded of police authorities in judging whether or not to collaborate. That would ensure that the yardstick for all must be efficiency and effectiveness, and that the Home Secretary cannot exercise the draconian  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1418"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1418</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>powers using other, unspecified criteria. Amendment 35 then provides that the powers of direction can only be used following the arrangements in Sections 40 and 40B of the Police Act 1996. Those sections set out very specific criteria and processes by which the Home Secretary can give directions to police authorities and chief officers. It would mean that directions could be triggered only when there was evidence that existing arrangements were failing to support adequate performance.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09062244000042"></a>The new section also ensures that directions can only be given to chief officers through the police authority. That is a very important safeguard to prevent direct political interference in policing by central government, and is a fundamental tenet of ensuring that policing is kept independent of the state. In addition, the powers of direction under the new section are subject to HMIC's view about the merits of the proposed direction. Finally, the authorities and forces concerned must be given an opportunity to make representations about the proposals.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09062244000043"></a>In tabling the amendments, I have sought to restrict what are very draconian, centralising powers. If the powers cannot be removed from the Bill altogether, they at least require reasonable checks and balances to ensure that they are not misused.</p>

The first amendments aim to take out the direction powers that the Secretary of State would have to help shape the future of policing in the area, something that the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament for. They would also remove the Secretary of State&#146;s power to publish guidance to support the implementation of the provisions.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09062244000045"></a>One of the key reasons for bringing forward the clauses on collaboration is to ensure that this increasingly important means by which to deliver policing benefits from a clear and robust framework that Parliament can approve. At the heart of this is the empowerment of police forces and authorities to enter into collaboration agreements where that is in the interest of policing. However, as the person accountable to Parliament for policing, an equally important part of this is the power for the Secretary of State to be able to ensure that collaboration is done in a way that benefits policing generally, and that arrangements are coherent, transparent and, where possible, consistent. That is not only sensible but constitutionally sound.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09062244000046"></a>If this is to be achieved in reality, any Secretary of State will need the requisite powers to influence collaboration when it is deemed to be in the interest of the overall efficiency and effectiveness of policing. Powers to direct are not new. Indeed, the powers to direct in this area of business replicate and provide clarity to the broad powers that the previous Government enacted through the Police Act 1996. Other direction powers that the Secretary of State already has under legislation that predates this Government give the Secretary of State powers of direction over elements of policing such as performance, priorities and policing areas. These powers, as is the case with our clauses, are  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1419"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1419</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be exercised in consultation with the parties affected. This continues to be a sensible way for these arrangements to proceed.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09062244000047"></a>There is a view that any direction given under this new legislation should be in accordance with the arrangements under the Police Act 1996, in particular Sections 40 to 40B. However, these sections deal typically with forces and authorities found, via a report by Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate, to have failed to discharge their functions effectively. While these clauses might be capable of enabling actions to be taken to remedy an individual force&#146;s failings, there might be wider strategic reasons, such as a move towards certain operational services being delivered at the regional level, which warrant central direction of a different kind.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09062244000048"></a>Directions of the sort described would need to be given both to the police forces involved to incorporate the changes to their structure and to the police authorities to incorporate the appropriate changes to accountability arrangements resulting. It is right to use Sections 40 and 40A to react to failings in performance, but, as we stated in the policing Green Paper, if we are to best serve the public interest, we must proactively engage with the service, including HMIC, and proactively determine where robust and consistent collaboration is needed. Directions here would serve to consolidate a consensus and not simply be used as a last resort, which is what lies behind Section 40. In addition, Section 40 goes no way towards specifying the sorts of directions about collaboration that may be given. The new provision in this subsection provides this clarification. As the Home Affairs Select Committee highlighted recently, there may well be a need to require collaboration to deliver improvements in certain policing areas, and where this is the case, it is right for Government to exercise their powers to achieve this. However, a prerequisite is for Government to have the powers in the first place.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="90622-0012.htm_spopq0"></a><a name="09062244000049"></a>The case for a more robust and consistent collaboration is emerging, with collaboration on functions such as serious organised crime growing. In the light of this progress across policing, we have already asked Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary to work with partners to scope what policing functions could usefully benefit from a more robust collaborative framework. It has, in turn, highlighted a number of areas where it is arguably in the public interest to proceed in a consistent manner across the country.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09062244000050"></a>I know that some believe that the powers being sought under Clause 5 should be expressly limited to those instances where it is in the interests of the effectiveness and efficiency of policing. I agree. This is, in fact, already provided for under Section 36 of the Police Act, which requires any power of the Secretary of State under Section 1 of that Act, which these provisions amend, to be exercised in a manner that promotes those aims. As we have demonstrated with the recent HMIC report, the Secretary of State will always need to be able to assure Parliament that the actions and decisions taken are grounded in the drive to deliver an effective and efficient police service.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1420"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1420</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90622-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09062244000051"></a>Some have expressed concerns that these powers to direct are compromising the independence of the police. Protecting the independence of the police is at the heart of our constitution and a critical safeguard in preventing the abuse of power by the executive. However, we must be equally careful to distinguish between this and the Executive&#146;s role in ensuring that policing is delivered effectively and efficiently, ensuring the police have the right structures and processes in place to deliver this public-service ambition, and that it is in the public interest and in no way undermines or threatens the principle of police independence.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09062244000052"></a>The power to mandate in this area&#151;which already exists&#151;has been clarified by these clauses, demonstrating our desire to be clear about our intention in the area. It is unfair to suggest, as some have, that these powers are anything but open and transparent. After all, we set out our intention to consider requiring collaboration in our Green Paper in the summer of 2008. With collaboration becoming a major part of 21st century policing, it is right and proper that, as well as encouraging forces and authorities to pursue collaborative ventures, the Government reserve the right to consult those who are to receive directions&#151;first, to help shape collaboration in those areas where they promote the efficiency and effectiveness of policing at a local, regional and national level, and, secondly, to intervene in those instances where a collaboration may benefit a few but is counterproductive to wider policing interests.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09062244000053"></a>I turn to Amendments 30 and 31. Statutory guidance is one of the key tools available to Government to ensure the effective implementation of new legislation and, in many instances, to clarify the intention of Parliament as a result of debates such as this one. This guidance becomes even more important where the legislation is seeking to drive organisational reform and new ways of working. In these instances, guidance allows delivery agents to avoid some of the pitfalls experienced by others, best value is achieved, and the legislation drives the necessary public service improvements. This is the purpose behind Section 23F, and to remove it would severely curtail the ability of Government to assist and shape public service reform, which is set out by this legislation but is underpinned by meaningful guidance of the kind that officials will work with the service to produce. This will of course include the APA, ACPO and all other partners helping to deliver effective policing. This consultation happens routinely. It is not restricted to the APA and ACPO and does not need to be included in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09062244000054"></a>While<b></b>non-statutory guidance can be issued without the need for primary legislation, as we have seen at Committee stage in the Commons and here today there are issues that are best dealt with in guidance but that are sufficiently important that statutory guidance, developed in partnership with partners, is best placed to ensure that delivery agents have regard to it.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09062244000055"></a>I know that that has been a long response but I hope that I have been able to set out the case for why the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to give directions about collaboration and to issue statutory guidance are both necessary and proportionate in collaboration agreements. In the light of my response, I would kindly ask the noble Lord and the noble Baronesses not to press their amendments.</p>

Probably my first controversial amendment in your Lordships&#146; House was when I moved an amendment to the Health and Medicines Bill 1988 to retain free dental examinations. I said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="09062244000115"></a>&#147;The suggestion to bring in a charge for a dental examination is a retrograde step&#148;.&#151;<b>[</b><I>Official Report</I>, 19/7/88; col. 1220.]</p>

<p><a name="09062244000102"></a>I was concerned that the introduction of a &#163;3 fee would deter people from visiting their dentist and that they would either not be examined or examined more rarely as they stretched the time between visits to get better value for money.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09062244000058"></a>Knowing that there would be no point in asking people simply to vote for my amendment, I appreciated that the only way to get support was by winning the argument. Your Lordships have their own views on most subjects that we debate and these views are usually very well informed. The day before the amendment was to be considered, I asked every noble Lord whom I could find whether they would please try to be in the Chamber to hear the debate. Fortunately a large number attended from all sides of the House. When put to the vote, the amendment was passed&#151;Contents 118, Not Contents 97. Unfortunately my success was short-lived. The other place reversed the decision and attached financial privilege, so that this House was prevented from reopening the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09062244000059"></a>That was the beginning of the end of national health dentistry for all, but I had no idea how sadly the access for patients would deteriorate, of course aggravated by the introduction of a number of new dental contracts that make it very unprofitable, if manageable at all, for dentists to continue in full-time National Health Service practice.</p>

The <I>Which</I><I>?</I> survey estimated that this applied to 3 million people in the previous two years. Again, there is nothing new there. Ever since Tony Blair assured us that everyone would have access to a National Health Service dentist, the numbers unable to do so have steadily increased. I know that we have heard stories of people pulling out their own teeth, but I am sure that that is a rare situation and no one could do it unless, due to loss of supporting bone, the tooth was very wobbly. I cannot accept that anyone today could willingly tolerate the pain of removing a solidly set

Historically, in the days before dental anaesthesia, the norm was to have a noisy band beside the place in a town where &#147;painless&#148; extractions were offered.

My purpose in raising this issue is to suggest what can be done in practical terms to deal with people&#146;s lack of awareness of the danger of undetected mouth cancer&#151;one of the most unpleasant of all types of cancer. Many of your Lordships will have read the moving articles written by the late John Diamond during his distressing illness. Oral cancer remains a lethal disease for more than half the cases diagnosed annually. Prevention is my aim.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09062244000062"></a>Oral cancer is defined as malignant neoplasms of the lip, tongue, gum, mouth, tonsil and pharynx. There has been no improvement in survival for decades and recent studies show that the incidence is increasing. No other cancer is increasing at this rate. In 1995, there were 3,673 new cases; the most recent figures available show that by 2005 there were almost 5,000 new cases a year, many in males under the age of 45. Nationwide the incidence has increased by 34 per cent, while in Scotland it has doubled in the past 10 years.</p>

Those are not my words; they are in the report, <I>Health Technology Assessment 2006; Vol 10: </I><I>No</I><I> 14</I>. It goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="09062244000116"></a>&#147;This may be achieved by increasing awareness among the population so that affected individuals may present earlier, or by screening or case finding for the detection of small, otherwise asymptomatic, cancers and precancers (secondary prevention)&#148;.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09062244000064"></a>One interesting finding of the report is that, although tobacco was long blamed, the reduction in tobacco usage has reduced lung cancer but over the same period there has been no reduction in oral cancer, which has increased in males in exactly the same age group as that with a decrease in lung cancer. The conclusion is that rising alcohol consumption may be a major factor in the rising incidence of oral cancer.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09062244000065"></a>Delay in diagnosis and presentation with late-stage disease may be due to patient delay or professional delay. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that better education as to signs and symptoms has created an earlier demand from patients for clinical examination. Therefore, there is a case for screening among high-risk groups for early detection of lesions at a treatable stage. Those in the high-risk categories could be offered screening, which the research that I have quoted indicates would be cost-effective.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09062244000066"></a>The British Dental Association endorsed the specific target in the 1994 oral health strategy that the rising incidence of oral cancer should be arrested by 2005. In 2002, the Chief Dental Officer for England set out, in <I>NHS Dentistry: Options for Change</I>, proposals for a modernised service with a standard oral health assessment. That would include a prevention element that covered,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09062244000067"></a>Screening programmes have been scientifically evaluated. The HTA report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="09062244000117"></a>&#147;It was shown that dentists can detect relevant lesions with a sensitivity ... and specificity ... similar to those obtained in other screening programmes&#148;.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09062244000068"></a>Analysis of data from more than 2,000 individuals in two pilot screening programmes showed a correct prediction of oral cancer or precancer in eight out of 10 positive cases. There were false positives, but this is usual in a pre-screen filter and acceptable, as such cases would be identified when given a detailed examination and tests. The prevalence of cancerous or precancerous lesions was 9 per cent compared with 2.7 per cent in the population as a whole. The 2006 HTA report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a><a name="09062244000118"></a>&#147;It would seem that general dental practice should be an ideal place to initiate a programme of screening for high-risk groups since dentists are already trained to examine the mouth and it would be a simple matter to examine for mucosal lesions opportunistically when a patient presents for some other, unrelated, purpose&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062244000103"></a>I have no doubt that that is correct. My concern is about the millions of people who are not able to attend a National Health Service dentist and are unable to afford alternative private dental treatment.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09062244000069"></a>The Government tell us that they intend to provide a number of polyclincs with a wide range of treatment. Would these not be ideal places to make oral screening for mouth cancer available? Opportunistic screening&#151;checking the mouth of someone who is attending for other treatment&#151;in general medical practice has not been attempted. GPs do not receive training in oral mucosal examination and the general opinion is that it would be prohibitively expensive to introduce. Could not suitably trained nurses or dental hygienists check the mouths of those attending for other reasons? Clearly they would need a basic training, but they would then be able to refer the suspect cases for further examination and any necessary treatment.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09062244000070"></a>It seems that there may be a problem with this. I understand that, although nurses carry out many procedures as part of a medical team, the Dentists Act may not allow auxiliaries to carry out such an examination for screening for oral cancer. Could the Minister clarify this for me? Will general treatment in a polyclinic operate under rules that would permit this screening? If not, what changes in the law would be needed to make it possible? I know that there has been talk of a new dentists Act for years. Would that be needed to bring about this practical possibility or could it happen under the present laws?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09062244000071"></a>A paragraph that I must read to noble Lords is headed &#147;Heterogeneity&#148; and states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a><a name="09062244000119"></a>&#147;Meta-regression was conducted to identify any significant differences in discriminatory ability between the programmes conducted in the two industrialised countries, England and Japan, and in the two developing countries of the Indian subcontinent. In the latter, (basic) trained health workers rather than dentists were employed as screeners, reflecting the prevailing economic circumstances in those regions&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062244000104"></a>It was a much larger, house-to-house, case-finding programme. The paragraph continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a><a name="09062244000120"></a>&#147;No evidence of a difference in discriminatory ability was found&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062244000072"></a>It was not the big words in that paragraph that impressed me, but the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09062244000123"></a>&#147;reflecting the prevailing economic circumstances in those regions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062244000105"></a>At that time in 2006, the western world was affluent and the National Health Service had extra money poured in. Now we are facing economic realities and there is a real case for getting better value for money. The Indian screening programme is most interesting and is supportive of my suggestion that people could be effectively trained to carry out such preliminary assessments for oral cancer.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09062244000073"></a>The fundamental purpose of screening is to sort out the apparently well person who probably has the disease from those who probably do not. Experts and fully trained professionals should be used in the final determination, but basic assessments would not require that level of skilled cost to the NHS. It is time for us to address new practical procedures to deal with the growing problem of oral cancer.</p>

<a name="90622-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09062244000075"></a>Oral cancer is an increasing problem but, despite campaigning by the dental profession and other health professionals, public awareness is low. The number of cases has risen markedly in recent years, particularly in the younger age group, most commonly males aged from 35 to 64. Survival rates for those who suffer with oral cancer are low, and about 50 per cent die of the disease. Unlike other cancers, survival rates for oral cancer have failed to improve. A 2007 survey by the British Dental Health Foundation found that public awareness is about 50 per cent, and that more than 25 per cent thought that spicy foods were the primary cause of the condition.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09062244000076"></a>The causes of mouth cancer are well understood. Tobacco use, which includes chewing as well as smoking, especially in conjunction with the excessive intake of alcohol, dramatically increases a person&#146;s chance of suffering from the disease. It is thought that tobacco use and alcohol account for about 80 per cent of cases. People who smoke and drink excessively are up to 30 times more likely to develop the condition than those who do not. Some of the biggest users of tobacco are the ethnic communities. Chewing tobacco is a special problem because few people know that it can cause mouth cancer and other serious diseases.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09062244000077"></a>We also know that early detection improves the chances of survival and allows for simpler treatment. At any one time, nearly 13,000 people in the UK are living with oral cancer. But there is much work that must be done. The profile of those suffering with mouth cancer appears to have shifted slightly in recent years, with younger sufferers and a growth in the proportion of females affected. These trends must be monitored and further research must be carried out  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1425"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1425</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>into the findings of new work which seems to establish a link between the sexually transmitted HP virus and mouth cancer.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09062244000078"></a>As a dentist myself, I understand the important role that dentists play in detecting oral cancer. Because we recall our patients for regular check-ups, we are one of the few groups of health professionals who regularly and routinely screen our patients and are ideally placed to spot white and red patches and ulcers that do not heal&#151;the early symptoms of the condition. So ensuring that everyone is able to access a dentist really is vital to early detection of the condition. The problems many patients face accessing NHS dentistry have been well documented and must be solved.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09062244000079"></a>As important as ensuring that patients are able to access the health professionals most likely to spot symptoms of mouth cancer is ensuring that dentists are well placed to provide screening and preventive care. May 2007 saw the publication of a Department of Health report, <I>Smokefree and </I><I>s</I><I>miling, </I>which made numerous excellent recommendations about the ways in which dental teams can be trained in smoking cessation, how they can offer counselling on risk factors and refer patients to stop smoking services. We have read much about the challenges presented to dentists&#146; provision of preventive care by the current NHS dental contract in England, and it is imperative that the review of dental services by Professor Jimmy Steele, published today, really addresses those problems and allows dentists to engage properly in the kind of preventive care they are so well placed to provide. The report is encouraging. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a><a name="09062244000121"></a>&#147;Just as health is the desired outcome of the rest of the NHS, so health should now be the desired outcome for NHS dentistry, while good oral health and the quality of the service should be the benchmarks against which success is measured&#148;.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09062244000080"></a>We, as legislators, also have a role to play. The British Dental Association, along with a whole host of other organisations in healthcare, is urging us to support the tobacco control measures in the Health Bill. Those measures are targeting the point of sale display advertising of tobacco products and cigarette vending machines that can lead to young people taking up smoking. Action is required in three key areas: raising the profile of the condition; its risk factors; and the importance of early treatment would encourage more people who suspect that they are suffering with the condition to seek help. Ensuring that patients can access dental care where sufferers are most likely to be detected would improve early detection rates, giving those who suffer with mouth cancer a better chance of survival. Finally, equipping those dental professionals with the time and tools to deliver really effective preventive care could lead to fewer people smoking and drinking excessively, and suffering with mouth cancer in the first place.</p>

She makes it with commendable regularity, so I thank her very much for her introduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09062244000082"></a>The noble Baroness is right to focus our attention on what are rare cancers. Only 1.7 per cent of all cancers are mouth cancers, so it is not a condition for which there is a national screening programme. With uncommon diseases it is most cost-effective to screen people who have an increased risk of developing them. As she set out, over many years, dental professionals have become more aware and highly trained to do preventive work and to pick out those patients who might well be at risk. Is it now possible to get dental practitioners into places where they are likely to encounter those who are in the high-risk groups who are not as likely to present at the dentist. I agree entirely with what the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, said about free dental check-ups. I absolutely agree with that.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09062244000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, talked about the fact that there are guidelines for GPs on when they should think about referring people on to a mouth cancer specialist. I wonder whether there is now a case for looking at that guidance for those referrals again to see whether it is specific enough, in the same way as the guidance is to dentists about proactively setting out to identify high-risk groups.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09062244000084"></a>I want to talk about pre-cancerous conditions. These are the two medical conditions that the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, talked about which cause abnormal areas in the mouth or throat; they are harmless to begin with, but if they are left untreated, they can turn into a cancer. They are Leukoplakia and Erythroplakia.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09062244000085"></a>I know from my researches that dental practitioners are well aware of these conditions; I am not sure that the awareness has yet sufficiently translated through to the general public. I wonder whether the Government have considered engaging with the dental profession to see what can be done to improve general information to the public about pre-cancerous conditions.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09062244000086"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, mentioned the British Dental Health Foundation calling on the Government to act on new research which reveals that oral screening can provide all-important early detection. I understand that the Department of Health has worked with Cancer Research UK on pilot projects in east London and north-east London, where health experts are alerting patients to predisposing symptoms, such as persistent mouth ulcers. Could the Minister in her reply give an update on this research and the likely changes in practice which may arise from it?</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09062244000087"></a>I understand that at last year&#146;s Mouth Cancer Action Week, the WHO oral cancer expert called for dentists to be given greater powers to prescribe smoking cessation treatments. Would the noble Baroness say whether that is likely to happen as part of the Government&#146;s overall strategy to bring about a decrease in smoking?</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09062244000088"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, referred to the health technology assessment and its conclusion that opportunistic screening for oral cancer is probably the most cost-effective approach. Since that technology assessment was produced, I wonder whether work has gone into enabling dental practices to improve their own clinical audit and clinical governance in respect to oral cancer. The University of Glasgow has put together a template of a clinical audit, which a practice could  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1427"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1427</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>use, based upon social history screening&#151;such as smoking and alcohol intake&#151;and soft tissue screening of the mouth. This model audit then indicates how a practice might gather such data and use them to target those patients for whom the risks are greatest. Could the noble Baroness say whether the Department of Health advises PCTs on how to evaluate the effectiveness of oral cancer screening of dental practices and how to not only monitor their performance but ensure that good practice is exchanged between practices?</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09062244000089"></a>My final point is that it is known that the human papilloma virus, HPV, is linked to mouth and oropharyngeal cancers. In a review of many studies, scientists found signs of HPV in just under one in four people with mouth cancer, and one in three people with of the oropharynx; HPV-16 was the most common type of HPV in these cancers. Given the welcome news last week that HPV is finally being recognised as an issue for men as well as for women&#151;although clearly the number of women who die from cervical cancer is bigger&#151;can the noble Baroness say whether sexual health clinics are made aware of the link between HPV and oral cancer? Furthermore, are there any protocols for ensuring that people who are diagnosed with HPV are automatically referred or advised to have a check-up with a dental practitioner?</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09062244000090"></a>I have not spent as much time on this subject or studied it in anything like as much detail as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, but I think that tonight she was right in that she invited the Minister to say how we can use the resources of dentists and other health professionals to act on what we know. We know that there are risk factors and high-risk groups, and targeting them, not just with information but also regarding prevention, has to be the way forward. It is therefore reasonable for her department to adopt a strategy for something which is, after all, a treatable condition provided that it is caught early enough.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09062244000092"></a>Oral cancer, as has been said, is a term that embraces a number of different cancers affecting the inside of the mouth. It is not one of the commoner cancers in this country; nevertheless, it is a significant one. About 5,000 people a year are diagnosed with it, and it kills more people than cervical and testicular cancer combined. However, it is significant in another sense as well, because a great many people have never even heard of it and, of those who have, a high proportion do not know what the main risk factors for it are. That level of public ignorance is of concern because, in one sense at least, mouth cancer is like many others: the sooner it is detected in an individual, the better is the chance of long-term survival. Unfortunately and all too often,  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1428"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1428</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by the time it is picked up, it has developed to a point where it is too late to do anything but administer radical treatments, which at best merely delay the inevitable outcome.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09062244000093"></a>As my noble friend said, the incidence of mouth cancer is rising year on year, and, for reasons which are not understood, it is increasingly being found in younger people, especially younger women. That is quite different from the typical pattern of 50 years ago. My noble friend mentioned the main risk factors&#151;tobacco and alcohol use&#151;and of course we know that both smoking and drinking are causally associated with a range of cancers, not just this one. However, it is interesting to see from the figures how heavy drinking can dramatically worsen the chances of a man or a woman contracting this particular type of cancer, more so than for any other. At the same time, smoking and drinking are not the whole story. A quarter of all young people who present with mouth cancer have none of the standard risk factors. Why is that? We do not know.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09062244000094"></a>Given the incidence of this cancer, the general degree of ignorance about it and the fact that it is not being detected early enough, my noble friend is absolutely right to ask whether a screening programme should be considered. Screening has of course been considered in the past. The National Screening Committee last reviewed the issue in, I think, July 2006 and decided against it. On the face of things, that conclusion seems questionable.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09062244000095"></a>However, I think that we have to be quite clear about what should govern a decision of this kind. The National Screening Committee employs well established criteria when considering whether to screen for a disease. One of them is that for a screening programme to recommend itself, a simple, safe, precise and validated screening test has to be available. There is a type of dye called toluidine blue which can be used as a marker for malignancy. However, I understand that the tests that have been done with this dye suggest that it is neither effective nor cost-effective as a screening tool in a primary care setting. Another type of screening is routine oral examination, but in the general population routine screening is not seen as attractive because a high proportion of suspicious-looking lesions turn out to be perfectly innocuous. Taking a biopsy from every patient with a suspicious lesion would therefore lead to a high proportion of false-positive referrals, and many would regard that as an unacceptable price to pay for the benefit achieved.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09062244000096"></a>The NSC also insists that the precise manner in which a condition develops, and the speed of onset, should be adequately understood before we start screening for it, because without this knowledge you cannot set screening intervals. These are things that we still do not know about for squamous cell carcinoma, which is the most common form of oral cancer. Nor do we know enough about the warning signs. My noble friends are better qualified than I to talk about this. With mouth cancer, there are two sorts of precancerous lesions that a dentist or doctor might spot: red ones and white ones. The red ones are rarer, but are quite good predictors of cancer; while the white ones, which are more common, are not. As yet, we do not properly  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1429"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1429</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>understand the way that mouth cancer progresses in its early stages. It requires more research. Taking things to the next stage, it is difficult to justify a screening programme unless effective treatment is available at the end of it for those in whom cancer is diagnosed.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09062244000097"></a>For cancer detected in its early stages, treatment is certainly effective, if our measure of success is the five-year survival rate. However, if the cancer is at stage three or four, which it frequently is, the five-year survival rate is the same now as it was in the 1960s&#151;in other words, pretty poor. What is more, any therapy that is given is often disfiguring and often highly debilitating. Doctors admit that the protocols for the clinical management of oral cancers need to be a lot better than they are.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09062244000098"></a>So, for a number of powerful reasons, the idea of a general screening programme for mouth cancer is problematic. The committee has therefore recommended alternative strategies. One is to say that dentists should be involved directly in promoting smoking cessation and safe alcohol programmes to their patients. I would like to hear what the Minister says about that. We have heard this proposal also from Dr Saman Warnakulasuriya of the World Health Organisation.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09062244000099"></a>The other is to suggest that, instead of screening the general population, which has been shown not to be cost-effective, we should target those groups of people who are most at risk and screen then opportunistically. The cost-effectiveness of this sort of screening looks a lot better. This was done in the recent research study conducted in southern India that was mentioned by my noble friend, where the targeting of high-risk groups of tobacco and alcohol users led to a sizeable increase in the rate of early detection of oral cancer. The study prompted the British Dental Health Foundation to advocate doing something similar here. I understand that pilot projects are under way already in east and north-east London, under the auspices of the Department of Health in collaboration with Cancer Research UK. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister what these projects consist of, and how they are progressing. Depending on their timescale and what results are achieved, will the Government consider rolling out the initiative to other areas of the country&#151;and what are they are doing to improve public awareness of oral cancer generally? I am not clear whether the information initiatives mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, when he answered a Question from my noble friend in 2005, are still current.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09062244000100"></a>There is an obvious point here. If there is to be any hope of implementing preventive strategies for oral cancer, GPs, and principally dentists, are in the front line. The unfortunate fact is that since the new dental contract was introduced in 2006, access to NHS dentistry has not risen, as was the intention, but fallen, as my noble friend pointed out. The contract pays dentists for performing an annual allocation of &#147;units of dental activity&#148;, which they must meet if they are not to find some of their income being clawed back. At the same time, the system of registering with an NHS dentist has been abolished, which has seriously weakened the ability of dentists to look after the long-term oral  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1430"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1430</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>health of their patients. Taken together, the changes have had the perverse effect of reducing the incentive for dentists to conduct routine check-ups, which are the only regular way of delivering preventive dental and oral care. Under the charging tariff, regular check-ups fall into the lowest income band. As a result, dentists find that they can afford to devote only around 15 minutes to each session, which is not enough time in which to deliver preventive care and advice to those who most need it.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09062244000101"></a>If the Government are resolutely determined to cling on to this contract, which so far they have seemed to be, something really needs to be done to address this obvious deficit in preventive oral healthcare. The Steele report may provide us with some of the necessary pointers. There has to be a way of ensuring that NHS dentistry is more available to at-risk individuals: principally, people in lower socio-economic groups and ethnic minority communities who use tobacco and alcohol. I hope that the Minister can provide us with some convincing reasons to think that we are on the right course to achieve this.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09062257000002"></a>I will put the challenges that we face in reducing mortality from mouth cancer into the context of improvements in the treatment of cancer as a whole and the role of the National Screening Committee. I will also address the dentistry issues in the course of my remarks.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09062257000003"></a>Those who are involved in the generality of reducing mortality should be proud of the clear and impressive story of real improvement that is unfolding for cancer patients and their families. We are better at preventing, detecting and treating cancer. Among people under 75, almost 9,000 lives were saved in 2007 compared with in 1996. Unfortunately, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, mentioned, we have so far not had the same success in reducing the toll of mouth cancer on the nation&#146;s health.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09062257000004"></a>As noble Lords have mentioned, mouth cancer affects around 4,900 people each year, and around 1,700 people die from the disease. The incidence of the disease has increased by 34 per cent over the past 10 years, and the mortality rate has increased by 9 per cent. As noble Lords have also mentioned, the evidence shows that tobacco, combined with excessive alcohol, is associated with 75 per cent of mouth cancer cases. It is therefore a largely preventable disease. However, the noble Earl is perfectly right to point to the fact that the prognosis is good where systems are detected early. Our problem is in detection and the need for more research.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09062257000005"></a>I will first address noble Lords&#146; points about dentists and other issues, and then come back to the pilots in east London and the north-east which the noble Earl mentioned. In fact, I think everyone who has spoken so far has mentioned access to dentists and its importance. Indeed, the Steele report is out today and is pointing us to the way forward.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1431"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1431</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90622-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09062257000006"></a>It is true that access to dentists fell when the new system was introduced, but that is being reversed and access is now up. It had grown to 27 million by September 2008 and to 27.3 million by December 2008. New services are opening, and increased investment gives us confidence that the numbers will continue to grow. However, access is still down by 0.9 million since the reforms, and we are still committed to ensuring that everyone who wants access to an NHS dentist can have it by March 2011. We absolutely accept that there is no room for complacency, and although the past two quarters show sustained growth and that new practices are opening, we know that we need to keep on the case and continue to ensure that we make progress.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09062257000007"></a>We also acknowledge that the detection of mouth cancer depends on people being able to access a dentist. Earlier today, we mentioned in statements on Professor Jimmy Steele&#146;s review of dental resources that he endorsed the measures that we are taking to improve access and made recommendations on providing information to patients on dental services that are available under the NHS. He proposes information for dentists on how to improve the quality of the care they provide, and we accept his recommendations. We are working through the financial implications of those right now.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09062257000008"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, made a point about polyclinics. As it happens, my noble friend Lord Darzi went to the Harrow polyclinic today and saw that it is providing comprehensive dental services. We are encouraging team working in dentistry, something that the noble Baroness is very concerned about and has previously raised with me. So, for example, as dental hygienists already examine their patients&#146; mouths when treating periodontal disease, we will consider whether their role might be extended. It might be that dental nurses could, with appropriate training, also have a role here; both hygienists and nurses could conduct examinations under the overall direction of a dentist, and that would not require new legislation. The noble Baroness has raised a very interesting and innovative point that we are going to consider.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09062257000009"></a>The challenge, of course, is getting people at risk to visit a dentist. Several noble Lords mentioned that. That is absolutely the challenge, and we know that people who are heavy smokers and heavy drinkers are members of the group who do not present themselves regularly for dental examinations. Accordingly, the department has concentrated on raising awareness of the risk factors and the predisposing symptoms mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09062257000010"></a>In 2005, the department made a grant of &#163;100,000 to Cancer Research UK to run the Open to Mouth Cancer Campaign. Under this pilot campaign, publicity was given to the predisposing symptoms of mouth cancers&#151;ulcers that do not heal, white and red spots on the gums and tongue&#151;and advised people to consult a dentist, a general practitioner or a pharmacist if they considered that they were at risk. Two sites were chosen.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1432"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1432</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90622-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09062257000011"></a>In Newcastle and Gateshead, men and women over 40 who smoked and/or drank heavily were the target audience. The aim was to encourage high-risk individuals to visit a dental practitioner for a soft-tissue mouth check, using a voucher that could be collected from the local pharmacy. Early results from phase one, which ran for four months from January to April 2007, show that pharmacists gave out 205 vouchers to members of the public. Of those distributed, 66 per cent of the vouchers went to non-dental attendees, 54 per cent to smokers, and 34 per cent to drinkers. Fifty people made appointments with a dentist for soft-tissue checks. Five were referred to secondary care, and one patient remains in continuous follow-up.</p>

<a name="90622-0013.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09062257000012"></a>In Tower Hamlets, the target audience for screening were Bangladeshi men and women over 40, especially tobacco and areca nut users. Oral cancer checks were delivered in community locations, using a mobile dental unit. The checks seem to have lead to an increase in oral cancer diagnoses at the Royal London Hospital. There were eight oral cancer diagnoses in 18 months from June 2006 to December 2007, a number usually seen in a five-year period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09062257000013"></a>Evaluation of these pilots is under way, and it is intended that the National Screening Committee will be made aware of the findings of these projects. I am sure that the issues raised both by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, will be taken on board. Decisions about the follow-up action that should be taken will then be taken at that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09062257000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, raised the problem of getting people at risk to visit a dentist, and I hope some of the remarks I have made will demonstrate that we have taken that on board. Indeed, the Steele report, which I have looked at today, very much emphasises the importance of information services and awareness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09062257000015"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, mentioned the HP virus and we understand that people with the virus receive a thorough review of their overall health. I shall write to the noble Baroness about the involvement of dentists in any follow up examinations and treatment.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09062257000016"></a>The UK National Screening Committee advises Ministers about all aspects of screening policy and supports implementation. As noble Lords have remarked, there is no national screening programme for any form of head and neck cancer in the UK. National population screening programmes are introduced only where there is evidence that screening would be effective in reducing the incidence of the mortality of the disease. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, eloquently described the issues surrounding that.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09062257000017"></a>The committee ran a series of expert group workshops on oral cancer which reported in March 2003. It recommended that the epidemiology of the disease could be further investigated with long-term studies; that opportunistic screening of individuals, as mentioned by the noble Earl, by health professionals should be encouraged with the intention of detecting high-risk individuals with early stages of the diseases; and that population awareness should be increased through health promotional programmes. That is what has guided the Government&#146;s actions since that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09062257000018"></a>In June 2006, the committee considered a report produced by the NHS R&amp;D health technology assessment programme, which has been referred to already by the noble Earl, on the cost-effectiveness of screening for oral cancer in primary care. On the basis of that analysis, the authors of the report recommended that further study is needed on the natural history of oral cancer and its precursors, and on the effectiveness of interventions, before any further consideration is given to a national population screening programme.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09062257000019"></a>In the light of concerns about the increased incidence, the UK National Screening Committee is currently reviewing its policy position on screening for mouth cancer. The review is likely to be conducted in the autumn, when Members will be provided with information from the Cancer Research UK pilots. While I cannot pre-empt the committee&#146;s findings, it would seem that the results of the pilots and many of the points that noble Lords have made during the debate show that it will be possible to conduct a thorough review on the options for a more systematic approach to screening for mouth cancer.</p>

As we draw our scrutiny of the clause to a close, I am reminded by the remark of the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, who is not in her place&#151;she said, &#147;That&#146;s not quite how it works&#148;&#151;of the delicate relationship between the Secretary of State, the police authority and the chief constable. I am sure that we are agreed in all parts of the Committee that our aim is to ensure that the Bill leaves here with that relationship as close and as complementary as it possibly can be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09062257000021"></a>Amendment 36 would draw out a small part of new Section 23G. It seeks to probe the circumstances in which the Secretary of State might envisage prohibiting a collaboration agreement. Given the requirements on chief officers to seek the approval of their authorities and the requirements on both of them to assist the efficiency and effectiveness of the agreement, when would the Government consider stepping in to stop one being made? The Minister gave us a fairly comprehensive explanation of that in the previous amendment, but I beg to move.</p>

Instead, this is a power to direct that we expect to have to use rarely, if at all. It is a necessary failsafe as opposed to a proactive legislative tool for regular use.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09062257000023"></a>Our approach to promoting collaboration has been to encourage forces and authorities to take bold and, at times, innovative steps to work jointly. We continue to encourage this approach and have issued some guidance and good practice on a range of issues to ensure that we learn from those leading the way. However, as our knowledge develops further, we will become better at identifying those instances where experience tells us either that collaboration is not the right form of delivery or that a certain type of collaboration is not going to deliver the improvements needed. Rather along the lines mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, when we were discussing a previous issue, this is something to draw on.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09062257000024"></a>In those instances, which are likely to be rare, it is the Secretary of State&#146;s duty to ensure that policing more generally does not suffer from the few badly executed collaborations. This growing pool of knowledge will also begin to identify preferred models of collaboration for certain policing functions that will need to benefit from a minimum level of consistency nationally in order to be effective. Police functions such as serious organised crime and counterterrorism are already providing good examples of this. In these rare instances, it is in the public interest that the national interest is reflected through the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to intervene as a last resort.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09062257000025"></a>While we hope that we will not need to use this power, Clause 5 provides a legitimate attempt to ensure that, where a collaboration agreement goes against the interests of policing more generally, the Secretary of State is able to reflect and defend the public interest. Should this power need to be used, it will of course be for Parliament to scrutinise and judge the Secretary of State&#146;s decision to act. I therefore ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</p>

<a name="09062257000027"></a><b><a name="90622-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062257000158"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> The new clause inserted by Amendment 37 is related to provisions already in the Bill in Clauses 6, 7 and 8. These clauses are intended to facilitate the work of police collaborative units. They ensure that, where two or more police forces reach collaboration agreements in respect of certain techniques regulating the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the fact that investigative teams may comprise officers from different forces will not cause any operational problems for the authorisation of these techniques.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09062257000028"></a>This new clause has a similar effect in relation to covert human intelligence sources&#151;CHIS. It may help if I explain precisely what a CHIS is. A CHIS is an individual who establishes or maintains a relationship with someone else for the covert purpose of obtaining information. A CHIS can be a member of the public&#151;for example, a member of a drug-trafficking gang who is recruited to provide information to the police&#151;or a member of a public authority, such as an undercover police officer who infiltrates a drug-trafficking gang to obtain information of a similar kind. In either case, RIPA requires each CHIS to have both a controller and a handler. These play different roles in managing and supervising the CHIS. The controller is responsible for overseeing the use made of a CHIS; the handler has day-to-day responsibility for dealing with the CHIS and for his security and welfare.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1437"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1437</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90622-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09062257000029"></a>With one key exception, the controller and handler of a CHIS have to be from the same authority or, in this case, police force. The exception to which I have referred is relevant to the need for this new clause. If the activities of a CHIS take place for the benefit of more than one public authority&#151;in this case, more than one police force&#151;the controller and handler can be from different authorities or forces. This exception will solve the problem for many collaborative units that tackle cross-border crime. Where a number of smaller forces agree to delegate all CHIS activity to a dedicated unit, it might not apply. This is because the dedicated unit may be required to investigate purely local, as well as cross-border, crime. In such circumstances, therefore, the controller and handler would have to be from the same force. Obviously, this would limit the point of having a joint investigative unit as part of a collaboration agreement.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09062257000030"></a>A further benefit of the new clause is that it will facilitate the way in which undercover officers are used across the country. As I have mentioned, the handler of a CHIS is responsible for his or her security or welfare. Often, an undercover officer&#146;s own police force likes to keep this responsibility even if the officer is deployed in another force area or is tasked by another force. Under this new clause, such a division of labour between the home and the host force would be possible. We even anticipate that all 43 forces in England and Wales may choose to form an agreement to permit such a sharing of roles in relation to undercover officers. The eight forces in Scotland may also choose to form their own collaboration agreement to this effect.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09062257000031"></a>Unfortunately, the limited impact of the exception that I have described has come to light only recently. I apologise, therefore, for this new clause being tabled late in the passage of the Bill. It is, however, a relatively minor adjunct to the key provisions in Clauses 6, 7 and 8, which are intended to facilitate the work of police collaboration units, including, in some circumstances, the collaborative work of all 43 forces in England and Wales or the eight forces in Scotland.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09062257000032"></a>Amendments 38 to 41 are minor and technical. Where all the conduct authorised is likely to take place in Scotland, Section 46 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 prohibits Scottish police forces from authorising under RIPA unless the authorisation is granted or renewed in the interests of national security or the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. Clause 8 of the Bill replicates this restriction unnecessarily. These amendments remove this replication. I hope that noble Lords will agree with the benefits that these provisions will bring. I beg to move.</p>

Both amendments are intended to modernise the operation of regulation and order-making powers under Sections 53 and 57 of the Police Act 1996, to bring them into line with more recent legislation exemplified by Section 53A of the same Police Act. These changes would require the Secretary of State to take into account the expertise of HMIC in the fields of police equipment and facilities and services before exercising powers under this section.</p>

<a name="90622-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09062257000034"></a>I believe the Government intend that these provisions in the Bill will enable the Home Secretary to mandate the use of national IT systems. However, the provisions are not limited to this and once again contain wide-ranging order-making powers which could have a much broader application. I accept that it might not be the intention of the current Home Secretary to use the powers more widely, but that does not guarantee that they will not be misused in the future. It therefore seems sensible to include mechanisms that help to ensure that these powers are used wisely and proportionately. The reference to HMIC advice is one way of trying to ensure this.

However, we feel that the existing consultation provisions in Sections 53 and 57 of the Police Act 1996, which relate to regulations that the Secretary of State can make regarding standards of equipment or requiring police forces to use specified facilities or services, are sufficient. Both Sections 53 and 57 already provide that the Secretary of State must consult the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers. Existing safeguards are therefore in place to ensure that the force requirements are fully understood and considered by those who have the greatest expertise in understanding the implications of making those regulations.</p>

The Secretary of State may of course wish to consider consulting HMIC on these regulations in other circumstances, but he should not be required to do so as the amendments propose.</p>

I understand that powers are available to ensure the use of hardware, but that current legislation does not allow for software to be similarly prescribed. The subsection would allow the Government to insist on common programmes being used, so has the potential to make considerable savings in the realm of data sharing across different authorities. The principle appears very sensible and entirely in line with reducing unnecessary red tape. Police forces need every encouragement to use sensible computer programmes so that police officers can spend less time at their desks and more time on the beat. Similarly, ensuring that records can be easily accessed by different authorities will help to ensure that offenders are properly identified across the country. The principle we accept. Our concern therefore lies not in the power that the section gives, but in whether it actually could be used.</p>

There have now been two reviews on how to reduce the bureaucracy and data burden in policing&#151;the question is whether the Government have the drive to ensure that their recommendations are pushed through. Is the Government&#146;s intention to set up another large database? If so, what steps have they taken to ensure that it does not go the way of the NHS database, for example, and so many others that have had great failure rates? If the Government intend to increase the sharing of data across police authorities&#151;demanded by regulation&#151;how will they ensure that there will not be another disastrous loss of confidential information?

As noble Lords will know, the policing Green Paper, <I>From the Neighbourhood to the National</I>, identified that the full potential of information systems to support better policing would be achieved only if there were a co-ordinated strategy for those systems developed across the police service. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, points out, that is a necessary way to go and it is important that we achieve that. She is absolutely right: not just in government, but across the private sector, we have not got the most brilliant record on large IT systems, and we certainly need to be very nervous of them. Certainly the intention here is not to set up another huge database and go down that route.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09062257000042"></a>Since the publication of the Green Paper, the National Policing Board has commissioned the National Policing Improvement Agency to take forward or consolidate a strategy, known as the information systems improvement strategy. Part of the strategy&#146;s approach is to build on the excellent and innovative collaboration work already taking place between forces. The strategy will also review the procurement of IT systems so that, wherever possible, national solutions are delivered for national problems. Historically, we have been very bad at this. I remember sitting between two chief constables and talking about some equipment. One said, &#147;I&#146;m going to buy this&#148;, and the other one said, &#147;In that case, I&#146;m not going to get that&#148;. We must not be in that sort of situation; it is just outrageous.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09062257000043"></a>Section 53 of the Police Act 1996 already allows the Secretary of State to set standards for &#147;equipment&#148;, a term which covers IT hardware but not IT software. A strategy that covers hardware alone is not really feasible. It would need to be able to set standards in respect of software as well to deliver the desired benefits in terms of better procurement, more effective services to the public and greater collaboration. Setting standards in respect of IT software will allow us to maximise efficiencies, whether at local, regional or national level. IT software and its development is a very costly element of any IT project, sometimes more costly than the hardware. Major efficiency gains could be made by ensuring compatible software platforms and leveraging more out of the provider&#151;the people whom we are buying from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09062257000044"></a>The amendment seeks to limit the scope of the provisions to IT hardware only. While much progress can be made through voluntary collaboration, we need to be certain that, if it is clear that there are benefits to the public and the police service generally for greater IT collaboration, the Secretary of State has the power to support that collaboration through setting requirements for both IT hardware and software.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09062257000045"></a>It is not our intention to cut across the operational decision-making of chief officers. We are merely seeking to enable a more effective regime for promoting efficiency and effectiveness. The Secretary of State would make regulations that support the joint design, procurement and management of IT systems at a national or regional level only if it was necessary to do so for the purpose of promoting that efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09062257000049"></a>Clauses 11 and 12 raise some serious concerns about the ability of the Secretary of State to interfere in operational policing matters with regard to specific forces. Currently, the Police Act 1996 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring all police forces to adopt particular practices and procedures. These regulations can only be made if the Chief Inspector of Constabulary states that he or she is satisfied that it is necessary to do so to ensure co-operation between police forces and also to ensure that the proper procedure is carried out and that it is in the national interest.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09062257000050"></a>The proposed new Clause 11 would allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to that effect which only apply to one or more police forces. It would also allow regulations to be made if the chief inspector thinks it necessary to do so to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of a police force, rather than just to ensure co-operation. Similarly, Clause 12 seeks to amend the current position, enabling the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring all police forces to use specified facilities and services if he or she thinks it is in the interest of efficiency or effectiveness to require just one or more specified police force to do so. Enabling the Home Secretary to direct the type of policies that apply to specific police forces to promote efficiency in that force raises the spectre of political interference in particular police forces. The current power does not allow the Secretary of State to pick and choose between police forces, and that provides some limit on the power of central government to control how a particular force operates.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09062257000051"></a>Liberty has consistently warned against political interference in policing. The police must remain able to investigate crime independently and to apply the laws made by Parliament free from political pressure. Liberty&#146;s position is that police authorities should be responsible for setting the strategic direction of the police force and should hold the chief constable of the

Liberty has frequently stated that police independence and the rule of law are best served by denying the Executive excessive control of operational policing matters. It also maintains that communities are best served when the police are able to act with an appropriate degree of independence.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09062257000052"></a>We have been going over this ground all afternoon. I make no apology whatever for going over it again and I am delighted that Liberty has provided this particular opportunity.</p>

<a name="09062257000053"></a><b><a name="90622-0015.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09062257000169"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> Clause 11 extends the Secretary of State&#146;s power to make regulations to require police forces to adopt certain procedures and practices. At present, regulations can be made in respect of all forces only where in the opinion of Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and the Secretary of State such regulations are necessary to support joint or co-ordinated police operations and are in the national interest.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09062257000054"></a>The proposed change allows regulations to be made in respect of one or more forces. It also allows the regulations to be made where in the opinion of Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and the Secretary of State the adoption of practices or procedures will promote the efficiency and effectiveness of a police force and are in the national interest.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09062257000055"></a>This clause further strengthens the ability of the Secretary of State to provide a regulatory basis for convergence in support of the information systems strategy. It has been our experience historically that the cost of developing common IT applications in policing has increased where there has been no agreement over common business processes.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09062257000056"></a>As in the case of Clause 10, we do not expect that such regulations will be made frequently. This provision is nevertheless valuable and necessary to improve information systems in policing. It is quite focused. Regulations under Section 53A could however also be used more generally to support the recommendations in Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s <I>Review of Policing</I> for more efficient and effective police business processes that would help to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, improve police procurement and create a national set of standardised forms.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09062257000057"></a>Clause 12 is the last of three clauses which are intended to give the Secretary of State more flexible regulation-making powers in support of a common approach to the development of information systems and services in the police service. This clause will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations in respect of the use by one or more police forces of specific services. Regulations will be made only where the Secretary of State, having consulted the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers, considers them to be in the interest of efficiency and effectiveness of the police.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09062257000058"></a>The power already exists if applied to all police forces at once. This provision allows the flexibility to make regulations that apply, for example, to one region. The circumstances in which this power might be used would be if there were benefit in a collaborating group of forces using a shared information service&#151;for example,

Again, we hope that agreement to do so would be done by voluntary agreement on the strength of the business case, but it is possible to envisage circumstances in which the benefit to a larger group of forces might justify an element of mandation.</p>

First, it puts councillor nominations on a more competency-based footing. This is intended to support the Green Paper&#146;s ambitions, which I fully endorse, to strengthen police authorities. It aims to contribute to this by improving the capacity and capability of police authority members. Independent members of police authorities are already selected through a competency-based process but the amendment extends this requirement to councillor members.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09062257000060"></a>At present, the only requirement in selecting councillor members is political balance. In my view, this must remain the overarching consideration. We discussed this on earlier amendments. The ability of police authorities to reflect a balanced range of views has been fundamental to keeping them independent and largely free of party-political domination over the past 15 years.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09062257000061"></a>However, there must also be room for improvement in the quality of councillor members. As an ex-councillor and ex-police authority chair, I am well aware of the   


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1444"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1444</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>weaknesses in the present system of appointment. Many councillor members are excellent, but some are still appointed for a range of reasons through a process that lacks transparency. Police authorities in some areas still struggle to find councillor members who will turn up and make an effective contribution, and in some cases, this amounts to attending no more than quarterly meetings of the full authority. Councillor members have a vital role to play in providing a link to democratic processes and credible accountability to local communities. Poor attendance or questionable commitment, or a lack of particular capacity to do the job, which is demanding, are not acceptable if this vital link is to be maintained.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09062257000062"></a>I am not arguing that councillor members should necessarily be expected to bring the same competences to police authorities as independent members. They have a different role to play, focused on engaging with local communities, understanding their needs and better joining-up policing with local councils. But the public have a right to expect that councillors should discharge this responsibility effectively and that the enthusiasm and suitability of candidates should be considered in deciding whether to appoint a councillor to a police authority.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09062257000063"></a>Secondly, the final paragraph of this amendment corrects a possible anomaly in the current legislation about appointing independent members. A significant round of appointments to police authorities took place last year across the country, which threw up some queries about whether the final stages of the appointments process need to be conducted by the full authority, or whether it can be done by a committee of the authority. Good recruitment practice suggests that it is not particularly effective to subject a candidate to an interview panel comprising 17 or more people, which is the number of members of a full authority. However, there are some doubts about whether it is adequate under current legislation to conduct final interviews through a committee and then ask the full authority to endorse the recommendations of the committee.</p>

<a name="90622-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09062257000064"></a>In theory, a police authority can delegate any of its functions to a committee unless the law says otherwise, but this amendment is designed to put the matter beyond doubt and make it clear that the decision on who to appoint can be delegated to a committee of the authority, if desired. I beg to move.</p>

My main concern is the practicality of what is being proposed. Local authority members are not chosen because of their expertise in any particular matter&#151;not yet. That may come in due course, and we will be fluffing around trying to find somebody with financial experience to lead the council on finance matters. But we are not there yet. I am worried that some people who would be very good police authority members would be precluded because they do not happen to have the ability or expertise that the police authority is looking for. Such expertise may not be available on the council at all. A police authority needs people with a robust connection with their local community, who have a lot of common sense and who understand policing. That does not seem to require any expertise other than being able to live in your local community and understand it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09062257000068"></a>Although I understand the sentiments behind the amendment, I would not want to support it, because it might put local authorities in a very awkward position. If they were trying to appoint the sort of people that a police authority said it wanted, they might preclude somebody who was very good indeed and who might have been appointed if such restrictions had not been in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09062257000070"></a>The difficulty that we face is that, given the state of local government elections and local government reorganisation, with yet more authorities put on hold in local government review, not only are the electorate not very interested in turning out to vote for their local authorities, but the attendance at police authority meetings, which has never been fantastic, is suffering again a fall in interest from members of the public.</p>

The Government are aware of the importance of this long-standing principle, which is why it was included in the Police Authority Regulations 2008. I am afraid that I do not see the value of moving this into primary legislation. These regulations have the

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09062257000073"></a>This amendment also seeks to place a duty on councils and joint committees to fill skills gaps in police authorities when appointing councillor members. This duty has long been placed on independent member selection panels when they appoint independent members. Extending this duty to the appointment of councillor members merits serious consideration. Many councillors have a broad range of skills and it appears sensible, in essence, for these skills to be considered in their appointment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09062257000074"></a>However, the wider context also needs to be taken into account. Often these decisions reflect broader concerns including political interests. I would not wish to impose restrictions on the discretion of councillors appointing their own members without first engaging with the Local Government Association and other interested stakeholders. I will ask Home Office officials to engage with the APA and the Local Government Association on this matter, with a view to the issue being considered as part of the regulatory reform of police authorities that is currently under way.</p>

It is very sensible that small committees of police authorities carry out the interviewing of candidates rather than the whole authority. However, I think that this amendment needs proper deliberation before it is included in the Bill. For example, I would wish fully to understand how this proposed power would interact with local government legislation. Would it impose any limits or requirements on membership of the committee? Could non-police authority members be co-opted on to that committee?</p>

This new confidence target is the one overarching numerical target that will be set for policing in the future by the Home Secretary. It is an important measure, so we must ensure that we get the arrangements surrounding it right.</p>

<a name="90622-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09062257000079"></a>The police do not deliver safer communities single-handedly; they have to work effectively with partners to achieve success in improving public safety and in driving down crime. The new confidence target recognises that because it is in fact a measure of public confidence in the police and local councils. Herein, of course, lies the catch. Councils are able to sign up to the same target through their local area agreements, but crucially they have an option regarding whether or not to do so. It is merely one of a range of targets that they can adopt and it is not mandatory for them. I understand that out of approximately 350 councils in the country, so far only about 50 have adopted this target. Of course, the police have little power to influence the council-half of the equation by which success will be measured in the future.</p>

<a name="90622-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09062257000080"></a>Although the single confidence target is very laudable and the reduction in the overall number of targets placed on the police is welcome, it seems inequitable that half of what is measured relates to bodies that the police do not control. The concern must be that what gets measured gets done. Particularly in the parlous financial times that we are facing, there will be significant pressure on local authorities to focus only on targets that they have selected as priorities. Targets that are not a priority are therefore likely to be ignored and little resource or effort will be invested in helping partners to deliver targets that are different. That could clearly have a detrimental effect on policing and on force performance, not necessarily through any fault of individual forces or divisional commanders.</p>

<a name="90622-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09062257000081"></a>My amendment would provide a solution by placing a duty on partner authorities to co-operate with the police in delivering the single confidence target, which is the key strategic priority set by the Home Secretary for policing. This is similar to the duty that partner authorities to local councils, including both police authorities and police forces, are already under to help councils to deliver their local area agreement targets. This seems a proportionate and balanced reciprocal approach to the problem. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90622-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="09062257000086"></a>Crime and disorder committees are effectively council overview and scrutiny committees when they sit to consider crime and disorder issues. They were created through the Police and Justice Act 2006 with the intention that they should scrutinise the work of crime and disorder reduction partnerships. That was nearly three years ago, but the regulations governing the operation of these arrangements were implemented only this year in April.</p>

<a name="90622-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09062257000087"></a>Noble Lords with memories somewhat better than mine may recall that I spoke about these provisions when the original Police and Justice Bill was in this House. At the time I was concerned, among other things, that the committees would be used to scrutinise individual partners, and not the partnership as a whole, as intended by the then Bill. I was concerned in particular that the committees would be used in practice to try to hold to account individual police commanders&#151;because police commanders are accountable to the chief officer, who in turn is accountable in law to the police authority. It is not for council committees to do the statutory job of other bodies.</p>

<a name="90622-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09062257000088"></a>To guard against this possibility and square the accountability loop, I suggested that provisions should be included in the Bill, specifying that a police authority member should sit on the crime and disorder committee.  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1449"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column 1449</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>At the time, my noble friend Lord Bassam resisted my call to put this in primary legislation, but agreed to ensure that it was covered in the regulations that followed. When eventually the regulations were published, in April this year, I was surprised and concerned to see that they did not specify that a police authority member should be co-opted onto these committees. The regulations did contain permissive powers enabling representatives of outside bodies to be co-opted at the discretion of the council. However, if a council chooses not to do this, significant difficulties concerning police accountability may arise.</p>

<a name="90622-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09062257000089"></a>I appreciate that the Home Office guidance that supported these regulations made strong recommendations that police authority members should be co-opted onto committees where policing matters were being considered. However, I am also aware that several councils will not, as a matter of principle, co-opt outside individuals onto their committees unless legislation compels them to&#151;and guidance is not legislation. So the situation remains unsatisfactory from a policing point of view, and risks creating tension between local authorities and the police, who are not legally accountable to them. This could have a detrimental effect on partnership working at a time when it is important that all parties work well together to make the best use of scarce resources. In moving the amendment, I ask my noble friend if he has any plans to revise the regulations at some point in the future, or any other plans that would allay my concerns. I beg to move.</p>

The suggestion is that it should be compulsory to have a member of the local police authority as a member of each of these committees. This is an interesting point. However, regulations made under the Police and Justice Act already enable the co-option of additional members&#151;including police authority members&#151;to crime and disorder committees. Although this is subject to local determination, supporting guidance drafted in partnership with the Association of Police Authorities encourages local authorities to presume that police authorities must play an active part in scrutiny committees, and provides clarity on particular circumstances where police authority members or officers can add value to their work.</p>

However, I should like to make a couple of points that relate to both Amendments 71 and 72 before going into the detail of Amendment 71.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000004"></a>As I am sure members of the Committee appreciate, I should like to emphasise how much I support the philosophy of the Bill to keep lone parents attached to the labour market. The later you return to work, the harder it is. The best way of helping children out of poverty is to help their parents, particularly a lone parent, back into work. I was delighted to see that half the mothers on the NDLP programme&#151;the New Deal for Lone Parents&#151;were volunteers, even though they have young children, because they were attached to the labour market and had recently worked.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000005"></a>Secondly&#151;and we have said this before&#151;I believe that we are making a profound mistake if we try to fit lone parents, with all the pressures they face, into a model of JSA designed for the feckless 22 year-old young man who does not care to get up in the morning. One of the problems is that JSA is conceptually based on men; it assumes that they are either out of work and, without a health reason, therefore lazy, or in full-time work&#151;one or the other. There is no recognition of, and probably no need in that situation for, sensible disregards, mini-jobs or stepping stones&#151;all the things that make sense for lone parents who not only have children whom they are bringing up single-handedly but who may have been out of the labour market for some time and need a more gradual re-entry than just pressure and hassle. We do not want the lone parents dichotomy of slammed doors&#151;in work, out of work. We need a staircase, a ladder, so that every hour you

Therefore, although we want to encourage lone parents who may have lost the knowledge, confidence, even the will to re-enter waged work, we should encourage them by additional premiums, not sanction them by cutting their benefits. You sanction the lone parent, and you sanction the child.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000006"></a>Amendment 71 proposes that we offer women on IS who are required to engage in work-related activity a premium or an additional component. Currently, if they are on employment and support allowance, they receive an additional &#163;24 above the JSA rate for participating in a series of work-focused interviews. But no such additional premium is proposed if instead, because of the age of their child, they are on IS. Instead, they will receive a sanction, as will their child, for failing to do what the adviser has required.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000007"></a>I do not understand why one group of lone parents gets the premium and the other does not when they are both required to participate in work-related activity. In practical terms, we are far more likely to get a positive response and outlook from lone parents with an additional premium than with the threat of sanction, which impoverishes and demoralises both them and their children.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000008"></a>This amendment proposes what the Government themselves proposed for this group of lone parents in paragraph 2.70 of their July Green Paper <I>No One Written Off. </I>It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09062211000103"></a>&#147;to encourage those with children under five to take part in these activities voluntarily at an earlier point in time, we will also pilot a &#147;skills for work&#148; premium for agreed activity, on top of existing benefit entitlement&#148;.</ul>

Can we hope that my noble friend, appropriately nudged, will come back with his own amendment to introduce a work-related premium to lone parents in this situation? I beg to move.</p>

This is the ultimate carrot for lone parents, which we on these Benches support. As she suggested at Second Reading and today, giving lone parents on income support who come under the provisions of the Bill a financial incentive to undertake work-related activity would be a much better idea than sanctioning them if they failed to comply. As she has said, claimants of the work-related activity component of ESA already receive an additional premium of &#163;24 above the JSA rate for participating in work-focused interviews. So the

We thought that it was going to be in this Bill because of what was in the Green Paper.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000013"></a>Basing the new policy on incentives rather than sanctions is a much more attractive proposition. It may be worth nothing that when my honourable friend Paul Rowen suggested this proposition in the other place, the then Secretary of State, James Purnell, seemed to be confused. He referred to the additional financial support available to single parents starting in employment, not to those in the progression-to-work group of single parents. We support the amendment and look forward to hearing the Government&#146;s reply.</p>

Income support is not generous. For mothers having to struggle on benefits, the thought of losing benefit is more likely to be a disincentive than an incentive to the join the groups and the steps leading to work. It is very important to encourage rather than to penalise. I should like to say, &#147;Well done to the noble Baroness&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062211000015"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062211000116"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I must confess that I got confused when reading this first amendment on today&#146;s Marshalled List. We are looking at an amendment which would insert a new clause to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act, which in turn appears to refer to work-related activity, as defined in Section 2D of the Social Security Administration Act that is about to be created by the Bill. It is a tortuous path and I must confess that I am not there yet. But I hazard it that the aim of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment is to make sure that any money or at least some money on a work-related activity does not count towards any amount disregarded as income on which supplementary benefits are based. From what the noble Baroness said, she was talking about &#163;24, which is the same amount as is available under ESA, to which I will turn in a minute.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000016"></a>I am not sure that I agree with the noble Baroness in her basic proposition. For a start, I am not at all clear that work-related activity will produce any income. I had assumed that if one was earning money from an activity, that would be work. We have touched on this before, but perhaps this would be a good opportunity for the Minister to clarify these definitions. If the work-related activity does not produce an income, the applicable amount referred to in the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act would not be affected one way or the other. However, should the work-related activity generate an income, what reason is there for that to be entirely disregarded, which, as I understand it, could occur under the amendment? Let us take the hypothetical situation&#151;I admit that it is very unlikely&#151;where a participant in the back-to-work scheme lands a work-related activity which pays more than the amount that they would receive on benefits. Why should there be a total disregard so that full benefit is paid as well? I accept that this extreme scenario will almost certainly never happen, but the principle remains. I, too, would like to know why a single parent is to receive no disregard, while a single parent with a disabled child would receive a disregard. It seems totally illogical, and I, too, look forward to what the Minister has to say.</p>

<p><a name="09062211000017"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="09062211000117"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> I thank my noble friend Lady Hollis for the amendment and for her express support for the policy thrust of the Bill. I say with respect to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that he has conflated issues in this amendment with the amendment that is to follow. I think that the thrust of this amendment is that there should be a work-related component available for those undertaking work-related activity. It is the next amendment which looks at a level of disregard, which my noble friend&#146;s amendment seeks to increase. We need to unpick those things. I note also that my noble friend&#146;s amendment has the support of the noble Countess, Lady Mar, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000018"></a>While the amendment has wider connotations, it is clearly directed at our intention, under Clause 2, to require lone parents and partners of benefit recipients to undertake work-related activity as part of the conditions for full benefit entitlement. We know that the vast majority of those on benefits aspire to work at some point and that paid work is good for them and their children in nearly every circumstance. To help more parents meet their aspirations and do more to eradicate child poverty, we have continued to invest heavily in evidence-based policy measures during the past 10 years. The changes that we are discussing today are a further step forward along that path.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000019"></a>This is all positive. However, as we have taken forward evidence-based policies, we have learnt that there is more we need to do. We have learnt from the current conditionality and support regime that we have in place that there is still a very significant disparity between the numbers who would like to move into paid work and those who actually take steps toward achieving this. We therefore want those parents in the progression-to-work group to undertake appropriate and personalised requirements as part of the condition of their benefit entitlement.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000020"></a>Here, I need to part company with my noble friend, because the thrust of the provisions in the Bill is focused on personalised support, the aspiration being that their level of support should be driven not be what benefit a person is on but by the help that they need in meeting those barriers to work.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000021"></a>To deliver this, we will ask claimants to agree with an adviser the steps that they are willing to take to make progress towards a return to work at the appropriate time for them. To help them achieve this, we shall provide a system of highly flexible and personalised support from the outset. The model of conditionality and support that we want to test is based on an expectation that they will undertake these agreed activities as part of their journey towards employment. Without this, many parents who can move towards the labour market will not take up the assistance that is available so that they can start to move closer to the labour market and be better placed to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000022"></a>In addition, we will ensure that we adopt a very broad definition of work-related activity that encompasses more traditional training, skills and job-related support,  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC347"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and wider, socially inclusive measures such as volunteering, undertaking parenting programmes or consulting a debt adviser. We therefore want to test this approach on lone parents and partners with a youngest child aged three to six by introducing pathfinders in 2010, as we have discussed in earlier Committee sittings.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000023"></a>We do not believe that it is right to look at a single component of a particular benefit and compare it with another where the structure and client group are radically different. That is why we have decided, notwithstanding that the quotes that my noble friend read out, not to mirror the employment and support allowance provisions in the progression-to-work pathfinders.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000024"></a>We acknowledge the extra difficulties and costs which lone parents face because of the caring responsibilities for their children. That is why they receive child tax credits and assistance with childcare payments. The extra expenses which occur when a lone parent on income support undertakes work-related activity are mainly for childcare and travel. That is why Jobcentre Plus will reimburse childcare costs and travel expenses, including those relating to travel to the childcare facility. Lone parents with a health condition can, of course, claim employment and support allowance and, if they do, they may qualify for the work-related component.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000025"></a>I appreciate that linking the requirements to undertake work-related activity with the payment with a specific additional premium can seem attractive but I think the noble Baroness will recognise that it is only reasonable in the context of the support provided as a whole. On that basis, I ask my noble friend not to press her amendment.</p>

That is why I return to the fact that we want to test the conditionality provided for in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000030"></a>There are also issues about the extent to which sanctions effectively encourage compliance. The internal Department for Work and Pensions&#146; administrative data show that, under the current income support regime, around one in 20 lone parents who are subjected to the work-focused interview regime are sanctioned each year but of those sanctioned more than half go on to attend a work-focused interview within six months. We do not see sanctioning as the objective of the regime, as it means a failure of the regime, but there is evidence that a sanctioning regime is a necessary component of the conditionality in which we ask people to engage.</p>

I understand that. Can my noble friend tell me&#151;I should know this, so forgive me&#151;whether the Bill contains capacity through regulatory power to introduce a work-focused premium at a later stage by regulations as opposed to primary legislation? I understand the point my noble friend is making that at the moment he has no evidence to suggest that we need a work-focused interview premium let alone a work-related premium of &#163;24 a week to add to the attractiveness for lone parents of coming into the programme and that, at the moment, he thinks that sanctions will be good enough because he has evidence that they work, to some degree, for lone parents failing to attend work-focused interviews at six-monthly intervals, but should he be proved erroneous, as is quite possible, and as there may be varying patterns in the country according to how far one lives from opportunities&#151;a rural pathway may be very different from a city one with decent transport and so on&#151;does the Bill contain the powers to introduce such premiums by regulation, whether on a piloted, regional or any other subset basis or would he have to come back for primary legislation? Can he assure me that there are powers by regulation and that as a result we will monitor this and see whether we need to introduce it? If so, I would be much more accepting of his position.

I reiterate that it is no part of our current intent to have a work-related component for work-related activity outside the ESA regime. Our policy is as set out in the White Paper. The short answer is that there is no provision in the primary legislation at the moment, but I shall certainly go away and think about whether there should be. However, I do not want to give my noble friend false hopes on that, because it is not the intent. If all lone parents on income support with a youngest child between three and six received a work-related premium of about &#163;25 a week, which is the ESA work-related premium, the cost would be of the order of &#163;300 million a year. That assumes no change of behaviour; I accept that that does not necessarily follow. But the short answer is that there is no provision in the Bill at the moment and no intent to include one, but I shall take away my noble friend&#146;s point.</p>

The situation between those in the pilots and those not in the pilots would be seen as monstrously unfair. I suspect that there will be a certain amount of thinking of unfairness in the pilots anyway, but that would be the straw that broke the camel&#146;s back. If it were to be introduced after the Minister&#146;s consultations and further thought, it should be introduced when the whole scheme goes live and not as a pilot.</p>

All that I was trying to suggest was that, if my noble friend was unwilling to take this proposal on in the current legislation&#151;and I understand his point&#151;he might give himself the reserve power so that he could. I take the noble Lord&#146;s on pilots. My noble friend is relying on the power of sanctions to deliver compliance with work-related activity. All my experience shows that you need sanctions but that you get a further mileage in compliance with an additional premium, when it becomes increasingly cost effective. To find out whether that is the case, you sometimes have to do pilots in which you can compare a group with the premium with a group without. So I take the noble Lord&#146;s point, but that is true for all the piloted new deals involving additional support. Unless you have a control group, you do not know what works. I agree that it is not especially desirable in the sense of any notion of unfairness, but it would at least allow you to establish how effective sanctions are as against, or in addition to, an additional premium.</p>

<p><a name="09062211000043"></a>Lone parents on IS currently have a disregard of &#163;20 a week, which equates to about three and a half hours of work.

It makes sense, given that they are sometimes patching together part-time jobs whose hours will alter according to their own needs and those of their children, such as during holidays, and those of the employers, many of whom want extra seasonal help&#151;and many of whom deliberately peg jobs at 15 hours a week to avoid NI contributions and keep the lone parents below the lower earnings limit.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000045"></a>Mini-jobs, as Kate Bell&#146;s research at Gingerbread has shown, make good sense for many lone parents. They increase their income and skills, whether till work, teamwork or stock control. They increase sociability and self-esteem and the parents learn about a wider world of work opportunities: the knowledge network that comes from knowing what is going on, which those isolated on benefit so often lack. All the research shows that one of the biggest barriers to getting back into work is the lack of access to the knowledge economy of what is going on in the labour market.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000046"></a>We want a staircase into work, not the daft present system. It is worth it if you are a lone parent working for three to four hours a week: you keep every penny. Then for the next 12.5 hours or so a week, you lose every additional penny. Then, at 16 hours&#151;bingo!&#151;you double your pay. Who could have thought of such a scheme? Not women, I think.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000047"></a>The amendment is obviously more probing than most, because it puts a figure of &#163;87 in the Bill, which is not sensible at all&#151;in fact, it is really rather silly&#151;as we would need primary legislation to uprate it. However, that figure is there to indicate the purpose of the amendment. The disregard is worth at least 15 hours a week at the minimum wage, and at 16 hours a week you go into tax-credit-supported work. The amendment sounds generous, but it has already been conceded that claimants on ESA can earn up to &#163;88.50 a week without losing access to benefits. We have always had similar and rightly helpful benefit top-ups, such as therapeutic earnings for disabled people. It would cost the taxpayer nothing because the lone parent receives the benefit as usual and the employer, not the Government, tops it up with a part-time wage.</p>

<p><a name="09062211000048"></a>I willingly concede that, providing it is kept simple, a taper might be appropriate or we could limit such an arrangement to the first two years back to work or until the youngest child is seven. Recent research by Gingerbread and the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that this would increase voluntary employment of lone parents by 5 per cent or more, which is as much as we have achieved in the past five years of elaborate policy-making and new deals. Make work pay, and work works. It is already the case that 27 per cent of jobs advertised in jobcentres are for less than 16 hours a week because employers need flexi-working. Indeed, lone parents who are currently working 16 or 18 hours a week are, in a recession, finding their hours cut back to 12 or 14 hours a week and they immediately cannot afford to work because they lose every penny beyond the original disregard of &#163;20. That is what happens when you have snakes instead of ladders, which is the system we have devised.</p>

<p><a name="09062211000049"></a>Even if my noble friend cannot agree today to introduce a staircase of opportunity moving from benefits into work, I am sure he would wish to do so once he has thought through all the implications. I accept that it would be an 18-month policy haul because of the read-across to other benefits that always bedevils social security, although it is easy enough to do. However, we could give much of the same help if we took the path that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, indicated and increased the disregard for lone parents from the current &#163;20 a week to &#163;50 a week, although that is not as generous as my &#163;87. What would that mean? For the lone parent it would be worth working nine hours a week before benefits deduction came into play; it is very simple, and it can easily be done in 48 hours by regulation rather than after 18 months&#146; policy haul. Bluntly, this is the amendment I would really like to see delivered, for reasons I hope to argue, and I might wish to come back to it on Report, if that seemed appropriate.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000050"></a>What are the amendment&#146;s virtues? First, it would help child poverty. An extra &#163;50 a week on top of benefits would be transforming. For the lone parent, along with any child maintenance, it would lift her and her children well above the poverty line. Is it not worth going after a really noticeable reduction in child poverty? After all, we have a child poverty Bill ahead of us. Secondly, it would help the lone parent remain attached to the labour market. The evidence shows that mini-jobs are the best preparation for a 16-hour tax-credit-supported proper job. Working nine hours each week, sorting out the transport and the childcare and learning the appropriate skills are a far more effective way to prepare a mother for conventional, full-time work than all the interviews, action plans, CV training, skills courses&#151;which may not relate to local jobs&#151;newspaper adverts search and the rest in the work-preparation package. I support that work-preparation package, but the best preparation for work is not work preparation, with hours spent travelling to and from the jobcentre, but work. Precisely because the mother is a willing employee, not a reluctant conscript, she will sustain it and build on it and we are there. She is doing exactly what we want her to do and gaining experience in the world of real work, so why do we not make that possible and attractive rather than punish her by taking away some of her benefit?</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000051"></a>Child poverty reduction and the lone parent in work are the first two arguments. The third is that it would help the employer, who would have a larger pool of flexible labour on which to draw. I repeat, more than a quarter, and I suspect it will soon be a third, of jobs in Jobcentre Plus are for fewer than 16 hours. As the recession recedes, an employer with a woman in a nine-hours-a-week job would be poised to increase her hours so that, in time, she can come off benefit and go into tax-credit-supported work. Many employers hesitate to employ a lone parent, as they do a disabled person, because of possibly misguided fears of unreliability. It would take the employer&#146;s risk out of employing her, as the risk of entering work is taken out for her. She would know that she can cope and that she is comfortable. We all know that the best way of getting a better job is to be in one already, preferably with the same employer.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000052"></a>Fourthly, it would also help to get fraud out of the system. One of the biggest reasons for fraud is that a lone parent, understandably from hers and her child&#146;s point of view, does work on the side&#151;perhaps cleaning&#151;which she does not declare and she is always nervous about whether a neighbour might report her to the social, which adds to the stress in her life.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000053"></a>Finally, it would be really cheap. With more wet towels I could possibly establish that it might even save the Government real money. Taxpayers pay benefit exactly as is&#151;no change&#151;and forgo only the tiny amount of benefit that a highly scrupulous, lone parent now declares which is deducted. Of course, they either do not work now, because it is not worth it, or they do and they do not declare it. The extra money&#151;the &#163;50&#151;which the lone parent gets comes because she has worked for it and the employer is paying for it; it does not come from taxpayers. If even half of lone parents with children under the age of seven work nine hours, it would cost taxpayers a modest &#163;20 million a year and, I suspect, even that is a serious overestimate. The cost of putting all lone parents through the work-preparation scheme would also be about &#163;20 million a year, a tentative figure, according to the regulatory impact assessment. Given the much greater likelihood of lone parents moving fully off benefit earlier from a mini-job than from any work-preparation scheme, however desirable&#151;and I support them&#151;the Government could expect to see savings much sooner as those parents will no longer need to rely on benefit. There is no contest and I would have thought it was a no-brainer. In net terms, we might even save the Government money.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000054"></a>I urge my noble friend to bring a proposal forward on Report, or possibly, more sensibly, a commitment to do this by regulation, as it should be done of course, to increase the disregard to &#163;50 a week. I know that the previous Secretary of State and the department were exploring that. Think of the gains: first, a real contribution to lifting children out of poverty; secondly, as it is a mini-job, it is a sensible and decent preparation for work, infinitely more effective, appropriate and in real time than action plans, work preparation and the like; thirdly, it would take fraud out of the system; fourthly, it would help the employer; and, fifthly, it would be so cheap and effective that compared with work-preparation programmes it could well save the Government money. I suggest to my noble friend that it is a no-brainer. I beg to move.</p>

As she has said, it is intended to ensure that the income disregard for lone parents is at least the value of 15 hours at the national minimum wage. That is where the complication of the benefit system comes in. As she said, ESA claimants may claim up to &#163;92 a week, although I think it has gone up, without losing access to means-tested benefits, enabling them to work in jobs of fewer than 16 hours, after which they would become entitled to tax credits. However, single parents on benefits can earn only &#163;20 a week, meaning that there is no financial incentive to work in jobs of between four and 16 hours.

It is worth pointing out, as the noble Baroness has said today and on previous occasions, that this would do a huge amount for child poverty, which often simply means lone-parent poverty. We support the amendment and hope that it will receive a favourable response from the Minister.</p>

As will be recalled, we discussed lone parents earlier in the passage of the Bill. I took the view at the very beginning that lone parents ought to have a choice as to whether they spend their time looking after their children or try to access a work environment in some way or other. The amendment comes to terms with that choice. Many lone parents want flexibility. They want to be able to decide how little work they can do and not lose any benefit, which this amendment is designed to enable. It would therefore be desirable for it to be included in the Bill and I hope that the Minister will agree with it in principle on Report, even though he may not like the wording.</p>

I had not planned to make a speech and am relying somewhat on my memory of 30 or 35 years ago when I was heavily involved in campaigning for increases in the income disregard; in those days it was &#163;4 a week. The arguments that were always put to me in that context were around the poverty trap. I very much support the basic principle of the amendment, that you need a stepladder back into work. However, I am conscious of the huge complexities of achieving a nice, neat stepladder because of the multitude of benefits and the implications for the incentive to get closer to full-time work if you have a clunky income disregard. I hope that the Minister takes the amendment away and gives serious thought to how best to achieve a nice, neat little stepladder. However, I fear that, in trying to achieve that, he will have to take account of the housing benefit withdrawal rate, changes in council tax as your income increases, and so on. It is no simple business. I remember huge tables of this sort of material from many years ago.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000058"></a>I support the principle of the amendment, but the Minister and his department will have a lot of work to do if he is to achieve this without dropping large numbers of single parents into a poverty trap at a slightly higher level; that is, if he is really going to achieve a money saving, which is ultimately what the Government&#151;and no doubt any alternative Government&#151;would be after, by encouraging lone parents to return to work in a way that would reduce the state contribution to their weekly income. I hope that I have said enough to convey one or two points to the Committee.</p>

Since 1998, however, we have introduced the tax credits system

If you are on the minimum wage, something like &#163;5.85 or &#163;5.95 an hour, a tax credit doubles the take-home pay so that an unskilled lone parent will get the take-home pay of semi-skilled man. As a result, there is no poverty trap, because of the effectiveness of the tax credits. What the noble Baroness said was absolutely true when disregards were first introduced. It is no longer true. We therefore have a clean sheet and can move forward.</p>

Coming from a rural community as I do, I am used to the idea of seasonal workers&#151;strawberry picking, asparagus cutting, raspberry picking and even goose plucking in the winter. That is how things work. What concerns me a little is that it will not be the same people doing all those different jobs. A young mother may, as I have done myself, take her child with her to work; that is what I used to do when I was younger. She can earn quite a lot in a short period of time, but then there is a desert when she has no more. How could that be balanced out?</p>

Of course, seasonal work has to come into this, but the real problem is that we do not have a graduated withdrawal system across the board. The basic stumbling block has always been the 16-hour rule. Until we find a way in which to get rid of that we have to accept either disregard, as in this amendment, or absolute allowances, as in the noble Baroness&#146;s first amendment.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000063"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is clearly warming to her theme. I do not wish her to think that I am determined to thwart her at every turn. I have a great deal of sympathy with this amendment, which she moved, as usual, with great passion. It is difficult to pick a figure that everyone can agree with; the amendment mentions &#163;87 as acceptable for subsistence. It is even harder to do that when one is trying to balance one&#146;s genuine concern for struggling parents with the cold necessity of working out what is affordable and practicable. I hope that my genuine concern is not in doubt. The figure of &#163;87 that would be disregarded for lone parents is around the ball park of the numbers I have seen suggested. I believe that the Z2K Trust has calculated the subsistence level to be &#163;64.30 a week, so an extra &#163;22.70 would not seem excessive if there are children involved. But I now understand what the noble Baroness was saying, and that her ultimate objective is to have a &#163;50 one.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000064"></a>I expect that the Minister will be able to furnish us with his department&#146;s most up-to-date statistics, along with his reasons for resisting the amendment. However, I hope that they will not be too strong, as I agree with  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC356"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>everyone who has spoken. I shall be interested to hear his response, because there is a case to be made&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, has just done&#151;for protecting a certain level of income for single parents.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000065"></a>I was interested in the figures that the noble Baroness gave. I should like to know why a single parent is perhaps slightly disadvantaged in these cases. That said, I should like to examine the figures that she gave us; if her proposal is really close to cost-neutral and the Minister said that it would not be unreasonable in the terms of the Bill, I would be more favourably disposed towards the amendment. The noble Baroness will understand why I cannot go any further than that at the moment. However, parents do maintain responsibility for their children and when they can afford to pay for their childcare, they must continue to do so. The Minister has already told us that when parents cannot afford to pay for childcare, the jobcentre will pay for them. As with so many debates that we have had in Grand Committee, the same theme raises its head: much depends on getting the action plans right. Getting childcare arrangements sorted out to the satisfaction of parents is crucial to the success of the scheme. For that reason, all noble Lords will be thinking carefully about how to approach action plans, as this matter will be returned to with some gusto on Report.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000066"></a>What I have just said has very little to do with the finances behind the amendment, but I believe it to be true just the same. We should look at these two things together, as I have no doubt the Minister is about to do.</p>

<p><a name="09062211000067"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09062211000140"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I hope that I can give my noble friend more comfort on this amendment than on the previous one&#151;although perhaps not total comfort; I do not want to raise her hopes unduly.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000068"></a>We announced in our response to the Gregg review that the department would test an improved financial incentive for parents with younger children to work less than 16 hours while on benefit in the progression-to-work pathfinders. On the question whether mini-jobs lead to other employment opportunities, research&#151;which I think is the research to which my noble friend referred&#151;shows that mini-jobs could play a role in engaging mothers in the labour market and allowing them to combine both caring for children and working. Mini-jobs may be appealing particularly to those who are further from the labour market, such as those with young children, or those who have a larger family and lack of qualifications. Being in a mini-job helps them remain in employment. The impact of mini-jobs for couple-mothers is less clear. The evidence suggests that participation in mini-jobs tends to be a stable activity of couple-mothers.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000069"></a>As a result of our desire to test and improve financial incentive, we are proposing to introduce in the pathfinders an earnings disregard higher than the current &#163;20 a week into income support for lone parents working below 16 hours a week. Our evaluation has indicated that an appropriate amount to test would be to increase the current disregard to &#163;50 a week. The rationale is that it balances the increase in income that a lone parent receives when working on benefit when they obtain a mini-job and the need to ensure that lone

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000070"></a>As my noble friend pointed out at Second Reading, we would not want a lone parent to miss out on moving into work of 16 hours or more a week and accessing tax credits where they can. Some people are able to double their take-home minimum wage and make work really pay&#151;again, as my noble friend instanced.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000071"></a>It is crucial to test the improved incentive of a &#163;50 disregard within the pathfinder areas to try out work while on benefits. It will represent one way in which lone parents can be encouraged to take up work-related activity that helps them make the transition into full-time work as part of the progression-to-work pathfinders. The new amount also represents a relatively simple and clear increase in the disregard and a much improved incentive to try out work while on benefits, without allowing lone parents to receive significantly more by working fewer hours and staying on benefits than if they were working 16 hours or more.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000072"></a>The provision would not provide the step-progression that my noble friend referred to, because, at a &#163;50 disregard, you are pretty much on the cusp of whether working just slightly under 16 hours equates to working 16 hours and being out of benefits and into the tax credits system. With the &#163;50 disregard, there would be a level income for somebody working about eight hours through to working just under 16 hours. The provision does not deal with the step-progression that my noble friend sought, but seeks to test improved financial incentives for parents in mini-jobs, which is the key point that my noble friend was pressing.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000073"></a>We also feel that it is inappropriate to specify an amount in primary legislation, because we would have to debate a new amount every time we wanted to change it. That is best left to delegated legislation and the processes already in place; for example, scrutiny by the Social Security Advisory Committee. Having heard what we intend to do, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09062211000074"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09062211000141"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> First, I thank every member of the Committee who has taken part in this debate and for their support. I understand the caution of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale&#151;some of us have been in that situation before&#151;but the fact that he supports the amendment in principle and recognises the stumbling block of the 16 hours is welcome. Most of us would agree that in an ideal world, if one were doing a zero-sum game, one would indeed have a step system. But it is quite a profound policy haul because of the interface; therefore, we need time and reflection. We can get much of the same benefit by going for the simple disregard.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062211000075"></a>I was delighted at my noble friend&#146;s response. He will not be surprised if I ask him some questions on timing, numbers and rollout. Would he regard this as being in place of work preparation&#151;otherwise being work preparation itself? I would obviously be entirely satisfied with keeping six-monthly WFIs going so that one could keep track, so to speak.</p>

As we have already discussed, we are looking to pilot progression-to-work pathfinders in about 10 to 12 areas. The pathfinders should start in October 2010 and run for two years, followed by an evaluation. That is the rough timescale. Until we have done further work on the full scope of the pathfinders, it is impossible to say precisely how many lone parents will be affected, but my noble friend will recognise from her experience that there is inevitably an evaluation process that follows. I can give no particular timelines about going through the process and completing the evaluation but the pathfinders will certainly start in October 2010.</p>

I was going on to say that people might start off in that progression-to-work group; they will undertake work-related activity and may try out mini-jobs, with the benefit of an increased disregard, and that may lead them on more quickly than would otherwise be the case to work of 16 hours a week or more. There is the chance to progress, although they would not necessarily stay on those pathfinders for two years.</p>

This is strange territory for me. Education is where home educators and I belong. I have drifted into this because of the Badman review and how home education is being handled from an educational point of view. I take an interest in that and therefore one of the related questions: how are these people handled by the welfare system?</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000002"></a>The home education community is immensely diverse. I do not think that it can be categorised in any useful way. Clearly, a number of people home educate out of conviction&#151;either that is their educational philosophy or they have a religious requirement which is not met by the state system. The majority are there by default because the state system has failed their children. They have children with special educational needs. I am sure the noble Baroness will recognise that many schools do not deal with such children properly. That is just a fact of life. If your child is disappearing down a whirlpool at school, it is noble and honourable to pick him out, take him home, look after him and make sure that he is educated properly. Some have children who,   


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC361"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC361</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rather than having a diagnosable special educational need, are just shy, have been bullied, have become school phobics or in some way or another have become children who are extremely difficult to educate at school.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000003"></a>As regards the state, these parents are doing something supportive. In educating their child at home, they immediately save the state &#163;4,500 a year&#151;the cost of educating a child in the state system. The Government do not have to pay that money to anyone when a child is home educated. The parents do not receive any support in any way from the local authority. They pay for GCSE entrance fees, swimming lessons and all sorts of other things which are provided as a matter of course to children in the schooling system. These parents are not living off the state. They are taking a substantial burden on themselves which the state would ordinarily assume.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000004"></a>It seems to me that the welfare system should deal properly and sympathetically with such parents, which is by no means always the case. It appears to be the habit of some officers at jobcentres to say that if the parents cannot get childcare, the children have to go back to school. That is an extremely rough thing to say in front of the child, who is always there because if you are home educating your child would be with you. That can cause extreme harm to the child if it is done under the wrong circumstances. Anyway, it is not the right thing to do. There needs to be an understanding that the childcare provided should be appropriate to the child. A child with special educational needs&#151;for example, on the autistic spectrum&#151;will need to have predictability and regularity about the way in which childcare is provided. They cannot just hop from one childcare provider to another. The childcare provider will need to have an understanding of a child&#146;s condition. For these parents, signing on is burdensome. Because they have their child traipsing backwards and forwards to the jobcentre every other week, often on a long train or bus journey, several hours of the schooling day are taken up by useless transporting.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000005"></a>These conditions are not imposed in relatively parallel circumstances. If a child is excluded from school or if you are the subject of a school attendance order, the system makes allowances for it. It does not make you travel to the jobcentre. It allows you to sign on by post. It makes other concessions which make the job of looking after children in those circumstances easier. But the Government are not prepared to extend those familiar ways of working to home educators. Again, if you are asking a home educator to look for work, that work must be something that they can fit around their child, particularly if child-minding is a difficult thing to come by. Training as a child-minder and child-minding might be a pretty good way of helping these parents, but the Government have cut back enormously on the number of places on such training schemes.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000006"></a>Home-working is another good way of getting these parents back into the job market, but home-working opportunities are not generally available through jobcentres. Many of these parents are quite active and intelligent, and if you were not that you would be foolhardy to take on educating your own child. They are quite capable of running their own businesses

Again, however, the jobcentre does not seem to be in the business of pointing people in the right direction.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000007"></a>I would like to see an understanding and supportive attitude; not bending the Government&#146;s objectives of getting people back into work for all the benefits thereof, but being prepared to use the flexibility that they extend to others to make the whole business of being a home-educating parent looking for work easier. I would like to see them adapt what they are doing with the sort of jobs they are prepared to offer and the sort of opportunities they are prepared to support in the circumstances of home-educating parents.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000008"></a>We will come back to this in other contexts and other fora over the next year or so, as the Badman review works itself out and we get into the business of how home-educating parents are to be integrated into the system, which is clearly going to happen. They are likely to have a register and be known to the authorities. There is even talk of some kind of local authority support. Since we now have the Bill in front of us, we should at least begin to think about how the welfare system should treat home-educating parents, and what concessions and additional facilities can be extended to them so that the Government&#146;s objectives, which I by and large share, are achieved in a way that benefits both the Government and the parents concerned. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000010"></a>My hope and belief is that that was the Government&#146;s intention, because if it is not it is simply a back door to doing away with home education. I ask the Minister whether, as it seems to me, home education would fall within new Section 2F(2) in Clause (2):</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062214000033"></a>&#147;A direction under subsection (1) given to any person ... must be reasonable, having regard to the person&#146;s circumstances&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062214000028"></a>Would &#147;the person&#146;s circumstances&#148; include home education? Would the new section be sympathetic to it?</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000012"></a>We know that the Government will not accept that home educators who are lone parents on benefits should be exempt from the provisions of the Bill to attend Jobcentre Plus for work-focused interviews or work-related activity. This is presumably because they think that there is a lot of flexibility built into being a home educator and, therefore, that lone parents who are home educators can attend Jobcentre Plus for work-focused interviews, and possibly work-related

But why can that not be regarded as work-related activities, as the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said? As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, many lone parents who home educate their children do so for practical reasons, such as the presence of a disabled child for whom it may be very difficult to get the appropriate childcare.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000013"></a>It seems to me that if new rules are to be brought in, including registration, right of access of local authority officials and more support for home educators&#151;those points were in the Badman report&#151;there is no reason at all why the Government should not also agree that home education is, at the very least, work-related activity. They cannot have it both ways. The Minister&#146;s erstwhile colleague in the department, the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, said that they have always been clear that parents should retain the right to educate their children at home, that most home educators do a fantastic job and that she wants to ensure that they get more support from local authorities. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

That balance revolves around the fact that the longer an individual is out of work the more difficult it becomes for them to return to work. The Bill seeks to address that essential feature. In that context, we must be certain that any exclusions to the proposals in Clause 2&#151;the progression-to-work group&#151;on which we settle do not end up with a financial and psychological downside to the entire family.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000015"></a>Those thoughts bring me to Amendment 74, in the name of my noble friend Lord Lucas. It seeks to exclude parents&#151;I am not sure whether it is one or both&#151;from the progression-to-work group on the basis that they are educating their children at home, perhaps because the latter are subject to school exclusion or have been bullied at school and have subsequently been withdrawn or simply because the parents believe that their children will be better educated if that education were conducted at home rather than in a conventional school setting. I have to confess that a department of state which I have had nothing to do with in my relatively short time in this House is the Department of Education and Science as it used to be called, or in the modern idiom the Department for Children, Schools and Families. My noble friend Lord Lucas should not feel unnerved by finding himself drifting, to quote his words, into this Bill and this Committee. As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, have said, his interest is an important one for the Committee to consider.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000016"></a>I support the view that parents should have the right to support and educate their children as they feel fit, subject of course to the necessary safeguards.

Of course, that must be a judgment but I know where my opinion sits. While I would not deny the right of parents to educate their children as they want, it would be wrong for taxpayers to finance, admittedly at a fairly low level of income, the living of a family who chose to educate their children at home.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000017"></a>The likely response of my noble friend to this matter is that by educating the children at home they are saving taxpayers&#146; money. In the short term that is undoubtedly correct but I ask my noble friend to think of the longer term as it applies to the children and to their parents after what may well be 11 years out of the workplace. How likely are those parents to get into work? Will taxpayers have to support them through the rest of their lives? What effect will that have on the children? How likely are they to end up in the world of work? No doubt the Minister will give us some statistics, if she has them, of the propensity of that. I shall await her response with interest.</p>

We can talk about parenting and motherhood or fatherhood as a job, but that considerably expands the discussion of the Bill, and I do not believe that is the background against which it is being proposed. I hope I have explained the downside of an environment where regular work is not part of the family&#146;s background. I am sure that one reason why the Government have brought forward the Bill is to increase the number of families, both single parents and married couples, who find themselves with an opportunity to work because it is the framework in which children may find a more fulfilled life.</p>

We have had a good, wide-ranging and useful debate on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I begin by repeating the quote from my noble friend Lady Morgan, the children&#146;s Minister, used by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, which demonstrates how the Government have to strike a balance in our response. It was from my noble friend&#146;s immediate response to the Badman report and its recommendations. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062214000034"></a>&#147;We&#146;ve always been clear that parents should retain the right to educate their children at home. Most home educators do a fantastic job and I want to ensure they get more support from Local Authorities.

<p><a name="09062214000029"></a>That is the balance that we are looking for.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC365"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC365</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>undertaking it. While I recognise that parents can choose to home educate their children, it remains the case that paid work is the best way out of poverty for parents and their families, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, intimated. Parents who choose to educate their children at home will need to be able to balance home educating activities with the steps they need to take to improve their long-term labour market prospects.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000022"></a>In addition, funding is not provided by government by way of benefits or otherwise to undertake home education. We believe that about 20,000 children are being educated at home, but it could well be double that, and we will discuss that when we come to the Badman report. The Government do not consider that parents who choose to educate their children at home should be treated more favourably in benefit terms than those whose children attend school. It would therefore be inconsistent with current government policy if benefit recipients who were also home educators were not required to participate in &#147;work for your benefit&#148;, as outlined in Clause 1 or to undertake work-related activity under Clause 2, if it was required of them. Nor do the Government think it is right to exempt home educators claiming JSA from signing on at a Jobcentre Plus office. However, as we have already stated, some parents will be exempted from work-related activity, as they are now from seeking work, because of the extra caring responsibilities that they have. We spoke about the higher proportion of children with SEN who are being home educated; those parents who are in receipt of carer&#146;s allowance or who have a child who is in receipt of the middle or highest rate care component of disability living allowance will not be required to undertake these activities.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000023"></a>In addition, unlike many parents who send their child to school, parents who choose to educate their child at home do not have to observe school hours, days or terms and may therefore&#151;and this is the other side of the coin from the point that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, made about time constraints&#151;have greater flexibility to fit paid work or work-related activity around their children&#146;s education. Therefore, home educators, like other parents, should be able to identify times which fit with their family and other commitments so they can undertake work-related activity or participate in &#147;work for your benefit&#148;. As with all other people subject to these new arrangements, home educators will not be penalised if they have good cause for not taking up a job&#151;I think that that was the gist of the question that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, asked; the availability and suitability of childcare will be central to such a decision. The jobseeker&#146;s allowance regulations were amended last year to make this clear. We will, of course, listen carefully to the responses to our public consultation on elective home education currently underway in response to the Graham Badman review.</p>

<p><a name="09062214000024"></a>Noble Lords asked me a number of questions. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, talked about the training of childminders and their ability. I understand that we have not cut back on the training for childminders. The number of childminders has dropped; the number of places provided by childminders has increased.</p>

<p><a name="09062214000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, spoke about statistics. I am not sure whether I answered his question. The statistics that we have at the moment say that 20,000 children are in this position, but we believe the number is far greater. One point of the Badman report is to have far better monitoring of the whole situation, which I am sure means support for home educators as well as being important for the well-being and safety of children and the duty of local authorities to ensure that that duty of care is carried out. There must be better monitoring, better support and better regular visits.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, asked about the reasonableness of what is required of home educators. A decision-maker would take into account the fact that there is a school-age child in the house; home education as such may not be relevant but for the availability of childcare it would be relevant. The state recognises that the childcare responsibility of home carers is a relevant issue on which to engage with home carers. However, it does not recognise that the education responsibility of home carers is one that it should discuss with home educators, because that is a voluntary activity on the part of parents.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062214000027"></a>I hope that I have answered the questions and urge the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

It has been an education to me, and one from which I will profit, to listen to all noble Lords on this occasion. I can see that there is a consensus, at least at this end of the Table, on the objectives of jobseeker&#146;s allowance, what it is seeking to achieve and how it goes about it. As a stranger in this territory, I shall seek to work within that consensus.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000002"></a>The noble Baroness said that home educators should go to their fortnightly interviews. I will research more whether that is a good or bad thing. I am not entirely sure whether it is totally constructive, given that other parents in similar situations but tied into the state are very much the same position&#151;such as if their child has been excluded from school, has not been allocated a school or has a school attendance order but does not have to attend every couple of weeks. I must try to understand why the Government make that concession in those circumstances and are never prepared to consider it for home educators.</p>

Anyway, I admit my ignorance in this area and will try to educate myself between now and Report.

Certainly, that is related to me by many home educators: they are told that that if they cannot find childcare they will have to send the kid back to school. Given these circumstances, whether it is philosophical or a child&#146;s crisis at the school, that does not seem to be an acceptable or well trained attitude to home education; it seems to me to be an uninformed attitude to it.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000005"></a>I would also like to try to understand why jobcentres are not more supportive of home-working and home businesses than they are. Why do they not, for instance, routinely refer people to the Prince&#146;s Trust if they show an interest in starting a business from home? Why do they not have a full and proper register of home-working opportunities? Again, this is none of my personal experience but just what has been related to me by home educators. I would like to try to understand these issues between now and Report. I would be most grateful for anything that the noble Baroness can do now or, indeed, later.</p>

The reason why I am moving this amendment and not the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of the Shaws, is that she thought that she might be detained in court when this amendment came up. Happily, she has managed to be here&#151;but that is why I am taking the liberty of moving this amendment from these Benches. The amendment uses the same definition of domestic violence as that used in the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, which allows a claimant

So we are not reinventing the wheel.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000009"></a>In 2008, research conducted by Gingerbread and Family Action examined the financial impact of domestic violence on women and found that it had a profound effect on women's ability to participate in employment, both while they were in a violent relationship and after they had left. Not only did it severely dent their confidence, but the very prospect of employment raised safety issues around their former partners knowing their whereabouts. Women fleeing domestic violence have also to be rehoused and resettled, often in temporary accommodation or refuges, which leads to significant disruption of their lives.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000010"></a>Reading the Report and Third Reading stages of the Bill in another place, the then Secretary of State, Mr. James Purnell, whom I seem to keep quoting, assured the Opposition spokesman that there would be three months' grace during which a woman who is housed in a refuge following domestic violence will not be required to work in order to qualify for JSA. How will that be taken forward? Will the Minister put down his own amendment? Will this be spelt out in regulations or simply be in guidance? I understand that at present Jobcentre Plus has the discretion to grant up to two months&#146; respite for women in a situation of domestic emergency to look for work. There is also a suggestion that that could be extended to three months. However, we are looking for clarity and commitment for women who are specifically fleeing domestic violence. Why should they rely on the discretion of a decision-making Jobcentre Plus in such an important area of policy? In Grand Committee, we have discovered that decision-makers do not always get these things right. Sometimes, they may even say that black is white.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000011"></a>When the Opposition spokesman asked about the three months&#146; grace, the former Secretary of State said that he could definitely give that assurance, which sounds to me like a firm promise of action. We want statutory protection for these women. I hope that however this promise is taken forward, it will extend to women who are not just in refuges following domestic violence but who might be elsewhere&#151;perhaps with a family member or friends. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09062225000012"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09062225000029"></a>Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws:</b> First, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, for taking the lead on this amendment on my behalf. I am in the middle of a difficult terrorist trial and it was looking unlikely that I would be here today. I am glad that I was able to make it and can add my words to those of the noble Baroness who has argued the case beautifully. There is little that I can add.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000013"></a>Over the years, I have been deeply involved with cases of domestic violence. When I was a much younger lawyer, it was a regular part of my practice. Now, at the much more serious end of crime, it is usually when there is a fatality that I am involved and that is deeply traumatic. The trauma of domestic violence cannot be underestimated. In the work that I now do with many of the organisations represented here today on the listening benches, we who are involved in any capacity with domestic violence know that the toll it takes is  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC369"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC369</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considerable. Women and children living in households where there is domestic violence take a long time to recover from its effects.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000014"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, mentioned the respite of three months. We should be thinking of something more considerable. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some solace on this and say that we might be talking about more than three months. I shall explain why. With regard to the exercise of discretion by those in the offices who will deal with people coming for jobseeker&#146;s allowance, there is still considerable ignorance about domestic violence. People still think that once a partner has left or a woman has left a situation of domestic violence, that is the end of things. The toll of long periods of domestic violence is so great that it often takes a very long time for people to feel able properly to engage again with the world. The idea of being able to find employment and hold down a job is truly daunting. It will take a lot of support and help for women to reach that point, often because their self-esteem has been totally undermined.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000015"></a>I want to emphasise the impact of domestic violence on children. It took many years for the judges before whom we would argue these cases to understand that when a woman was being battered it was abuse of the children too. The children became traumatised, suffered emotionally and were often damaged by witnessing the violence in their home. Those children are often very needy and need their parent in the months afterwards. It feels like a bereavement, and there are often complicated emotions because the children often also have great affection and love for the abusive parent. Seeing their parents separating is often deeply traumatic for the children, and the mother is especially needed in the months that follow. Therefore, I urge the Committee to be sensitive about pressing the woman into work during that time.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000016"></a>I return to the matter raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas. The easy response would be to say that there will be discretion for those interviewing these women&#151;it is largely women&#151;but that does not give enough solace to those of us who know about these experiences. Too many people do not understand the impact of domestic violence, particularly long-term domestic violence. We are hoping that the Minister will be able to give us comfort by saying that the Government will table an amendment to provide the protections for women that we want to see in the Bill. If welfare is about anything, it is about protecting the most vulnerable. Domestic violence is one of those areas. We know the social cost of domestic violence. In the longer term, we are talking about the underperformance of children in education and the higher incidence of mental illness as children become older when they have been brought up in violent homes. We know the cost in terms of anti-social behaviour. Children often act out because they have been brought up in abusive environments. If we can deal with this sensitively early on by providing support to a mother going through this experience, it would be important for society as a whole.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000017"></a>I hope that the Minister will see this in the context of the wider work that has been done by government on domestic violence. The Government have a good

All political parties accept that this is an area that we have to deal with well if we are going to heal some of the problems in our society.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062225000018"></a>This means that in a Bill as important as this we have to make sure that we are alert to the ways in which domestic violence has long-term impact on those who are on the receiving end. To urge them too early into work will not be beneficial to any of those involved or to society as a whole. That is why this is such an important issue for those who are creating this legislation.</p>
<h5><a name="09062255000159"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09062255000001"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09062255000169"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I support much of what the noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, have just said. I expect that domestic violence will be debated at some length later on in the Bill, when we come to Schedule 6, which will, I am pleased to say, be placed in the safe hands of my noble friend Lord Taylor.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000002"></a>However, on this rather more specific issue of how the rules on claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance relate to those who suffer from domestic violence, I believe that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment refers to a person who has left the family home through fear of violence. Although I admire her efforts to be determinedly politically correct&#151;the amendment after all refers to a male&#151;the sad truth is that the people whom we really have in mind are more likely to be women and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, said, their trauma.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000003"></a>Women who have children over seven who leave a violent relationship would previously have been entitled to income support. However, due to changes in regulations, which we have been talking about off and on for far too long, those women will now be asked to claim jobseeker's allowance and be subject to the full conditions that are incorporated in the jobseeker's allowance regime&#151;whether it is the full regime or the modified regime does not really matter.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000004"></a>We are trying to avoid placing demands on frightened and vulnerable women which would be too onerous, given their circumstances, for them to meet. For those women who have to flee their homes to escape violence, with children in tow, the income support that they receive, until they are migrated off it, is essential for them to survive. For those who manage to find refuge in a shelter, the benefits that they receive will be vital to help pay for that and to meet their other needs.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000005"></a>I believe that it is in recognition of these problems that the noble Baronesses have proposed the amendment. For that reason, we support the principle that women&#151;or, indeed, men, as the amendment allows&#151;should have a grace period. Indeed, my great party proposed last year a grace period of three months, during which women who are in refuges, having had to flee their homes to escape domestic violence, would not be required to seek work in order to qualify for JSA. My party did not go as far as to say that they should not be in the progression-to-work group, because that was not in the process of being debated.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000006"></a>I am sure that all noble Lords will agree that such a measure is fair, as there is little to be gained from foisting demands on traumatised women who need a

The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, said that three months was often not enough&#151;I shall have to study that most carefully. My right honourable friend Mrs May spoke strongly in favour of the proposal in another place, and I am happy to put on record my support, too. Our figures suggest that the numbers are relatively small&#151;the mothers of around 3,000 children. I hope that the Government will be able to confirm or deny this, but, more importantly, will be able to support the basic proposal.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000007"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, referred to the fact that this matter was raised, perhaps too briefly, in another place, as consideration of the Bill there was drawing to a close. I say &#147;too briefly&#148;, because the Minister&#146;s most recent temporary boss pronounced on this issue&#151;I would have thought, unlike perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas&#151;somewhat uncertainly. Therefore, I look to the Minister to be more explicit. The quotation that I would like to comment on is one from Mr Purnell on 17 March, at col. 871 of <I>Hansard</I>, when he said that he believed it to be the case that mothers in this category were already protected. The former Secretary of State believed it to be the case, but will the Minister confirm that it is so and will remain so? If he can, I expect that the noble Baroness will be happy to withdraw the amendment, knowing that in the precise words that she has chosen it is not needed. Again, however, I shall have to think carefully about the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000008"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09062255000170"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I strongly support this amendment and declare an interest, going back many years now, when I was involved as a local authority housing chair in setting up both a refuge for battered women and some of the halfway houses to which they were able to move. Obviously, circumstances changed and differed among the women who suffered domestic violence, but most who came to the refuge had to move on every few weeks as an aggressive, abusive and violent man sought to find them. They would try to track down their children at school, follow them back from school and then break the windows of the refuge. Above and beyond all the physical assaults that lone parent had had, she had to deal with the fact that she and her children were constantly moving home and school; sometimes she would even move out of the local authority area into an adjacent local authority area for her own safety. Apart from all the trauma and stress of the impossible situation in which that put the lone parent, it was impossible for the DWP and any prospective employer to have a working relationship with somebody who was essentially on the move for her own physical safety. That will not be true of all of them, but it was true of many of the women that I worked with those years back.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000009"></a>For all sorts of reasons, I hope that my noble friend can agree the amendment today and we can bank it and regard this as a step forward. There is no way that such a woman in such a situation will be job-ready or remain focused on work when she is thinking about her physical safety and her child&#146;s emotional safety. I hope that my noble friend will simply say that it is a

I am pleased that my noble friend Lady Kennedy was able to make our proceedings, despite the pressing issues that she has to deal with. I acknowledge my noble friend&#146;s long-standing expertise and commitment in this area and the important issue that she raises about domestic violence having an impact on children in particular. There was also the point raised by my noble friend Lady Hollis about the transitory nature of housing arrangements for women and children in these circumstances. To the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, I can say that, while we are looking at regulations under the JSA regime, they could and should and will be imported into the progression to work group as well.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000011"></a>Clause 3 gives power to prescribe in regulations persons who can receive income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance without having to meet the usual job-seeking conditions. Our objective is to modify the conditions for jobseeker&#146;s allowance so that it is suitable for people who currently receive income support, such as lone parents with a youngest child under the age of 7. This amendment would place in the Bill a specific category of people who would be able to receive jobseeker&#146;s allowance but who, for a period of three months, would not be required to seek work. That easement would apply to jobseekers with dependent children who have left their previous home through fear of violence. For the most part, it would be of benefit to lone parents with children aged seven or older who have been subject to domestic violence.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000012"></a>As we have discussed previously in this Committee, lone parents with older children no longer have automatic entitlement to income support. If they are otherwise work-ready, they can access support through jobseeker&#146;s allowance only; in doing so, they are required to comply with the full labour market conditions that attach to that benefit.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000013"></a>However, when putting these provisions in place, we recognise that there will be times when it would be unreasonable to expect the full conditions of jobseeker&#146;s allowance to apply; for example, in cases of recent bereavement or relationship break-up where the pressure to comply with full conditionality could place further stress and anxiety on an individual or their children. I hope that noble Lords will be pleased to hear that these provisions also apply in instances of domestic violence.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000014"></a>We have amended the jobseeker&#146;s allowance regulations to enable advisers to use their discretion in cases where there is some domestic emergency. Parents in these circumstances, including lone parents, will be treated sympathetically and advisers will be able to waive the requirement to be available for employment for a period of up to eight weeks on any one occasion in any period of 12 months. That is in addition to the three further periods of one week each that may be allowed under the current rules for the same circumstances. These additional weeks can run consecutively.

<p><a name="09062255000015"></a>While I understand the very real concerns behind these amendments, I believe the approach we are already taking is the sensible one that enables those facing difficult and stressful times to be supported. We already have provisions in place that enable a period of respite which will give parents subject to violence an opportunity to start to rebuild their lives and self-confidence while not having to worry about attending their jobcentre or looking for work. Prior to the abolition of income support we also want to mirror these provisions within regulations for the progression-to-work group.</p>

The Minister has said that jobcentre staff will use their discretion in these cases. They will have to be extremely sensitive to understand what women go through when they are badly treated by their husbands or partners. It is not in the experience of most people to understand this. As well as the training that we are told advisers will receive for people with fluctuating illnesses, learning difficulties and mental problems, what sort of training will be given? How long will it take? Will the advisers meet some people who have already gone through these traumas themselves in order to ascertain how difficult it is for the people who the advisers will deal with?</p>

<p><a name="09062255000017"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09062255000173"></a>Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws:</b> I should also like to pick up on that and the Minister can answer us both at the same time. The reason why training to help deal with discretion is being raised is because we know that although the police around the country have been urged to take domestic violence seriously, there are huge variations in response to this and huge variations, despite training, in how the police deal with domestic violence. Unfortunate failures have led to terrible events. It is very hard for those who have never themselves had any close dealings with domestic violence to understand its impact. Are the Government confident that even training such people will deal with that? In the courts, judges, lawyers and the police have great difficulty. We still struggle to have this understood by all those players in this area. The idea that people in jobcentres up and down the country will understand well enough to exercise discretion in a favourable way is something about which we have profound concerns. Perhaps the Minister has an answer to that.</p>

When contact is made with a woman and, as a result of the situation she is exposed to, she asks for this discretion, how often does he expect the personal adviser to grant it? If it is to be granted informally, make it a right. That makes it simple. As a former local authority leader, he will understand the situation very well in his own borough. If he thinks that, as a result, almost every woman exposed to domestic violence would have the sympathetic response from the personal adviser that we would all like to see so that they would not be brought within the regime for three months or more,

<p><a name="09062255000019"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062255000175"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I acknowledge that the training and understanding of advisers is key in this issue, as in so much of what we have debated so far during the passage of the Bill. In relation to the existing JSA regime and the progression-to-work model, we believe it will be necessary further to develop a workforce strategy to think through the implications of the adviser role. That work will also enable us to develop comprehensive additional training material for Jobcentre Plus advisers to enhance the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver this more personalised approach. It is inevitable that there will be differences of approach and emphasis, and there will not necessarily be uniform understanding. We need to continue to work at that to broaden the understanding and sensitise our advisers to these situations so they deliver the flexibility that is in the system at the moment.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000020"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to the previous Secretary of State&#146;s reference to this matter and assurance that three months&#146; grace would be available. The current formulation is eight weeks plus three one weeks, so one thing I will take away from this is the need for the regulations to recognise that three months are available. Under the regulations that is technically not quite there.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000021"></a>There is, as ever on these issues, a debate around whether we should allow discretion within the system or how much we should put in the Bill. The amendment would ensure that all those who left their previous home due to violence would be exempted, whereas the current provision requires some degree of judgment by advisers. However, advisers&#146; decisions are subject to the normal safeguards that apply within the system; that is, there is a separate decision-making function that ensures that the facts are looked at objectively and that decisions are reasonable in the circumstances and there is a right to appeal to an independent tribunal. There is that protection in the system. To summarise, we have to make clear that we are looking at three months, not eight weeks plus one week plus one week plus one week. We have to make sure that our advisers are trained and sensitised to these important issues. Where we might part company is on the need to put things in primary legislation, but I hope we have a common objective in dealing with this.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000022"></a>On issues around training, I would be happy to engage with my noble friend Lady Kennedy to run through what is currently involved in those training exercises and, if we may, draw on her particular expertise in seeking to address them. I hope that that has shown our support for the issues that have been pressed here. The key issue that we are apart on is the necessity of putting the provisions in primary legislation, which we do not think necessary. However, we need to make sure that the regulations and the system support the three-month requirement.</p>

The Minister has moved an inch, but no further. I am worried that the phrase &#147;domestic emergency&#148;, under which Jobcentre Plus advisers would have to look at this issue, could cover a burst water main or something like that. It does not quite reflect the real trauma which the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, talked about of the impact on family life, the disruption to children&#146;s lives, perhaps having to move to a refuge or to safe houses, with all the knock-on effects of later antisocial behaviour. This is in a completely different league from other kinds of domestic emergencies.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000025"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062255000177"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I apologise for interrupting the noble Baroness. I saw the use of the terminology &#147;domestic emergency&#148; as potentially broader than the detail of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, which talks about having to flee the home. From what we have heard today, in most instances it is probably a woman with her children who has to flee the home. I can imagine that there may be some instances when someone is barred from the home, but that would not necessarily be a requirement. We are dealing here not only with the fact of domestic violence but also the fear of it.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000026"></a>Again, I am happy to take this away and look at the regulations to ensure that it is absolutely clear that they cover the situations on which we are focusing. The regulations say that if there is a domestic emergency then there shall be an exemption, whether it is discretionary, so we have the period of exemption. Perhaps I did not make that sufficiently clear earlier on.</p>

We shall have to study carefully what he said to see whether we should return to this matter. Three months is the absolute minimum and we now discover that it is not quite three months at the moment. We shall reflect on what the Minister has said. The fact that we have this amendment means that in various parts of the country the guidance has not been satisfactory; the discretion of Jobcentre Plus advisers has not been satisfactory, otherwise it would not have been brought to our attention. We will both study what noble Lords have said in this debate, and in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It concerns childcare for older children of parents who claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Your Lordships will be well aware that we debated similar issues during the first day in Committee, but principally with respect to employment support allowance and the treatment of childcare for younger children. I do not want to rehearse the same issues here again, but ask for your Lordships&#146; patience while I explore a few points concerning JSA and older children where the Government&#146;s position remains a little unclear.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000030"></a>On younger children, on the first day in Committee the Minister gave a good assurance that the parent would be responsible for decisions as to whether a particular childcare facility was appropriate for her child. On older children, in the context of decision-making on a parent&#146;s participation in the flexible New Deal, the impression from the Government is very different. The former Secretary of State told the Work and Pensions Committee:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062255000148"></a>&#147;In the end it will be the personal adviser's decision with the possibility of appeal because if we did it the other way round that would clearly have the potential to drive the cart and horses through the conditionality regime&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000138"></a>&#147;The cart and horses&#148; is quite sweet, really.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000031"></a>The Government&#146;s response to the Work and Pensions Committee report on the commissioning strategy for the flexible New Deal said:</p>
<ul><a name="09062255000157"></a>&#147;Advisers will be required to consider the availability and suitability of childcare when they consider whether a parent's child care responsibilities made it unreasonable for them to stay in employment, to take up paid employment, or to carry out a jobseeker's direction&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062255000139"></a>This implies that personal advisers, who are unlikely to have any professional knowledge of and expertise in the childcare requirements of children, will be making decisions that will have a major impact upon a child&#146;s development. I think that that quote can be interpreted in more than one way, so I am not saying that it is categorical.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000032"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify the following points. First, will the right of the parent to decide whether a particular childcare facility is suitable  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC377"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for their child be the same for older children from the age of seven with respect to the flexible New Deal as we understood it to be for younger children under seven in the ESA context? Secondly, will the non-availability of suitable childcare be accepted as good cause for parents with older children? Thirdly, I understand from the Child Poverty Action Group that only 6 per cent of 14 year-olds uses out-of-school clubs. This figure is apparently well out of line with the Ofsted data. If an out-of-school club is the only option for a child, would the availability of an out-of-school club be taken as suitable childcare availability even if the parent explained that the child had made it clear that they would not attend it? Fourthly, the DWP is guaranteeing that all working parents will be able to access affordable childcare by 2015. What is the DWP&#146;s definition of &#147;affordable&#148; in that context? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000033"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09062255000182"></a>Lord Northbourne:</b> The noble Baroness raises an important point. We have so far talked about childcare largely as it relates to the under-sevens and the early years, which we must all recognise is a crucial period in the child&#146;s life. But we must surely ask what we mean by &#147;childcare&#148;. It is simply unrealistic to talk about it just in the context of somewhere for the child to go and watch the television day in, day out eating noodles out of a pot. It is also unrealistic to expect teenagers to go where they are told to go; they have got to go where they want to go; there have got to be activities for them. Anyone who has worked in this area must be perfectly conscious that most of the youth clubs have closed and most of the playing fields have been sold off, and that extended schools are simply not a reality, yet, in terms of providing facilities for children of that age.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000034"></a>It is of the utmost importance that we take the opportunity of introducing a suitable amendment&#151;the drafting of the amendment is fascinating: it is a quadruple negative&#151;to suggest that parents have this right. After all, when children get to even nine, 10 or 11 years old, if they have a latch-key, they start looking on their computer or on the television for all the sorts of rubbish&#151;not only rubbish but the positively evil material&#151;that is available to them. They are then on the streets; they do not have anybody to guide them; they do not have anything to do; they form gangs and start to get drunk; and so we have domestic violence and many of the problems that we have with our young people today. What are going to do about that? What are we going to do about parents who work perhaps at weekends or in the holidays who are not in a position to give guidance and some measure of supervision to their child?</p>

<p><a name="09062255000035"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09062255000183"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> The new clause would create a new exemption from the application of Section 19 of the Jobseekers Act 1995. It would raise the absence of childcare facilities as a good cause for not fulfilling the obligations of the jobseeker&#146;s agreement. I know from our earlier debate on childcare that the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, is concerned about the problems posed to parents of young children. In a way, the noble Lord is quite right: the problems of older children are arguably even more likely to be serious than those of

I think that all noble Lords would probably agree with this, and hope that Members of the Committee see that I am as concerned as they are. I reiterate the point raised earlier that childcare is such a big part of parents&#146; lives on their way back into the job market that it will necessarily be a major element in an action plan.</p>
<h5><a name="09062255000163"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000036"></a>Your Lordships may have decided, perhaps rightly, that I am fixated&#151;to use my word to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas&#151;about the super-affirmative regulation that she proposed what seems weeks ago; perhaps it was, I am not entirely sure. However, I was interested to hear what the Minister said in response to that, as it is clear that childcare will be a stumbling block unless adequate provision is put in place. I hold to the view that this must be worked out in advance by a participant in a scheme and the adviser, and the scheme should be constructed accordingly to take account of school hours, available childcare, visiting rights if applicable, and so on.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000037"></a>When we were discussing the changes in the regulations in November 2008, I made the point that no one wanted to see children running wild, joining gangs and so on. Equally, no one wants to see them watching rubbish television for hours on end or, even worse, sitting in front of a computer&#151;arguably for even longer. There is an awful lot of damaging material available on computers unless the parents sensibly block it&#151;assuming that they know how, which is by no means always the case.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000038"></a>Having said this, I am not sure that I can support the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment. It is unusual in that it places an almost insurmountable standard of proof on the Secretary of State. As well as being&#151;what was the noble Lord&#146;s expression?&#151;a quadruple negative, the amendment means that if a person fails to take part in their scheme, they would not, as currently envisaged in the Bill, have to show that they had good cause for doing so. They would simply be able to sit back and leave the Secretary of State to prove that lack of suitable childcare was not the cause. It is difficult to prove a negative. I fear that the noble Baroness would risk rendering a scheme potentially unworkable. It is much more straightforward for the parents to point to a lack of childcare as their good cause. Reversing the burden of proof like this risks tying logic in knots.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000039"></a>I accept that this is a useful peg on which to hang a detailed discussion on childcare provision if, indeed, another lengthy one is still required. However, I remain of the view that this is, when put in practice, an action plan issue.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000040"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09062255000184"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> We on this side of the Committee would be interested to know how the Minister replies on childcare for older children. There is a lot of misunderstanding about the age at which a child must have somebody looking after them. There is one perception, but I am not sure that 14 is a relevant age in law. It would be interesting to know what the reply is on that. This was reflected in the evidence-taking session in the other place. Someone

It is an important question.</p>

Section 19 of the Jobseekers Act 1995 allows for the denial of jobseeker&#146;s allowance in specified circumstances. Broadly, these are that a person has, without good cause or just cause, failed to carry out a jobseeker&#146;s direction; failed to take up a place on a training scheme or employment programme; lost his job through misconduct; left his job voluntarily; or refused a reasonable opportunity of employment.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000042"></a>Section 19(8) enables regulations to prescribe the matters to be taken into account in determining whether a person has good or just cause for any act or omission with respect to these requirements. Regulations made under that provision ensure that the availability of suitable childcare forms part of the consideration.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000043"></a>Regulation 72 of the jobseekers regulations 1996 relates to decisions under Sections 19(5)(a) and 19(6)(c) of the Jobseekers Act. This regulation states that account must be taken of any caring responsibilities which would, or did, make it unreasonable for the person to undertake a particular employment or carry out the jobseeker&#146;s direction. The regulation also requires that regard must be had to whether childcare is reasonably available and, where it is, whether it is unsuitable due to the parent&#146;s particular needs or those of the child. Regulations 73 and 73A make similar provision in relation to good cause for failure to participate in training schemes or employment programmes and in respect of just cause in cases of voluntary unemployment.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000044"></a>The Government are cognisant of the fact that parental employment is likely to be predicated on the availability of suitable childcare. That is why we have invested heavily in our childcare strategies, and it is why we have already put regulations in place to ensure that this is a factor taken into account in deciding whether or not to deny benefit to jobseekers.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000045"></a>I should make it clear, as I hoped I had in our earlier deliberations, that it is for parents to decide which childcare provision is suitable for their children. That applies to older as well as younger children. Jobcentre Plus advisers will not make that decision on parents&#146; behalf; we believe that such approach would be counterproductive as a parent is unlikely to be able to work efficiently or participate effectively in work-related activities if they are worried about how their child is being cared for. However, if a parent makes representations that no suitable childcare is available to them, we will need to be satisfied that such claims are reasonable. Jobcentre Plus will ensure that the person has made reasonable efforts to determine what childcare is available in the area&#151;for example, by contacting local family information services and visiting local childcare providers. If from its knowledge of local provision Jobcentre Plus believes that the search has been less than exhaustive, it will help the person to identify other possible options. When the local provision has been thoroughly investigated, the parent will need to explain why they consider each provider available to them to be unsuitable to their

If there is a fairly limited range of provision available or there are extenuating circumstances, it may be quite reasonable for the parent not to take up the provision on offer.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000046"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, asked about our definition of affordable. It is within the tax credit limits: &#163;175 for one child and &#163;300 for two or more. As for 14 year-olds and out-of-school clubs, we should bear it in mind that lone parents can restrict availability down to 16 hours a week. Of course, 14 year-old children are in school for 30 hours a week, so within that context there should not be a problem, because the Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on local authorities to ensure sufficient childcare for children up to the age of 14.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, referred to playing fields being sold off and extended schools not being available. The Government aim for all schools in England to become extended schools by 2010, offering a range of services, including childcare and study support, from 8 am to 6 pm weekdays throughout the year. Some 15,550 schools&#151;that is, 71 per cent of the total, 17 per cent of them primary schools and 79 per cent of them secondary schools&#151;with more than 5.2 million pupils on roll are now offering the core extended service.</p>

My understanding is that a range of services do cater for older children, but I do not have chapter and verse in front of me. I re-emphasise that the Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on local authorities to secure sufficient childcare. The extended school provision covers children to the age of 14; they should be catered for under that provision.</p>

That is the term used. The Minister did not answer the point about what would happen if a child refused to go to the available childcare facilities&#151;and of course kids of 13 or 14 are very likely to refuse to do what one would dearly like them to do, as I know well. I feel that there is discretion for the personal adviser whether to take that seriously or whether simply to sanction the parent. Could the Minister give some sort of assurance on that?</p>

In any event, that issue would be part of the reasonableness decision if a parent continued to maintain that the provision that was there was not suitable because it was not, in practice, suitable for the particular child.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000054"></a>On the earlier issue on the age that children can be left at home, the law is not clear because it does not state an age when children can be left alone but parents can be prosecuted for wilful neglect if they leave a child unsupervised in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health. That is in the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. I hope that that has dealt with the queries from noble Lords.</p>

Over the past two weeks, thanks to the Minister&#146;s responses to the multitudinous questions asked by Members of this Committee, we have discovered quite a lot about the proposed system for moving people on JSA closer to the workplace. Most of your Lordships&#146; concerns have centred, although not exclusively, on the transfer of single parents from income support when their children are less than seven years old. As I have understood the proposals up to now, when the child is only one year old, the parent is summoned to interview. I had not appreciated until last Thursday that it could be a group interview and not a one-to-one with a personal adviser. Will those group interviews, illustrated by part of the letter that I read out when moving Amendment 57 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, be the normal way of interviewing those single parents in the first instance? How this initial interview is conducted is of vital importance to the future conduct of the relationship between Jobcentre Plus and the single mother, not least because the individual circumstances of one parent in the group will differ from another. Does the Minister agree that a group interview simply cannot achieve that?</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC382"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC382</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="09062255000164"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000057"></a>Having said that, I am grateful to the Minister&#146;s advisers&#146; rapid response to my moving of the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, last week. The response explains that a group information session is not a work-focused interview. A one-to-one work-focused interview will usually follow a group information session and it is the only mandatory aspect. However, the customer can decline the offer of a group information session without having to give a reason. In such instances a separate one-to-one work-focused interview will be arranged, usually in the jobcentre. I hope that that is well understood. It certainly was not by the person whose letter I partly read out. Therefore, it is a failure of information between Jobcentre Plus and the people who are called in the first instance to these group interviews.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000058"></a>Secondly, unless and until an individualised action plan&#151;incidentally, I heard the Minister talking about &#147;individualised&#148; several times, so I have hope for the amendment that I moved on that subject some while ago&#151;is agreed with the parent, which is not until the child is three years old, the only requirement on the parent is to turn up on a regular basis to the one-to-one interviews. At one point we heard that this is to be every three months. The illustrative examples&#151;Panglossian, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, called them&#151;tend to confirm that. In the circumstances, three months seems to be rather a short period. If she&#151;it is usually she&#151;fails to go to the interview without good cause on the day and at the time it is to happen, she risks losing part of her benefit. If she persists she loses more and more and ultimately can lose it altogether for six months.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000059"></a>This group of amendments, therefore, is to discover why the Government have decided that interviews at an age when the parent is still in constant care of the child are deemed so necessary. The point is particularly valid as the parent does not have to do anything except turn up for interviews. In view of that, what is the benefit of these repeated interviews?</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000060"></a>Paragraph 260 of the notes on clauses implies that the reason for these repeated interviews is that they are the condition on which benefits continue to be paid. Are these interviews really the only way that these conditions can be met? It strikes me as a very time-consuming and expensive way of going about it. If the Minister is about to say that that is the system established under the Jobseekers Act 1995 and the Government do not want to change it, perhaps I may gently remind him that we are dealing with a completely new set of affairs which was not even an idea in the mind of God when the 1995 Act was being drafted. What we need to look at is the effect of these provisions on today&#146;s clientele&#151;in this case, single parents.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000061"></a>Amendment 75B is intended to probe why paragraph 267, which lists the relevant benefits to which new Section 11B refers, includes incapacity benefit but not employment and support allowance, which is slowly replacing it. Incidentally, it would be helpful if the Minister would tell us when it is now intended that migration from income support to ESA should begin. New claimants have of course been on it for some months now.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000062"></a>Amendment 76A, which I am afraid was an afterthought, refers to paragraph 23(3) of Schedule 1. Notes on clauses say that this &#147;is intended&#148; to amend the provision which allows people to continue to receive JSA temporarily without being available for work, having entered into a jobseeker&#146;s agreement or being available for work. This intention is clearly needed when you migrate single parents with very young children from income support to JSA. I assume that it is also foreshadowing one of the groups which is to remain on income support and which will be transferred much later&#151;those involved in court proceedings lasting longer than eight weeks.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000063"></a>Clearly, the intention is good, but the question arises about whether it is met by new paragraph 8 of existing Schedule 1 to the Jobseekers Act 1995, which refers only to regulations being made which may&#151;not shall&#151;prescribe circumstances when a person does not need to fill the normal actively seeking work conditions and so on. That is particularly important when we consider Amendment 80, which concerns those groups that will remain on income support for a period after the Bill is enacted, which are many more than those involved in the court proceedings I was talking about just now. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000064"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062255000195"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> This amendment is welcome in that it gives us a chance to talk about the need for work-focused interviews, which seems slightly obscure for lone parents who have a very young child. However, this highlights the complexity of the rules in Jobcentre Plus and the fact that there is obviously much disparity around the country about how the rules are worked out. Obviously, there is guidance for Jobcentre Plus personal advisers about work-focused interviews, but we have just heard about someone who could not get to a group work-focused interview and was told that there was no flexibility. That is disturbing because they should have been told that if they made another appointment they could have a one-to-one work-focused interview in the afternoon. However, they were not told that but just that there was no flexibility. We come back to this leitmotiv which has been running through the whole Grand Committee about the training of Jobcentre Plus staff and the guidance issued to them. This shows that the guidance needs to be thoroughly overhauled.</p>

Perhaps the people in the Jobcentre are overworked and, therefore, do not give full consideration to each case as they should.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000066"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062255000197"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for his amendments to Schedule 1. Earlier in Committee, I outlined how Clause 3 deals with the entitlement conditions for JSA as set out in the Jobseeker&#146;s Act 1995 and paves the way for a major simplification of the benefits system by enabling JSA to take on the role currently performed by income support.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000067"></a>Schedule 1 contains a number of further amendments to the Jobseeker&#146;s Act and it is worth saying at this point that the provisions within it are not new. The  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC384"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC384</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schedule amends and updates existing legislation to enable the introduction of the modified JSA regime and to ensure that a consistent approach is taken across benefits. Some of the amendments in Schedule 1 simply restate the existing rules for jobseekers, while most carry forward into JSA the system of conditionality and support established by Clause 2 for people on income support in the progression-to-work group, such as lone parents.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000068"></a>Paragraph 2 of the schedule removes the requirement for JSA claimants who are not subject to the jobseeking conditions to attend interviews and provide evidence about their jobseeking activity. Claimants who are available for work would normally be required to attend fortnightly interviews at their local Jobcentre Plus office in order to provide information and evidence of their availability for employment and active job search, often referred to as signing-on.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000069"></a>When we proposed moving people from income support to the modified form of JSA we recognised that it would be inappropriate for people who were on income support, who are not expected to be available for and actively seeking work, to be subject to the same conditionality as jobseekers. There was certainly no intention to require them to look for work or to sign on in the same way as current jobseekers. This paragraph makes it clear that the signing-on provisions do not apply to people on the modified regime, and I hope the Committee will agree that this is a sensible approach to take.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000070"></a>The provisions in new Section 11B of the Jobseekers Act, to which the second amendment refers, repeat the wording of existing provisions in the Social Security Administration Act in relation to work-focused interviews. In doing this, we have aimed to maintain consistency of legislation across the benefits system. For people in receipt of more than one benefit, these provisions ensure that we set out in regulations which benefits can be subject to a sanction for not attending a work-focused interview and the extent of any such sanction. The amendment would remove that important transparency for our customers, which I do not believe was the noble Lord&#146;s intention.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000071"></a>I turn briefly to Amendment 76A. I can understand why the paragraph of Schedule 1 to which it refers may seem odd. There has always been a provision in the Jobseekers Act that enables prescribed groups to be exempt from the jobseeking conditions. It was drafted on the basis that everyone on JSA would be required to look for work, and it is used in limited circumstances when jobseekers attend training courses and are therefore not expected to sign on or actively to seek work. Paragraph 23(3) of Schedule 1 to the Bill amends this provision so that the current arrangements can continue as now for people who would normally be subject to the jobseeking conditions, while making it clear that the regulations will apply only to people who are not otherwise entitled to JSA, in particular under the new arrangements for groups currently on income support. That is why it provides that regulations may prescribe circumstances where income-related JSA can be available to a person without needing to meet the jobseeking conditions if they would not otherwise be entitled to benefit. This is very much a detailed  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC385"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC385</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>point, but the key thing is that the new provisions will help ensure that all groups that should be claiming JSA can be catered for under the new arrangements as seamlessly as possible.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000072"></a>Several additional points were raised in connection with the amendments and otherwise. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to the letter to which he referred on the previous day in Committee. He is right that a group information system is not a work-focused interview. One work-focused interview will usually follow a group information session. It is therefore not mandatory to attend a group session and action to impose a sanction cannot be taken for failing to attend. The noble Lord asked about work-focused interviews for parents with young children. The work-focused interview should operate at the point of first claim, then at six months and one year. That is the only conditionality for parents whose youngest child is below the age of one.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000073"></a>The noble Lord asked what is the purpose of work-focused interviews. It is as an opportunity to explain to our customers the journey that they may be required to undertake in future, to explain the functions of Jobcentre Plus, to explain issues around work and skills and, generally, to be a keeping-in-touch opportunity for people who would otherwise not necessarily be focused on the labour market.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000074"></a>The noble Lord asked about the IB to ESA migration timescale. The plan, which we previously discussed, is for all claimants on incapacity benefits to be transferred between 2010 and 2013 but, as ever, we are keeping the issues under review and the final timetable has not been determined. I hope that deals with the points the noble Lord raised and that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000075"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09062255000198"></a>Lord Northbourne:</b> Is a jobseeker entitled to take along a friend or adviser to a meeting at a job centre?</p>

He spoke early on in his few words about this being a major simplification. I am not sure that many people outside this Room, and perhaps a few in it, would agree with him. Certainly initially, until it is all worked through, the Bill produces a subset&#151;I should not call it a subset, but I do&#151;of jobseeker&#146;s allowance and rolls it into a single benefit.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000078"></a>Yes, of course I understand that the fully fledged jobseeker&#146;s allowance as it has been up to now requires fortnightly so-called &#147;signing on&#148; interviews because the job adviser needs to be satisfied that people really are actively seeking work through applying for posts through advertisements and the various other ways in   


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC386"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC386</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which that can be done. However, we are now talking about people who are not actively seeking work. They do not fit into the progression-to-work group either, until their child, as the Minister has said over and over again, becomes three years old. So it is always necessary to have a first interview, but I suggest that it really isn&#146;t necessary to have another until the child is slightly over three. I will have to work on this for Report.</p>

There are various steps along the conditionality road. There is the requirement to attend the periodic work-focused interviews when the youngest child is below the age of one. Therefore, for older children, there is a requirement for regular work-focused interviews and for an action plan to be drawn up. On our proposed piloting, when the youngest child reaches the age of three we are looking to have pathfinders on the work-related activity. There is that progression until one gets to the full jobseeker&#146;s allowance requirements.</p>

Until the child is three, they do not have to do anything else. I ask again: what on earth is the point of these very early intermediate work-focused interviews?</p>

If you do not have the opportunity of that work-focused interview at an earlier stage, the first engagement under the noble Lord&#146;s proposition seems to be when the youngest child is aged three. That adds to the period where the lone parent may have been away from the job market. We know that some engagement, even if it is a work-focused interview, generally enhances the chances of people accessing work at an earlier stage than they otherwise might. If you say that they do not have to come near the jobcentre until their youngest child reaches the age of three, that is a gap that would make it more difficult for many people to access work or get themselves involved in those work-related activities as quickly as they otherwise might.</p>

It is mandatory for people to turn up for their work-focused interview but, beyond that, there is no requirement for them to engage in further work-related activity or job seeking or anything of that nature, although there is the provision for them to do that if they want to and the opportunity for them to engage before the youngest child reaches the age of three. It is up to lone parents whether they want to do that; it is about giving people opportunities, not just about conditionality.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000086"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0006.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09062255000208"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Surely to goodness, that is explained in the initial interview. We have been worrying about lone parents who are worried about childcare, and so on. Nursery schools, followed by playgroups, start these days with children at a very young age. I cannot remember when my grandson first went, but it was certainly before the age of one. It might be that those parents are satisfied and go back to work very quickly, but I still do not see that these intermediate interviews will have any effect whatever. I suppose that the Minister will say, &#147;Ah, we&#146;ve got to have a pilot and find out!&#148; What happens if I am right?</p>

<p><a name="09062255000087"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0006.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="09062255000209"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> We are getting a bit repetitive and, I think, making somewhat heavy weather of this. It may well be the case that because an individual comes in for a work-focused interview and understands what Jobcentre Plus is about and what the journey in due course towards employment may be, that person may come to focus on the fact that they wish to update their skills, for examples. The work-focused interview may well have prompted that thought in their minds, and they voluntarily may wish to engage to undertake some training and upgrade those skills before they get into any work-related activity requirement. If we do not have the work-focused interviews, it is less likely that those opportunities will occur or present themselves to individuals. I do not see what problem the noble Lord has about this, as it is a limited engagement that people have at these interviews to open up opportunities for them so that they can progress to work faster than the mandatory system may require.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000090"></a>Clause 6 is designed to support the migration of people from income support either to ESA or to JSA according to the Peers&#146; information pack. It does two things: first, they do not have to do anything when they make the move, as it is done for them administratively; secondly, it will ensure that the new benefit is income-protected at the point of change. That is fair enough, but for how long is that protection to continue? I have never seen a social security change such as is outlined in this Bill whereby no one loses out; there are inevitably gainers and losers. This is particularly relevant where the child element in income support is taken into account. Are the Government really saying that there will be no losers?</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000091"></a>I apologise for the wording of Amendments 81 and 82, which are grouped with Amendment 78. I am afraid that it may have caused some confusion among the Minister&#146;s advisers. My problem is that I could not find a formulation that included this current Bill when enacted and all previous Acts passed, or regulations made under this and previous Acts, while excluding future Acts.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000092"></a>Over the past few years, it has become commonplace to find words identical to those in Clause 7. This has come to worry me more than a little, because who knows what the future will bring? Will the Minister still be en poste this time next year? Will I still be badgering him after the forthcoming State Opening of Parliament? Who is to tell?</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000093"></a>Teasing apart, what future Acts can possibly be relevant, or, as the subsection has it, be likely to be relevant, to the move from income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance, or even ESA, and how could they accomplish something that is not accomplished by the Jobseekers Act 1995 as amended by this Bill, and the statutory instruments flowing from the amended Act? A cynic would suggest that the draftsman is covering himself in case the formulation in this Bill and the myriad regulations flowing from it are incomplete and future Acts and the regulations flowing from them will be needed to complete the job.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000094"></a>If this were not the very epitome of a framework Bill, I would not be nearly so worried about subsection (5), as any specific measures would be in the Bill. However, here we have a situation where everything is done by regulations, the rationale for which is described in the various clauses in the Bill. In essence, the Bill allows the Government to do anything they like by means of regulations. What possible future Bills or orders do the Government think might just be necessary? Even if they become necessary in years to come, why cannot those future Bills contain provisions to amend earlier Acts of Parliament, as we all know does this one?</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000095"></a>I appreciate that my worries are of a more general nature than just this Bill. None the less, I hope that I have related them to social security law more generally, as amended by this Bill, which after all is the Bill currently before the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000096"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09062255000213"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for his amendments to Clauses 6 and 7. These clauses are closely connected to the provision made by Clause 3 for a new form of JSA to be paid to people in place of income support without paying them any less money or requiring them to meet the usual job-seeking conditions.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000097"></a>Clause 6 enables awards of income support or income-related ESA to be stopped where appropriate, and allows for a transitional allowance to be paid for a time and at an amount that can be prescribed by regulation if such arrangements are required. There are a small number of occasions when the benefit rates for income support, ESA and JSA are not the same and, in these circumstances, we need to ensure we have the necessary provisions to protect the benefit incomes of claimants as they migrate from one benefit to another as a result of these changes. Subsection (2)(c) provides that protection, and I do not believe that noble Lords would want us to reduce clarity in the Bill on the considerations that are to take place in the determination of a transitional allowance.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000098"></a>Clause 7 sets out the conditions which are required before a decision to abolish income support can be taken. Where these conditions exist, the Secretary of State can make an order which effectively switches off income support. It also allows him to make any transitional and consequential provisions that may be needed. Amendments 81 and 82 seek to ensure that an order made under Clause 7(4) could not be made to amend, repeal or revoke any provision or regulation made in any Act after the commencement of the Bill. I can stress again that the powers can be used only once alternative provision has been made for all income support recipients. Clauses 3 and 5 ensure that we have that provision in place. Clause 7(4) is necessary and important because it allows us to make workable transitional arrangements if the benefit rules change after this Bill is commenced.</p>
<h5><a name="09062255000166"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000099"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree with me that such provision should be made. As I explained at the outset, in proposing to abolish income support we are not proposing that the people who get it should receive any less money or be subject to the requirements placed on people who are required to look for work. The intention is to simplify and streamline the system but not to make it any less sensitive to people&#146;s needs. However, this provision future-proofs the legislation and will help ensure that any transitional or consequential provision made under Clause 7(4) is effective. On that basis I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Can he help me with the length of time of the transitional arrangements? Do they last until the individual finds work, or is there a period after which they sort of fall off the cliff edge?</p>

How long protection will be needed for will depend on circumstances, which will obviously be set out in detail in due course. That is the normal approach to these matters.</p>

<p class="amendment_hs_quote"><a name="09062255000152"></a>&#147;(7) In section 14 of the Welfare Reform Act 2007 (c. 5) (action plans in connection with work-focused interviews) for subsection (3) substitute&#151;</p>

The amendment is a re-drafting of an amendment tabled by Paul Rowen, MP, in the other place on Tuesday 24 February. However, the amendment is broader than the one debated in the other place and ensures that all claimants on ESA are covered by the safeguard. A second important difference between the two amendments is that this one does not place any restriction on what can be drawn up in the action plan. Instead, it removes the compulsory nature of any medical or health-related treatment in the action plan.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000104"></a>The reason for the changes to the amendment is important. Some medical treatment might help a claimant in his or her progression to work, and claimants may wish to include that treatment in their action plan. However, the important point is that this must always be a decision taken freely by the individual. Claimants must not be sanctioned for failing to carry it out. During the Committee debate in the other place, the Minister, Tony McNulty, MP, said,</p>
<ul><a name="09062255000158"></a>&#147;we will never mandate any parent into any health intervention that is delivered by a health professional, including psychological therapies and the taking of medication&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Welfare Reform Bill Committee, 24/2/09; col.129.]</ul>

<p><a name="09062255000140"></a>The principle of our amendment has thus been conceded by the Government.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000105"></a>Our concern is that the safeguard should be incorporated in the Bill. We have had many discussions in relation to various Bills about the importance of principles being in legislation, and we have a similar issue here. Although statements from Ministers giving assurances are always welcome, they do not, of course, have the strength or impact of the Bill itself. The wider legal system sets strict limits on compulsory medical treatment and provides significant safeguards for those who are compelled to take treatment in special circumstances. As someone who is very familiar with the Mental Health Act, I am aware of the strengths of those safeguards.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000106"></a>The Mental Health Act also has safeguards to protect the giving of consent by a patient to ensure that it is real and informed consent. There would be no such safeguards in the Bill. The giving of consent would be experienced as given under duress, I suggest. The Bill gives significantly wider powers to personal advisers. They will not be trained health professionals but could potentially be requiring a claimant to undertake specific activities to improve their health. As I have already indicated, this might include therapy programmes or medication. Such decisions surely should and must be decided between a person and their clinician. I hope that we are pushing at an open door here. As I indicated earlier, the Government have accepted the principle of the amendment. Most importantly, it will not cost the Government anything. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000107"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09062255000219"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> In the absence of my noble friend Lord Alderdice, whose name is on the amendment, I shall speak briefly in support of it. However, a lot of my words will be exactly the same as those used by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. I do not want to repeat them all. My speech also contains the phrase &#147;we may be pushing at an open door&#148;. The noble Baroness quoted the words of the Minister in the other place, so I shall not do so. However, the Government have made clear that activities to stabilise health conditions can be included as part of work-related activity, and hence a claimant might be subject to sanction if they are not undertaken. The worry of health professionals like my noble friend Lord Alderdice, who is a psychiatrist, is that the measures in the Bill have the potential to blur the boundaries of consent. While claimants might appear to consent to do particular activities, such as take certain medical treatment, it might not be entirely clear to them that they had a choice. Therefore, the taking of such medical treatment might be seen not as a voluntary decision but compulsory if the claimant wanted to go on receiving their full benefit entitlement.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000108"></a>One of the main worries of health professionals and others is, as my colleague the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, said&#151;I would like to call her my noble friend but I shall call her my noble colleague&#151;that, whatever else a Jobcentre Plus personal adviser is, he or she is not a trained health professional, but could potentially be requiring a claimant to undertake specific activities to improve their health. This might extend to therapy programmes, medication regimes or to other activities such as exercise or weight management. If these

That is why we need a statutory safeguard in this very important area of how the Bill will work in practice.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000109"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09062255000220"></a>Baroness Murphy:</b> I, too, support the amendment. It is completely unethical for any doctor, nurse or clinical psychologist to engage in any treatment of a patient who has been coerced into care by the state, or indeed by anybody else unless they fall within the provisions of certain public health Acts&#151;the Mental Health Act or certain parts of the Mental Capacity Act.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000110"></a>It is necessary not only to ensure that the person does not receive medication and specific treatments in a coerced manner, but that they should not be dictated to about the place that they should attend. There have been many discussions about this with regard to the Mental Health Act but it is clear that once you start dictating to a person the place they might attend to receive care and treatment, such as a day centre or a day hospital, you are near to coercing them into the programmes that are delivered at those places of care and treatment. It is almost impossible for the person to say no once they get there. This is an extremely important point that we argued over a great deal when we discussed the mental health legislation. It is utterly crucial that the individual should be willing and able to seek care and treatment, and that that care and treatment is delivered on a completely voluntary basis with no quid pro quo in terms of what they will get in return.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000111"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0007.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09062255000221"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> I too support the amendment. The noble Lord has heard me carrying on enough about people with ME/CFS, but in some cases they have been told that it is a condition of their continuing to get benefit that they take a course of cognitive behaviour therapy and graded exercises. The NICE guidelines recommend CBT in certain instances for people with mild to moderate ME&#151;I am using &#147;ME&#148; as a shortcut&#151;but say that it has to be a joint decision between the medical practitioner and the patient, that it must be with the patient&#146;s consent and that the cognitive behaviour therapy must be given by somebody who understands and has had training in ME. I have seen a medical assessor&#146;s report where he recommended that a particular claimant had a course of CBT because there was nothing really wrong with him. That is not acceptable, and we need something more tightly on the books.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000112"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0007.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09062255000222"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am not sure whether the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, intended the amendment to be a precursor to our debates very shortly&#151;perhaps not that shortly&#151;on drug and alcohol abuse. However, I take the view that even if the amendment covers that situation, it is unintentional and she wants to stick to those people whom she mentioned. Drug abuse is obviously an important topic that we must and shall address fully. The amendment would mean that an action plan for work-related activity could not specify a requirement for the participant to do anything that would require him to take medication or treatment.  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC393"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC393</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It would prevent any medical treatment being required as a necessary step in completing a back-to-work progression. That is wrong. Once again we return to the action plan, which I am sure that all noble Lords are by now well aware must be agreed between the parties. That requirement precludes the kind of enforced medication which some may worry would be required.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000113"></a>None of us would rule out, however, the scenario in which a participant with a medical problem which hinders their return to work but is none the less treatable or even curable agrees&#151;that is the important word&#151;to seek medical help to overcome that problem.</p>

That is the issue that we are conscious of in the mental health field&#151;that people in that field too need robust safeguards to make sure that they are not coerced into treatment. They are in a vulnerable position. In a personal adviser&#146;s office, a person is also in a vulnerable position; they feel that they had better fit in with the requirements of the personal adviser or they may lose their benefit. The issue of consent is fundamental here.</p>

Again, the normal entry into the hospital world, as the noble Baroness knows perfectly well, is through a GP and if the plumber comes back, having seen his GP, with whatever suggestion the GP makes, then we are in a different scenario.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000120"></a>I do not think that these worries bear much weight. I shall say more about this when we get to the drugs and alcohol issue, as we shall shortly. I hope that the Minister will be able to reinforce what I have said about the proper training of the job adviser.</p>

I hope I can reassure them about our intentions in this area. The definition of work-related activity is drawn very widely. That is to provide as much flexibility as possible for claimants and advisers to agree the activities in a non-coercive atmosphere that will best support a return to work in their particular circumstances. Where an individual has a health condition that in itself is a barrier to that person returning to work, we believe that he or she should receive appropriate help and support to make a return to work possible. Many individuals will be keen to undertake medical treatment, such as counselling or physiotherapy, as their work-related activity.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000122"></a>The amendment would mean that these activities could not be recorded on the action plan as work-related activity, even where that was the wish of the claimant. We would not want to limit the scope of the provisions in that way. Every claimant should have the right to choose to take up medical treatment to meet his or her work-related activity requirement. However, I agree that claimants should not be directed to undergo medical treatment under the specific work-related activity provisions. I repeat: we do not agree that claimants should be directed to undertake medical treatment under the specific work-related activity provisions. This is consistent&#151;</p>

As I said earlier, assurances are valuable, but why not have this in the Bill? This is a very important safeguard and is not just a matter of training, if I may say so. I should say that on the previous occasion I was looking anxious and shaking my head rather than glaring.</p>

So it is in the regulations, not the Bill, as the noble Baroness asked. We believe that that is consistent with the recommendations of the Gregg review and the codes of medical practice that the noble Baroness and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, spoke about.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000125"></a>I was asked some specific questions. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, asked what would happen if people changed their minds&#151;again raising the coercion issue. If claimants want to undertake medical treatment, it will be made clear to them that they are free to change their mind at any time. It will never be required that they must continue to receive the treatment or take up new treatment.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000126"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, asked whether we will require customers to attend a certain place where a medical intervention can take place. Under Clause 8, as regards ESA claimants, we will not require customers to undertake medical treatment or require them to attend a place of treatment, although we may require someone to go to an information session. The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, talked about a plumber&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09062255000127"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0007.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="09062255000231"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> Why was it felt important when we debated the Mental Health Bill that these crucial safeguards were included in the Mental Health Act while in this Bill it is regarded as okay to have them in regulations? I do not understand that because the principle is exactly the same in relation to human rights, which are what we are really talking about. To impose treatment against someone&#146;s will is very serious; it is an assault. I ask the Minister to take this away and think about it in relation to the Mental Health Act.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000128"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0007.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="09062255000232"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> Absolutely. The noble Baroness makes a very strong point, and we will certainly take it away. We feel that we have gone as far as is necessary, but I do not disagree that she has made a strong point, and we will certainly look at it between now and Report.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000129"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, used the example of the plumber. The adviser may well discuss other work-related activities. Could the plumber consider work that does not involve stress on his legs? Reskilling would be something to do with that.</p>

Clause 7 gives the Secretary of State the power to abolish income support and is a clause on which we have all received a great deal of representation from many groups, all expressing concern about what looks like the imminent abolition of income support. We understand the Government's purpose in putting this clause in the Bill. They say it is all about simplifying the benefits system and they confirm that the power to abolish income support will not be triggered until no one needs it. However, Governments come and Governments go. All we seek in this amendment is a modest but important proposal&#151;a safeguard, really&#151;for income support to be the subject of a report to be presented to Parliament before regulations to abolish income support are brought in under the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000132"></a>Income support is still available and is particularly taken up by lone parents, carers and women in the later stages of pregnancy. We are told that there is to be a new and detailed plan for the long-term reform of benefits available to carers, and we look forward to that. Perhaps the Minister can tell us when we can expect that; I do not think that this is the first time that he has been asked about it. We hope that any review of the benefits system in relation to carers will recognise the very important work that carers of all kinds do and the fact that their economic value to the country is probably incalculable. Moving carers from income support on to a modified JSA regime seems a very clumsy way of treating them and could deter some people from taking on unpaid caring duties, which in turn could damage family relationships. We must not forget that carers can get carer&#146;s addition only if the person for whom they are caring gets certain benefits themselves. That is not always the case. Those benefits are attendance allowance, disability living allowance at the middle or highest rate for personal care, constant attendance allowance in some circumstances and, in others, war disablement pension.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000133"></a>It is not just voluntary groups that are concerned about this part of the Bill. The Government's own advisers, the Social Security Advisory Committee, thought the Government's proposals &#147;ill-conceived and short-sighted&#148;. We urge the Government to listen to all those voices expressing great concern that the power to abolish income support might be brought in before proper safeguards are in place for those who rely on it. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062255000135"></a>The TUC has been in touch with me about this. It tells me that trades unions are determined to defend the Beveridge principle of providing a safety net to guarantee that no one will be left without a right to an income. Many people who learn that they are to be switched from income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance will worry that they will be required to be available for employment, even though that will not be practical for them. It is quite clear that this has already begun to worry a number of women. I am sure a number of us have, like me, received quite a lot of material from women&#146;s organisations. It includes a letter from a woman who has a disabled child. She wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062255000156"></a>&#147;If I was told today that I had to go into waged work, it would be very difficult not only for me but especially for my child. I wouldn&#146;t want to leave her in the care of someone else who may not have her needs at heart as her mother does or be as aware of her condition ... If I was in waged work I would have to leave suddenly if my daughter was ill &#151; not a lot of jobs let you do that. And if my daughter was very ill I would have to leave the job and go back on benefits. I&#146;m already working caring for my child but the work I&#146;m doing is not paid, so now they are asking me to do paid work on top of all my unwaged caring work, which is devastating and exhausting&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000141"></a>That is typical of letters from people who are on income support and fear that the provisions in the Bill will remove their right to it and that they will be expected to enter into some form of waged work or a work-related system that they feel they are not able to cope with.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000136"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062255000237"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I support the amendment. Most people with mental health problems probably do not qualify for the various disability benefits that might support the carer in avoiding sanctions. If the Minister attended one of our carers&#146; groups, he would be aware of the tremendous strain that these people face day by day. Many of them barely cope, yet if they did not keep going, the mental health services in this country would not cope. We are incredibly dependent upon the contribution made by carers in that field. For that reason alone&#151;I would not presume to contribute on any other disability issue about which I am less familiar&#151;I hope that the Minister will take this amendment very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="09062255000137"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0008.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09062255000238"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> There are mothers of almost grown up or, indeed, grown-up autistic children who are carers and there are mothers of children who are bed-bound with ME. To expect those people even to think that they might have to go out to work because of the title of the allowance that they will be given is wrong. If the Minister is going to come up with a new name for it, that may be acceptable, but let us hear what he has to say.</p>

<p><a name="09062259000001"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062259000033"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I wonder whether there is a misconception here. No one is saying that the multitude of groups will be dealt with in a one-size-fits-all way.  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC398"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC398</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>When one looks at the list&#151;for example, pregnant women within 11 weeks of their expected confinement or young people in full-time non-advanced education who are estranged from their parents&#151;one sees that none of the words we have heard covers them. I talked on an earlier amendment of those who are involved in court cases for more than eight weeks, which is another category so usefully listed in the Peers&#146; information pack.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000002"></a>I was also alarmed that the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, suggested that the switch to income support would mean loss of benefit altogether. I cannot believe that of any Government of whatever persuasion. The noble Baroness will know full well that I do not share her Government&#146;s persuasion 100 per cent of the time and perhaps not even 50 per cent of the time. That thought beggars belief.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000003"></a>Of course, Parliament will need to be satisfied that all these groups are being looked after before agreeing to regulations, which should not be allowed to be brushed aside unless a Member of either House notices as would have happened in years gone by. I do not believe that that is the case now because for some time we have had the assiduous services of your Lordships&#146; Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, on which we had a debate last Friday. Alas, I could not attend, although I should have liked to, due particularly to my small involvement in creating the committee, which was based on the frustration I felt as a long-term member of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, whose standing orders have always precluded a discussion on the merits.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000004"></a>However, I digress slightly from the point that I was making. There now has to be a better reason than formerly to choose an affirmative procedure over a negative one. The final abolition of income support is definitely not of such importance as to warrant an affirmative instrument, as it will have withered on the vine by that stage. Of course I accept that each of the categories of people who will remain on income support after this Bill is up and running will need legislation to move them on to another benefit&#151;perhaps JSA, the single benefit currently being investigated by the Government and the Official Opposition, or some other benefit which is yet to be invented. The conundrum, which I share with other Members of this Committee, is, first, when; secondly, how; and, perhaps thirdly, where, as regards what benefit is most appropriate. The only clue we have is to be found in the <I>Raising E</I><I>xpectations</I> White Paper regarding carers. Apparently, there are no plans to move carers on to JSA until the Government have finished their examination of long-term care and have what the Peers&#146; information pack calls a clear and detailed plan.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000005"></a>For the other categories, with the exception of the sick and disabled claimants who will I am sure migrate to ESA, the Government appear to be rather indecisive. Perhaps unhelpfully, the Peers&#146; information pack says that this might be appropriate for those on statutory sick pay, which I would have thought was inevitable and the right proposal. The Peers&#146; information pack goes on to say that the DWP currently plans to move all the other groups on to the modified form of JSA. This policy is being developed over a number of years.  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC399"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC399</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The fact that the pack says that the DWP currently plans to move them all to a modified JSA does not mean that that will happen. I do not have the least idea where they will all end up, but I have no doubt that for some of the groups a modified form of JSA would be appropriate.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000006"></a>However, I am not clear about how the JSA can be the catch-all for all those groups currently on income support. I would be grateful if the Minister would explain, not least because for many of these groups jobseeking has nothing to do with their circumstances. I am thinking, for example, again of people who are involved in long court cases. By definition, they are not even in the progression-to-work group. Would it not be better if the court system took care of them, for example?</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000007"></a>To sum up, we need a progress report at regular intervals before income support is finally abolished. I think that we will get that because each of these categories will have a statutory instrument before they are allowed to be moved on to a new and different benefit. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that. I do not know whether they will be done in blocks of categories or if each category will have its own statutory instrument. The Minister probably cannot answer that yet, because he probably does not know. As I say, we are years ahead of actually achieving this. But when income support is finally abolished, we will have had a whole series of statutory instruments and reports&#151;possibly reports from CSAC, on top of that&#151;and maybe other information as well. We would then be satisfied that all the groups had been properly taken care of elsewhere in the social security system, so that when the time came, abolition by negative resolution would be the appropriate way in which to do it. I hope that that will help the Minister in what is likely to be rather a difficult response, given all noble Lords and the noble Baronesses who have spoken in support of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09062259000008"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0008.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09062259000034"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> It strikes me that the noble Lord has just given a very good reason for Clause 7 being superfluous.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000010"></a>I shall make a couple of points to start with. To be clear to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, we are not taking away anybody&#146;s right to an income by anything included in these provisions. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, asked about the timetable for bringing forward specific proposals on carers&#146; benefits. Our Green Paper on care and support is likely to be published before the Summer Recess. We have committed to retaining income support for as long as it is needed for carers.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000011"></a>Clause 7 sets out the conditions which are required before a decision to abolish income support can be taken. When these conditions exist, the clause will enable the Secretary of State to make an order which  


<notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC400"></a><b>22 Jun 2009 : Column GC400</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>effectively switches off income support. It would also allow him to make any transitional and consequential provisions that may be needed. Amendment 80 states that the decision to switch off income support should be subject to affirmative procedure; and that the Government should also present Parliament a report concerning income support.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000012"></a>I will deal with the issue of affirmative powers first. As noble Lords will be aware, the Delegated Powers Committee has looked carefully at the Bill and concluded that Clause 7 should be subject to affirmative procedure. Based on that advice, we will table a government amendment on Report to make Clause 7 subject to affirmative procedure. I hope that noble Lords will be satisfied at least on that point. The second part of the amendment would require the production of a report before the order can be made. I am not convinced that this is necessary, especially as we have now agreed that the order will be subject to affirmative procedure process. I know that noble Lords have been concerned about the position of carers when income support is abolished; I am happy to reiterate our commitment that carers will not be moved from income support until we have agreed a clear and detailed plan setting out how we will reform the benefit system over the longer term and how the particular needs of carers will be recognised. Invariably that process will involve consultation with carers themselves and their representative groups.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000013"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, have given notice that they intend to oppose that Clause 7 stand part of the Bill. Clause 7 is important as it sets out how we will perform and simplify the structure of the benefit system. It provides the basis for a streamlined system in which there is no longer a separate benefit called &#147;income support&#148;. That may seem a very radical change but it is the logical step in a process which has been continuing for some time.</p>
<h5><a name="09062259000032"></a>7.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000014"></a>When it was first introduced, income support was a catch-all benefit for everyone who satisfied an income test. Over the years, a number of new benefits have been introduced to provide support for different groups: income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance for unemployed people, pension credit for older people and, most recently, income-related employment and support allowance for sick and disabled people. In addition, lone parents with older children now receive jobseeker&#146;s allowance rather than income support. Once those changes have come in, income support will serve a much narrower purpose than was intended; it will be a benefit mainly for lone parents with young children, carers and a number of much smaller groups, some of which the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to. In those circumstances we do not think it makes sense to retain income support as a separate benefit.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000015"></a>Of course, people who receive income support will still need help. In Clause 3 we are amending jobseeker&#146;s allowance to ensure that they can get it. The amendments to Clause 3 will create a new form of jobseeker&#146;s allowance which will, for all intents and purposes, provide the same comprehensive safety net currently provided by income support. Clause 7, therefore, provides

Although we have no definite date to do that by and although we have said that we shall do it only once resources allow, we still believe that this is the right time to take these powers.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000016"></a>We shall need to look carefully at how the change will fit with other changes which are underway, in particular the transfer of sick and disabled people from income support to the employment and support allowance, but we believe that it is important to set out our clear intention to abolish income support and, thereby, move towards a system based on two main benefits for people of working age: employment and support allowance and jobseeker&#146;s allowance. That will be a significant step towards a simpler and more flexible system of benefits in which people are treated as individuals and not categorised by benefit labels. In the longer term, we may go further and get to a position where there is a single benefit for people of working age. However, reforms of that magnitude can only be taken in stages and removing income support is the obvious next step.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000017"></a>I hope that noble Lords agree that it is right for the Government to make their intentions to reform the benefit system clear and that making the provisions to abolish income support subject to the affirmative procedure will provide the necessary level of scrutiny. I hope that they will also agree that a report to Parliament will offer little in the way of additional scrutiny as the key discussions and decisions will already have taken place by the time a report is introduced.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000018"></a>A number of specific additional points were raised. The noble Countess, Lady Mar, asked whether we should change the name. Perhaps in the longer term we may move to an entirely new single working-age benefit and at that stage we may look at the title.</p>

<p><a name="09062259000019"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0008.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09062259000036"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Turner, may correct me but one thing that we are worried about is that carers will not claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance because it is called &#147;jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#148; and they will not think that they fit into that category. The name is important.</p>

<p><a name="09062259000020"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062259000037"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I understand that not unreasonable point. We need to see where the carers&#146; strategy is heading. It is fair to say that people may be switched off from claiming just by the title, but I am sure that there are ways in which we can address that. On balance, we note that for most people on jobseeker&#146;s allowance it would be the start of a journey towards work and towards seeking employment. It is important that we retain that component of our approach.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000021"></a>My noble friend Lady Turner expressed concern about removing the safety net which the benefit system provides for thousands of vulnerable people, reiterating the TUC's position on that as well as her own. To be clear, the Bill does not abolish income support but it provides a mechanism for abolishing it by order once it has been decided that there are no longer any groups that need it, but not before that. No decision has been taken about when that will happen.</p>

<p><a name="09062259000022"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09062259000038"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> It looks as though there is a great deal of fear among people who are now on income support, otherwise we would not receive letters from people who are afraid that their income support will be removed and that they will not have anything to replace it.</p>

<p><a name="09062259000023"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09062259000039"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I acknowledge that. This is why it is useful to have these exchanges. We need to reflect on how we can seek to address those fears genuinely and explain fully to people what is intended. I acknowledged that these can be sensitive times for people, particularly those who are vulnerable.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000024"></a>I have dealt with the point about the safety net. My noble friend Lady Turner also said that it was inevitable that we would use the powers in the Bill as a stepping stone to applying full JSA conditionality to all groups. I stress that this is not the case; we acknowledge that some groups on income support have significant responsibilities that should take priority over actively seeking work, and there is no intention to introduce full JSA conditionality for those groups until they are in a position to benefit from an increased level of activity.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000025"></a>I have dealt with the position of carers and the fundamental reason why we seek to support this provision. On the basis of what I have said, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment and that Clause 7 will stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09062259000026"></a><b><a name="90622-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09062259000040"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> I thank all those who have supported the amendment. It is significant that I was supported by three noble Baronesses. As the noble Countess, Lady Mar, said, income support applies particularly to women and the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, made the same point. Women are particularly sensitive to the need for income support. I accept what the Minister said, but having a clause called &#147;Abolition of income support&#148; in the Bill has frightened a lot of people. There is a real failure to communicate what this will do. We all know what the situation is, but even the press do not. It is one of the complaints that the press make; if they talk about the Bill at all, and they are beginning to talk about it now, they just talk about the abolition of income support.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000027"></a>I am glad that we now know that the report on carers will be with us before the Summer Recess. That is very welcome. There is a real problem&#151;the noble Countess, Lady Mar, touched on this&#151;that a lot of groups worry about carers being put on jobseeker&#146;s allowance, even if they are in the category of JSA that will not be expected to look for a job. That carries the wrong message. I understand in a sense why the Government are doing that, but it is a very cock-eyed way of doing it that has produced a great deal of misunderstanding.</p>

<a name="90622-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062259000028"></a>I am pleased, though, that the Minister has said that the Government will abide by the recommendation of the Delegated Powers Committee and will make the affirmative procedure apply to any regulations made under this section of the Bill, which will allow us to have another debate on Report if necessary. If it had been a negative instrument it would have been the same, but we will get a report from the Social Security

However, if that committee has any doubts about it, will he assure us&#151;if he is in a position to say this&#151;that the Government will listen to its recommendations? Sometimes the Government do not listen at all but plough on, regardless of the views of their own advisers. I hope that in this instance they will listen.</p>

That has been the case several times in the recent past. As a member of the Merits Committee I am in a good position to know these things.

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="0906223000003"></a><b><a name="90622-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0906223000076"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0906223000004"></a>Today, I welcome the publication of Sir Jim Rose&#146;s report on identifying and teaching children with dyslexia or literacy difficulties.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0906223000005"></a>In May 2008, I asked Sir Jim Rose to make recommendations on the identification and teaching of children with dyslexia and on how best to take forward the commitment in the Children&#146;s Plan to establish a pilot scheme in which children with dyslexia would receive reading recovery support or one-to-one tuition from specialist dyslexia teachers.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0906223000006"></a>Sir Jim&#146;s final report makes 19 recommendations for the Government, local authorities and schools on assessing and advancing children&#146;s progress, improving support to schools, strengthening teaching expertise, strengthening intervention programmes, assuring the quality of provision and providing guidance for parents and others.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0906223000007"></a>We accept all those recommendations requiring action from my department and also we endorse the recommendations requiring action from delivery partners.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0906223000008"></a>My officials will look with the Dyslexia-Specific Learning Difficulties Trust at how it might best work with us at implementing the recommendations. I have set out our initial plans in my response to Sir Jim and we will provide further details in the autumn. We will make up to &#163;10 million available over this and the next financial years to support the implementation of Sir Jim&#146;s recommendations and on other projects&#151;including those taken forward by the Dyslexia-Specific Learning Difficulties Trust&#151;to improve outcomes for children with literacy difficulties and dyslexia. We plan to invest most of this in specialist training.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0906223000009"></a>Copies of the report and our initial response will be placed in both Libraries.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0906223000011"></a>The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) was held on 15 June in Luxembourg. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of State for Europe represented the UK.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0906223000012"></a>The agenda items covered were as follows:</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0906223000013"></a>General Affairs</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0906223000015"></a><I>Preparation of the 18</I><I> and </I><I>19 June European Council </I></p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0906223000016"></a>The GAERC discussed the presidency&#146;s agenda for the June European Council. The European Council will focus on EU institutional issues; financial supervision and regulation; climate change funding mechanisms; employment; illegal migration across the Mediterranean; and external relations.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="0906223000017"></a>On institutional issues, there was widespread support for a positive outcome from the June European Council on Irish legal guarantees, with a view to securing the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="0906223000018"></a>On financial supervision and regulation, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary agreed the system for micro-prudential supervision needed to be reformed; however, the new supervisory authorities should not have the power to impose decisions on national supervisors or firms, where those decisions would require member states to take fiscal action.   On macro-prudential supervision, he agreed with the establishment of a European systemic risk board, but made clear  that its chairmanship should be representative of the EU as a whole, not only the eurozone. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary also noted the importance of G20 summit follow-up and preparation.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="0906223000019"></a>On employment, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary made clear that any accelerated mobilisation of the Social Fund should remain within the existing financial perspective ceilings. He also suggested that June European Council conclusions should call for increased EIB lending, particularly to business and critical infrastructure projects, in order to accelerate economic recovery.  </p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="0906223000020"></a>On climate change, the presidency said that the conclusions language would go forward to the June European Council, an outcome that the Government support.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="0906223000021"></a>On illegal migration, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta emphasised the scale of the problem in the Mediterranean and its disproportionate impact on them; they were looking for other member states to help share the burden. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary agreed with the need to address the issue at its roots&#151;it was not enough just to deal with migrants when they arrived, we needed to take a more long-term approach, which prevents the migrants from travelling to the EU in the first place.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="0906223000022"></a>On external relations, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary welcomed the inclusion of an Afghanistan/Pakistan declaration in the European Council conclusions and looked forward to the Pakistan summit on 17 June. He also noted that Aung Sung Suu Kyi&#146;s birthday would coincide with the European Council; even before a verdict in her trial, it would be appropriate for EU heads to send a message of support from the council to her, and to demonstrate commitment to democracy in Burma. The presidency confirmed that

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0906223000023"></a>The Government support these discussions at the June European Council. In particular, we welcome the continued co-ordinated EU response to the economic and financial situation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0906223000029"></a>High Representative Solana debriefed Ministers on his recent visit to the region and noted that continued EU-US co-operation would be vital, especially over the next few weeks. There was widespread agreement on the importance of further EU-US co-operation, addressing settlements, securing access to Gaza, and supporting a comprehensive, regional approach. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary agreed and urged the EU to encourage support for the Arab peace initiative.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0906223000030"></a>Ministers agreed conclusions on the MEPP, welcoming the US Administration's commitment to pursuing a two-state solution and a comprehensive peace. They also confirmed the EU's readiness to work actively with the US and other quartet members to achieve this goal and contribute substantially to post-conflict arrangements aimed at ensuring the sustainability of peace agreements.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0906223000031"></a>Following the outcome of the elections in Iran, Ministers agreed conclusions without discussion, based on a UK text, setting out the EU&#146;s concerns about the post-election situation, focusing on the need to respect freedom of expression and, while underlining the EU&#146;s willingness to engage with Iran, stressing the need for Iran to meet its own responsibilities.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="0906223000032"></a>Ministers spoke positively about the conduct of elections in Lebanon, noting the longstanding EU contribution to help stabilise the situation there, and adopted conclusions that congratulated the people of Lebanon and encouraged all parties to co-operate with President Sleiman.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="0906223000034"></a>The council adopted conclusions, which renewed the EU&#146;s commitment to the common position and extended the EU-Cuba political dialogue for a further 12 months. The council undertook to review these in June 2010, based on an assessment of progress on issues raised in the conclusions, in particular human rights and political reforms. The conclusions called for the Cuban Government to allow unimpeded contacts with civil society in the margin of high level EU visits. The presidency commented that practically no progress had been made by Cuba on human rights and civil liberties. However, the EU would continue its two-track

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="0906223000037"></a>The presidency noted that member states were united in their condemnation of the trial of Aung Sung Suu Kyi and in their desire for a robust response to the verdict. They underscored the importance of engaging Asian partners, of working to address circumvention of the existing measures and working through EU Special Envoy Fassino.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="0906223000038"></a>In terms of additional measures against the regime, there was consensus around the need to keep these under further consideration, pending the verdict of the trial.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0906223000040"></a>International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) Chief Prosecutor Brammertz briefed Ministers on the co-operation of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia with the ICTY. Following an exchange of views on implementation of Serbia&#146;s interim agreement and following Brammertz&#146;s report on Serbia, Ministers noted that Heads of Government would discuss the issue at the June European Council.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="0906223000054"></a><b><a name="90622-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="0906223000079"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="0906223000055"></a>Today the Department of Health is publishing Professor Jimmy Steele&#146;s report on the future of NHS dental services. The report sets out a clear vision for the future of NHS dental services which are accessible to all, provided to a high quality and focused on prevention and improving oral health.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="0906223000056"></a>Professor Steele was asked by my predecessor to conduct an independent and comprehensive review of NHS dental services in December 2008 and to provide advice on some of the specific issues raised in the Health Select Committee&#146;s report on NHS dental services published last July.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="0906223000057"></a>Professor Steele acknowledges the current problems that some people have in accessing NHS dental services and agrees that the NHS should continue to address specific capacity shortages through the current dental access programme.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="0906223000058"></a>Further, Professor Steele notes specific concerns that patients have about NHS dentistry and makes recommendations on improving the provision of information to patients to help them find an NHS dentist, as well as improving support for NHS dentists to provide high quality care for more patients, as dentists themselves wish to do.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="0906223000059"></a>The report highlights many of the complexities in NHS dentistry and therefore recommends that all proposed changes to dentists&#146; contracts should be piloted thoroughly, and that the recommended changes to the pathway of the dental patient through care should be evaluated carefully. It also recommends much more effective collection and use of information to help monitor and develop the quality and effectiveness of the care patients receive. The Government accept the recommendations in principle, subject to working through the detail of their financial implications. The report recognises the more difficult future fiscal environment and rightly puts an emphasis on piloting, cost containment and more efficient ways of working. With that in mind, we will begin work immediately to set up the pilots and develop plans for further implementation, working closely with the profession as we do so.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="0906223000062"></a><b><a name="90622-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0906223000080"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for the Olympics and Paymaster General (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="0906223000063"></a>The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) has entered into agreements for Triathlon Homes LLP (Triathlon) to purchase 1,379 affordable homes on the Olympic village development. I have given a guarantee, as Minister for the Olympics, in support of those agreements.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="0906223000064"></a>Triathlon is a consortium of First Base and the registered social landlords Southern and East Thames. The principal agreements are between Triathlon, its debt funders and Stratford Village Development (GP) Limited (Stratford Village Development), a wholly owned subsidiary of the ODA which is developing the village on the ODA&#146;s behalf.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="0906223000065"></a>As Stratford Village Development is a newly established company, with minimal financial strength, the ODA has guaranteed its obligations under the terms of those agreements and has also undertaken to Triathlon, and its debt funders, to perform certain obligations which fall directly on the ODA.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="0906223000066"></a>The ODA itself has no significant sources of funding independent of Government and is expected to have a limited life span that many of Stratford Village Development&#146;s obligations are expected to exceed. In such circumstances, and given that the obligations go beyond the lifetime of the 2012 Games, I have agreed to a ministerial guarantee of the ODA in support of its guarantees of Stratford Village Development and the ODA&#146;s direct obligations. Such a guarantee is provided for under the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="0906223000067"></a>The guarantee essentially covers the ODA contracting to build and convert the units from athletes&#146; use at Games time to affordable housing specification and the ODA delivering its scope for the wider Olympic Park infrastructure.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="0906223000068"></a>All Stratford Village Development&#146;s and the ODA&#146;s obligations to Triathlon and its funders are within the ODA&#146;s existing scope and budget&#151;therefore no additional funding is required. As with the rest of the ODA&#146;s programme, there would be access to programme and funders&#146; contingency, if it became necessary, from within the existing public sector funding package.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="0906223000069"></a>The obligations do not constitute additional contingent liabilities because the obligations covered by the guarantees can be funded within the overall public sector funding package for which a contingent liability was announced to Parliament in March 2007.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="0906223000070"></a>At the point at which the ODA is wound up, any remaining rights and obligations under its guarantees and direct undertakings will be managed and considered as part of the Government&#146;s decision at the time on the allocation of the ODA&#146;s remaining assets and liabilities.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="0906223000073"></a>Ratification of the Optional Protocol is an important step and underlines the messages in the convention about respect for the human rights of disabled people.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="0906223000074"></a>As my Statements of 3 and 27 February indicated, the Optional Protocol builds on the convention by establishing two additional procedures in respect of implementation and monitoring of the convention itself.</p>

<a name="90622-wms0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="0906223000075"></a>The first is a procedural avenue that, subject to meeting conditions set out in the Optional Protocol, will enable individuals or groups of individuals to bring petitions to the UN Committee that has been established to monitor implementation of the Disability Convention if they believe that their rights under that convention have been breached. The second is an inquiry procedure giving the committee authority to undertake inquiries when reliable information is received into allegations of grave or systematic violations of convention rights.</p>

This has meant that the Secretary of State has not rejected any applications.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_72"></a><a name="09062224000103"></a>The Building Research Establishment (BRE) has conducted a review of local authority implementation of the licensing provisions under the Housing Act 2004, and this has included an assessment of those selective licensing regimes that were in operation at the time of the research. The final report is due to be published in July 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_173"></a><a name="09062224000205"></a>We are confident that the legislation is beginning to work well. We always intended that the legislation should be used only as a last resort where other measures have proved unsuccessful. We want to encourage voluntary reoccupation of empty homes but this can only work well where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a comprehensive empty property strategy.</p>

Local authorities can use compulsory purchase orders where properties are left empty or they can use an enforced sale procedure where empty properties are derelict or in poor condition.

In 2004 we acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. One of our reasons for doing so was to enable us to consider on a more empirical basis the merits of the right of individual petition. Professor Jim Murdoch of Glasgow University reviewed the operation of the optional protocol,  and we announced the conclusions of his review on 4 December 2008, which were that the optional protocol had not yet provided women in the UK with real benefits; non-governmental organisations in the UK had not used the optional protocol in advancing the cause of women, and that the quality of the UN Committee's adjudication on admissibility of complaints could appear inconsistent. Professor Murdoch's findings suggest that the first three years did not provide sufficient empirical evidence to decide either way on the value of other individual complaint mechanisms. We will need further evidence, over a longer period, to establish what the practical benefits are.</p>

<a name="90622w0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_285"></a><a name="09062224000336"></a>In January the Secretary of State for Health notified the European Commission of concerns that a number of hospital services delivering 24-hour immediate patient care, some supra-specialist services, and small, remote and rural units may need more time to achieve full compliance with the requirement for an average 48-hour working week. The notification set out the Government's intention to take up the option of a limited derogation under Article 17(5) of the European working time directive for services identified as needing more time. Derogation would allow services to plan for up to a 52-hour average week, up to August 2011 (exceptionally until 2012). This flexibility represents good National Health Service management.</p>
