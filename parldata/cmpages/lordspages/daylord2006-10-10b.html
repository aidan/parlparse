December 2005 to cover 250,000 more people, but we have advised the
chair of the Disability Rights Commission that, as part of the
discrimination law review, we will be considering the
commission&#146;s recommendations on the definition of disability. In
addition, the cross-government review of independent living is
considering whether any changes to legislation are required to support
independent living.

appreciate my noble friend&#146;s reply, but does he agree that the
current definition of disability is outdated and restrictive and that,
as a consequence, many thousands of disabled people are denied the
protection of disability law? Those are in addition to the 250,000 whom
he just mentioned. So it is a vast problem. How soon can we have a new
definition that is comprehensive and based on the social model of
disability?</p><p><a name="061010126000019"></a><a name="spnew_3"></a><b><a name="061010126000688"></a>Lord

of date; that has been

local authorities provide community care services based on individual
needs and local criteria, rather than simply on a statutory definition
in the 1948 Act. We will take this forward as part of the independent
living review. Equally, the work of the Disability Rights Commission
and its recommendations for disability legislation will be considered
in the
review.</p><p><a name="061010126000020"></a><a name="spnew_4"></a><b><a name="_spnew2"></a><a name="061010126000689"></a>Lord
Skelmersdale:</b> My Lords, does the Minister accept
that insufficient weight is given to people with fluctuating
conditions? Given the Government&#146;s objective of encouraging as
many people as possible off incapacity benefit and into work, how do
they intend to achieve it for those suffering from, for example,
bipolar disorder or
ME?</p><p><a name="061010126000021"></a><a name="spnew_5"></a><b><a name="061010126000690"></a>Lord
Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, the Disability
Discrimination Act states that, if an impairment has had a substantial
adverse effect on a person&#146;s ability to carry out normal
day-to-day activities but that effect ceases, the substantial effect is
treated as continuing if it is likely to occur. Under the legislation,
fluctuating conditions are covered. I accept that it is an important
question, which will often depend on the way in which a medical doctor
would interpret that fluctuating condition. It is certainly a matter
that we need to keep under review and is important for getting more
people off incapacity benefit. The noble Lord is
right.</p><p><a name="061010126000022"></a><a name="spnew_6"></a><b><a name="_spnew3"></a><a name="061010126000691"></a>Lord
Addington:</b> My Lords, will the Minister give an
undertaking that, if there are legal problems about moving towards a
more social model or definition of disability, the Government will let
us know those problems in plenty of time so that we can have this
debate in a more open and coherent
manner?</p><p><a name="061010126000023"></a><a name="spnew_7"></a><b><a name="061010126000692"></a>Lord
Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, I think that the
noble Lord is referring to the work of the Disability Rights
Commission. A report has just been produced suggesting a change in
definition. We will, of course, give it every consideration. It is fair
to say that the Disability Rights Commission recognises that there are
some important challenges that will have to be met. Although there was
consensus on reaching a change in definition, I do not believe that
there was consensus on what that definition should be. Clearly, there
is a risk that the wider the definition, the more it may dissipate the
effort. These are important matters that will need to be
considered.</p><p><a name="061010126000024"></a><a name="spnew_8"></a><b><a name="_spnew4"></a><a name="061010126000693"></a>The

the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. What is being
done to get some uniformity in the decisions from the Benefits Agency
Medical Service&#146;s doctors? The noble Lord knows very well from
correspondence that we have had on frequent occasions that many of
those cases go to appeal and are won. It seems to be grossly unfair
that people, many of whom are seriously ill, should suffer the stress
of preparing a case for appeal when they will win
anyway.</p>

appeals take place. Sometimes, appeals are won because new information
comes to light. It is important that we get as much information as
possible to the original decision maker. We are undertaking extensive
reviews of the service in the context of our welfare reform agenda and
the legislation before Parliament. I very much take the point raised by
the noble

Morris of Manchester:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to
my noble friend Lord Ashley for raising the crucially important issue
of definition, which has now been emphasised again by the disquieting
experiences of cancer patients seeking time off work for medical
appointments. Can we be assured that, in moving forward on this issue,
Ministers will take fully into account the provisions now agreed for
the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the
obligations they will
impose?</p><p><a name="061010126000027"></a><a name="spnew_11"></a><b><a name="061010126000696"></a>Lord
Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, my noble friend is
right: the 2005 amendments extended the remit of the Disability
Discrimination Act to include many more patients with cancer. Clearly,
an issue has been raised recently about the extent to which employers
and service providers are aware of the new provisions. We have done a
lot to bring this to the attention of such organisations, but more
needs to be done.</p><p><a name="061010126000028"></a>On the UN
convention, I pay tribute to my noble friend and other noble Lords who
took part in a debate in your Lordships&#146; House a few years ago.
Great progress has been made. There is now an agreed text. It is
subject to some technical work but, as far as I am advised&#151;this
will have to be checked carefully by each government
department&#151;we do not believe that any legislation in operation
in this country is incompatible with the text that has now been
agreed.</p><p><a name="061010126000029"></a><a name="spnew_12"></a><b><a name="_spnew6"></a><a name="061010126000697"></a>Lord
Rotherwick:</b> My Lords, does the Minister expect
the new definition to cover dyslexia, which affects about 11 per cent
of the population? Without certain support at school and later on in
the workplace&#151;IT support, for instance&#151;people with
dyslexia can never usually reach their true potential in
life.</p><p><a name="061010126000030"></a><a name="spnew_13"></a><b><a name="061010126000698"></a>Lord
Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, we do not have a
new definition, so it is difficult to give the noble Lord a hard and
fast answer. Essentially, the DRC wants to move from a definition that
protects a group of disabled people and protects anyone who experiences
discrimination on the grounds of impairment. One of the problems that
the DRC recognises is that, if impairment is the judgment to be made,
it also wishes to exclude a limited number of trivial conditions from
that definition. That shows some of the problems there will always be
in coming to a new definition. The key test at the moment is that the
Act defines a disabled person as a person with physical or mental
impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their
ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. That is the basis
for a more extensive description of those people who are
covered.</p>

given that the fatality rate is 10 times above the national average

right to suggest that this is a growing industry. Certainly the
baseline figures for 2001-02 show that the waste industry has very
high, unacceptable accident rates. As I said in my Answer, the
executive has set a target for reducing those rates through a
combination of encouragement and advice to the industry, alongside a
proactive campaign of inspection and enforcement. Although I do not
have official figures in relation to the baseline figure, work by the
Environmental Services Association suggests that accident rates have
reduced. That does not give room for complacency&#151;we need to
build on it&#151;but it looks as though we are now moving in the
right
direction.</p><p><a name="061010126000035"></a><a name="spnew_18"></a><b><a name="_spnew8"></a><a name="061010126000703"></a>Lord

concern is the number of fatal accidents that occur in scrap yards.
Major accidents have also been caused during household collections when
operatives cross pavements and streets. With scrap yards, one is often
dealing with fairly small businesses. The trade association, working
with the HSE, is developing a passport to encourage staff to be
trained. We need to do more of that. There is also a big need to train
vehicle operatives to try to reduce the number of such
incidents.</p>

important consideration. The targeted action that the HSE is developing
is focused on local authorities as one sector that has a big role to
play. There is an existing duty in law for all staff to undergo
training, but the structure of the industry is such that it could be
very brief and inadequate. Alongside regulation enforcement, we need to
do everything we can to encourage the industry to ensure that team
leaders and operatives are properly trained and risk-assessed.

better performance. The signals are that it does; the construction
industry is probably the best example of where this has worked. Over

fairness? How can a policy of allocating expenditure to Scotland that

clear that the Government have no plans to review the Barnett formula.
The funding arrangements were set out in the latest statement of
funding policy, which, as I said, was published in July 2004. That
remains the Government&#146;s policy. Spending in the devolved
Administrations is not derived just from the Barnett formula; there are
other components to it, including the annually managed expenditure and
locally financed local government expenditure. The differences between
the regions and the devolved Administrations have as much to do with
the starting baseline and the annual managed expenditure as they have
with the application of the Barnett formula. Perhaps I may gently
remind my noble friend that, in his evidence to the Select Committee in
November 1997, he said:</p><ul><a name="061010126000260"></a>&#147;I am flattered that the Barnett

objective. I am sure that he will agree that it was intended to last

Spending Review is a fundamental review of public expenditure across
the board, based on zero-based budgeting by departments, and it looks
objectively at what services need to be delivered and how they are to
be funded. That is a thorough-going review of public expenditure. If
one looks at what has happened to expenditure in the devolved
Administrations and England in the six years to March 2006, one will
see that identifiable expenditure, which is the bulk of public
expenditure, has increased faster in England than it has in Scotland,
Wales or Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="061010126000052"></a><a name="spnew_34"></a><b><a name="_spnew14"></a><a name="061010126000719"></a>Lord

of us are extremely puzzled by the Treasury&#146;s persistence with
its approach to this matter? Surely the analysis of the regional impact
of public expenditure must be based on serious economic analysis and
research. It is matter not just of needs, although that is important;
it is also a question of where that expenditure can take place most
effectively. The Barnett formula simply does not meet either of those
criteria, and it never has. Is it not up to the Government to take the
criticisms more seriously and offer us a more fundamental approach to
regional

application of the Barnett formula, which looks just at year-to-year
changes from the base, is a small part of total public expenditure. The
Government are committed to improving prosperity in public services in
all regions. Their regional policy was set out in the SR 2004 White
Paper. The Government have established a PSA target to make sustainable

that the Barnett formula was just a component of how public expenditure
changes and that the Government have been about a comprehensive
spending review. That review has gone back to zero base right across

unfortunate consequences for military medicine in general and the care

the decision to close the military hospitals was taken by the previous
Government. That decision was right. Experience has taught us that high
standards are maintained only by maintaining the experience of clinical
personnel by carrying out clinical care. The level of casualties that
we have to look after in the military is, thank God, not large enough
to sustain full-scale military hospitals. On any given day, we have in
hospital fewer than 50 in-patients from the military. That is for all
cases, of any type. The most efficient way for people to be cared for,
therefore, is in specialist military hospital units within the NHS. You
need a large NHS hospital with all its clinical experience, facilities
and the range of know-how properly to look after our soldiers. That is
garnered only in an NHS hospital.</p><p><a name="061010126000066"></a><a name="spnew_46"></a><b><a name="061010126000731"></a>Lord

noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, I wish to paint in the
background of this matter as it is a long time since it was considered
in Committee.</p><p><a name="061010126000093"></a>I start with the
police role in cautioning young offenders. That role was overhauled by
the Government in 1998 and put on a statutory basis in the Crime and
Disorder Act of that year. But we are not dealing with young offenders
today so I say no more about that. The police role in cautioning adult
offenders has never been put on a statutory basis but it is of very
long standing. It has been regulated by successive Home Office
circulars setting out the National Standards for Cautioning Offenders.
I believe that the most recent was issued in
2005.</p><p><a name="061010126000094"></a>Cautioning
has always been a very valuable tool for dealing with low-level
offenders. Its essential features are well known: the offender must
admit his guilt and be willing to accept the caution. It has always
been vital that cautioning rather than prosecuting should be in the
public interest. It goes without saying that cautioning does not
involve
punishment.</p><p><a name="061010126000095"></a>The
simple caution was always very useful and it still is. Then in 2003 the
Home Office came up with an idea that cautioning could be made even
more useful in some cases. It depended on the offender being willing to
make reparation for his offence and on the victim being willing to
accept reparation. The idea was that the offender and the victim should
be brought face to face&#151;always if the victim was
willing&#151;and the offender would then make amends either by
repairing any damage which he had done to the victim&#146;s property,
paying the victim compensation or, indeed, just apologising. The
evidence was that
this,</p><ul><a name="061010126000275"></a>&#147;can reduce
reoffending and improve victim satisfaction with the criminal justice
system&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 29/10/03; col.
362.]</ul><a name="061010126000247"></a>Those are not my
words but those of the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General on
Report in 2003. He referred then to this as a very exciting new idea. I
agree that it was. The criminologists refer to it by the name of
&#147;restorative justice&#148;. But I do not believe that anyone
ever thought that conditional cautions of that kind would be useful
except in a small number of cases.
<p><a name="061010126000096"></a>The other condition which could be
imposed, again with the consent of the offender, was that he should
undergo some form of treatment. Again, it would obviously apply in only
very few cases. The code explaining the purpose of conditional
cautions, as contained in the 2003 Act, stated at page six:</p>



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_124"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="061010126000264"></a>&#147;Rehabilitation: this might
include taking part in treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, e.g.
attendance at self-help
groups&#148;</ul><a name="061010126000248"></a>and so on.
Attendance at anger management courses is another example
given.<a name="061010126000249"></a>On reparation, the
code says,<ul><a name="061010126000276"></a>&#147;this
might include repairing or otherwise making good any damage caused to
property (e.g. by cleaning graffiti), restoring stolen goods, paying
modest financial compensation, or in some cases a simple apology to the
victim.&#148;</ul><p><a name="061010126000097"></a>That was the
idea, and, if I may say so, a very good idea it was. If, during his
speech in 2003, the Attorney-General had been asked, &#147;Why do you
not extend conditional cautions so as to include the possibility of
imposing a fine?&#148;, he would, I believe, have answered:
&#147;But that is the very opposite of what we are trying to do. How
can a fine help the victim? How can a fine rehabilitate the offender?
There is nothing restorative in a fine, and there is no reason to
suppose that it will reduce re-offending. If a fine is the appropriate
remedy, it should be imposed in the usual way by magistrates&#148;. I
do not know whether that is the answer that the Attorney-General would
have given in 2003, but it is very different from his answer now. I
need not say that I find his 2003 speech a great deal more persuasive
and convincing than the one he made in Committee on 6 July, which I
have read with the greatest care.</p><p><a name="061010126000098"></a>I oppose Clause 16 standing part on the
following grounds. First, it is wrong in principle for the prosecution
to determine the level of punishment. Indeed, it is wrong for the
prosecution to have any say in the sentencing process at all.
Sentencing has always been for the courts, at least since the Bill of
Rights of 1689. No amount of Home Office guidance on how this proposed
fine should be made a condition, and no amount of safeguards that could
be built into the Bill at this or any stage, can get away from that
basic objection.</p><p><a name="061010126000099"></a>The point can
be illustrated from a very different field: the mandatory life sentence
for murder. Traditionally, the Home Secretary justified his claim to
have the last word on when a prisoner should be released on the ground
that he was not exercising a sentencing function at all but he was only
determining when the prisoner should be released. That fallacy was
exposed finally and firmly by the House of Lords in Anderson, of which
I am sure the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General will be well
aware. At the other end of the scale, in support of this provision,
reliance is sometimes placed on the fixed penalty for parking illegally
or for not wearing a seat belt. But fixed penalties are entirely
different. The amount is fixed by statute or by-law; it does not in any
way involve the prosecution&#146;s
discretion.</p><p><a name="061010126000100"></a>My first objection
being the straightforward objection on the grounds of principle, my
second is that the existing conditions under the 2003 Act are entirely
consistent with the basic concept of a caution. Punishment, however, is
entirely inconsistent with that basic concept. Indeed, the notion of a
punitive caution could almost be said to be a contradiction in
terms.</p>



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_125"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061010126000101"></a>When the Government say in their various
documents that they are only extending conditional cautions, widening
their scope or filling a gap, it sounds harmless enough. But it is not
harmless, because Clause 16 does much more: it creates something
&#147;radically new&#148;. Those are not my words, but those of
Hazel Blears in Committee in the other place, where she said that this
new concept could affect as many as 30,000 individuals a year. My
objection is that the two ideas, a caution and punishment, are
inconsistent with each
other.</p><h5><a name="061010126000316"></a>3.30
pm</h5><p><a name="061010126000102"></a>Thirdly, I fear that if
fines are capable of being made conditions, they will soon in practice
replace the other conditions, because they are much easier to monitor
and enforce. If that happens, all the good done by the 2003 Act, and
which should continue, might be driven out by the bad done by the 2006
Act.</p><p><a name="061010126000103"></a>Fourthly, if we are
introducing something &#147;radically new&#148;, as Hazel Blears
said&#151;and I certainly believe that&#151;should we not have had
proper consultation before we were asked to do that? The noble and
learned Lord the Attorney-General has expressed regret that there was
not more consultation, but he says that he and the Lord Chancellor
discussed the matter with judges, magistrates and
officials&#151;although I do not know who they may be. I, too, have
discussed the matter with judges and magistrates and I found no one in
favour of this proposal&#151;certainly not the magistrates, judging
from their views expressed as recently as March 2006; nor do I read
Lord Justice Auld in his 2001 report as favouring what is now proposed.
In its recent paper, Liberty made a strong case against the
proposal.</p><p><a name="061010126000104"></a>Lastly, there is
surely an overwhelming case for waiting until the results of the 2003
experiment are available, so that we can know whether it is working.
What is the urgency? The answer, we are told, is the pressure on
magistrates&#146; courts and the need to divert 30,000 cases at
whatever cost in terms of constitutional principle. Conditional
cautions under the 2003 Act were progressive, beneficial and based on
principle. The current proposal is not. It is yet another example of
expediency driving out principle, and I hope that we shall oppose it. I
beg to
move.</p><p><a name="061010126000105"></a><a name="spnew_54"></a><b><a name="_spnew26"></a><a name="061010126000739"></a>Baroness

During our debates in Committee in July on conditional cautions, I made
it clear that we continued strongly to support the provisions launched
by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. That, as the noble and learned Lord
pointed out, introduced conditional cautions intended to facilitate
rehabilitation of offenders or ensure that they made reparation for the
offences. But now the Government wish to impose conditional cautions as
a punitive measure.</p><p><a name="061010126000106"></a>My

clause remaining in the Bill while we

in Committee our concern about developments in government policy since
the clause was debated in another place. This summer, the Prime
Minister has announced that he intends dramatically to increase the use
of administrative punishment and avoid using the
courts.</p><p><a name="061010126000107"></a>We are deeply concerned
that the Government are taking our judicial system down a route that
may be convenient to them but that certainly has not been proved to
serve the victim and the public well. As the noble and learned Lord
made clear, there has as yet been no proper public debate on this
matter. He put forward strong arguments for removing this
clause.</p><p><a name="061010126000108"></a>The Minister is of
course aware of the concerns expressed about these measures by the
Magistrates&#146; Association, for one, which I thank for its
courtesy in coming to the House during the Recess to provide me with
further briefing on its views on the matter. The association remains
obdurate against the inclusion of the clause.</p><p><a name="061010126000109"></a>Fair trial safeguards and the
involvement of the independent court in the delivery of punishment are
also in the wider public interest and in the interest of victims of
crime. The rigours of an open trial help to ensure that the right
person is convicted and demonstrate publicly that justice is being done
and that the state will not accept criminal behaviour. An open trial
provides a public warning against offending. A publicly observed
objective process in the criminal justice system can also be of great
value for victims. I do not see how punitive cautions would deliver
those additional benefits.</p><p><a name="061010126000110"></a>If
we were to remove this clause today, we would keep to the current legal
position on conditional cautions. The system has not yet been running
long enough to prove its own merits or demerits, but we certainly hope
that it will prove to have merits. Indeed, in Committee, when I asked
the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General about the reoffending
rate for those who have accepted conditional cautions, he said
that,</p><ul><a name="061010126000277"></a>&#147;the scheme
has been going for an insufficient length of time to give a meaningful
answer to that question&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
6/7/06; col. 378.]</ul><a name="061010126000250"></a>He
also said that, if he could improve on that answer, he would write to
me, and I am grateful to him for so doing at the end of last week.
However, as he will know, my gratitude has to be somewhat tempered by
the fact that his letter basically said: &#147;I&#146;ve got
nothing more to tell you. There isn&#146;t sufficient information to
give a robust interpretation of the impact of the 2003
measures&#148;. I have the letter in front of me and I give a
pr&#233;cis of it, but the noble and learned Lord, while trying to be
helpful, was not able to provide robust information to persuade me that
the original cautions are working in the way that we hope.
<p><a name="061010126000111"></a>It seems only sensible that, before
further changing the law on conditional cautions, we should wait to see
how the current law has operated in practice across England and Wales.
After all, as the noble and learned Lord said, when Hazel Blears
introduced these matters in another place she acknowledged that they
were an &#147;innovative and radical departure&#148; from 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_127"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the current law. That was way back in the spring&#151;on the morning
of 23 March, at col. 167. I have nothing against innovation, radical or
whatever; if it is done for the right reasons, I would welcome it. But
the Government have not yet proved their case on Clause 16,
particularly in the light of the policies that they have headlined over
the summer. They have themselves accepted that this is a significant
matter that requires wider public discussion and consultation. I
noticed that the DCA&#146;s paper <I>Delivering Simple, Speedy,
Summary Justice</I>, which was published in July this year, says at
paragraph 7.7 on page 40,
that,</p><ul><a name="061010126000278"></a>&#147;we need to
engage with the judiciary, criminal justice practitioners, communities
and the public in general about where the balance lies between simple
and immediate responses to low level misbehaviour and fast, efficient
and modern court processes&#148;.</ul><a name="061010126000251"></a>I would certainly agree with such a
consultation, but the wider debate called for in the DCA&#146;s paper
has not yet taken place. If we truly value accountability to the public
and the victim, that consultation should proceed before we plunge in
and include the
clause.<p><a name="061010126000252"></a><a name="spnew_55"></a><b><a name="_spnew27"></a><a name="061010126000740"></a>Baroness
Linklater of Butterstone:</b> My Lords, I support the
amendment. The extension of conditional cautions beyond reparation and
rehabilitation to include wider punitive conditions is highly
undesirable, as we have heard expressed so eloquently by the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. We entirely endorse the current principle of
conditional cautions, which is that the only conditions that may be
applied are those that will facilitate the rehabilitation of the
offender or ensure that he or she makes reparation for the
offence.</p><p><a name="061010126000112"></a>That underlines the
very important principle that cautions are meant to be an alternative
to entering the criminal justice process, and it is also a means of
encouraging the person not to reoffend while still at the lowest level
of offending. Indeed, I believe that reparation and rehabilitation
constitute constructive punishment. Making good damage to a person's
property or being required to attend a rehab clinic, for example, is
much tougher than simply paying a fine, which allows the offender to
walk away from the reality of what he has
done.</p><p><a name="061010126000113"></a>Every means of keeping
people out of the criminal justice system is to be encouraged,
particularly where younger people are concerned. Never has this been
truer than it is today, when people are criminalised earlier and
earlier compared with 10 years ago, as is well documented. That has, in
turn, contributed to the catastrophic situation in our prisons today,
which is due in large part to the slippery slope on which petty
offenders find themselves at an early stage and to the
Government&#146;s misguided belief that prison is the only way to be
tough rather than their recognising the failure that it largely is. It
is important that we find ways of diverting people from offending at
the earliest possible stage, which is why the conditional caution is
such a constructive tool in the process.</p><p><a name="061010126000114"></a>However, as we have already heard, the
extension of conditional cautions to include wider punitive conditions
is another matter entirely. This clause 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_128"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allows inclusion of specifically punitive conditions, which at the
moment might include a fine of up to &#163;500 or a community-based
order of up to 20 hours, described, as has already been heard, by Hazel
Blears as an innovative and radical departure affecting up to 30,000
people a year.</p><p><a name="061010126000115"></a>We have already
voiced our concerns in this place about this extension of
administrative justice to punishments imposed by the police and
prosecutors rather than the courts because we believe in a principle of
justice that sentencing and punishment should be imposed by an entirely
independent tribunal and not a biased prosecutorial authority. There is
a real risk that these proposals could be seen as allowing the police
and the CPS to act as investigators, prosecutors and judges. In
addition, there is a further risk that the powers could be used to deal
with high-level offending. My concern is how the proposals could affect
younger people or those with special needs, who are very unlikely to
understand or fully appreciate the implications of what is being
offered and will have little idea of where to go for legal advice. Such
people are, by definition, vulnerable, and a fear of prosecution and,
in particular, the idea of having to go to court is enough for them to
agree to anything, whether they are guilty of anything or
not.</p><p><a name="061010126000116"></a>Any extension of more
punitive conditions not only has alarming implications for the
extension of administrative justice in this country but it also runs a
risk of tipping vulnerable people into the criminal justice system. I
feel that that is an unacceptable price to pay for simple, speedy,
summary justice. It is not only potentially hazardous so far as
concerns the life chances of such petty offenders but it has serious
implications for the management of the criminal justice system as a
large number of people are likely to be sucked into it. They, society
as a whole and our system of justice risk being damaged by
it.</p><p><a name="061010126000117"></a>We entirely endorse the
Government's policy to make reparation and rehabilitation a central
feature of policy, and it seems to us that the current legal position
on conditional cautions is a creative way of embedding it. We support
the amendment and the retention of the current position on conditional
cautions.</p><h5><a name="061010126000317"></a>3.45

Goldsmith:</b> My Lords, this group includes
government Amendment No. 145, and I shall speak to that as well as
responding to the speeches on whether the clause shall stand part. I
shall do that first as, in part, it responds to at least one of the
points made by the noble Baroness.</p><p><a name="061010126000119"></a>A concern touched on in Amendment No.
65, which was not moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, relates to
the financial limit that is set out in the Bill and how that might be
changed. I detected agreement between us on two points: first, that
this policy&#151;certainly this is the Government&#146;s
intention&#151;is not intended to deal with high-level offending but
with low-level offending and, therefore, it is right that there should
be a financial limit; but, secondly, it was also acknowledged that
financial

adjusting them. We responded to the concerns expressed about how that
adjustment should take place by recognising that it would be
appropriate to have as an additional safeguard for a change in the
financial limit that no change should be made save by order subject to
affirmative resolution.</p><p><a name="061010126000120"></a>Amendment No. 145, to which I now speak,
seeks to ensure that any changes to time or financial limits on
punitive conditions are subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure. Therefore, it would require, as is obvious, any changes to
those limits to be subject to a vote in both Houses of Parliament. That
applies to the financial penalty and to the number of hours that an
offender could be required to attend. I shall move that amendment
formally when it is called.</p><p><a name="061010126000121"></a>I
turn to the substance, which is the conditional cautioning scheme. I
recognise, with appreciation, the support that has been expressed in
all three speeches for the concept that we tried to introduce and have
introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. We believe that it was not
enough to have simply a stark choice between a caution, which amounts
to saying, &#147;Don't do it again&#148;, and an appearance in
court, with all that that entails and with a penalty attached to it. We
wanted to find ways to deal with low-level crime fast and effectively
that would meet the needs of everyone, including the needs of victims
when they are present. I believe the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Lloyd, reads too much into what was said previously to say that this
was all about victims. Certainly, a face-to-face meeting with victims
is one way of dealing with a disposal, but it is certainly not the most
usual way of dealing with a disposal. It certainly is not the most
usual way of dealing with conditional cautions.</p><p><a name="061010126000122"></a>We also wanted to find quick and
effective ways of dealing with the offending behaviour of the
individual. The noble and learned Lord spoke about the rehabilitative
condition, saying that he thought that that would apply to only a very
few people. I beg to differ with him. The number of people in this
country who commit relatively low-level crime as a result of problems
with drugs, with drink and with other issues of that sort, such as
anger problems, is quite high. One only needs to visit a magistrates'
court any day of the week or, even more so, to visit a police station
to see how often those issues
arise.</p><p><a name="061010126000123"></a>However, once the scheme
started to operate, it became apparent to those who were operating it
that there were certain limitations in the scheme. The experience of
operating it has been positive, but there are limitations in the cases
where it can be used. I shall give one or two examples of that in a
moment, as I tried to do in Committee when we dealt with clause stand
part.</p><p><a name="061010126000124"></a>The noble and learned
Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, spoke
of the time that we have had. There has not been enough time to reach
any conclusions on the reoffending rate, but the scheme has been
operating in parts of the country sufficiently to know that it is well
worthwhile&#151;I have had that directly from those operating it, who
have also reported to me what the 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_130"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>victims involved have said&#151;and that there are limitations in how
it works. I do not want to focus on the financial penalty first, but on
the other condition referred to: the number of hours worked, which is
looked at rather clinically. I shall give a good example, although this
is not how it might operate exclusively.</p><p><a name="061010126000125"></a>You could come across
an offender who has been spraying graffiti around the town. If you can
identify the particular place that that offender has been spraying
graffiti, you can invite him to agree that, instead of going to court,
he will clean it off under the current scheme. That is reparative,
because it relates to the specific graffiti he dealt with. Noble Lords
might think that a good way of bringing the consequences of his
behaviour home to the offender&#151;&#147;If you go around spraying
graffiti, somebody must clean it off and you will be that person on
this occasion&#148;&#151;and help with his future
behaviour.</p><p><a name="061010126000126"></a>However, if there is
an instance where the graffiti for which he was responsible cannot be
identified, although you know that he was the offender and he admits
that he was, or it has already been cleaned off by the wall&#146;s
owner, you cannot say &#147;We want you to clean graffiti off another
wall instead&#148;. In our view, that is not possible under the Bill
because it is not actually repairing the specific damage he did. In
terms of the benefit to him of seeing the effect of his offending
behaviour, I believe that that would be an appropriate and proper
response, although noble Lords may disagree. However, we could not do
that without making the
amendment.</p><p><a name="061010126000127"></a><a name="spnew_57"></a><b><a name="061010126000742"></a>Lord
Lloyd of Berwick:</b> My Lords, can the Minister

covered?</p><p><a name="061010126000128"></a><a name="spnew_58"></a><b><a name="061010126000743"></a>Lord
Goldsmith:</b> My Lords, I am absolutely not going to
shy away from that, and will come to it. It may be at the heart of the
issue rather more than the point of work. It is important that noble
Lords understand&#151;which is why I take the liberty of explaining
it&#151;that the removal of this clause does not just deal with the
fine element, but the sort of example I have given: that you cannot ask
someone to clear up a piece of graffiti without being clear that he is
responsible for it.</p><p><a name="061010126000129"></a>Where
somebody has been drunk and disorderly, causing a nuisance in the
community&#151;goodness knows, I am afraid that happens a great
deal&#151;one might think that to say, &#147;Right, you should help
clear up the street on a Sunday morning, perhaps the street littered
with beer cans from the night before&#148;, would be an appropriate
response. It would be a good way of bringing his offending behaviour
home to him, and a good thing for the community. You cannot impose that
under the current conditions. Nor can magistrates impose it, because
they have a lower limit of 40 hours for community service, and cannot
impose it unless it is of a sufficient degree of seriousness, which
this would not be. We are missing a whole range of response.</p><p><a name="061010126000130"></a>I shall give an example of where the
fine is appropriate. We currently have a system under which
fixed-penalty notices can be imposed by the police not just for driving
offences or the sort of thing the noble 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_131"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and learned Lord referred to, but also, under schemes approved by
Parliament, for things like drunkenness and public disorder offences.
Let us take the example of someone who, on a Saturday night or
whenever, drinks too much, comes out of the pub and starts with very
bad behaviour. If he kicks in a door, you can invite him to repair the
door if the owner of that property wants him to. Some owners of
property will say, &#147;We don&#146;t want that person repairing
our door. We don&#146;t want him anywhere near our house&#148;. You
can suggest to him that he should go on a course to deal with his
alcohol or attend self-help groups to deal with anger management. The
police could impose a fine without going to court at all. It is
important to recognise that, and, contrary to what the noble and
learned Lord says, they have discretion&#151;not on the amount, I
accept&#151;whether to impose a fine. What you cannot do at the
moment is to say, &#147;What this really needs is your agreement to
deal with your problem by going on some sort of course, but you also
need to recognise the wrongness of your behaviour by paying a
relatively modest financial penalty&#148;. You cannot at the moment
do both.</p><p><a name="061010126000131"></a>The prosecution could
give a conditional caution to deal with alcohol management or anger
management and the police could impose a penalty. Both those things
could happen outside court, but you cannot do both. This provision
would enable both to be
done.</p><p><a name="061010126000132"></a>What
are the safeguards? This is important because the first point raised by
the noble Lord was a constitutional concern that punishment should be
imposed by the courts. I am a little surprised that no noble Lord who
has spoken has referred to the fact that this is not an imposition at
all. It remains for the courts because no offender will be required to
accept a conditional caution. It cannot be imposed on him against his
will. He will have free legal advice on whether to accept the
condition. If he does not accept the condition, he can simply say,
&#147;I will go to court. I will plead not guilty in court&#148;,
or, &#147;I will plead guilty in court and I would rather have the
court deal with it&#148;. It is not a case of giving the prosecutors
the power to punish because it is for the court ultimately to do that.
A condition is being offered which differs from fixed penalties, which
are a punishment imposed not by the prosecutor but by the police. I
give way to the noble and learned Lord.</p><p><a name="061010126000133"></a><a name="spnew_59"></a><b><a name="_spnew28"></a><a name="061010126000744"></a>Lord
Lyell of Markyate:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the
noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General. Is what he is saying in
accordance with how human nature works? Is not the power of the
prosecutor, or indeed the police, to say, &#147;We are going to do
this to you; of course you can go to court&#148; a very powerful
arm-twisting power, and does it not have to be kept under very close
control?</p><p><a name="061010126000134"></a><a name="spnew_60"></a><b><a name="061010126000745"></a>Lord
Goldsmith:</b> My Lords, the noble and learned Lord
will perhaps not be surprised to hear that I do not disagree with him
about not having arm twisting. 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_132"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is why the safeguards are important. Let me enumerate them. The
first and most important is that nothing can actually be imposed. The
offender does not have to admit his guilt. He can go to court. He does
not have to accept the condition. He can go to court and leave it to
the court to decide. But there are further conditions. This does not
apply unless the proposed response is appropriate and proportionate.
That is in guidance.</p><p><a name="061010126000135"></a>Secondly,
the offences for which the conditional caution could be given are
limited by guidance, not from the Home Office but from the Director of
Public Prosecutions and approved by the Attorney-General. That will not
just cover which offences are considered, it will also control the way
the scheme is operated. A detailed matrix will be developed following
consultation that will set out which offences could be considered for a
financial penalty condition and provide guidance on the level of that
penalty, again to be approved by the director and
me.</p><p><a name="061010126000136"></a>Thirdly, before the
condition can be proposed, there must be sufficient evidence to
prosecute. The prosecutor needs to be satisfied about that. The noble
and learned Lord and others will see the distinction, for example, from
a fixed-penalty notice for drunkenness which does not involve a
prosecutor being satisfied on the evidence; a police officer could just
impose it. The House might think it would be better to have the
involvement of the independent
prosecutor.</p><p><a name="061010126000137"></a>Fourthly, one of
the key tests to be applied to the decision to offer a conditional
caution will be whether it is in the public interest to divert the
offender from prosecution. That is clear in the <I>Code for Crown
Prosecutors</I>. It identifies cases for a conditional caution as
follows:</p><ul><a name="061010126000279"></a>&#147;while the
public interest justifies a prosecution, the interests of the suspect,
victim and community may be better served by the suspect complying with
suitable
conditions&#148;.</ul><a name="061010126000253"></a>Fifthly&#151;I
mention this point previously and it directly relates to the concerns
expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell of
Markyate&#151;free legal advice will be available. As I said in 2003,
that may be telephone legal advice, but legal advice will still be
available to someone as to what is the effect of a condition, whether
to accept it and whether that is the right thing to
do.<p><a name="061010126000138"></a>As I said, the conditions
must be proportionate to the offence; they must be suitable to the
offender; and they must be achievable. I hope that I gave reassurance
previously that they would take into account the means of the offender,
for example. That will be clearly set out. The offender has to admit
his guilt before a condition can be agreed. There is no sanction for
breach of a conditional caution. If the offender does not meet the
condition, he gets taken to court, not for breach of the condition but
for the original
offence.</p><p><a name="061010126000139"></a><a name="spnew_61"></a><b><a name="_spnew29"></a><a name="061010126000746"></a>Lord
Burnett:</b> My Lords, to what extent will offenders
be given clear notice of the fact that free legal advice is available?
Furthermore, what information will be given as to their right to
proceed to court to have the matter adjudicated
there?</p>

remarks to a conclusion because there is much more business to deal
with. I have tried to emphasise, first, why I believe that the current
scheme does not deal with cases where victims, the community and the
public will benefit from having a speedy response to low-level crime,
and, secondly, that substantial safeguards are available to protect
against the concerns that have been expressed. I agree with the noble
Baroness that all ways&#151;I noted her words&#151;of keeping
people out of the criminal justice system are to be encouraged. This is
one way to do that.</p><p><a name="061010126000142"></a>I want to
make one final point. A lot of the debate has focused on the financial
penalty. As I have made very clear, that is by no means the whole of
it. I believe that there is a strong case for having that financial
penalty. However, some of the debate seems to have focused more on the
possibility that that might be the only condition imposed. I have given
examples of where we would want it to be together with other
conditions, but I recognise that that may not be clear from the way
that the Bill is drafted. If that is noble Lords&#146; only concern,
we may be able to give further thought to that, but I strongly urge the
House not to reject what may be a really helpful way to deal with
low-level offenders in the interests of everyone, without infringing
constitutional principle, because the constitutional principle is that,
at the end of the day, it is the courts who decide. The courts will
decide here, because they are not being excluded in any way. The
offender can go to court if that is what he wants to
do.</p><p><a name="061010126000143"></a><a name="spnew_63"></a><b><a name="061010126000748"></a>Lord

out lines 31 and
32.</ul><p><a name="061010126000150"></a>The noble
Viscount said: My Lords, this amendment seeks to remove the exclusion
of county councils from the definition of &#147;local
authority&#148; in Clause 18 and therefore include them within the
community call to action.</p><p><a name="061010126000151"></a>As
noble Lords will be well aware, county councillors are democratically
accountable&#151;I certainly do not have to say this to the noble
Lord, Lord Bassam&#151;to their local communities and work closely
with local partners to ensure their community&#146;s needs are met.
These include youth offending teams, drink and alcohol teams, as well
as social, education and environmental services, not to mention their
work for local strategic partnerships and local area agreements.
Indeed, the county council is a responsible authority for community
safety services under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and plays a key
role in this area, as the Home Office review of partnerships arising
from the 1998 Act acknowledges, and yet this has failed to be
translated into the
Bill.</p><p><a name="061010126000152"></a>The
Minister suggested in Committee on 6 July 2006 (<I>Hansard, </I>col.
410) that the inclusion of county council members in the community call
to action could result in overlap, duplication of effort and confusion
about local accountability. I put it to your Lordships that including
county councils would enable powers to deal with all implementation
issues and, as a result, encourage the development of local approaches
which are both flexible and responsive to local needs. Inclusion will
enable discretion and scope for existing local arrangements to identify
where issues are best dealt
with.</p><p><a name="061010126000153"></a>The
County Councils Network (CNN) has suggested that the confusion the
Minister referred to is more likely to occur if the exclusion of county
councils is maintained. The reason is that the current proposals 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_137"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make community disorder reduction partnerships accountable to the
district council&#146;s scrutiny committee. That would mean that the
county council services exercised through the CDRP become nominally
accountable to a district council committee, therefore infringing
issues of accountability.</p><p><a name="061010126000154"></a>The CNN goes on to
highlight:</p><ul><a name="061010126000266"></a>&#147;In many
counties there are up to eleven or twelve districts and therefore the
same number of CDRPs, raising the possibility of the Police and County
council being accountable to twelve different
bodies&#148;.</ul><a name="061010126000254"></a>Surely this
has the potential to lead to more confusion and less direct
accountability, not the other way round. For example, county councils
hold regular surgery sessions to meet local people, at which community
safety issues are often raised. If excluded from the CDRP, a county
member would not be able to address an issue about which he is likely
to be knowledgeable. Instead, local people may face delay and
frustration for a further referral elsewhere and a lack of cohesion in
local service delivery.
<p><a name="061010126000155"></a>Involving county council members would
instantly strengthen local democratic arrangements and enable a
read-across to the functions of larger service providers and partners
such as the police. By excluding county councils, we are excluding
local representatives for 80 per cent of England. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="061010126000156"></a><a name="spnew_65"></a><b><a name="061010126000750"></a>Lord
Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> My Lords, Amendments
Nos. 68, 70 and 73, which complete the selection initiated by my noble
friend Lord Bridgeman, seek to apply the requirements of Clause 18 for
local authorities to set up oversight and scrutiny committees for crime
and disorder matters and what we have learnt to call the
&#147;community call for action&#148; to the particular
circumstances of the City of London.</p><p><a name="061010126000157"></a>It will be no surprise to your Lordships
to learn that specific provision is needed. &#147;Unique&#148; is
an overused description; I know, however, from having had the honour to
represent the City for 24 years before entering your Lordships'
House&#151;which made me the third longest serving MP for the City
since 1283&#151;that the City can genuinely be described as a class
of one. I am conscious that your Lordships' House is anxious to proceed
to more contentious matters, but the uniqueness of the City of London,
in more senses than one, confers certain complications, which I need to
explain and hope to resolve.</p><p><a name="061010126000158"></a>I
do not presume to offer your Lordships a magnum opus on the
City&#146;s constitution, but it is worth recording that the City is
a corporation by prescription and not a creation of Parliament. Within
the City of London, one of the three executives of the City
Corporation, namely the Common Council, has, however, been given the
functions conferred elsewhere on the statutory local authorities since
their creation as part of the 19th century reforms for local
government. It is appropriate to mention, because it has particular
relevance to the need for these amendments, that the City&#146;s
internal structure bears little relation to that of a local authority.
It is also worth noting, bearing in mind that the subject matter is
crime and disorder, that the City itself incorporates the functions of
a police authority.</p>



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_138"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061010126000159"></a>These features are important because when
what is now Clause 18 was inserted in Committee in another place to
capture councils not operating the new style executive arrangements,
with which those of your Lordships with experience of local government
will be familiar, the then Police Minister, Ms Hazel Blears, noted that
the clause was intended to be all-encompassing as an alternative to
seeking,</p><ul><a name="061010126000280"></a>&#147;lengthy
drafting amendments to the Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report,
</I>Commons Standing Committee D, 23/3/06; col. 204.]</ul><a name="061010126000255"></a>Inherent in the intention appears to
have been the assumption that the local authorities to which the clause
was to apply would have an overview and scrutiny committee which the
clause would complement. That was a reasonable assumption for local
authorities in general because even where a local authority has not
adopted the new executive arrangements, which most are required to do
under the Local Government Act 2000, regulations still require those
authorities to establish an overview and scrutiny
committee. <p><a name="061010126000160"></a>That is not,
however, the case for the City of London. Unlike local authorities, the
City does not have an oversight and scrutiny committee. Oversight and
scrutiny functions are applied by the Common Council itself, and
through its committees and sub-committees. There is therefore no
existing structure to which the requirement in Clause 18 can relate. A
practical consequence of applying the clause would be to require the
City to reform its existing committee structure and its membership. It
would require the creation of another committee to scrutinise crime and
disorder matters, which are overseen also by several other committees,
including the committee overseeing the police functions. It would
result in confusion and duplication of functions between committees,
and would certainly not enhance the efficiency of oversight and
scrutiny of crime and disorder
issues.</p><p><a name="061010126000161"></a>As for the detail, I
shall concentrate on Amendment No. 73. Amendment No. 68 to Clause 18
and Amendment No. 70 to Schedule 6 are consequential. The object of
Amendment No. 73 is to achieve the scrutiny and accountability
requirements anticipated by Clause 18, without requiring the creation
of additional, unhelpful administrative machinery.</p><p><a name="061010126000162"></a>Subsection (1) would confer on the
Common Council the powers of oversight and scrutiny conferred by Clause
18(1), but without requiring the City to set up a new committee. These
powers would be exercised through the Common Council's existing
administrative structure. Subsections (2) and (4) would apply the
requirements of transparency contained in Clause 18(2) and
(7).</p><p><a name="061010126000163"></a>Subsection (3) would apply
the requirements of Clause 18(3) in respect of members of local
authorities to the members of the Common Council. Subsection (5) would
impose the same obligations for follow-up action on crime and disorder
matters as those imposed by Clause
18(8).</p><p><a name="061010126000164"></a>Subsection (6) applies
the provisions of Clause 19, dealing with guidance and regulations
issued by the Secretary of State, but subject to any modifications 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_139"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>necessary to deal with the City's administrative structure. Subsections
(7) and (8) set out the
definitions.</p><p><a name="061010126000165"></a>The new clause
admittedly extends the text of the Bill by a few lines, but the need to
provide for the City's particular circumstances is not unusual. It is
perhaps worth noting that, in relation to oversight and scrutiny in
health service matters, specific provision was made to deal with the
City through Section 10 of the Health and Social Care Act
2001.</p><p><a name="061010126000166"></a>I understand that these
amendments have emerged following productive discussions between the
City and Home Office officials, which I take this opportunity to
acknowledge. I hope that the Minister will feel the amendments to be a
reasonable way to approach the application of Clause 18 to the
City.</p><p><a name="061010126000167"></a><a name="spnew_66"></a><b><a name="061010126000751"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, there are two
distinct sets of amendments here, which I shall deal with in turn. I
turn first to the amendment moved by the noble Viscount, Lord
Bridgeman, with his customary courtesy. I know that he will not be
terribly happy with my response, but I trust that he will not take it
as a slight&#151;it is certainly not intended as a slight in any
sense on county councils or their network.</p><p><a name="061010126000168"></a>The purpose of the community call for
action is to enable a person to raise community safety issues of local
concern with local councillors. In a two-tier area, this simply should
be a district councillor responsibility. My view today is the same as
it was in Committee; that is, to do otherwise would lead to public
confusion, as a person could raise their concerns with county and
district councillors.</p><p><a name="061010126000169"></a>It needs
to be recorded that the community call for action is designed to enable
the public to engage with local issues of an essentially operational
nature. These issues are best handled at the district level. To extend
the definition of &#147;local authority&#148; for the purposes of
this legislation to include county councils could also bring strategic
issues within the ambit of the community call for action, which has
never been our intention&#151;nor is it the intention of the draft
legislation.</p><p><a name="061010126000170"></a>Of course, that
does not rule out county council involvement. County councils will have
a very important role. If the issue raised by the community call for
action relates to matters within the sphere of the county council, it
would be reasonable and proper to expect the district councillor to
whom the matter was referred to discuss the issue with the local county
councillor or the county council itself. Furthermore, I would also
expect a county councillor to be co-opted on to the district council
overview and scrutiny committee so that their views of county
councillors can be fully taken into consideration in any committee
report.</p><h5><a name="061010126000320"></a>4.30
pm</h5><p><a name="061010126000171"></a>Given the assurance that the
county council voice will have the scope to be heard, I hope that the
noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw his amendment. County
councils will be well looked after in these 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_140"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arrangements and their constructive role will be brought within the
ambit through the route that I
described.</p><p><a name="061010126000172"></a>I now turn to the
issues quite properly raised by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton
Mandeville. I have good news for him, because not only do I fully
appreciate the points that he made about the committee structure that
already exists in the City of London, but it is certainly not the
Government&#146;s intention to require the corporation to create a
new scrutiny committee that cuts across existing arrangements. We are
more than happy to accept these amendments, in principle.</p><p><a name="061010126000173"></a>The important point is that the crime
and disorder reduction partnership in the City should be subject to
appropriate scrutiny as with such partnerships elsewhere, and that
there is an appropriate committee that can consider the community call
for action. I am sure that the noble Lord will appreciate that. It is
not an expression of arrogance on our part, but we would like to offer
our own draft of the noble Lord&#146;s amendments and get the
parliamentary draftsmen to look at the drafting of a suitable
amendment. If the noble Lord is happy not to press his amendments to a
Division&#151;he has already conceded that they are defective in
part&#151;we will happily bring forward our own at Third Reading and
perhaps even table them jointly with the noble
Lord.</p><p><a name="061010126000174"></a>So I can offer some
comfort to the noble Viscount and a great deal more comfort to the
noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton
Mandeville.</p><p><a name="061010126000175"></a><a name="spnew_67"></a><b><a name="061010126000752"></a>Viscount
Bridgeman:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the
Minister for attempting to reassure me about the county councils, but
there is a big difference between discretionary involvement of county
councils and statutory involvement. However, I shall read the
Minister&#146;s remarks carefully in <I>Hansard</I>. In the mean
time, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="061010126000176"></a>Amendment, by leave,

House we all know that the Home Office is in the vanguard of
progressive government thinking and that the way in which government
operate is totally seamless, that different government departments talk
to each other and that proposals emerge having been considered by all
the relevant parts of government and parts of the government machine.
That is the normal process, but I have the suspicion that on this
occasion that process was perhaps not as perfect as would normally be
the case and that the vanguardism of the Home Office 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_141"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has gone away at a slight tangent from some of the other thinking that I
understand is going in the
Government.</p><p><a name="061010126000181"></a>We have been
waiting for some while for a White Paper on the future of local
government, and it may have been that we would have had that White
Paper in advance of our detailed consideration of these clauses if
things had gone according to plan. However, that has not yet happened,
although one understands that the White Paper is imminent. I am told
that drafts of it may exist and may shortly be considered by the
Cabinet.</p><p><a name="061010126000182"></a>Perhaps we are being
slightly premature in bringing forward changes in the way crime and
disorder reduction partnerships, scrutiny committees and co-options
work, in advance of knowing with clarity what the Government will be
proposing more generally for the future of local government. For
example, we have just heard some points being raised about the position
of county councils and the Corporation of London. It may be that those
matters are dealt with effectively as part of the forthcoming White
Paper.</p><p><a name="061010126000183"></a>I assume&#151;because
it would be very surprising if a White Paper on the future of local
government did not consider such matters&#151;that we will be looking
at the function and role of the local elected representative. Implicit
in these clauses is the new community call for action. I think this
could be a useful step forward, in terms of giving a new explicit role
to local councillors as advocates for their local communities, working
with communities to move along public services.</p><p><a name="061010126000184"></a>If that is to be the case, however, and
if the stories that are emanating about what may or may not be in the
White Paper are true and similar community calls for action are to
apply to other aspects of public services, we need to see whether the
arrangements proposed in this Bill for the way crime and disorder
matters will be treated can be read across effectively into the other
areas of public services that might be affected by similar powers.
Perhaps the Government are being premature. It may be that in a
week&#146;s time the Minister will be able to stand up and tell us
what will be in the local government White Paper, but my understanding
is that it is unlikely that will happen in the next few days.</p><p><a name="061010126000185"></a>Given that the purpose of the White
Paper, we are told, is that there may be substantial legislation on the
future of local government and its precise internal arrangements in the
next Parliamentary Session&#151;although obviously we cannot prejudge
what might be in the Queen&#146;s Speech&#151;it would surely be
sensible to round up all these provisions as part of that at the same
time. For example, there are some provisions in these clauses for
co-options, and apparently there will be regulations to specify what
those might be. At various times noises have emerged from the Home
Office suggesting that police authorities should have a co-opted place
on overview and scrutiny committees dealing with crime and disorder
matters in the various local authorities in their area. Passing over
for a moment the workload implications of that for police authority
members, you then have to consider the 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_142"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relative status of a co-opted member of a police authority&#151;or,
for that matter, a co-opted county councillor sitting on a district
council overview and scrutiny committee. What will be the relative
status of those individuals compared with the sitting members of that
principal council&#146;s role in terms of overview and scrutiny? Are
you not diluting the representative, community advocacy role that we
understand the Government want to create as part of the local
government White Paper?</p><p><a name="061010126000186"></a>Those
matters have to be thought through very carefully. No doubt there are
officials in government departments who have had towels around their
heads and considered all these matters, and are coming forward with
proposals of an intellectual clarity and brilliance that we will all
wonder at when we hear them. In advance of seeing those proposals,
however, it seems strange to set up a process that involves unspecified
co-options with unspecified status. It is unclear where they will fit
in.</p><p><a name="061010126000187"></a>We have here some
convoluted, rather obtuse wording that does not work well. It is trying
to fit square pegs into round holes, and they do not really fit. It is
hard to see how the clauses will operate. There will clearly have to be
reams of regulations afterwards to try and turn them into something
that will work at an operational level. In the interests of trying to
help the Government out and avoid a situation where we legislate in the
next Session to unpick bits of this Bill because the prevailing
thinking on local government has moved on in that time, would it not be
better for the Government to wrap all this up together, to think again
and not to press these clauses at this time? I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="061010126000188"></a><a name="spnew_69"></a><b><a name="_spnew31"></a><a name="061010126000754"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, the proposals
coming out of the CDA review, as encapsulated by this Bill, are
looking, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, has so eloquently
put it, more unworkable and more and more resource intensive. The
wording on how CDRPs will function is just plain confusing. It tries to
articulate a split between the levels of the CDRP that will set
strategy and the levels that will deliver on this strategy. But because
of the reluctance of the Government to commit anything to primary
legislation, in the name of flexibility, this has been left so vague it
is obtuse.</p><p><a name="061010126000189"></a>The Community Call
for Action is intended to be a mechanism of last resort, but how can we
be sure that it will not be a mechanism of first resort unless
safeguards against this are placed in primary legislation? And if not
there, then how are safeguards to be managed and guaranteed? How do we
know that overview and scrutiny committees will not be overwhelmed by
matters referred to them, whether genuine or motivated by political
skulduggery, extremist agendas, single issue obsessions or just plain
nuisance value? How will these committees be trained, resourced and
supported if there are to be many hundreds of them at district level as
is proposed? Who pays&#151;and does this represent value for
money?</p><p><a name="061010126000190"></a>Police authorities
will also have a particular problem, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris,
has pointed out. Most 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_143"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consist of only 17 members, but they must find members to sit on all the
strategic level CDRPs in their area and different members to sit on all
the overview and scrutiny committees that will link to the CDRPs in
their area. A case study that the Association of Police Authorities has
supplied to me illustrates what would happen in Surrey. It
states:</p><ul><a name="061010126000268"></a>&#147;There are
currently 11 CDRPs in the county area discharging funds of
approximately &#163;2.5m. If the proposals for a
strategic/operational split are taken forward each partnership would be
overseen by a group at member level, whilst operational delivery would
continue through groups similar to [those] currently in existence. The
result would be to introduce an additional 11 groups to the structure
of governance for community safety in the
county.</ul><ul><a name="061010126000269"></a>There is also a
recommendation that these bodies co-operate at a county level to ensure
that the relevant LAA targets are delivered. It is therefore likely
that at least one further group will be introduced to provide that
co-ordinating role.</ul><ul><a name="061010126000270"></a>Each
local authority would then have an oversight and scrutiny committee
responsible for community safety. In the case of Surrey there would
therefore be 12 such committees. The county council already has a
dedicated oversight and scrutiny committee, but at district level most
currently operate only loose scrutiny arrangements that would require
new structures to meet the requirements of the review. As a result a
further 11 groups would be introduced to oversee community safety in
the county.</ul><ul><a name="061010126000271"></a>These committees
would be responsible for considering applications under the
&#145;Community Call for Action&#146; provisions and, if necessary,
triggering action. When considering applications the committee would be
obliged to involve representatives from each of the responsible
authorities.</ul><ul><a name="061010126000272"></a>The majority of
funding to support community safety within the county is provided
through the individual agencies, each having their own governance
structure. The police are accountable through the chief constable to
the police authority for their contribution. Local authorities are
accountable through the portfolio holder to the Executive and to the
full council for their contributions. Similar arrangements are in place
for all other
partners.</ul><ul><a name="061010126000273"></a>Furthermore, a
number of issues being addressed by the CDRPs, e.g. domestic violence,
require input from other partners in the wider criminal justice system
and third sector requiring different governance and accountability
arrangements&#148;.</ul><p><a name="061010126000191"></a>Police
authorities must have a seat on these committees if police
accountability in delivering the community safety strategy is to be
meaningful. It would seem to leave room for a lead role for local
authorities in setting community safety strategies. On the surface,
that seems like a noble and democratic aim, but it is likely to erode
the accountability of the police to police authorities, and that would
not be helpful. Local councils and local councillors have a vitally
important role to play as advocates and voices for their communities,
but that leaves room for confused accountabilities, with BCU commanders
pulled in many directions by many different interests. On top of all
this confusion, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris, has reminded us, a
White Paper is shortly to come out dealing with reforming local
authorities; yet the provisions of this part of the Bill are
substantially about local authorities. We really do need to wait and
see what the White Paper has to say on this, or we will be back
amending this Bill by the time the ink is barely dry on its
cover.</p>

Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> My Lords, my speech
on this occasion will be much shorter than my last, but it provides me
with an opportunity to thank the Minister for the nature of his
response to my earlier amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, made a
sympathetic reference to the dilemmas of the Corporation of London. I,
too, feel profoundly sympathetic to the points that he powerfully
argued at this juncture. Your Lordships&#146; House is in his debt
for having done
so.</p><p><a name="061010126000193"></a><a name="spnew_71"></a><b><a name="061010126000756"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I have listened
with some care to the comments that have been made in your
Lordships&#146; House this afternoon, and I shall attempt to reflect
on those as the Bill proceeds. I was amused to be described by
extension as a <I>vanguardista</I> by the noble Lord, Lord Harris. It
is well past my student years since that description was bandied around
in a rather heated debate about something that seemed terribly
important at the time. I appreciate the spirit in which the noble Lord
approached his amendment. Some important points have emerged in the
debate, but in the end I return to the position that we as a Government
would find the amendment pretty much impossible to accept, although
some of the issues raised are clearly very important.</p><p><a name="061010126000194"></a>It is worth saying that the partnership
landscape, which noble Lords have discussed at several points during
debates on this Bill, has moved on and changed substantially since the
crime and disorder reduction partnerships, which are also known as
community safety partnerships in some parts of the country, were
officially created in 1998 by the Crime and Disorder Act. There is
common agreement that they have played an important part in helping to
achieve significant reductions in crime across England and Wales. We
need to build on that success story by ensuring that the partnerships
are as effective as they can be in reducing crime&#151;there is a
commonality of view that that is right&#151;and in particular in
dealing with crime and disorder, misuse of drugs, alcohol and other
substances and anti-social behaviour. We have moved on, and there is
much more of a consensus around those issues.</p><p><a name="061010126000195"></a>It is common knowledge
too that the Home Office undertook a review of the partnership
provisions of the 1998 Act in collaboration with key stakeholders,
including ACPO, the Association of Police Authorities, and the Local
Government Association. The findings of that review informed the
provisions in the Bill which these amendments now seek to remove. The
provisions in the Bill will ensure that key tools and good practice
examples, such as effective information-sharing and intelligence-led
interventions, are used to optimum effect by all partners. The
provisions in the Bill allow for the Secretary of State to issue
regulations to define how these proposals will be implemented by the
crime and disorder reduction partnerships. The provisions are there to
provide the flexibility to which the noble Baroness, Lady Harris,
referred.</p><p><a name="061010126000196"></a>I
understand some of the concerns raised by my noble friend about the
implementation of some of these measures and I heard his ironic
comments about 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_145"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the apparent seamlessness of Whitehall and, in particular, the role of
the Home Office. I know that he would like to have seen some of the
proposals as set out in the Crime and Disorder Act review made in
primary legislation. For good reasons, we think that the detail should
be left to regulation and guidance, and that will provide us with an
opportunity to reflect further and to have more discussions and
debate.</p><p><a name="061010126000197"></a>We do not underestimate
the importance of ensuring that any such secondary legislation is fully
informed by practitioner expertise and the involvement of partners. For
that reason, we have gone out of our way to conduct extensive
consultations on the detail, with more than 1,000 practitioners across
England and Wales, and we will continue to work with stakeholders as we
develop the proposals for
implementation.</p><p><a name="061010126000198"></a>The amendment
seeks to remove wholesale the provisions aimed at improving
accountability arrangements for local community safety bodies by
extending the remit of overview and scrutiny committees, requiring them
to review and scrutinise the functions of crime and disorder reduction
partnerships. These provisions also provide for the introduction of the
community call for action. This will enable local communities to seek
answers from the police, local authorities and their partners where
they have failed to deal effectively with a community safety problem in
their area. The provisions also give ward councillors new powers and
duties to act on behalf of their communities to seek a resolution to
those problems. This package of measures gives communities an
opportunity to have both a voice and a role in community
safety.</p><p><a name="061010126000199"></a>A number of councils
have already undertaken reviews of crime and disorder which have
changed the way that services are delivered, with tangible benefits for
local people. Overview and scrutiny committees are in a strong position
to tackle complex and cross-cutting issues and support partnership
working as well as to assist in driving up performance. We want this
approach to become standard practice for community
safety.</p><p><a name="061010126000200"></a>Together these
provisions form a package of measures that will enable crime and
disorder reduction partnerships to continue to deliver positive
community safety outcomes as well as become more visible and answerable
to local communities and local politicians, who are well placed to
ensure that they are well served. We reject the noble Lord&#146;s
amendments for those
reasons.</p><p><a name="061010126000201"></a>These
measures have not been put together in isolation. We are fully
cognisant of developments in other parts of Government. We have been
working closely with the Department for Communities and Local
Government in implementing Crime and Disorder Act review measures, and
the White Paper will complement that work. Rather than stall an
important process that needs momentum and development, it is important
to put in place, at least in outline, measures that will strengthen
crime and disorder reduction partnerships and take forward work which
has been widely acknowledged successful. I
understand the concerns raised by the

continue on those issues, but I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his
amendments.</p><p><a name="061010126000202"></a><a name="spnew_72"></a><b><a name="061010126000757"></a>Lord
Harris of Haringey:</b> My Lords, I am enormously
grateful to my noble friend for his thoughtful response and I am
pleased to hear that I have reminded him of his lost youth&#151;that
was entirely coincidental. I am also grateful for the support that my
amendment has received from various corners of this
House.</p><p><a name="061010126000203"></a>My noble friend said
that the process of making regulations provided an opportunity for
further reflection. I take that as an acceptance of my point that
considerable further reflection is required. Although I understand the
Government&#146;s desire to move forward by putting this framework
into legislation so that the regulations can follow, it might be better
to reflect earlier rather than later on precisely how this might
work.</p><p><a name="061010126000204"></a>I am absolutely
committed to the idea of crime and disorder reduction partnerships,
with local government, the police service and all the other relevant
agencies combining on these matters. But we know that the White Paper
on local government will take a fundamental look at how partnership
working operates in all matters of interest to the future of particular
localities. I am also committed, as I think my noble friend is, to the
important role of individual elected councillors as community
advocates. But, again, the White Paper will, we understand, extend and
look at that in all sorts of other areas.</p><p><a name="061010126000205"></a>I am attracted to the idea of the
community call for action and interested in how that might operate but,
given how it will interact with overview and scrutiny committees, we
would benefit from knowing precisely what the overall package will be.
I digress for a second by saying that we understand that there are also
to be major changes in the network of patients&#146; forums, to
create what I think will be called local involvement networks, which
will work to local authority overview and scrutiny committees. There
will be changes as a consequence of that. These changes will graft all
sorts of material on to the work of overview and scrutiny committees,
so we are trying to legislate on something that is moving
rapidly.</p><p><a name="061010126000206"></a>My noble friend said
that he planned that reflection should take place between the enactment
of the Bill and the introduction of regulations, but I hope that that
can be brought forward. I hope that the Government will consider over
the next few days whether it would perhaps be better to revise these
clauses dramatically, or even withdraw them, given the forthcoming
White Paper. In the next few days, the Government may internally be
clearer about their direction that they are following for local
government. If that view diverges from what is being presented to us
today, it is important that we are not faced with having these clauses
on the statute book. However, given my noble friend&#146;s offer to
reflect further on these matters, albeit at the wrong stage&#151;I
hope that he will take my encouragement to reflect further now as
opposed to after the Bill has been enacted&#151;I beg leave to
withdraw the amendment.</p><p><a name="061010126000207"></a>Amendment, by leave,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House,
I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right
honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence. The Statement is
as follows:</p>&#147;With
permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about our
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
&#147;I should like to start by
expressing my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the
brave servicemen who have lost their lives since I last spoke to the
House on 24 July. Five soldiers have died on operations in Iraq, all
killed in action. Twenty-seven personnel from all three services have
died in Afghanistan, 11 of them killed in action, and 16 have been lost
in other incidents, including those killed in the RAF Nimrod crash on 2
September. Others have been wounded, and our thoughts should be with
them also.&#147;Let me
turn first to Iraq. The House will be aware of the escalation of
sectarian violence in recent months, particularly in and around
Baghdad. The combined Iraqi and American Baghdad security plan, which I
was briefed on in Baghdad in August, just before it began, is a major
initiative aimed at improving security for all the communities in the
city. The security element is closely followed by co-ordinated projects
to improve basic services, backed by $400 million of funding. In those
areas that have so far been cleared of terrorists and sectarian gangs,
with 1,700 weapons seized, citizens are reporting better security and
are starting to see improvements in their daily
lives.&#147;That said,
however, the overall level of violence across the city, including
sectarian killings, remains unacceptable. There was further evidence of
this today. But the plan is still in its early stages and there is
impressive commitment from American, coalition and Iraqi
forces. 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_148"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;In the UK&#146;s area of
operation in south-east Iraq, the biggest challenges lie in Basra city.
Two weeks ago, Iraqi and UK forces began a large-scale operation moving
through the city sector by sector, strengthening security and improving
basic services. One important element of the operation is a renewed
effort to improve the capacity of the Iraqi police and to address
infiltration by militias. The operation also includes clean-up
projects, agriculture projects and projects to improve basic services,
including bringing clean drinking water to a part of the city which has
never had it
before.&#147;Elsewhere in
the south-east, in September Dhi Qar became the second province to be
handed over to the Iraqi authorities, following Al Muthanna in July. We
should congratulate the Iraqis on this achievement and also our
international
partners.&#147;In terms of
future planning for the UK in Iraq, I can confirm that the force
package for the next routine roulement in November, in which 19 Light
Brigade takes over from 20 Armoured Brigade, is essentially that which
I outlined in my announcement to the House on 18 July. I should also
draw the House&#146;s attention to my Written Statement on 11
September, which confirmed a temporary deployment of 360 troops,
including specialists such as engineers to help to deliver the Basra
projects I described earlier, and elements of the Theatre Reserve
Battalion to provide support during the roulement period. Excluding the
temporary deployment, this will leave our force level in Iraq at
approximately
7,100.&#147;We should be
in no doubt that this is a decisive period in the future of Iraq. There
is much debate here in Britain, in America and of course in Iraq about
the best way forward. But all agree that military means alone will not
be decisive. This is especially true now, when it is clear that
sectarianism and the struggle for power have emerged as a major threat
to Iraq&#146;s security. What is required above all is a political
solution. That must include a genuine effort at national
reconciliation, drawing all Iraq&#146;s communities into a political
process and away from violence. Prime Minister Maliki and his
Government are trying to deliver this. We and our coalition partners
must do all we can to support them and strengthen their
resolve&#151;so, too, must the international community as a whole,
and Iraq&#146;s near neighbours in
particular.&#147;Let
me now turn to Afghanistan. The achievements and losses of our forces
in Helmand province rightly have been the focus of our attention in the
past two months. The work our forces are doing there is difficult,
dangerous and exhausting. I salute them&#151;particularly the men and
women of 16 Air Assault Brigade, who are coming home having been
relieved by 3 Commando. I shall be visiting them tomorrow to thank them
in person but today, on behalf of the whole House, I should like
formally to record our recognition of the bravery, professionalism and
sacrifice of this brigade and all those from across the three services
who supported them during this tour. 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_149"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;On the fifth anniversary of our
intervention in Afghanistan, we should reflect on the progress our
efforts have brought about: 2,000 schools built; 5 million
children in school, one-third of them girls; more than 70 new hospitals
and clinics; 4.5 million refugees returning home. This is not
a failing
mission.&#147;NATO, in the
shape of the ISAF force, and under the leadership of General Richards,
now has responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan. But as we know,
the summer has seen fierce fighting. As I made clear in a speech last
month, the persistence of the Taliban was greater than we expected.
Such is the nature of operations: the enemy always has a vote and we
have adapted. But let me repeat, the force package we deployed, and
which we have strengthened further over the summer, was designed to
deal with violent resistance, and in every encounter with the Taliban
our forces have defeated it. Moreover, by attacking us directly, the
Taliban has taken heavy losses, both in northern Helmand and against
the Canadians in Kandahar. We have sent a clear message that we will
not be beaten in combat, a message not lost on the local population.
This has strengthened the position of local leaders, some of whom are
now pursuing peaceful negotiations with our commanders and with the
Afghan Government.
&#147;In Afghanistan we have reached
a key point in the campaign. On Sunday I spoke to General Richards and
he described the situation as a window of opportunity. If we can build
upon the blow we have delivered to the Taliban, if we can quickly
deliver real, concrete changes to the lives of ordinary Afghans through
development and reconstruction, then we can begin to generate the
lasting support the Government need.
&#147;So we are moving forward, but
consistently I have made clear the challenges we still face. The
assumption of complete military command for Afghanistan is a
significant achievement for NATO, but also a significant test. There
are still shortfalls in the planned force structure. Caveats on the use
of some forces remain. I have been in frequent, often daily discussions
with the secretary-general and fellow defence ministers to reinforce
the message that as an alliance we must live up to our commitment to
Afghanistan, sharing the burden and the risks. I ensured this subject
was top of the agenda at the NATO summit in Slovenia two weeks ago and
I will continue to press for urgent action. We have made some progress;
some caveats are lifting. The Poles have confirmed they will provide a
battalion, and the Canadians plan to put further troops into the south.
Importantly, General Richards judges he has the forces to maintain the
relatively stable security situation that now exists. But I will
continue to push for his requirements to be met in full as a matter of
urgency.
&#147;In Helmand,
the UK Task Force also faces challenges. The battles we have fought in
the north of the province have brought us to the relative stability we
have seen in recent weeks. Taliban 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_150"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>activity is down, and engagement with local leaders is growing. But we
must capitalise quickly with progress on reconstruction. We are
rebalancing our forces, taking advantage of the steady improvement in
the Afghan army and police to concentrate our forces on the central
area surrounding the provincial capital Lashkar Gah. This should
increase the scope for other government departments to act in safety,
and should also increase the confidence of local enterprises and
international NGOs to begin the reconstruction that is at the core of
our strategy.&#147;Back in
the UK, the main challenge for me, my department and the joint
headquarters and chiefs is to give our troops the resources they need
to get the job done. This is a relentless task, but we are rising to
it. We have now almost completely deployed the reinforcements I
described to the House on 10 July, with the last few elements due in to
Afghanistan in the next few weeks. That includes: two more Chinook
helicopters and more flying hours for helicopters across the fleet,
more capacity to train the Afghan National Army, engineers to take
forward development, and more infantry. On 24 July, I announced a new
package for protected vehicles for both Afghanistan and Iraq, including
100 new Mastiff and 100 additional Vector, funded by new money from the
Treasury. We continue to invest heavily in force protection, including
countermeasures to protect vehicles against attack, defensive aids for
aircraft and personal body armour. I believe we have shown we can be
responsive to the requests of commanders and we will continue to be
so.&#147;Of course,
support for our troops is not just about numbers of people and
equipment; it is also about pay, conditions, welfare and medical care.
In all these areas we are constantly reviewing what more is needed, and
for some weeks now I have specifically been looking at pay levels for
forces on
operations.&#147;Our
forces are some of the best paid in the world. Only Canada pays more
across the ranks. But forces from other countries do not pay tax when
on operations, and this has led some to demand that we do the same for
our people. I think we can do
better.&#147;I am pleased
to announce today that we intend to introduce a new, tax-free,
flat-rate, operational bonus, which, for a six-month tour, would amount
to &#163;2,240. For an average private or lance corporal, this is
equivalent to the amount of tax they would pay during a six-month tour.
It means that half our people on operations will be better off than
under a tax exemption, increasingly so for the lower paid. The most
junior will be over &#163;500 better off after a six-month tour than
if we had simply exempted them from tax. As importantly, everyone on
operations will be equally better off than they are now, by just under
&#163;100 per week, free of
tax.&#147;I would like to
thank my right honourable friend the Chancellor for making over
&#163;60 million of new money available so we can fund this new
bonus, without taking any existing defence funding away from front-line
needs. 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_151"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;This is a complex area. I have
been looking at these questions for weeks, but I can assure the House
that the troops who have been fighting in Afghanistan over the summer
will not lose out. The payment will be backdated to 1 April 2006, as an
adjustment to pay arrangements in the current financial year. Full
details of eligibility will be made public shortly but I can confirm
that, besides Afghanistan, it will apply to our forces in Iraq and the
Balkans.&#147;Let me
finally deal with the issue of medical care for those injured on
operations. First, I want to challenge the notion that the current
system is in any way inferior to what went before. In particular, the
relentless attack on the work of the outstanding medical staff,
military and civilian, at Selly Oak Hospital is unfair and misplaced. I
have been there twice in recent months. It is one of the highest
performing and most successful hospital trusts in the NHS and provides
major specialist centres for trauma, burns, plastic surgery and
neuroscience.&#147;Our
primary concern is to give our injured people the best medical care
available. This is to be found inside the NHS. While some have been
calling in public for a return to military hospitals, we have been
quietly getting on with the job of establishing a military-managed ward
at Selly Oak in partnership with the NHS. I can confirm that this will
be operational before the end of the
year.&#147;I have been
open about the nature of the challenges we face in our operational
theatres. I do not seek to hide from this House the difficulties we
face in overcoming them, but I am convinced our strategy remains the
right one.&#147;In
Afghanistan, we have to tackle the south and the east if we are to
secure what has already been achieved in the rest of the country. We
have to make the comprehensive approach work, with all government
departments acting together to achieve our objectives. We have to get
NATO to live up to its
commitments.&#147;In Iraq,
we have to support the Iraqi Government, their army and police in
taking responsibility for their own security and holding the line
against sectarian infighting. We will do all these things; we cannot
afford not to.&#147;I have
spoken many times about the debt we owe to the men and women who serve
in our Armed Forces and who carry out this hard and dangerous work on
our behalf. I am sure the House will join me in paying tribute to them
again today&#148;.<p><a name="061010126000218"></a>My Lords,
that concludes the
Statement.</p><h5><a name="061010126000323"></a>5.15

Astor of Hever:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for repeating the Statement. We on these Benches also express our
condolences to the families of those troops killed in Iraq and
Afghanistan during this long, hot and difficult summer. Our thoughts
are also with those who have been wounded, some very 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_152"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seriously, and their families. We also pay tribute to those servicemen
and servicewomen serving now in Iraq and Afghanistan, those who have
served there and those who will be taking their turn for a tour of
duty. It is vital that we do everything possible to look after the
families of those on active
service.</p><p><a name="061010126000220"></a>My immediate personal
reaction to the wording of the Statement is that it is complacent to
the point of being misleading and that it further discloses an
inability by the Government to grasp what needs to be done, what should
have been done and what must be done now. There is a growing sense that
Ministers, in their public utterances, are living in an unreal world,
quite different from that in which our troops on the ground are
fighting and being killed.</p><p><a name="061010126000221"></a>In
Afghanistan, we now find ourselves with a conflict out of all
proportion to that promised by Ministers. Troops have been engaged in
the hardest sustained fighting since the Second World War with a steady
stream of casualties sustained in close-quarter battle, with many
instances of real heroism. In these circumstances, our servicemen and
servicewomen have a right to expect only the best treatment before,
during and after combat.</p><p><a name="061010126000222"></a>It is
the job of a responsible Opposition to scrutinise the
Government&#146;s conduct of these operations. We owe that to the
soldiers out there. While we have always supported the
Government&#146;s aims&#151;it is essential that we do not allow
either country to become a breeding ground for terrorism&#151;we have
always held and expressed reservations over their actions. We have
constantly maintained that, so far as Afghanistan is concerned, the
Government were all the time basing their predictions on the best
possible scenario.</p><p><a name="061010126000223"></a>The Prime
Minister went on the record on Saturday to say that whatever our forces
needed for Afghanistan would be found and supplied. Splendid. But how
does this Statement point to specific actions to give effect to that
promise?</p><p><a name="061010126000224"></a>The
Government&#146;s decision in 2004 to cut the size of the Army has
now been exposed as a serious misjudgement, jeopardising both the
morale and the safety of our troops. The number of soldiers dismissed
from the Army for going absent without leave has nearly doubled since
the start of the Iraq war. The Government are putting the lives of our
Armed Forces even more at risk with ageing or inadequate equipment.
There is an alarming shortage both of equipment&#151;for example,
helicopters in Afghanistan&#151;and of personnel. We cannot persist
with a situation where the Army is waging extended campaigns while
relying heavily on the Reserve Forces to plug the
shortfall.</p><p><a name="061010126000225"></a>One of the most
striking features of both campaigns is how public confidence has been
lost. There is a widespread belief that we are not being told the scale
of the human cost of the conflict. We need to be honest with the
public, as the US Government have been. The number of casualties is far
too low for the number of fatalities, whether judged by a typical ratio
of fatalities to casualties or by the discrepancy with US casualty
figures, where there are eight times as many casualties as fatalities.
That makes the figures 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_153"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>simply not credible. Can the Minister tell the House how many casualties
have been sustained in Afghanistan and can he give the House a
definition of
&#147;casualty&#148;?</p><p><a name="061010126000226"></a>Finally,
we welcome the Statement&#146;s objective: to give our injured
servicemen and women the best medical care available. That will always
be with the NHS. But wounded soldiers have been let down by a failure
of &#147;bedside&#148; rather than &#147;clinical&#148; care.
What are the Government planning to do to put that right&#151;in
particular, to provide more secure military wards manned by service
nurses?</p><h5><a name="061010126000324"></a>5.20
pm</h5><p><a name="061010126000227"></a><a name="spnew_76"></a><b><a name="061010126000761"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for
repeating in your Lordships' House the Defence Secretary&#146;s
Statement. From these Benches, we join in paying tribute to our brave
men and women in the Armed Forces serving under very difficult and
challenging
circumstances.</p><p><a name="061010126000228"></a>Looking first at
the Statement&#146;s reference to Iraq and Afghanistan, I again
regret that we are having to respond to developments in those two
difficult and important operations through the process of a Statement
rather than full debates, as we should have. On Iraq, there is much
optimism in the Statement but no assessment of why things have been
going so badly. Are the Iraqi people really, as it says,
seeing,</p><ul><a name="061010126000281"></a>&#147;improvements in their daily
lives&#148;</ul><a name="061010126000256"></a>when they
now die violently at the rate of about 100 per day? Does the Minister
agree with the assessment of his colleague, Jack Straw, that the
situation is &#147;dire&#148;? Does he agree with the US Marine
Corps Colonel Devlin&#146;s intelligence assessment sent to the
Pentagon about al-Anbar province, in which he said that there were no
functioning central Iraqi government institutions in the province and
that local governments were under the &#147;control of the
insurgents&#148;?<p><a name="061010126000229"></a>In our
area of responsibility, can the Minister tell us in more detail what
has been the trend in the security situation? The Statement refers to
the handing over of responsibility in two areas. How has al-Muthanna
province been in terms of violence and governance since our withdrawal
in June? In Basra, what progress has been made in the difficult
relationships with the local
police?</p><p><a name="061010126000230"></a>Most importantly, what
is our strategy for the future of Iraq? The Statement talks about there
being much debate about the way forward. Are the British Government
involved in the work of the US envoy James Baker? What does the
Minister feel about the widely discussed US strategy for dividing the
country into three parts? What are we going to do if that becomes US
policy?</p><p><a name="061010126000231"></a>Turning to Afghanistan,
as the Statement says, the latest extension of the NATO mission is to
cover the whole of the country. That means that NATO is now responsible
for all of Afghanistan, but there are still 8,000 US-led troops
operating under Operation Enduring Freedom and all their air power is
retained under American control. The Pentagon press statement issued at
the same time as the NATO press statement states:</p>



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_154"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="061010126000274"></a>&#147;We&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="061010126000257"></a>meaning
the
US&#151;<ul><a name="061010126000282"></a>&#147;will
continue to lead the counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan, train
and equip the Afghan national security forces and assist with
reconstruction&#148;.</ul><a name="061010126000258"></a>So
we now have both NATO and Operation Enduring Freedom doing the same
jobs in overlapping geographical areas. Can the Minister share with us
the military logic behind that
arrangement?<p><a name="061010126000232"></a>Next, how are
the Government responding to General Richards&#146;s assessment
reported yesterday morning that we must improve the lot of the Afghans
within the next six months if they are not to turn to the Taliban for
support? It is also clear that there is a turf war between the military
and development agencies in helping Afghanistan&#151;I trust that we
shall explore that more deeply when we debate the Unstarred Question
this evening. Can the Minister assure us that the Ministry of Defence
is totally content with the work that the Department for International
Development is doing and does not have its eyes on the department's
funding?</p><p><a name="061010126000233"></a>Turning to the pay
proposals in the Statement, from these Benches we welcome the tangible
recognition through a flat-rate, tax-free operational bonus that the
services are not just working in challenging circumstances but have
also been operating beyond the defence planning assumptions year after
year. We agree that a straight payment is better than trying to
introduce some complex tax regime through taking them out of the tax
bracket when they are away. However, it will take us some time to
consider the detail, which is not in the Statement, to decide how
different servicemen and women are affected and it will be very
important that it is seen as a fair system by all members of the Armed
Forces and the reserves. Can the Minister assure us that there will be
an opportunity for the MoD to change the arrangements when anomalies
surface, as they certainly will over the coming months? I also want to
know how the Armed Forces Pay Review Body will treat this allowance. It
will be bad if we end up having the X factor reduced next April because
of the allowance that is now being implemented. Let us hope it is
exempted from that.</p><p><a name="061010126000234"></a>I welcome
in the Statement the assurance that the defence budget will not have to
fund this extra money from the current budget. I trust that that will
remain the case into future
years.</p><p><a name="061010126000235"></a>Finally, more generally,
what are the Government doing about the degree of tasking that our
Armed Forces are now experiencing? They need either more people or
fewer tasks. The Government must do something
soon.</p><h5><a name="061010126000325"></a>5.25

Drayson:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for the support
that Members on the Benches opposite have given for the aims of our
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for the challenges that our
forces face in those theatres. The points that they have made have
focused on the implementation of these operations, and on criticisms
about the way in which we have gone about it.</p>



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_155"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061010126000237"></a>First, as a Defence Minister, I do not
accept the assertion of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, that Ministers are
living in an unreal world, unconnected with what is going on on the
ground. I came back from Afghanistan on Sunday having spent some
considerable time with our troops at Camp Bastion, at Kandahar and at
Kabul, ensuring that I absolutely understood the challenges that they
have faced in the past six months, to learn the lessons that need to be
learnt about the way in which we respond to the threat that we have
encountered and to ensure that we in the Ministry of Defence do
absolutely everything that we need to do to support our forces. As the
noble Lord said, the Prime Minister made a statement on Saturday that
our forces will have everything that they need to carry out these
operations.</p><p><a name="061010126000238"></a>Being the Minister
responsible for defence equipment means ensuring that our processes for
delivering urgent operational requirements into theatre are as
effective as possible. I spent a considerable amount of time ensuring
that I understood what we need to do to learn from the situation on the
ground in both Iraq and Afghanistan and to respond to that. That is
working. The defence procurement reforms that we have introduced have
led to a more responsive system that is delivering the equipment. There
is no doubt that we have issues&#151;the noble Lord opposite has
mentioned helicopters several times&#151;and we accept that our
helicopter capacity is deficient. As I said yesterday in this House, we
are implementing several measures to improve the situation urgently. We
have found that helicopters are an important force-multiplier,
particularly in Afghanistan, and there are several areas of development
that we are undertaking to put ourselves in a position to ensure that,
at the next roulement, we have the helicopter capacity to meet any
potential threat.</p><p><a name="061010126000239"></a>Noble Lords
made a point about ageing and inadequate equipment. It is simply not
the case across the piece. I accept that there are examples of
equipment that has been very hard worked. The WMIK vehicles, which the
Parachute Regiment has been using, are being replaced by Viking
vehicles, which are new and, I must say, impressive vehicles, which the
marines will be taking into theatre. We need to get the WMIK vehicles
back and ensure that they are repaired and replaced quickly. We are
seeing an improvement. I am monitoring closely the delivery of urgent
operational requirements into theatre to ensure that we are delivering
what our troops need. I simply do not accept that our procurement
process is not responding in the way noble Lords
describe.</p><p><a name="061010126000240"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Astor, asked specifically about casualty figures. Between 1 January and
31 July 2006, which are the latest figures that I have&#151;I should
add that a Question will be asked in the House on Monday about the
specifics of casualty figures&#151;four UK personnel were categorised
as very seriously injured from all causes excluding disease, five UK
personnel were categorised as seriously injured from all causes
excluding disease, and 125 UK personnel were aero-medically evacuated
from Afghanistan as a result of all causes. I am happy to write to the
noble 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_156"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord. During my visit last week, I spoke to the commander of the field
hospital in Camp Bastion, who gave me some figures from the experience
that the hospital is having. He mentioned specifically the ratio of
troops killed in action to casualties and I would be very happy to
expand on that.</p><p><a name="061010126000241"></a>On the use of
Reserve Forces and general overstretch, we must recognise that it is
the policy of this Government to change the way in which our Reserve
Forces are now used with our Regular Army on operations. We have found
that that has been very effective. It is not a case of using the
Reserve Forces because we do not have sufficient Regular Army to do the
job. It is a part of the one-army approach which we are now
adopting.</p><p><a name="061010126000242"></a>Today, in a
Question, we debated clinical care of our military and what is being
done. As the Statement said, we do not accept that we do not have
sufficient medical care for our Armed Forces. I have visited the field
hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan, and our facilities in Selly Oak,
Birmingham; I have spoken to soldiers about this issue. Our level of
care on operations is first class. Selly Oak has delivered in a major
hospital the necessary care for the cases coming back from operations.
We cannot go back to the past and military hospitals. Frankly, they are
unable to provide the appropriate level of sophistication and equipment
to care for our people properly. We must recognise that the numbers of
people in the military for whom we have to care is relatively small. As
the Statement said, the best way to ensure that there is proper care is
to provide it under the NHS.</p><p><a name="061010126000243"></a>On our strategy in Afghanistan, last
Friday, General Richards made clear to me that the recent change in the
command and operation, and the way in which the Afghan Government are
focusing on development zones in the country, was a positive
development. The progress made by the military in the past six months
gives us a tremendous opportunity, which we must take now. One concern
made to me by our military commanders in the field is that the pace of
reconstruction, which takes place now and during the winter when
traditionally the fighting is less, is established by next spring. I
know that there is an active effort in discussions on how we can
accelerate that.</p><p><a name="061010126000244"></a>In answer to
the noble Lord&#146;s question on whether I am content with what DfID
and the FCO are doing, there is room for us to further leverage the
work of the military in partnership with and together with the work of
DfID and the NGOs. I have heard from military commanders that
additional resources on the ground would be very effective and
complementary to the work being done by DfID and the
FCO.</p><p><a name="061010126000245"></a>We have a clear strategy
for Iraq. It is true that the situation in Iraq is very difficult,
which we accept. However, there is a strategy of developing a security
framework in the provinces. When we feel that we have got to the point
where the Iraqi police and army have the capability to take over a
province we hand it over. During the summer, we successfully did that
in two provinces. As regards the level of violence in those provinces,
it is low. The operational over watch which we are providing has been
effective. No doubt, 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_157"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the real challenge is in the cities; mostly in Baghdad, but also in
Basra. The military strategy taking place locally is to go
block-by-block through those cities to establish law and order, clear
out the gangs who are killing people, stop sectarian violence and
establish reconstruction. As the Statement said, it is early days to
see whether that will be effective. The early indication is that it is.
Operation Sinbad in Basra aims to do that and it will take many months.
By the end, we will see whether it has been successful. Its success
depends on whether local political support becomes further established
in the city. As that is established, our strategy will be then to
withdraw and provide operational over watch in the way that we have in
the other
provinces.</p><p><a name="061010142000002"></a>It
is not true to say that we do not have a clear strategy. In both
countries we know absolutely what our plan is, but these are difficult
circumstances requiring the support and development of local government
and law and order in parallel with
it.</p><p><a name="061010142000003"></a>I shall take away the noble
Lord&#146;s point about potential anomalies in pay proposals. I do
not know the process by which we will deal with anomalies should they
arise, but I am sure that we will undertake to address them if they are
found. I can confirm to the House that the X factor will not be reduced
as a result of these proposals. This is in addition to the present pay
structure, and I am sure that the pay review body will take it into
consideration. I expect the pay review body to fully take into account
the enduring pressure that our Armed Forces are under, the fantastic
response they are making to the challenge of operations, and the local
market conditions which exist. I spoke to a lance corporal in 3 Para
last week going back to Colchester. It is important that that young
corporal knows that he can get on the property ladder in Colchester,
and we are committed to providing a pay package which allows him to do
so.</p><h5><a name="061010142000083"></a>5.36

Craig of Radley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for repeating the Statement. I notice the generally positive tone of
what he is saying and I am delighted to see that some of the
deficiencies are now being gripped&#151;perhaps some of them
belatedly. All that is good news, as is the additional money going to
those on operations, but I have raised more than once in the House my
concern about the commitment of this country and its Armed Forces on
two fronts, and we remain heavily committed, not only in Afghanistan
but also in Iraq.</p><p><a name="061010142000005"></a>It had been
forecast some months ago that by this time our commitment in Iraq would
not be as demanding as it clearly is and looks like remaining. We are
seeing reports of the Iraqi police, up to brigade strength, proving
inadequate for the job which we expected them to do. So I repeat my
question to the Minister: is he satisfied that this country and our
Armed Forces are capable of continuing to maintain the level of
commitment on these two fronts, with the ability to react more strongly
should either front&#151;or, indeed, both fronts&#151;become
subject to greater pressure than they are under at the
moment?</p>

Drayson:</b> My Lords, I cannot put it more
accurately than how the Chief of the General Staff recently described
it in saying that things are running very hot, very hot indeed. That
reflects the sustained level of commitment that our troops have to
manage at the present.</p><p><a name="061010142000007"></a>The
answer to the point made by the noble and gallant Lord is that it
depends very much on how long these operations will continue. We need
to be realistic about the requirements that they will place on us if
they are sustained in the long term. We must not travel in hope; we
must always make sure that our Armed Forces have resources to meet that
challenge. We are looking at our equipment plans to ensure that they
have the appropriate balance, taking into account the operational focus
in the long term, for example, and, as the noble and gallant Lord is
aware, we are carrying out a spending review. As we look at those
plans, we need to ensure that we have the resources for any level of
sustained commitment into the
future.</p><p><a name="061010142000008"></a><a name="spnew_80"></a><b><a name="_spnew35"></a><a name="061010142000088"></a>Lord
Richard:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may come back to a
question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Garden. Is it not perfectly
clear that there is now intense reconsideration going on in Washington
of the strategy that should be pursued in Iraq? What input do Her
Majesty&#146;s Government hope to have in that reconsideration and,
particularly, what input do we hope to have in the consideration by
James Baker, the former Secretary of State, of this topic? All sorts of
ideas are being floated in all sorts of quarters, particularly in
Washington. I hope that we will not be pursuing one strategy suddenly
to discover that the Americans have changed their
ground.</p><p><a name="061010142000009"></a><a name="spnew_81"></a><b><a name="061010142000089"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, as my noble friend would
expect, we have close and multiple levels of discussion with the United
States on the strategy in Iraq. However, we must take into account the
views of the people of Iraq and their elected Government. The
Government of Iraq do not want to see a partition of Iraq. They are
clear on that point, and Her Majesty's Government support the Iraqi
Government in their
decision.</p><p><a name="061010142000010"></a><a name="spnew_82"></a><b><a name="_spnew36"></a><a name="061010142000090"></a>The
Earl of Onslow:</b> My Lords, it has been reported
that there are restrictions on German behaviour in Afghanistan and that
the Luftwaffe will not fly at night. There have also been reports of
other members of NATO being bound by rules that do not apply to us or
the Canadians. Will the Minister please make representations to the
heirs of Schamhorst, Bl1/4cher and Gneisenau that they should
behave like proper soldiers and not ban flying at
night?</p><p><a name="061010142000011"></a>Secondly, has the policy
of platoon garrisons dotted about north Helmand province been altered?
One platoon, or its equivalent, tied up in one fort, surrounded by a
lot of screaming Afghans shooting at them does nobody any good whatever
and just causes casualties and mayhem all around. That seems to have
been what is happening.</p>

Drayson:</b> My Lords, with regard to our coalition
partners such as Germany and the caveats they place on the operations
that they undertake, those caveats are a matter for the Government of
the country concerned, in the same way that we would expect the rules
of engagement to be a matter for us. There is no doubt, as I have said
in this House only today, that NATO is not fully stepping up to the
challenge we face in Afghanistan. The requirements which the NATO
generals have asked for have not been fully met. We in the United
Kingdom are providing a significant contribution to Afghanistan; we are
also putting clear pressure on our coalition partners to provide the
resources that the commanders need in the field.</p><p><a name="061010142000013"></a>With regard to the noble Earl&#146;s
comments about the platoon garrison, I do not believe that he has fully
understood the strategy that has been undertaken there. To say that it
is not doing anyone any good is to do a disservice to the brave men who
have fought and died in those platoon garrisons.</p><p><a name="061010142000014"></a>The purpose of having those platoon
garrisons was to make sure that in the important towns in the northern
part of Helmand province, the rule of law and, in particular the
influence of the local governor, Engineer Daud, were maintained at a
time of pivotal security within that province early in the summer. The
garrisons were defended by the British troops because it was essential
to the maintenance of the operation of the local government. If the
local government does not operate effectively, reconstruction cannot
take place, the Afghan National Army does not get paid and the Taliban
would secure a local victory which would have a propaganda effect on
the local population. The fact that our brave soldiers went into those
very dangerous platoon houses and, greatly outnumbered as they were,
fought the Taliban and won decisively, has established in the minds of
the locals that the British are serious about helping the local
democratically elected Government to secure security and the rule of
law in the province. It has led directly to the establishment of the
cessation of hostilities in those areas and is something upon which we
can build.</p><p><a name="061010142000015"></a>Our strategy is
then to allow the Afghan army and police, which we have trained, to
take over in those platoon houses. This will allow some of our troops
to leave those platoon houses&#151;not all of them, but some of
them&#151;and to be freed up to patrol the areas around them and
ensure that reconstruction can take place. We have a clear strategy. It
has worked and we shall build on
it.</p><p><a name="061010142000016"></a><a name="spnew_84"></a><b><a name="_spnew37"></a><a name="061010142000092"></a>Lord

that it will not have the sufficient training and preparation that a
core headquarters would have, along the lines of the ARC which is there
at the moment.</p><p><a name="061010142000018"></a>Will the

the border? Does it still have troops on its western border? Is it
still working on the problem on our
behalf?</p><p><a name="061010142000019"></a>I share the rapture of
the noble Lord, Lord Garden, about the bonus for our servicemen, but
like him, I qualify it until we see the details. I hope that it will
not be divisive across the Armed Forces. We need to remember that there
are many people in the Armed Forces, across all three services, who are
on long operational tours, which are not just in the Balkans, Iraq and
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="061010142000020"></a><a name="spnew_85"></a><b><a name="061010142000093"></a>Lord

Lord for his points relating to the practicalities of the bonus. I will
take them back to the department and make sure that they are taken on
board. The noble and gallant Lord is right that it is vital that it is
not seen as divisive, but, at the same time, it is very important that
we take steps&#151;and this is a positive step&#151;to address this
issue, as he and others have
recognised.</p><p><a name="061010142000021"></a>The noble and
gallant Lord asked about NATO. The track record so far is mixed.
Despite the pressures we have put on NATO through our requests, there
are deficiencies. It is therefore important for us to be realistic. We
must go forward on the basis of our troops being on operations as
partners in the coalition. We must ensure that our troops are provided
with the equipment that they need to do the job. If there is any doubt
about the provision of that equipment, we need to take responsibility
to make sure that our troops are properly equipped.</p><p><a name="061010142000022"></a>The noble and gallant Lord asked about
our confidence in the composite HQ which will take over from ARC. I
have not heard any queries about it. I will probe the matter and write
to the noble and gallant
Lord.</p><p><a name="061010142000023"></a>The key issue in respect
of Pakistan is the border and doing as much as possible to reduce its
porosity. We have seen Pakistan make considerable and increasing
efforts in that area. Our engagement with the Government of Pakistan
has had an
effect.</p><p><a name="061010142000024"></a><a name="spnew_86"></a><b><a name="_spnew38"></a><a name="061010142000094"></a>Lord

defending&#151;and the gangs who are kidnapping and murdering people
from the other sectarian groups. The key is for us to establish, in
support of the Iraqi Government, police and army, a security
environment in which that sectarian violence cannot take
place.</p><p><a name="061010142000026"></a>A
key challenge, which we recognise, has been the level of corruption
that has taken place within the Iraqi police. There has been
involvement in these killing squads from the Iraqi police. We have to
be engaged in support of the Iraqi Government to stamp that out within
the Iraqi police, and that is proving to be a very difficult
job.</p><p><a name="061010142000027"></a><a name="spnew_88"></a><b><a name="_spnew39"></a><a name="061010142000096"></a>Lord
Morris of Aberavon:</b> My Lords, I welcome the
Minister&#146;s proposals regarding pay. We shall have to look at the
detail in due course, but the aim is a very good and proper one. I also
support him on the medical proposals. The high cost of sophisticated
medical care means that it is the only way in which what we need to do
can be undertaken. Having said that, he also commented that the
persistence of the Taliban is greater than we anticipated. Has that not
been the same right through history and is it not a masterly
understatement from John Reid&#146;s original
comment?</p><p><a name="061010142000028"></a>Lastly, has NATO not
failed in the role that it should play? The Minister mentioned caveats
in the use of some other NATO countries. Can we have a detailed list of
those caveats? What can we do to get NATO to play a proper
role?</p><p><a name="061010142000029"></a><a name="spnew_89"></a><b><a name="061010142000097"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and

are following for medical care. He is absolutely right that it is
important for that to be done within the NHS
structure.</p><p><a name="061010142000030"></a>There has been a lot
of commentary in the press relating to the statement made by my right
honourable friend John Reid, when he was Defence Secretary. In fairness
to him, I feel that we should all read the statement in full and listen
to or read the transcript from the &#147;Today&#148; programme.
When one reads it in full, one can see that he did not simply make that
statement relating to going into Afghanistan and hoping that no shot
would be fired. He said that we hoped that that would be the case but
that we were preparing for a very difficult mission. He went on to say
that we were sending significant fighting assets in the 16 Air Assault
Brigade because we recognised the challenge of what we were going to
come up against from the
Taliban.</p><p><a name="061010142000031"></a>We have found the
resistance from the Taliban stronger than we expected. We have been
forthright in saying that. However, despite it being greater than we
expected, our forces have met that challenge with courage and
determination and have inflicted a clear tactical defeat on the Taliban
this year, which speaks to the competence and effectiveness of our
Armed Forces, their tactics and their equipment. None the less, we need
to look at, and are looking at, what additional resources are
needed.</p><p><a name="061010142000032"></a>With regard to NATO, I

commanders and what is still outstanding. We need to continue to push
our NATO coalition partners to provide the full list of equipment that
NATO commanders in the field are requesting. It is vital that they do
so now, because we have a window of opportunity, as General Richards

Ramsbotham:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
the Statement. A lot has been heard today, both now and in the early
Question, about the medical support being given in Selly Oak hospital.
However, not much has been heard about the operations of the Defence
Medical Welfare Service, which the Minister will know was set up at the
time of the Gulf War to provide psychological and psychiatric support
to people after they had left hospital. In particular, I am concerned
about the degree of support being given to members of the reserve
forces, who do not remain under regular military observation when they
return to the community, because there are disturbing stories that they
are not being well supported in view of the strain, and other things,
that they have been under during
operations.</p><p><a name="061010142000034"></a><a name="spnew_91"></a><b><a name="061010142000099"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, with his
experience, is absolutely right that we must make sure that the level
of support that we offer our Armed Forces is related not only to their
physical but to their mental well-being and that it fully takes into
account the subtle but very important differences between the needs of
our reserve forces and our regulars. One thing that we have learnt is
that by the very nature of reserve deployment, returning from
operations&#151;and not as part of a regular unit&#151;provides
additional stress for which people need support. We are taking action,
as part of our initiatives in welfare support, to provide that support
to our reserve forces.</p><p><a name="061010142000035"></a>The
investment that we have made in support for our service people, based
on an independent review that was undertaken a couple of years ago, led
to a recommendation that support in terms of mental health was best
done on a more regional and local basis, such that people had local
support. That is being done through the use of the Priory, which has
provided us with a series of centres of support to underpin our
approach for mental
healthcare.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="Rep_1"></a><a name="061010142000001"></a>Police

amendment stands in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady
Linklater of
Butterstone.</p><p><a name="061010142000039"></a>For
70 years the law has made it quite clear that for children involved in
criminal proceedings the expectation is that reporting restrictions
will not be lifted except in exceptional circumstances. In recent
years, the Government have introduced legislation so that for children
involved in anti-social behaviour order proceedings there is an
expectation that reporting restrictions will be lifted except in
exceptional circumstances. The effect of the amendment would be to
reverse the situation to the status quo <I>ante</I>, where it stood for
70 years.</p><p><a name="061010142000040"></a>I am most grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, for his helpful reply in
Committee. He recognised the concerns about the welfare of these
children and gave a very balanced analysis of the problem, drawing on
his experience of being a leader of a local authority where these
problems arise.</p><p><a name="061010142000041"></a>The purpose of
bringing this back on Report is to hear further from him on the support
for families and children given these orders. The work that the
Government are doing to support families is encouraging, but as we
established in Committee only slightly more than 1 per cent of parents
with these children were given parenting orders. Given that these
orders were so effective, it seemed surprising and disappointing that
those families were not being supported in that
way.</p><p><a name="061010142000042"></a>The Minister countered by
saying that each child was given a needs assessment, but we know from
experience elsewhere that it is all very well sometimes to provide an
assessment of needs but it is the services that follow and the
resources that are provided that matter. Of particular concern is that
significant numbers of the children are under the age of 15 and they
can be as young as 10. It was quite clear from the response given by
the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, that very often the names and photographs
of children as young as 12 would be publicised in the local community,
sometimes in a leaflet and sometimes in the local media. Tabloids have
picked up the photographs of children as young as 12 and publicised
them in their coverage.</p><p><a name="061010142000043"></a>It is
most encouraging to hear the Government&#146;s progress with the
&#147;respect&#148; action plan to counter anti-social behaviour.
For instance, the Prime Minister said this
summer:</p><ul><a name="061010142000081"></a>&#147;The
&#145;hardest to reach&#146; families are often the ones we need to
reach most&#148;.</ul><a name="061010142000078"></a>He went
on to say that there is a requirement for earlier intervention with
some of these families, who are often socially excluded and socially
dysfunctional. It was encouraging to hear the statement by the Minister
for Children, Beverley Hughes, about the pilot schemes she has launched
in 20 local authorities, targeting parents of eight to 13 year-olds
with the most disruptive behaviour. Brighton and Hove&#146;s local
authority features in that.
<p><a name="061010142000044"></a>The general sense is that the
Government&#146;s policy in this area is moving in a positive
direction, but I regret that, over the eight years that these orders
have been in place, no attempt has been made, as far as I 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_164"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can see, to determine what the impact has been on
these children and their siblings of having their identities publicised
in the local areas. That causes us great concern, particularly, as we
heard in Committee, when some of these children have disabilities,
learning difficulties, Asperger syndrome and so on. Two-thirds of these
children have their cases heard in adult courts. It was only in
February this year that guidance was sent out that magistrates in such
courts should have training in youth justice matters to assess those
sensitive cases. I would be grateful to hear from the Minister, either
later or in writing, what monitoring has been taking place of how
effectively that guidance is being implemented. These children&#146;s
cases are reviewed after one year. That has recently been introduced,
and is very welcome. Again, I would appreciate how that is being
monitored.</p><p><a name="061010142000045"></a>These are complex
matters. It is extremely difficult to draw the balance between the
welfare and the rights of these children and the terrible impact their
behaviours can have on their communities. I look to the Minister to
provide more assurance on how the Government are supporting these
children and families. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="061010142000046"></a><a name="spnew_93"></a><b><a name="061010142000101"></a>Baroness
Linklater of Butterstone:</b> My Lords, I rise to
support this amendment regarding reporting restrictions on children
with ASBOs. We tabled this amendment in Committee, and we shall of
course support it again. When I spoke to it then, the Minister, the
noble Lord, Lord Bassam, started his reply by saying he had heard me
make this sort of speech before&#151;in other words: I would say
this, wouldn&#146;t I? Well, I have not changed my view, and I fear
the Government will not have changed theirs either.</p><p><a name="061010142000047"></a>I persist in believing that children who
breach an ASBO should not be named and shamed in the press. Mine is not
a lone voice. The very distinguished chairman of the Youth Justice
Board, Professor Rod Morgan, has spoken out eloquently against the
practice, as have the CEO of Barnardo&#146;s, who is an ex-director
of the Prison Service; Napo, which has compiled a dossier on some of
the damaging outcomes for children with neurological disorders such as
Asperger&#146;s, ADD or Tourette&#146;s; and the Council of Human
Rights commissioner Alvaro Gil-Robles, to name but a few. The arguments
have not materially changed.</p><p><a name="061010142000048"></a>We know that the Government themselves,
in a response to a Question in the other place, have admitted that they
know little of the characteristics or circumstances of children issued
with ASBOs. Perhaps they do not care all that much, as they have no way
of knowing who it is affecting or how. We also know, however, that all
childcare professionals are aware that there is overwhelming evidence
that labelling children is damaging and counterproductive. It does not
stop bad behaviour, since demonising children tends to reinforce the
behaviour and will give a few some status with their peers, and we know
that negative publicity tends to increase anxiety in the public at
large, rather than promoting the understanding and good will that are
so desperately needed by all concerned.</p>

presumption of reporting restrictions is reinstated, which still leaves
the court the option of publicising cases where it sees it to be useful
or beneficial. It is a small but vital matter of judgment and emphasis,
and one that can make an enormous difference to the lives of the people
involved. I hope the Government might be prepared to consider their
position this time.</p><p><a name="061010142000051"></a><a name="spnew_94"></a><b><a name="061010142000102"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I fear we could be
treading the same ground as we have trodden before. No matter; I shall
press on. I congratulate the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Linklater, on their contributions. They contribute to an
important debate about the impact of anti-social behaviour orders, and
they quite properly ask questions about impact and effectiveness. It is
an important part of the debate that we consider those
issues.</p><p><a name="061010142000052"></a>That said, I come back
to the point I have made before on several occasions, that I think our
approach is ultimately the best one. It is for the court to determine,
and to give reasons why it thinks it right, that publicity is given in
some cases, in the circumstances we envisage. I do not agree with what
the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, has to say, although I am
interested. I would be very interested to read some of the cases to
which she has referred, because they are important. I know from
personal experience that when I talk to local residents in my own
community, they think we have got the balance about right.</p><p><a name="061010142000053"></a>I was interested in the noble
Baroness&#146;s description of some of those difficult cases where
people have Asperger&#146;s or an attention deficit syndrome
problem&#151;ADD and so on&#151;and I recognise the importance of
giving careful consideration to whether publicity should be given in
those cases. Earlier in the year I saw a local case reported where the
juvenile concerned was suffering from a syndrome. Interestingly, the
publicity had had a beneficial effect, because it made local residents
rather more aware of that syndrome as an issue, and I think it led to a
situation where the court carefully considered exactly what should go
on from a finding in the court, and what sort of treatment should be in
place to support that young person in the community.</p><p><a name="061010142000054"></a>ASBOs are community orders, and I think
it right that the needs of the local community should be equally
balanced against those of the young person. Although, as I have made
plain, the welfare of the young person should be fully and properly 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_166"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considered, it is, of course, not ultimately the principal purpose of
the order, which is to bring relief to the local community. That must
be properly considered. Publicity of proceedings is often an integral
part of the local agencies&#146; efforts to tackle anti-social
behaviour, although it is important that we do not name and shame for
the sake of it.</p><p><a name="061010142000055"></a>ASBOs are made
in open court, and, unless the court imposes restrictions, the media
are fully entitled to report them, even if they involve young people.
It is for the court to decide whether or not to impose reporting
restrictions, but the court also recognises that these cases
sometimes&#151;perhaps often&#151;need to be reported, for two
reasons: first, to help the local community and the victims of
anti-social behaviour, who know that something positive has been done
to stop the abuse and that someone has responded to a problem that
members of the local community have experienced; and secondly, to
publicise fully the prohibitions so that the community can help to
enforce the order.</p><p><a name="061010142000056"></a>Publicity
is not to punish or shame the individual. We need to remember that the
anti-social behaviour of juveniles&#151;and indeed of
adults&#151;made subject to an ASBO will have a serious and lasting
effect on people&#146;s lives. The needs of such individuals must be
balanced with those of the community who have a right to be
protected.</p><p><a name="061010142000057"></a>The courts can
still impose reporting restrictions if they believe that the situation
warrants it because there is a requirement on them to have regard to
the welfare of the child or young person. We believe that the existing
legal framework is working well in
practice.</p><p><a name="061010142000058"></a>We are, of course,
aware of the Youth Justice Board&#146;s research into ASBOs and
children. I cannot provide more information to your Lordships&#146;
House today on the fruits of that research but, as I have said, I shall
reflect further on the concerns that the noble Baroness and the noble
Earl have raised. I shall write to both of them and share that
correspondence with others who have taken part in the debates. It is
right that we examine criticisms carefully and balance those against
the needs of local communities and have regard to the research that has
been conducted on ASBOs. We want to make sure that they are effective.
I do not think that it is in anyone&#146;s interest not to do that.
As the debate has moved on and people have recognised the importance of
ASBOs, it is important that we understand their effect and impact. We
need to reflect on the impact on the individuals
involved.</p><p><a name="061010142000059"></a>I hope that your
Lordships will not be seduced into accepting the amendment, which is
attractive from the perspective of the noble Baroness and the noble
Earl. I encourage the noble Earl to withdraw

the Government would look in more detail at the proposals of the Joint
Committee on Human Rights, and that she hoped and expected to table
government amendments on Report to address the concerns that had been
raised. She also said that, like the Chief Inspector of Prisons, the
new chief inspector, not Ministers, would continue to be able to set
the criteria for inspections and gave assurance that prison inspection
would be based on domestic and human rights standards rather than on
service standards or government
targets.</p><p><a name="061010142000071"></a>I was disappointed,
first, that the Minister could not meet me during the Recess to discuss
the amendments and, secondly, that the government amendments have not
satisfied either the proposals of the Joint Committee or the concerns
that were expressed or spelt out, and in particular that the
Minister&#146;s undertakings are not included in them. Only two of
the six guarantees of the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, required by the
Joint Committee have been satisfied. Government Amendment No. 93 covers
the fact that inspections must be based on visits and government
Amendment No. 97 covers unannounced inspections, but none of the
characteristics of independent inspection of prisons of the noble Lord,
Lord Hurd, has been satisfied; in other words, what I always regarded
as the particular strengths of the position of the independent Chief
Inspector of Prisons&#151;namely, that you had the right to go
anywhere unannounced and the right to set your own criteria, that there
would be no reduction in a programme of regular inspections and that
you reported directly to the Home Secretary and the public. Those
strengths are to be diminished.</p>



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_168"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061010142000072"></a>I have explained before to this House
that the inspection of the treatment of and conditions for prisoners is
not about value for money. By the same token the inspection of prisons
is not the same as the inspection of the management of individual
offenders. It is the inspection of a community that is a prison and
whether the various parts of it are fit for purpose. The prison and
probation inspectorates are currently looking at how this might be done
in the same spirit in which the inspectorates have worked together
since 1996 on subjects that involve more than two of them. In the case
of prisons, this includes health, education, drugs treatment and many
other subjects not covered by any of the inspectorates that are subject
to this proposal.</p><p><a name="061010142000073"></a>The new
criminal justice inspectorate in Northern Ireland already provides a
precedent for what I am saying, leaving prisons out of that merger and
contracting the inspection of the prisons in Northern Ireland to Her
Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector&#151;the acknowledged expert. The
purpose of my amendment is to save the Government from repeating a
failure of six years ago. They have tried to go down this merger route
before. This is not a Home Office proposal resulting from a detailed
study related to this Bill, but the Home Office putting flesh on the
bones of wider direction&#151;merging 11 public sector inspectorates
into four&#151;contained in the Chancellor&#146;s 2005 Budget
speech.</p><p><a name="061010142000074"></a>In May 2000 the Home
Office tried to merge the prisons and probation inspectorates and
dropped the proposal six months later because it realised that it made
no sense at all to merge them until the prison and probation services
had been merged. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, will no doubt remember
having to admit to this House that no one was in favour of that
proposal. Now it proposes to merge five inspectorates and five
different functions working to three separate Secretaries of State. In
Committee the Minister talked about the justice inspectorate, but there
is not a single justice system working to a single justice Minister,
although I am one of those who think that there should be. Unless and
until there is, it seems to me to make no more sense to merge these
five different inspectorates than it was to merge the two which at
least had to work together on some of their
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="061010142000075"></a>There is also
a worrying lack of clarity about when this is to take place. In
Committee the Minister told us that the Government would stage the
transition of the new inspectorate and not abolish the Chief Inspector
of Prisons until they were satisfied that the new chief inspector was
ready effectively to carry out the prisons inspection duty. But a week
before that the Home Secretary said that the post of Chief Inspector of
Prisons would be abolished in March 2008 at the end of Miss
Owers&#146;s contract. There is a conflict here and I should like to
know which is right.</p><p><a name="061010142000076"></a>Two weeks
ago I was interviewed by head-hunters who are looking for what the
noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, described in a previous debate as a
superhuman being&#151;the new chief inspector. The head-hunters are
looking for someone who can speak with first-hand experience of
inspecting 140 prisons, 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_169"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can advise 50 chief constables on personnel as well as operational
matters, knows the intricacies of the Crown Prosecution, courts and
probation services, is able to deal with three Secretaries of State and
10 other Ministers, can balance limited budget resources between five
separate operations each of which has a full programme, has time to
read and edit more than 300 reports each year and can carry out the
media, official and representational tasks currently undertaken by five
people in three ministries. The net effect will be that because no one
person could possibly do this the chief inspector will either have to
delegate tasks to the deputy currently doing them or take him or her
with him to provide first as opposed to second-hand evidence. But this,
of course, is the very duplication that the Government say they are
trying to avoid.</p><p><a name="061010142000077"></a>I wish to
make two points on the subject of duplication. First, there is no
duplication at present between any of the five inspectorates. Any
duplication in this area is between the plethora of regulators and
auditors, many of them introduced by this Government. Secondly, where
is the single immigration regulator, announced in July in the Home
Office paper <I>Fair, Effective, Transparent and Trusted</I>, to sit?
Is this to be a fifth inspectorate? Is it to be included in the
proposed merger that we are discussing? Is it to take over the
responsibilities of the inspectorate of prisons listed in the Bill? Is
it to be the independent monitor required under the optional protocol
and not included in the government amendments? If so, will that
independence satisfy the joint committee of the United
Nations?</p><p><a name="061010162000002"></a>The
disastrous introduction of the National Offender Management Service
should have provided a salutary lesson on the dangers of introducing
theories before they have been properly thought through and evaluated.
The Minister has talked about a joined-up offender management demanding
a new type of inspection. However, less than half of the 80,000 in
prison are serving sentences that include probation supervision, and
less than half of the over 250,000 offenders in the hands of the
probation service have come from prison. Therefore, only a minority of
offenders are subject to the main direction of NOMS. By the same token,
only 20 per cent of police time is connected with the criminal justice
system, with the remaining 80 per cent being devoted to the prevention
of crime; and yet there is no definition in the Bill of what community
safety means.</p><p><a name="061010162000003"></a>In July, the National
Audit Office published a paper called <I>Wider Lessons for Public
Sector Mergers of Regulatory Agencies</I>. There are 15
recommendations, one of which does not apply to this merger because it
is about retirement pay. As far as I can see, however, all the other 14
recommendations have been ignored. I will quote just two:</p><ul><a name="061010162000120"></a>&#147;Base the decision ... on a
balanced judgement of whether the projected benefits justify the costs
of carrying out the merger&#148;,</ul><a name="061010162000113"></a>and,<ul><a name="061010162000121"></a>&#147;Ensure
there is a plan to mitigate the risks of disruption to business as
usual and the interests of stakeholders&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_170"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061010162000004"></a>In the case of the inspection of prisons,
the stakeholders include the public. It is no good assuming that what
is proposed is do-able because some of what is being done should not be
done. In the case of the prisons inspectorate, I ask what should not be
done. I have to admit that I always overspent my budget every year,
because I could not do what was required of me with what I had been
given. Now there is to be less with which to do more, so the business
is to be disrupted. I explain that by the fact that there are to be
transitional costs of some &#163;2.2 million, which are to be taken
out of the existing inspectorates&#146; budgets, and that means that
what they will be able to do will be reduced. In addition, the prisons
inspectorate is now to be required to inspect prison cells, court cells
and transport. If it has to do that it needs extra resources, but if it
is not given the resources it will have to cut down the existing
programme, which is not something that the public would
welcome.</p><p><a name="061010162000005"></a>The prison system is,
as we all know, in crisis. In Committee, the Minister described it as
being &#147;of superb construction&#148;. Well, that construction
has proved unequal to the task, and in addition the director-general
has admitted in public that several thousand prison officers are
corrupt. Throughout my time as chief inspector, my chief concern was
that there was a difference between the facts that I was disclosing in
my inspections and the data given to Ministers by officials and
official sources. Both I and my successor have commented on this many
times, largely on the grounds that you cannot make sound decisions
based on fudged and inaccurate data.</p><p><a name="061010162000006"></a>Let us just look at the last inspection
of Pentonville, quoted in the most powerful article by the noble Lord,
Lord Hurd, in the <I>Observer</I> on Sunday. He quoted the lack of
basic requirements, including vermin infestation and complaints about
assaults and bad treatment of staff. He did not, however, mention one
other complaint that the inspector mentioned, namely that the food ran
out during lunch&#151;the only hot meal of the day. For me, the two
worst aspects of the report were, first, that there was no supportive
first-night strategy, and night staff did not know the location of new
arrivals, which suggests to me that all is not well about suicide
prevention despite the assurances that we are given. Secondly,
unemployed prisoners, who represented half the population, had only an
average of 2.5 hours out of cell, while employed prisoners were out for
about seven hours. The average across the prison was five hours, which
is far less than the over eight hours that the prison was reporting. I
mention that because I wonder whether under the proposed new regime
those sorts of uncomfortable details will be allowed to be
published.</p><p><a name="061010162000007"></a>As a soldier, I
learnt that at times of crisis the one thing that you need above all is
timely, accurate information. The current crisis has come about in part
because the Government have failed to listen to timely, accurate
information provided by their one independent and objective
source&#151;the independent prisons inspectorate. But you
don&#146;t shoot the messenger just because you don&#146;t like the
message.</p>

House admire not only the Minister&#146;s ability but also her
unswerving loyalty to her party&#146;s line. Never having been a

in a letter, nothing more and nothing less than dangerous nonsense
whose practicalities and consequences have not been properly thought
through. Were I the Minister, particularly at a time of crisis such as
our prisons are going through now, the last thing that I would want to
lose would be my one source of objective, independent information.
Protest though the Minister undoubtedly will, a Deputy Chief Inspector
of Justice, Community Safety and Custody (Prisons) who is subordinate
to a chief inspector, subject to the direction of 13 different
Ministers and required to have regard to such aspects of government
policy as Ministers in three separate ministries may direct, simply is
not as independent as the current stand-alone Chief Inspector of
Prisons. I repeat sentiments that the Minister will recall were
expressed from every side of the House in Committee, in the hope of
preventing the Government from committing an act of wilful and
unnecessary destruction of a beacon of our criminal justice system. I
beg to
move.</p><p><a name="061010162000009"></a><a name="spnew_97"></a><b><a name="_spnew42"></a><a name="061010162000451"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Worcester:</b> My Lords, we on these
Benches have a particular interest in this matter. These Benches are
the seat of people who, from the beginning of the modern prison
service, have had the right to enter and inspect. That right was
exercised by the Lords Spiritual because of a recognition that you
cannot do anything more serious to anybody than deprive them of their
liberty, and that that act itself is completely unique in the relations
between the state and the subject. It deserves careful and independent
scrutiny, and that scrutiny is of the first importance to be
maintained. Of course, no one on these Benches today would wish to
suggest that we return to the custom that the only source of
independent inspection should be diocesan Bishops, because we all
recognise that that work these days requires independence,
professionalism and resources. That does not mean that we do not
continue to have an interest in this area of work, and all my
colleagues share with me as Bishop to prisons a concern that this
feature of our prisons regime should be
sustained.</p><p><a name="061010162000010"></a>I am even more
astonished than I am outraged by this government proposal. I am
astonished because it seems to be depriving the Government of one of
the sources not only of independent judgment&#151;as the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, said&#151;but of public support for those aspects of
crime reduction that have most engaged the Minister&#146;s committed
attention. She has rightly asked representatives of the faith
communities, the voluntary sector and commercial organisations to join
with the Government in giving assistance to ensuring that people who
have offended are enabled to make the best possible transition to
society. There is no stronger ally of the Government in that respect
than the chief inspector who examines prisons precisely to ensure that
they are fit for the purpose of returning people to society with the
best chance of not reoffending.</p>

a formidable ally of the Minister and her concerns? The chief inspector
does so by her direct and prestigious access to public media. The chief
inspectors that we have had&#151;sparing the blushes of the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, himself&#151;are remarkable examples of what
happens when you have a highly competent, committed, objective and
serious person inhabiting an office of enormous public prestige under
the Crown. That is what is required of that person&#151;to gain
access to the public media and to gain publicity for the main
recommendations of the inspectorate&#146;s reports. It is simply not
conceivable that a subordinate official of the enormous inspectorate
that the Government are thinking of creating will have that kind of
access.</p><h5><a name="061010162000131"></a>6.30

are talking about abolition and not merger here, because there will
never again be, if this provision passes into law, a Chief Inspector of
Prisons. The result will be that the public sympathy and interest which
have been gained during the time of the past office holders will simply
disappear.</p><p><a name="061010162000013"></a>I am astonished that
the Minister, who has such a strong commitment to the rehabilitative
purposes of the criminal justice system in general and of prisons in
particular, should be prepared to lose that element of support in this
work. In the process she has managed to alienate, as far as I am aware,
every person and responsible organisation that has invested attention
in prison reform&#151;something to which she is also committed. She
has lost the sympathy of faith groups, communities and Churches that,
on the basis of that commitment, have been prepared to enter into the
faith alliances that she has promoted, because we now suspect that the
Government&#146;s attitude to prison reform is far more detached and
cynical than we had
supposed.</p><p><a name="061010162000014"></a>This situation is of
the greatest seriousness. I urge the Minister to think again, and I
urge your Lordships seriously to consider supporting the amendment in a

Mayhew of Twysden:</b> My Lords, faithful to the
mention made by the Chancellor in his Budget speech that the Government
were minded to move to a single inspectorate, the Bill now provides for
the inspectorates of prisons, police, the Courts Service, the CPS and
the National Probation Service to be clustered under a single chief
inspector. I cannot help thinking that that curious clustering would
form a good task for a simple aptitude test. The question would be:
&#147;Identify the incongruous item&#148;. It would have to be a
simple test, because the odd one out in that list stands out so plainly
as the inspectorate of prisons. None of the other four services looks
at what we do to and for people who are locked away out of sight, out
of hearing and generally out of mind. That is a distinct characteristic
to which the right reverend Prelate referred.</p>

inspection regime that looks at the offender management regime from
start to finish through custodial and community
settings&#148;.</ul><a name="061010162000114"></a>Shortly
afterwards, a very shrewd and simple question was asked by the noble
Baroness, Lady Billingham, who was sitting behind the Minister. The
noble Baroness
said:<ul><a name="061010162000122"></a>&#147;The department
seems to be saying that everything that the Chief Inspector of Prisons
now does will remain with the new inspector. My worry is that there are
four other inspectorates that this super-human being will have to look
after. I cannot really see how that is going to
work&#148;.</ul><a name="061010162000115"></a>The reply by
the Minister occupies the next 22 lines. While they deserve to be read,
they are too long for me to cite now; but the upshot of the argument is
in the last four lines. The Minister said
that,<ul><a name="061010162000128"></a>&#147;the
important thing is that what the inspectorate actually does&#151;the
independence and the rigour and vigour of the current prison
inspectorate should not be diminished. It should be enhanced. That is
our aspiration&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/7/06; col.
460-61.]</ul><a name="061010162000116"></a>I could possibly
share that aspiration, but not the expectation; nor, I guess, can many
people share it in the light of what the noble Baroness, Lady Stern,
said in that debate. She
said:<ul><a name="061010162000123"></a>&#147;I have not met
anyone who sees any sense in this proposal&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 6/7/06; col.

system, the noble Baroness scarcely wanders alone&#151;knowing no
one, discussing nothing. If the Government will not heed the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, then let them heed
her.</p><p><a name="061010162000020"></a><a name="spnew_99"></a><b><a name="_spnew44"></a><a name="061010162000453"></a>Baroness
Quin:</b> My Lords, I am pleased to have an
opportunity to say a few words in this debate. Mention has already been
made of the Prison Reform Trust and the role of the noble Lord, Lord
Hurd, in chairing that organisation. Although I do not think that it is
a declarable interest, I would like to say to the House that I am
chairing a Prison Reform Trust project involving work with prisoners
with learning disabilities and learning
difficulties.</p><p><a name="061010162000021"></a>I listened with
great interest to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, whom I had the
pleasure of working with during my brief tenure of office as prisons
Minister. One of the points he made is one about which I too am
concerned&#151;that this proposal 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_174"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>does not seem to involve a very clear line of communication between the
inspectorate and the relevant Ministers, because of the jumbo nature of
the new organisation. I hope that my noble friend the Minister can
reassure us about the lines of communication between the inspectors and
the relevant Ministers who will be most concerned with the subjects
under consideration.</p><p><a name="061010162000022"></a>I would be
grateful also if my noble friend could provide current cost estimates.
When organisations are changed, considerable costs can be incurred. I
would like to be assured that, in the short term, the costs of this
operation will not exceed the benefits. Perhaps she can also provide
estimates of long-term savings and say what constitutes
&#147;long-term&#148; in that
regard.</p><p><a name="061010162000023"></a>I share the concern
that many people have expressed about any compromise of independence. I
believe that the independence of the current inspectorate arrangements
is a very important aspect. I, too, pay tribute to the work done by the
current inspector of prisons, as well as that done by the previous
distinguished occupants of that position.</p><p><a name="061010162000024"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to
resist some of the doom and gloom about the present situation in
prisons. Perhaps I could share with the House an experience that I had
during the summer, when I visited a prison&#151;the young offender
institute in Deerbolt in County Durham&#151;that I had previously
visited some nine years ago, when I was Minister. I was greatly
impressed both by the changes to the physical infrastructure of that
establishment and by the great improvements in the sense of purpose,
the regimes and the innovative programmes that were being pursued. So I
do not simply accept the description of our prison system as being in
crisis. I think that a lot of good progress has been made in recent
years and I say to my noble friend that, because of such developments,
I am generally happy with the Government&#146;s approach to prison
issues and penal reform. However, on this issue, I will have to listen
very carefully to her reply to this debate.</p><p><a name="061010162000025"></a><a name="spnew_100"></a><b><a name="_spnew45"></a><a name="061010162000454"></a>The
Earl of Caithness:</b> My Lords, who will rid me of
this troublesome inspectorate? That was a thought that I often had when
I was Minister for prisons. Its reports caused me some anxiety from
time to time but, looking back, I am extremely grateful to it and think
that it did an excellent job. Perhaps I should therefore support the
Government&#146;s proposal to get rid of the Chief Inspector of
Prisons.</p><p><a name="061010162000026"></a>I was the first
Minister to visit a prison unannounced. It was an amazing experience.
Not only was I welcomed by the prison officer at the gate, who rang the
governor and said, &#147;There&#146;s a guy here who says
he&#146;s the Minister for prisons and won&#146;t go away&#148;,
but I found that to go into a prison totally announced was very
different from my normal visits to prisons.</p><p><a name="061010162000027"></a>The Minister will
argue that of course that situation will be retained. However, I put to
your Lordships three things that will not be retained. One is the
finance for the inspectorate, which undoubtedly will be trimmed, as the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_175"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>said. Secondly, if the prisons inspectorate is joined with other
inspectorates, the key element of independence and objectivity will be
minimised. Thirdly and perhaps most importantly, the standing of the
prisons inspectorate in the eyes of Ministers and of the public will be
severely reduced. For those reasons, I cannot support what the
Government propose and will support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="061010162000028"></a><a name="spnew_101"></a><b><a name="_spnew46"></a><a name="061010162000455"></a>Lord
Dubs:</b> My Lords, I will just intervene briefly. I
had a long conversation with my noble friend on the telephone yesterday
morning and listened to her put forward all the arguments that we shall
no doubt hear later. I promised to think very carefully about them. I
have thought very carefully about them and I am afraid to say that I am
not persuaded, the more so now because I have heard some excellent
speeches this evening, which have demolished the Government&#146;s
case. I do not think that I am regarded as a member of the awkward
squad, but one does not have to be a member of the awkward squad to say
that the Government have got this one wrong.</p><p><a name="061010162000029"></a>I have three brief points. First, the
crisis in the prison population suggests that this is the last moment
to be tampering with what is one of the great traditions in
Britain&#151;an independent inspectorate that has shown robustness
and integrity and has been willing to say things that are uncomfortable
for Governments. I always thought that it was a great tribute to
successive Governments and prison Ministers that they have had such an
independent inspector of prisons. Indeed, that has been part of the way
in which we have managed a very difficult area of life.</p><p><a name="061010162000030"></a>Secondly, like others who have spoken, I
believe that the role of the Chief Inspector of Prisons is different in
kind from the role of the other inspectors&#151;so different that I
think to merge them is not
sensible.</p><p><a name="061010162000031"></a>Finally, our
reputation internationally rests on a number of key features of British
life. I suggest that the way in which we have inspected our prisons,
with a real sense of independence, has sent an important message to
other countries where things are not done that way. People in other
countries look, sometimes with admiration, at the way in which we have
managed prison inspection, so it would be a sad day if we said to the
world, &#147;No, this is coming to an end&#148;.

Elton:</b> My Lords, I have the greatest sympathy for
the present Minister for prisons, who is in a position very close to
the one that I was in when I came to the Home Office in 1982. Very
soon, I had a chart on the wall to show how many places were left
before we had to use executive release to make room for more prisoners
to come in. We got down to 11 places at one time, and that was using
the bridewells and police cells as well. It is no good saying that
there is not a crisis. There is a crisis. To try to manage that crisis
at the same time as reorganising an important element of what you are
doing seems to me to savour of not very sensible thinking.</p>



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_176"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061010162000033"></a>I share the astonishment of the right
reverend Prelate, not for the reasons that he gave but because, despite
the fact that I continually hear the Government say how anxious they
are to decentralise, we have here a great accrual of directive power to
the central authority in exactly the opposite direction. It is rather
like pressing the button for No. 2 when you get in the lift on the
Principal Floor and saying, &#147;I&#146;m going down&#148;; it
is the reverse of what is happening.</p><p><a name="061010162000034"></a>The damage that will be done by this is
considerable, as has been powerfully put already. I speak only because
I spent a year as Minister for the probation service and three years as
Minister for prisons and my silence might be taken as a lack of concern
for what is afoot. I am deeply concerned. Whatever words of assurance
are given, your Lordships should read the Bill and still try to believe
that, in future, the person responsible for inspecting prisons will be
in any sense independent. It is simply incredible. He will be
subordinate to someone who is in turn subject to ministerial direction.
That is two layers that do not exist now to cloak what he is able to
bring out.</p><p><a name="061010162000035"></a>Finally, I echo
what the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said in a most powerful speech. A
Minister is the prisoner of his civil servants when it comes to
receiving information. The only other sources are hearsay and newspaper
reports unless you have an independent inspector to do that job for
you. In the circumstances in which we now understand prison staff work,
that is an absolutely essential connection of the Minister to reality.
Connecting to the public also gives the Minister muscle in Cabinet or
in departmental meeting, because the public become aware of what is
wrong and want something to be done about it&#151;as do we. Let us
not stop that happening by passing this ridiculous part of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="061010162000036"></a><a name="spnew_103"></a><b><a name="_spnew48"></a><a name="061010162000457"></a>Baroness
Gibson of Market Rasen:</b> My Lords, my name is on a
number of these amendments, so I would like to speak. However, I should
first apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for not being in
the Chamber at the beginning of his speech. I was so busily caught up
with these few words that the debate crept up on
me.</p><p><a name="061010162000037"></a>I am saddened and
disappointed to be making this speech because, after our July debate, I
genuinely believed that we would be able to reach some agreement on the
prisons inspectorate. However, that has not materialised. The
Government&#146;s aim to bring together the various organisations to
make the criminal justice system more streamlined is fine by me; I have
no problems with that. However, to achieve this, I can see no necessity
for the prisons inspectorate to be subsumed within this mass of other
inspectorates. I, too, believe that the prisons inspectorate is
different. It alone deals with the conditions in which prisoners exist,
a matter that I believe must be judged as one of the cornerstones of
progress in any civilised society.</p><p><a name="061010162000038"></a>I am afraid that, for once,
<I>Hansard</I> got it wrong in July. It was me who spoke in the debate
on this matter and not my noble friend Lady Billingham. We are
sometimes mixed up, even when we go to pay what we 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_177"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>owe in the Dining Room. I said in the debate that I believed that
whoever headed this proposed new inspectorate would need to be
superhuman. After the Home Secretary's Statement to the other place
yesterday, I believe that that is even more the
case.</p><p><a name="061010162000039"></a>We are told that we are
to have more prisons. Prisons are to be recategorised to accommodate
prisoners that they were never meant to house. There is going to be
maximum flexibility within the prison estate&#151;whatever that
means&#151;and we are to use police cells for convicted prisoners. At
the same time, if the Bill goes through unamended, the real vigour of
the prisons inspectorate will have been
lost.</p><p><a name="061010162000040"></a>The overcrowding in our
prisons is pertinent to this debate because overcrowding means that
rules cannot be kept to and prisoners&#146; rights go out of the
window. The number of prisoners in the system and their welfare go
hand-in-hand, and the prison inspectors are the guardians of that
welfare.</p><p><a name="061010162000041"></a>As the noble Lord
said, this is not a new position in which the country finds
itself&#151;we have been here before. In the late 1980s, the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, the then Lord Chief Justice, in his
inquiries into the Prison Service following the Strangeways riots,
identified overcrowding as bringing perpetual crisis management to the
system. He was right. Considering a reduction in the individual
independence of the prisons inspectorate at this time and proposing to
lump it in with other inspectorates is wrong. If there has ever been a
time when there is a need for a hands-on separate prisons inspectorate,
it is now.</p><p><a name="061010162000042"></a>In July, I told the
House that, although it might be expected that the Prison
Officers&#146; Association would welcome this change in the prisons
inspectorate, in fact it did not do so. This morning I again contacted
the POA general-secretary, Brian Caton, who told me that the POA
continued to believe that the amalgamation of the prisons inspectorate
with other inspectorates
would,</p><ul><a name="061010162000129"></a>&#147;delete its
effect and be
disastrous&#148;.</ul><a name="061010162000117"></a>I
agree. I ask the House to support the
amendment.<p><a name="061010162000043"></a><a name="spnew_104"></a><b><a name="061010162000458"></a>Baroness
Linklater of Butterstone:</b> My Lords, first, I
extend my great congratulations on a most incredible and powerfully
argued speech from the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I think that that
sentiment is probably shared by most of us in the House today. I also
congratulate the right reverend Prelate, whose outrage and astonishment
I share.</p><p><a name="061010162000044"></a>When this issue was
debated in Committee, it was argued passionately and almost unanimously
that the prisons inspectorate should not be merged into the proposed
new mega-inspectorate. Few voices, if any, apart from those of the
Government, were raised in favour of the proposition, and I believe
that the Summer Recess has done nothing to diminish that passion. It is
devoutly to be hoped that this time the Government really will have
ears to hear and will listen.</p><p><a name="061010162000045"></a>The arguments for retaining the separate
identity, independence and unique role of the prisons inspectorate
remain the same and are, I believe, 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_178"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>overwhelming. When we are dealing with issues concerning the treatment
of people who have been deprived of their liberty and are locked away
out of the public gaze, there has to be a body with the independence,
expertise and muscle to ensure that international human rights
standards are complied with and that safety is maintained. That is what
our highly respected and internationally admired prisons inspectorate
currently does.</p><p><a name="061010162000046"></a>We think that
we live in a civilised country but that does not guarantee that what
happens in our prisons is always civilised&#151;far from it. Indeed,
it is arguable that the current chronic overcrowding of our jails makes
it almost inevitable that it is not, when people are literally
warehoused and churned from place to place as beds become available and
any form of rehabilitation is virtually impossible. The excellent
reports from the inspectorate demonstrate that but, more than that,
there is evidence that the inspectorate contributes directly to
promoting change and good practice as a result of its recommendations.
Indeed, it also draws attention to existing good practice and helps to
disseminate that too.</p><p><a name="061010162000047"></a>The
inspectorate is so much more than an auditor of process and systems. It
requires very special knowledge and insight to inspect properly the
treatment in and conditions of penal custody. Without it, there is
little doubt that there is a serious risk that standards of treatment
will drop and breaches of human rights of prisoners will take place.
There is also the concern from the parliamentary Joint Committee on
Human Rights that the Government&#146;s
plan,</p><ul><a name="061010162000130"></a>&#147;would not be
compatible with the requirement of the Optional Protocol to the [UN
Convention against Torture] that there be independent monitoring of
places of detention at the national level&#148;,</ul><a name="061010162000118"></a>without the insertion of specific
guarantees. The six safeguards laid down by the JCHR to ensure
compatibility have not all been addressed by the Government and,
without them, it is not acceptable that current standards should be
undermined by the Government's
proposals.<p><a name="061010162000048"></a>I draw specific
attention to one area which requires a particular specialist skill
within that of the inspectorate as it currently operates. This concerns
the children that we have in custody. Here, there is a separate
specialist team, which uses child-centred, welfare-based criteria and
has a different set of expectations from those used by the adult prison
inspectors. It spends a lot of time talking to children. It conducts
joint inspections with Ofsted and the Social Services Inspectorate,
thus acknowledging the particular needs and issues of this relatively
small but extremely important and sensitive area of inspection. It also
demonstrates how importantly it rates partnership, working with other
experts. We have heard nothing of the provision that the Government
might make for this aspect of the inspectorate's work, and I should
welcome a comment on this from the Minister when she
replies.</p><p><a name="061010162000049"></a>The chief
inspector&#146;s latest annual report demonstrates some alarming
findings. The most recent annual survey of the juvenile population
shows that an average of 73 per cent say that their bell is not 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_179"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>answered within five minutes; more than a third say that they feel
unsafe all the time; a quarter have been insulted or assaulted by
staff; and 2 per cent say that they have been sexually assaulted by
staff. The latest report from Huntercombe YOI expresses serious concern
about the use of force to strip-search children&#151;an acutely
traumatic experience for those who have been abused before coming to
prison, of whom there are a significant number. In the six months
before the inspection, there were four child protection referrals
following allegations made by children of abuse while being
strip-searched. That is evidence taken by very qualified people who
spend time talking to children, and it is taken very
seriously.</p><p><a name="061010162000050"></a>It is interesting
that in the child prisons&#151;the STCs&#151;inspections are
carried out by CSCI alone because the children are very young. It took
an investigation by my noble friend Lord Carlile into the treatment of
children in custody to discover children experiencing practices which
would be called child abuse in any other non-custodial setting. That
demonstrates the real specialism of the
inspectorate.</p><p><a name="061010162000051"></a>That is all
shocking evidence which needs to be exposed to protect this
particularly difficult and vulnerable group within the prison
population&#151;the children. As I have shown, it requires very
specialist skills to uncover it, even when YJB monitors are on-site.
How can we possibly allow this work to be diluted or compromised? I
sincerely hope that this time the Government will be able to listen to
the arguments from all sides of the House and reconsider their
position, where the whole will be far less than the sum of its parts.
There is too much at stake.</p><h5><a name="061010162000133"></a>7

Blake escaped from prison, and the Mountbatten report was produced
afterwards. At the end of that report, I was approached, along with
some rather special people with whom I was living at the time, and
asked to go round prisons, to look at them and to produce some
suggestions about making them harder to escape from. I had the full
support of every prison governor and many of the senior warders. I
visited, with a little team, and lived in prison. I hope we did our job
well.</p><p><a name="061010162000053"></a>I got very close to the
then inspector of prisons whom I thought was a remarkable man. Even
then he was worried. I shall not say which political party was in power
and speaking from these Benches it does not really matter. He told me
that because there had been a disaster, the heavy hand of government
was on him every day&#151;harder and harder&#151;and he was
frightened of losing his independence as the Chief Inspector of
Prisons. We did what we could to help him&#151;I am not saying that
that was very successful&#151;but the government of the day did not
treat him particularly well. The lesson I learnt over several months in
the prisons business was that such a man or woman must be entirely
independent, reporting only to the very highest in the land at top
Secretary of State level. I am rather horrified by what is being
proposed tonight. I think it is completely
wrong.</p>

I have the privilege of chairing the All-Party Group on Penal Affairs.
The Government&#146;s proposal to abolish the independent inspector
of prisons is entirely perverse, not least at this time. My noble
friend Lady Quin objected to the word &#147;crisis&#148;, but
perhaps we can agree on the word &#147;failure&#148;. Any system
that spends &#163;37,000 of taxpayers' money every year on locking up
each prisoner when two years later 73 in every 100 are back behind bars
must be rated as a failure. I am bothered and alarmed that there is not
more public concern over that waste of resources. Something clearly is
not working in the prison
system.</p><p><a name="061010162000056"></a>I am especially
bothered about the proposals relating to the inspector of prisons as it
is precisely at times of overcrowding, with jails bulging at the gates,
that added pressures are put on staff. Added pressures on staff mean
that mistakes are made, rules are broken and the rights of those whom
we lock up are not respected, but ignored. The bigger the pressures on
overcrowding, the more mistakes are made, and any attempt at sensible
rehabilitation and proper, consistent education goes out the window as
well. That is bad enough and adds to the waste of resources but now,
because of the pressures on staff, under the Government&#146;s
proposals, those behind locked doors will not be properly
inspected.</p><p><a name="061010162000057"></a>I
would like the Minister to explain to the House what extra benefits we
shall receive from this new jumbo system of inspection of our prisons.
What is Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons not doing now that
will be more effectively done under this amalgamated system? I hope my
noble friend can spell that out because there has to be a reason for
this proposal that makes some sense. It gives me no pleasure to say
that the Government will not have my support tonight on this proposal.
They do not deserve it.</p><p><a name="061010162000058"></a>We
have an outstanding system of inspection of our prisons that is
literally the envy of the world. I agree with every word that the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, a very distinguished former Chief Inspector of
Prisons, has said. People from all over the world beat a path to the
door of whoever holds the office of Chief Inspector of Prisons to learn
how we do this. The pity is that, dare I say, over the years successive
governments and successive Home Secretaries have not taken enough
notice of what inspectors have said. Is it not right that time without
number the response is, &#147;That was six or eight or nine months
ago and most of these recommendations have been put in place&#148;?
We know that that simply is not the
case.</p><p><a name="061010162000059"></a>I urge the Minister to
listen to what is being said all around the House. This system deserves
and demands to be kept in place, especially at times when we are

Anelay of St Johns:</b> My Lords, I add the support
of these Benches to all the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham. Grouped with those are two rather modest amendments in my
name&#151;Amendments Nos. 88 and 89&#151;and I suggest that the
mood of the House might not be with me were I to try to speak to them.
I propose to table them at Third Reading for consideration, if the
Minister is happy with that. They relate to Her Majesty's Inspectorate
of Constabulary.</p><p><a name="061010162000061"></a>The guiding
principle to which we have adhered is that it is wrong to damage the
authority and independence of the Inspectorate of Prisons. We believe
that the Government&#146;s proposals would do just that. In
Committee, I set out our beliefs and arguments in detail. It would not
be appropriate for me at this stage to repeat
them.</p><p><a name="061010162000062"></a>I recall that, a lifetime
ago, when I was a student reading law reports and trying with my addled
brain to make sense of them, one member of the Court of Appeal seemed
to say almost every time merely, &#147;I agree and have nothing to
add&#148;. I used to wonder why he wasted that opportunity to put
forward his point of view. Tonight is that time. The passionate
convictions have been put and the expertise has been revealed by all
those who have exposed the weaknesses of the Government&#146;s
proposals. All the arguments have been persuasive. So I agree and have
nothing to add, except my passionate conviction that the amendments
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, are
right.</p><p><a name="061010162000063"></a><a name="spnew_109"></a><b><a name="_spnew52"></a><a name="061010162000463"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I have, of course,
listened with the greatest care&#151;and with a little alarm and
anxiety&#151;to everything that has been said. The noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, in his very powerful speech said, &#147;Don't shoot the
messenger&#148;. In addition he suggested that the messenger was the
purveyor of objective information. These amendments are not designed to
shoot and do not shoot the messenger. I say to the noble Earl, Lord
Caithness, that I have never for one moment ever thought, &#147;Who
will rid me of this troublesome
inspector?&#148;.</p><p><a name="061010162000064"></a><a name="spnew_110"></a><b><a name="061010162000464"></a>The

Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I understood him to
have felt that. I do not share his anxiety. We have understood that
inspection, with all its rigour and its painful, acute attention,
brings to our scrutiny something that nothing else could give us. I
agree with all those who say that we demand and need that level of
acute objectivity. I do not hesitate to say that there are some who are
thereby greatly assisted in Government. The argument in support of
certain changes and difficulties becomes easier if there is support,
encouragement, information and data in a report, enabling them to make
it with greater power. I see the noble Lord, Lord Elton, who has
doubtless had a common experience, nodding his head. I make it plain to
the House that we do not 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_182"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make these changes on the basis that they will dilute, divert or in any
way subtract from the acuity which has been brought to bear on this
issue. Inspection has
value.</p><p><a name="061010162000066"></a>However,
as wonderful as our inspector of prisons is now and has been, all the
successors in title are equally difficult and long may it be so. Noble
Lords will perhaps remember his honour Judge Tumim, who was succeeded
by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. Anyone who thought that the
replacement would make it easier soon learnt their mistake. After the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, shuffled off this particular mortal coil,
Anne Owers took up the cudgels. She has been equally vigorous. We have
on each occasion found someone of real calibre to discharge this duty.
If anyone wishes to know whether super-human beings exist, they need
only listen to the debates in this House. We seem to have a large
number of them here.</p><p><a name="061010162000067"></a>Our
proposals will not undermine the quality of inspection. My noble friend
Lord Corbett asked what this new inspectorate adds. It adds a great
deal. I remind the House that we are talking about five independent
inspectorates, each of them excellent. We rely on each to give us that
level of change. Things have changed, however, and I must remind the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, how much. He talked about a justice
inspectorate working to a single Minister, and points out that there
are three. On a number of occasions, I have shared with this House the
significant changes since the 2003 Act. The creation of the National
Criminal Justice Board with the local criminal justice boards means
that the three Ministers, together with the subordinate Ministers who
discharge this duty, come together in the National Criminal Justice
Board every month to make significant decisions about how the criminal
justice system should be managed end to end.</p><p><a name="061010162000068"></a>Through that process, we have learnt
that the system must be just that if we are to protect individuals, and
provide rehabilitation and change. The right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Worcester said that he was shocked and surprised. I confess
that I was shocked and surprised that he should think that we are in
any way cynical about our work. I assure him that the passion we feel
for changing is by no means diminished, and any action in this regard,
although we may disagree, is not due to any degree of <I>male
fides</I>. I hope that he will accept that as the truth.
</p><p><a name="061010162000069"></a>Let us look at the added
value. There are huge gaps in what we do and what we know, which must
be filled. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said that while 80,000
people are in our prisons, only a small percentage would be subject to
supervision. I again remind him of the changes in the 2003 Act, meaning
that in the majority of sentences people will spend part of their time
in custody and the rest in the
community.</p><p><a name="061010162000070"></a><a name="spnew_112"></a><b><a name="061010162000466"></a>Lord
Ramsbotham:</b> My Lords, I did not say &#147;a
small proportion&#148;. I said &#147;less than half&#148;. I
think I am right in saying that some of the provisions of the 2003 Act,
such as custody plus, have not been able to be enacted. That may well
be the intention, but I suggest that it is not currently the
case.</p>

Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, the system we are
putting in place is not simply to deal with the situation today, but
the whole framework we wish to have in place for the criminal justice
system as a whole. We are moving to a situation when it will not just
be the period in prison, but will also extend to the period in the
community. We are determined to reduce the unacceptable level of
recidivism. That involves the seven pathways&#151;which the noble
Lord will know about&#151;the work we must do across the piece, and
the link between the juvenile estate and the adult estate and making
sure they dovetail. We are not prescribing a framework for what is now,
but what will be. That is an important issue.</p><p><a name="061010162000072"></a>We believe that we have fully registered
the concerns about dilution of prisons inspectorates. The Bill
preserves the existing remit of the Chief Inspector of Prisons as a
special duty. It places a statutory duty on the chief inspector to
maintain expertise in inspectorate staff. Transition will be managed to
ensure business continuity. On the date, we have of course made plain
that this will take time. We said that we would only abolish the
prisons inspectorate when the new chief inspector is fully able to take
on the role. To facilitate a smooth transition, the appointment of the
current Chief Inspector of Prisons has been extended until April 2008.
It is hoped that the timetable will encompass such a smooth transition
before then. However, it is of course open to Ministers to review a
further extension if the timetable proves not to fit into the April
2008 framework. That is what we intend, and how we propose to deal with
it.</p><p><a name="061010162000073"></a>There has been a
suggestion that this could be a cost issue&#151;my noble friend Lady
Quin was concerned about costs. I assure her and the House that we
expect a one-off cost of setting up the inspectorate of about &#163;2
million. Over time, there should be some efficiency savings, but we
expect to maintain total annual funding at broadly existing levels:
approximately &#163;20 million per year. Those costs will be met by
the business areas in the Home Office, the Department for
Constitutional Affairs and the office of the Attorney-General, who are
responsible for funding the existing
five&#151;</p><p><a name="061010162000074"></a><a name="spnew_114"></a><b><a name="061010162000468"></a>The
Lord Bishop of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I thank the
Minister for giving way. Will she confirm that, under the new
arrangements, it will be for the new chief inspector to determine the
budgetary priorities between the various aspects of the inspection?
Does she accept that one of the worries that many of us have is that
ministerial direction may influence those priorities in such a way as
to impede the proper functions of the prisons
inspectorate?</p><p><a name="061010162000075"></a><a name="spnew_115"></a><b><a name="061010162000469"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I understand that
that is an anxiety. That is why, in structuring, we are putting a
specific duty on the existing remit of the chief inspector to ensure
that the prisons duty will be carried out. I assure your Lordships that
we will be as zealous about those matters as we are now. That is not
going to change.</p>

Lester of Herne Hill:</b> My Lords, does the Minister
accept that every single speaker this evening, other than the Minister,
has indicated that they regard the present system as making Ministers
and the Prison Service more accountable? Would it not therefore be
sensible not to diminish public confidence in the system, but to keep
the system as it is now for the sake of public
confidence?</p><p><a name="061010162000077"></a><a name="spnew_117"></a><b><a name="061010162000471"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I can assure the
noble Lord that although I have been in this House for quite a long
time, my hearing has not been diminished. I understand what has been
said and I have internally digested it. It is only right and fair that
I should say to the House that I understand and hear noble
Lords&#146; anxiety. I understand what they fear and, indeed, why
they fear it, but it is my role to try to assist the House to
understand why those fears, which have been properly, eloquently and
expansively expressed, are not founded in fact. It is of course open to
the House in due course to disagree, but that is our democracy and that
is the purpose. If there is only one person who will defend the
Government&#146;s position, your Lordships may notice that it should
be me.</p><p><a name="061010162000078"></a>We have considered these
issues because these concerns were very much our concerns. We have
carefully considered the recommendations of the Joint Committee on
Human Rights and are now introducing an express requirement that every
place of detention should be inspected and clarifying that nothing can
prevent the chief inspector from making unannounced inspections. That
meets the proper concerns expressed. We have also considered the
concern that there will no longer be a single senior independent
office-holder with sole responsibility for prison inspections. We
intend to develop a strong senior management structure with
function-based heads, backed up by the retention of existing specialist
expertise throughout organisations to whom the chief inspector can
delegate responsibility for specific areas. We are not seeking to
diminish that level of expertise. That is true not just for
prisons.</p><p><a name="061010162000079"></a>The only other matter
to answer is the query of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, about the
immigration regulator. That position has yet to be decided, but I will
certainly make sure that the House is kept informed. We will not
commence the justice inspectorate&#146;s new duty to inspect the
immigration enforcement system until the position is clear. Meanwhile,
there will be no break in the inspection of immigration detention
facilities.</p><p><a name="061010162000080"></a><a name="spnew_118"></a><b><a name="061010162000472"></a>Lord

look at the health and safety issues but at the relationship with
inmates, the transfers and the planning of care
plans.</p><p><a name="061010162000082"></a>As regards the
specialists, we will now have a specialist team, independently
scrutinising these issues, which we believe will add value to what is
already done. It will not diminish what is being done, because we hope
that that will be maintained, but in addition there will be a greater
degree of expertise and acuity from the other professionals conducting
the joint inspections.</p><p><a name="061010162000083"></a>A number
of reports, not least from Andrew Bridges, the Chief Inspector of
Probation, have outlined graphically how they see the added value. We
believe that as a result of the joined-up working, we will be able to
get not only what we have now, but the added value of a joined-up
inspection. For those reasons, I invite the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, not to press his amendment. Hell will doubtless freeze over
first.</p><p><a name="061010162000084"></a><a name="spnew_120"></a><b><a name="061010162000474"></a>Lord

Garden</b> rose to ask Her Majesty&#146;s
Government what further assistance they are providing for the
reconstruction and security of
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="061010162000100"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, this Question was originally tabled in the
name of my noble friend Lady Northover. I much regret that, because of
family illness, she is not here to open this
debate.</p><p><a name="061010162000101"></a>We have supported the
agenda for Afghanistan set out by Jack Straw some five years ago. It
was clear that the international community had failed the country at
the end of the Cold War and that we had to change it from the haven for
terrorism that it had become. This required the international community
working together on reconstruction and economic development which, in
turn, required political reform and adequate security for the rule of
law.</p><p><a name="061010162000102"></a>During the past five
years, progress has been made&#151;I am sure that the Minister will
tell us about that progress&#151;but it has been much slower than it
should have been. That is because the main players moved resources to
the foolish adventures in Iraq. The trends are now not as positive as
we might wish. Non-governmental organisations are reporting that
deteriorating security in many formerly peaceful provinces has resulted
in a disabling environment for development. Although there is visible
economic activity and improvement of infrastructure in many parts of
the country, persistent unemployment and high levels of corruption are
increasingly problematic. I shall focus primarily on the new
developments this year, and ask the Minister several questions about
the effect of the changes on overall progress and what the British
Government intend to do about them. Unlike in Iraq, we have benchmarks
against which to measure progress. The Afghanistan compact was drawn up
in London in January, and gives us those benchmarks for a range of
issues, including security, drugs, gender equality, and social and
economic development.</p><p><a name="061010162000103"></a>Although
formulated only nine months ago, these benchmarks now seem overly
optimistic. For example, all illegal armed groups will be disarmed by 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_189"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the end of 2007 in all provinces. Does the Minister believe that this is
still achievable? By the end of 2010, there will be in place effective
measures that contribute to the elimination of poppy cultivation. After
this year, which showed a 60 per cent rise in the total poppy harvest,
where are the UK priorities now? By the end of 2010, the national
action plan for women in Afghanistan will have been fully implemented,
and female participation in all Afghan governance institutions will be
strengthened, so the compact says. Does the Minister agree that the
extension of education to girls&#151;one of the major achievements
since 2001&#151;is now being threatened by the widespread closure of
schools in the south? What are Her Majesty&#146;s Government doing to
help to provide safe access to education for girls in Afghanistan and
protection for female government employees working in high-risk
areas?</p><p><a name="061010162000104"></a>The United Nations and
the Afghan Government launched a drought appeal in July. Why has the
United Kingdom not committed any funds to the appeal so far? In all
this, the security strategy is key. As we heard earlier this afternoon,
NATO has taken responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan. The recent
fighting in the south, including Operation Medusa in Kandahar province,
has had a major impact on civilians. The Afghan Government have
reported that 4,000 families in Helmand and 2,500 families in Kandahar
have been displaced as a result of this ongoing conflict. Will the
Minister tell us what assessment the British Government have made of
the humanitarian effects of the fighting in the south?</p><p><a name="061010162000105"></a>For five years, the United States has
led the coalition under the banner of Operation Enduring Freedom, which
has been pounding the south and the east in a failed attempt to find
Osama bin Laden. No significant reconstruction work has been done
there, and the Taliban has grown experienced and more confident. Nor,
even after five years, do we seem to have much of an intelligence
picture of the operational theatre, given the mis-assessment of the
past three months. Until today, I have not joined in the criticism
about a confused strategy. While NATO and Operation Enduring Freedom
had separate geographical areas of responsibility, the strategy was
perhaps manageable, if unusual. As I indicated earlier today in our
debate on the Statement on Iraq and Afghanistan, I am seriously
concerned. NATO is responsible for the whole of Afghanistan through the
ISAF mission. Meanwhile, 8,000 troops under American control will
operate under Operation Enduring Freedom, and the US-controlled air
power will not be transferred to NATO. Was there ever a military
operation like this before, with two major forces with overlapping
remits operating in the same areas? In February, when the United States
takes command of NATO forces, which agenda will have priority? This is
of real concern to NGOs operating in the field. They have found it very
difficult to near impossible to work in a theatre where offensive air
power is the weapon of choice.</p><p><a name="061010162000106"></a>But this is not the only turf war. Did
the Minister read Christina Lamb&#146;s report from Afghanistan in
the latest edition of the <I>Sunday Times</I>, in which she said that a
DfID representative speaking about 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_190"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reconstruction work in Helmand province could cite only the rebuilding
of market stalls in two districts? She went on to report that the
British military wanted DfID to hand over some of its funds to enable
them to carry out work. Her article claims that the military are locked
in a debate with DfID over the strategy for the &#163;20 million
available to spend in Helmand. DfID wants long-term projects, and the
military want to get jobs to Afghans now. Indeed, the comments of the
noble Lord, Lord Drayson, this afternoon seemed to reinforce this view
of some difference between the military and the development
strategy.</p><p><a name="061010162000107"></a>The <I>Sunday Times
</I>article quoted the NATO commander Lieutenant-General David Richards
as saying:</p><ul><a name="061010162000126"></a>&#147;The
military can&#146;t do much more - it&#146;s up to the government
and development agencies. At the moment somehow it isn&#146;t
happening and we&#146;re beginning to lose
time&#148;.</ul><a name="061010162000119"></a>When we talk
to the NGOs, however, they are critical of the funds going to military
aspects compared with the money available for development work. Does
the Minister agree that the Ministry of Defence, DfID and the NGOs must
have a common purpose? Where does the Foreign Office stand in these
disputes? Does it favour the quick-fix approach offered by the
military, or the long-term sustainable development approach for which
the development agencies are arguing? Are the British Government
providing sufficient resources to do both? Both are obviously
important.<p><a name="061010162000108"></a>We on these
Benches have no doubt that the future of Afghanistan is vital to the
long-term security of United Kingdom citizens, as well as the greater
aim of providing security for the people of Afghanistan. It is already
a difficult task; it will become an impossible one if the United States
and NATO operate different military strategies at the same time in the
same place, and if the military and the aid agencies are in dispute.
Will the Minister give us some assurance that these tensions are being
addressed?</p><h5><a name="061010162000138"></a>7.47
pm</h5><p><a name="061010162000109"></a><a name="spnew_125"></a><b><a name="_spnew54"></a><a name="061010162000479"></a>Lord
Brennan:</b> My Lords, I commend the
Government&#146;s programme for Afghanistan, but I recommend that
they pursue that programme, first, with a considered and flexible
strategy, secondly with caution, and thirdly with the opportunity for
regular review. Above all, the Government must strive to avoid a
significant gap being created between their political aspirations and
the capacity to execute those aspirations with the military or in the
development field, both of which are inextricably linked. I take this
cautious view because historically Afghanistan is a complex and
difficult geopolitical arena militarily. It survived 20 Russian
divisions and saw the rise and fall of the Taliban in bloody
circumstances. There is a Pashtun revival and a porous border with
Pakistan, so history suggests the caution that I have recommended. With
regard to aid, it is a misuse of words to speak of reconstruction in
Afghanistan. Rather, it is a process of construction. That means time,
money and long-term effort and commitment. The question is whether it
will work for development. 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_191"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum></p><p><a name="061010162000110"></a>Militarily and in the field of
development, this country should determine what is best for that
country and what is within our reasonable capacity to help it to
achieve that. That means considering both the short-term and the
long-term strategy. As of 5 October, NATO has taken military
command of the military situation in Afghanistan under the leadership
of Brigadier-General Richards. Military men in his position are careful
in their choice of words. Earlier this week, he said that we were at a
tipping point and had six months in which to achieve a significant
change so that the people are with us and are not driven against us.
That is a very tight and very tough timetable within which to achieve
his declared objective of having the people come on the side of NATO
and the Afghan Government. So what is the short-term
strategy?</p><p><a name="061010162000111"></a>Secondly,
I turn to the long term. History demands that if you enter Afghanistan
to seek to change it you thereby commit yourself to a process of a
number of years. That commitment I understand to have been made by this
country and its partners in NATO. They must fulfil that commitment;
that is, all of them, not just us. NATO is with us and its member
countries acting as a group of common partners with shared objectives,
which means that you have to commit yourself to the responsibility of
supply and potential damage to your troops. At the moment, the
relationship of combat troops to the rest in NATO is wholly out of
proportion. How can NATO, therefore, be seen to make that change unless
there is more
commitment?</p><p><a name="061010162000112"></a>Thirdly, do we have
enough strategic assets as a NATO force, not just British helicopters
for British troops? What is our alternative strategy if it is not to be
NATO, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, raised this afternoon?
Finally, since 2001 we have contributed &#163;390 million to that
country through DfID in aid. It is our fifth largest target for
donations and we are the second largest aid provider. Have we carried
out a results-based analysis? Is it going the right way? These are very
large sums of money to direct to Afghanistan. I regret to mention the
introduction of the Promulgation of Virtue and Prohibition of Vice
Committee. The title bemuses us, but what does it mean for women in
Afghanistan if we are spending this kind of money? I close positively.
We as a Government are giving leadership, which means responsibility by
us to lead others in the objectives that we have
declared.</p><h5><a name="061010165000024"></a>7.52

D'Souza:</b> My Lords, I thank, first, the noble
Baroness, Lady Northover, albeit in her absence, for having instituted
this debate; secondly, the noble Lord, Lord Garden, for introducing it;
and, thirdly, the Government for having made a substantial commitment
over the years to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Long may that
continue. However, Afghanistan remains a fragile state&#151;not,
thankfully, as fragile as it was, but nevertheless certainly not
stable.</p><p><a name="061010165000002"></a>I want to look briefly
at the logic of the multilateral aid programme and to question the 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_192"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decisions by major donors to channel millions of dollars of aid largely
through the Afghan Government to the detriment of indigenous and other
NGOs, many of which have been working in Afghanistan for many years.
The UK Government draw a distinction between the US search and destroy
mission and the UK&#146;s mission which
is,</p><ul><a name="061010165000023"></a>&#147;firmly centred
on the reconstruction effort ... actions will always have the
primacy of the reconstruction effort in mind ... [the UK troops]
are not there to wage war but to help
rebuild&#148;.</ul><p><a name="061010165000003"></a>The aim of
the donor community as laid out in the Bonn process and underlined
again at the London conference earlier this year was and is to build
capacity in all sectors in Afghanistan. Last January, donors launched
the Afghanistan compact, part of which was concerned with ensuring that
aid be allocated almost exclusively through the various Afghan
ministries. This has led to a somewhat two-headed approach of
conforming with President Karzai&#146;s wishes, but at the same time
undermining the development goals of the Karzai and Blair governments.
The Department for International Development now channels something
like 70 per cent of aid via the government, with the concomitant
decrease in funds available for those NGOs working at local levels.
That of course allows for a measure of accountability, but in recent
months it has become more obvious that the government simply do not
have the capacity to spend aid money on agreed infrastructure and other
projects. Recent estimates suggest that perhaps only 10 per cent of
available aid money has been
spent.</p><p><a name="061010165000004"></a>Perhaps I may spell out
a little more the consequences of this shift in the allocation of aid
money. NGOs are increasingly becoming sub-contractors without the means
to initiate new programmes, implement training courses and/or work in
areas other than those presently occupied by various military forces.
Given the precarious context in Afghanistan, local programmes that
focus on capacity building, such as support for community development
councils in health, education and local government structure, help to
provide employment. That creates less incentive for young males to join
the insurgents and therefore allows a more robust community that is
less likely to fall to the Taliban at the first fence. Community work
is a form of defence, yet the priority programmes decreed and funded by
central government are short term, have no exit strategies and are
running short of money&#151;some speak of a $20 million deficit. Even
if donors are willing to commit more, maintaining aid flows to rural
communities is beyond the capacity of the government in the absence of
a strong NGO presence.</p><p><a name="061010165000005"></a>A
further consequence of the decrease in direct funding to NGOs is the
shift to development programmes in insecure provinces being delivered
by military personnel, which is an extremely bad precedent and not
necessarily efficient. For example, aid pledged for Helmand but delayed
due to the insurgency is aid money not being spent. As we know,
military spending is six times greater than that spent on development.
There is therefore an urgent need to deploy scarce resources well, if
not synergistically. While it is understandable that the Government may




<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_193"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be reluctant to commit non-military staff to working in insecure
regions, it is precisely in those areas that long-term infrastructure
building is most urgent, and this job is best undertaken by
NGOs.</p><p><a name="061010165000006"></a>A continuation of this
scattered approach, dictated by military rather than perhaps
developmental considerations, will result in an imbalance in aid
programming and an eventual imbalance in the country as a whole, with
some provinces lagging far behind developmentally. Meanwhile, there are
some NGOs mainly employing local staff, such as Afghanaid, that are
prepared to carry on working in some areas considered to be insecure,
but no longer have the means to do
so.</p><p><a name="061010165000007"></a>The argument is for
complementary programming to support the Afghan Government&#146;s
priorities, but to maintain some direct NGO funding to pre-empt the
pulling out by some NGOs due to lack of support. Perhaps I may add that
the Nordic Governments are extremely supportive of their NGOs and
continue to fund them generously, precisely because they understand the
role that they play in reconstruction. I therefore ask the Minister to
reassure us here and the aid community more widely that support will be
continued and/or forthcoming for those NGOs with a proven track record
of serious work in the poorest parts of
Afghanistan.</p><h5><a name="061010165000025"></a>7.57
pm</h5><p><a name="061010165000008"></a><a name="spnew_127"></a><b><a name="_spnew56"></a><a name="061010165000028"></a>Lord
Hannay of Chiswick:</b> My Lords, there seems no
point in denying that things have not gone as well in Afghanistan as
was hoped and, perhaps, unrealistically expected when the Taliban
regime collapsed five years ago. We underestimated the degree of
failure of the Afghan state after a decade of Soviet occupation and
another decade of civil war. We underestimated the intractability of
the problems posed by the fissiparous tendencies of the different
ethnic groups, by the longstanding tradition of interference in
Afghanistan by its neighbours and by the grip that drug production had
taken on Afghanistan&#146;s otherwise almost non-existent rural
economy. We did, here as in many other places, fail to grasp what a
very long, complex task peace-building inevitably is in a failed state.
It is good that the Question introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Garden,
gives us an opportunity to look at all this and reflect on
it.</p><p><a name="061010165000009"></a>One hears quite a few
voices suggesting that we and our NATO allies are unwise to commit
ourselves to new and demanding security operations in the south of the
country and that the international community as a whole is trying to
achieve the impossible task of helping Afghanistan become a stable,
working state with reasonably democratic institutions. Before following
that line of reasoning, it is as well to consider the alternatives. Do
we seriously believe that Afghanistan could yet stand on its own feet
without any or with less external support than is currently being
provided? If not, what would be the likely consequences of our doing
less or simply quitting? The Taliban and the forces of religious
extremism remain a force to be reckoned with, as do the remnants of
al-Qaeda. Can we possibly afford to 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_194"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>run the risk of their achieving something similar to their joint control
of Afghanistan that existed until 2001? Do we not in any case have a
political and moral duty to see through the peace-building tasks that
we assumed when we intervened in Afghanistan that
year?</p><p><a name="061010165000010"></a>The answers to all of
those questions seem to point to our having a national, as well an
international, interest in seeing this matter through, and doing so
with a will and the necessary resources. But are we and the Afghan
Government yet doing all we can to achieve a successful outcome? Is
enough being done to marginalise the former war lords and to ensure
that they do not return or reassert their control over the instruments
of the state? Is enough being done to offer a substantial stake in the
new Afghanistan to the Pashtun tribes of the south and the east,
without whose active co-operation a peaceful and stable Afghanistan
will not be achievable? Have we yet achieved the right policy mix for
dealing with the drug problem? I doubt, frankly, if it is possible to
give an unhesitatingly affirmative answer to any of those
questions.</p><p><a name="061010165000011"></a>Afghanistan has
suffered from external interference for hundreds of years and it has
sometimes interfered in its neighbours itself. Recently we have heard
distant echoes of past quarrels over the tribal areas that straddle the
Afghan-Pakistan border, otherwise known as the Durand line. Is it not
an essential element of any stabilisation of Afghanistan itself that it
and all its neighbours commit themselves to non-interference, to
respect for existing frontiers and to a range of confidence-building
measures and co-operation? In many parts of the world those objectives
are anchored in regional or sub-regional multilateral organisations,
which impose legal obligations as well as expressing good intentions.
Is it not time to construct some such regional approach around
Afghanistan? I raised this point in our debates some five years ago and
I do not believe that much has been achieved. Perhaps the Minister can
say something now about the Government&#146;s thinking on this
point.</p><p><a name="061010165000012"></a>And then there is the
issue of drugs. I should like to hear the Government&#146;s thinking
on this. Is there any aspect of the ideas being promoted by the Senlis
Council, and which would involve some legitimised production for
pharmaceutical purposes, as takes place in certain other countries such
as Turkey, which might over time make sense in Afghanistan?</p><p><a name="061010165000013"></a>Clearly security issues lie at the heart
of any peace-building effort in Afghanistan. It was surely a mistake to
have left large areas to the south and east of the country so long as a
kind of free-fire zone for the US forces and the remnants of the
Taliban. The successes achieved elsewhere by the provisional
reconstruction teams show just how important it is to pursue
reconstruction and development at the same time as security. Perhaps
the Minister could tell the House how those tasks of reconstruction and
development are being pursued in the areas where Britain and other NATO
allies have now taken the responsibility for providing
security.</p>

could be said on this subject. But I would like to end with one
thought, which is in no way specific to Afghanistan. The tasks we have
undertaken in Afghanistan will not be successfully achieved if we
cannot check and reverse the increasing political alienation that is
developing between Muslim countries and the West. That alienation will
not be checked and reversed if we&#151;and that in large part means
the United States&#151;do not resume without delay a serious effort
to solve the Arab-Israel dispute in its entirety. The policy vacuum in
this matter over recent years has wrought havoc to our wider
objectives&#151;the recent events in the Lebanon being the most
recent evidence of that&#151;and it is all set to wreak even more
havoc if we do not collectively do something urgently to fill the
vacuum with a meaningful peace process which has the united support of
the whole international community. That is surely something on which
Europe should now give a

Earl of Sandwich:</b> My Lords, there are positive
signs in Afghanistan&#151;children in school, women&#146;s rights,
the growth of civil society and of people&#146;s power to change
their lives. But these things are happening almost invisibly against a
background of propaganda, insecurity and the uncontrolled cycle of
violence.</p><p><a name="061010165000016"></a>This is not a
conventional civil war, nor even really an ideological one: it is an
old territorial struggle between rival groups and militias. The
coalition decided to back the Northern Alliance against the Taliban,
which is now a convenient name for the enemy. But there were never two
sides, only temporary alliances. In 2001 we expected the whole country
to fall in line because of the undoubted diplomatic skills of a new
Pashtun leader. It has not, although he has held the rest of the
country together remarkably
well.</p><p><a name="061010165000017"></a>Disarmament is an
extremely slow process, as the noble Lord, Lord Garden, pointed out.
The end-2007 deadline is quite unrealistic. No fewer than six district
chiefs and security chiefs of different provinces were fired recently
because they were not co-operating with the disbandment of illegal
armed groups and there are still about 1,800 of those groups. The
Taliban, with its mainly southern commanders and allies such as
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, are never going to co-operate. They have chosen to
repeat the Russian experience and to become the Mujaheddin of today.
They could hold out in the hills for years. I think it is unlikely that
NATO, even under its new combined command, will be able to sustain its
action in the south except along a front closer to Kandahar. It had
much better concentrate on the areas it knows it can
defend.</p><p><a name="061010165000018"></a>We originally sent our
soldiers to defend reconstruction, and I am still of the view, as
others have said, that we can do that in safer areas through the UN
mandate and the PRTs in the north and west, but not in the south. What
has changed is that NATO is now acting through a fighting force as well
as through peace-keeping troops and the Taliban will

Britain came as a friend, but it is also seen as an enemy and we have
to come to terms with that. The longer our troops are fighting limited
actions in Helmand, the less we can be regarded as helping in the
country as a whole.</p><p><a name="061010165000019"></a>There are,
of course, other reasons for the rise in violence, including the
ideological overspill from Iraq and the perception of the US and the UK
in general. We are not winning the hearts and minds of the Arab world
because of our narrow foreign policy. I was very glad to hear that the
Chancellor had made an excellent speech at Chatham House this morning,
pointing out that the hearts and minds campaign has been neglected and
that we must put more resources into it. I hope it gets it from the
Treasury.</p><p><a name="061010165000020"></a>While we are right to
assert human rights and the rule of law, we can do this only within the
capacity of Afghan institutions. As the noble Baroness, Lady
D&#146;Souza, said, these things take years to grow, and to claim,
like President Bush, that we are fighting for democracy is absurd.
Those who are genuinely engaging with the Islamic world in the FCO and
DfID and really understand the culture of the Middle East deserve much
more support. There are some excellent projects, such as the Turquoise
Mountain Foundation, which are slowly reviving traditional crafts and
restoring buildings; NGOs such as CARE are offering courses among the
neediest Afghan women, providing them with income-generating skills.
There is a myriad of valuable NGO projects. It might help if our
various governments did not try to solve all of Afghanistan&#146;s
problems at once.</p><p><a name="061010165000021"></a>So what are
the priorities for DfID and can it stick to them? Poppy eradication or
poverty reduction? Let us concentrate on the poorest farmers, not the
richest ones. Before 2001 we were concerned about the extent of drought
in the north. The same is happening today. Lack of rain last winter
caused severe water shortages and there has been a 50 to 80 per cent
loss of rain-fed cereal
production.</p><p><a name="061010165000022"></a>My questions for
the Government are these. What are we doing to avert hunger in these
areas, with nine provinces facing a critical shortage of drinking
water? What contribution will the UK make to the latest UN drought
appeal? What are the Government doing to help the UNHCR reach the
estimated 15,000 families displaced by the conflict in the south? How
is DfID supporting the attempts of the Afghan Government to provide
safe access to education for girls and boys in high risk areas? The
extension of education to girls is one of the major achievements. It is
now threatened by the widespread closure of schools all over the south.
This issue surely needs more attention if the Afghan people are going
to trust foreign
invaders.</p><h5><a name="061010170000022"></a>8.09

that the intervention in Iraq&#151;which I supported at the
time&#151;will fail to reach its purpose to create a pacified,
unitary and democratic state of Iraq. This makes it all the more
important that the other intervention in the area, that in Afghanistan,
succeeds. Its objective was, and is, more modest. The

reconstruction but concentrates on basic security. If I were a soldier,
I should like this limited mandate which is within the professional
competence of the military. However, enduring freedom&#151;I am using
the words rather than the term&#151;requires more.
</p><p><a name="061010170000002"></a>The problem of Afghanistan is
that three needs are indissolubly interlinked. One is security. The
second, however, is statehood. Foreign military forces are in a sense
expected to represent the elected Government in Kabul&#151;or is it
of Kabul?&#151;throughout the country. It is hoped that they will
prevent Afghanistan becoming a failed state. The third need is
sustainability in the social and economic sense. This involves, above
all, the transformation of a drug economy into one that provides
long-term opportunities without a mafia or warlords&#151;present
rulers are often both&#151;running the economy for the greater glory
of their power.</p><p><a name="061010170000003"></a>One may hope
that one day the international community will have a force capable of
helping with all three objectives. That day, however, is still far
away. One must be satisfied if military intervention forces are trained
in appreciating the needs of statehood and sustainability as well as
security. In any case, the three are closely related. There will be no
security as long as the central state is failing to control local and
regional warlords. There certainly will be no sustainable social and
economic development as long as the drug economy is the main source of
employment and the basis of local and regional power
structures.</p><p><a name="061010170000004"></a>At the moment,
there is an uneasy division of labour between the international troops
charged with guaranteeing security, the training of a police force to
support the elected Government and non-governmental organisations
trying to build elements of a sustainable economy and society. In some
areas, notably in the north of the country, this works reasonably well;
in most areas it does not. When hand grenades were thrown through the
windows of a hospital for women, which a friend of mine had constructed
with the NGO he set up for the purpose, the troops stationed nearby did
not know what to do, to say nothing of the absence of an Afghan police
force representing the elected
government.</p><p><a name="061010170000005"></a>When I reflect on
these and similar incidents, it seems to me that although security
clearly is an important objective, it will be achieved only if and when
the need is met to help the establishment of an effective state of
Afghanistan. Training an Afghan police force matters as much as
fighting renewed Taliban incursions. The curse of
the region&#151;and that now includes Iraq&#151;is failed states.
Hence, state-building is the first objective of intervention. It is no
good winning local battles with insurgents or burning poppy fields if
there is no indigenous and effective state structure which gradually
establishes the monopoly of violence which defines statehood. This
requires a local police force which is loyal and an independent
judiciary as much as elected leaders. It also requires some rethinking
of objectives and of the measures and skills needed to achieve them.
Who is doing the rethinking?</p>

Chidgey:</b> My Lords, in winding up this debate on
behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I stress the importance of not only
the debate but the strength of the contributions made so far tonight. I
am sure they will give the Minister much food for thought.</p><p><a name="061010170000007"></a>My noble friend Lord Garden referred to
the slow progress made in Afghanistan due to the diversion of the
adventures in Iraq. He said that the benchmarks we were aspiring to
only some nine months ago are already failing to be met. The noble
Lord, Lord Brennan, called for caution and for a regular review in the
short and long term because of his concerns brought about by the
history of that troubled region. The noble Baroness, Lady
D&#146;Souza, referred to the fragility of the development programme,
and other noble Lords made similar telling
contributions.</p><p><a name="061010170000008"></a>One fundamental
concern must be the progress being made with reconstruction and
security in Afghanistan. Reconstruction appears not so much to have
stalled as to have hardly started in some provinces. The recent reports
claiming that the outcomes to date of the &#163;20 million DfID
programme in the Helmand province amount to little more than rebuilding
a few market stalls are cause for great
concern.</p><p><a name="061010170000009"></a>The provincial
reconstruction teams programme, much vaunted at the beginning of our
current involvement in Afghanistan, seems to have fallen off the
agenda. Instead, critical appraisals are emerging that the local
development projects undertaken under the umbrella of ISAF and NATO,
while worthy and well executed, are uncoordinated. They are not planned
as part of a provincial or national development programme, thus tending
to be ineffective in progressing towards national reconstruction goals.
Yet our commanders on the ground are reporting that we have, at best,
six months in which to turn things round and convince the Afghan people
that the infrastructure improvements promised are materialising and
that the destruction of their villages through the mayhem of
war-fighting is a costly, yet acceptable, price to pay.</p><p><a name="061010170000010"></a>At present, we seem far from winning
that argument. While President Karzai repeatedly calls for coalition
forces to exercise greater care when conducting air strikes, the
monthly rate of strikes by the US Air Force has reached 750, far
exceeding the monthly rate in Iraq. The resulting collateral damage has
been immense, with shopping districts, schools and transport
infrastructure being destroyed and large numbers of civilians killed or
injured to add to the civilian casualties occurring in the fighting in
the south, which exceeds 50 per cent of total
casualties.</p><p><a name="061010170000011"></a>While
today&#146;s Statement reflected on new schools being built and
children now in school, schools are being destroyed, men and women
teachers murdered and girls denied education on pain of death wherever
the Taliban are back in control. Is it any wonder that Afghanis are
said to be at a tipping point between supporting the coalition and NATO
forces, with the continuing destruction and casualties that that
implies, and turning again to the harsh regime of the Taliban and all
that that implies?</p>

year?</p><h5><a name="061010170000024"></a>8.19

Rawlings:</b> My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord,
Lord Garden, for taking on the Question of the noble Baroness, Lady
Northover, on the progress of peace and stability in Afghanistan. I am
sorry that she is unable to be with us, but send her our best wishes
for her family.</p><p><a name="061010170000016"></a>It has been
invaluable for the House, building on the Statement that we heard
earlier today, to speak out on the treatment of, and attitude towards,
our troops. I add our condolences to the families of those troops who
have been killed or wounded, and pay tribute to all the service men and
women. I should declare my interest as a longstanding patron of the
Afghan Mother and Child Health Clinic.</p><p><a name="061010170000017"></a>It is unfortunate that our efforts in
Afghanistan are linked with the ongoing horrors in Iraq, yet the
ever-climbing fatality figures and violence are only part of the Afghan
story. In Afghanistan, a solid alliance is acting against Taliban
fighters, including the Afghan Government, national forces and NATO
troops, with the support of local people, who remember what was
inflicted upon them by the Taliban during the past 30 years. The
continuing power of warlords, the dependence on poppy production by
many farmers, and the crushing poverty and underdevelopment found in
many regions are unquestionable and well documented.</p><p><a name="061010170000018"></a>These obstacles are
not insurmountable, but Afghanistan's problems will not be solved
easily. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, told us that insufficient
rainfall last month means that 2.5 million people in Afghanistan face a
chronic food crisis. We would be most interested to know what steps Her
Majesty's Government are taking to address this problem. Will the
Minister clarify too what discussions DfID has had with the Foreign
Office&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Garden, mentioned this&#151;before
assigning its 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_200"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>resources to projects in countries where both departments are involved?
I gather that DfID is allegedly funding some reforestation projects in
Pakistan. It is no doubt a worthy project, but, if it is taking place,
are we not in effect paying to plant the trees that are hiding the
Taliban fighters who have moved across the border? It is hardly
joined-up
government.</p><p><a name="061010170000019"></a>Unfortunately,
enormous amounts of foreign aid can sometimes have many unintended
consequences, such as high levels of inflation in certain sectors and
increased corruption. The noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, spoke of
foreign aid agencies. However, these can prevent government agencies
hiring capable staff. What steps are Her Majesty's Government taking to
make certain that their aid is not unwittingly hampering the efforts of
the Afghan Government to build an effective state
apparatus?</p><p><a name="061010170000020"></a>Security, as the
noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, stressed so well, is as important as
reconstruction. Where the former is absent, there cannot be the latter.
Government reports and media sources tell two very different stories
about Armed Forces funding. The Government claim that money was always
available for equipment purchase and is even now being spent on
ensuring that only the best is available for our troops, yet endless
accounts by those in a position to know tell of cost-cutting. The
latter highlights what the figures already indicate: that our Armed
Forces are not being given enough money, men or support when they need
it most. Will the Minister explain to the House, as the noble Lord,
Lord Brennan, asked, what the Government have been doing recently to
encourage the other NATO countries to increase their troop numbers in
Afghanistan? I hope that there will be no more media stories of
equipment failure now that the special reserve fund has been
released.</p><p><a name="061010170000021"></a>We have been in
Afghanistan several times before. History tells us that there are no
easy solutions. Although matters may not be as bleak as the media
continually portray, they are, however, certainly not as rosy as the
Government would like us to believe. I look forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s answer to our questions on food, FCO aid and troops,
and to others put to her
today.</p><h5><a name="061010179000033"></a>8.24

Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Garden, for pursuing this debate. I know that the noble
Baroness, Lady Northover, cannot be in her place and I send her the
Government&#146;s best wishes.</p><p><a name="061010179000003"></a>Afghanistan is one of
the poorest countries in the world and is off-track to meet all the
millennium development goals. Years of conflict and insecurity have
denied basic services that we take for granted, such as healthcare and
schooling. One in four Afghan children still dies before their fifth
birthday. The reconstruction effort in Afghanistan is certainly a
long-term initiative. Achieving our objective of a peaceful, prosperous
and secure Afghanistan will be reliant on the support and commitment of
donor agencies for many years to come. As my noble friend Lord Brennan
said, we must honour that commitment. Do we regularly 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_201"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>review our policy on Afghanistan? Yes, we do, both in DfID and across
government.</p><p><a name="061010179000004"></a>A prosperous and
democratic Afghanistan is crucial to reducing global poverty and
increasing stability in the region. For this reason, the UK is the
second largest bilateral donor. We are fully committed to
Afghanistan&#146;s long-term development. At the London conference in
January 2006, the UK confirmed this by assigning a 10-year development
partnership agreement. This agreement, signed by Prime Minister Blair
and President Karzai, commits DfID to provide &#163;330 million in
development and assistance over the next three years. That forms part
of the UK&#146;s overall pledge of &#163;500 million to reduce
poverty, improve security in governance and tackle the opium industry.
DfID&#146;s budget for Afghanistan is &#163;102 million
for this year, which will rise to &#163;113 million in
2007-08 and &#163;115 million for 2008-09. In addition, DfID
contributes 18 per cent of the European Commission's pledge of
&#8364;1 billion over 2002-07, and over 10 per cent of the World
Bank's spending in Afghanistan of $250 million a year. We also
contribute financially to UN programmes and to the Asian Development
Bank.</p><p><a name="061010179000005"></a>DfID's programme supports
the Government of Afghanistan's interim Afghanistan national
development strategy, launched at the London conference. Our programme
specifically underpins three of the objectives set out in that
document: building effective state institutions, improving economic
management and effectiveness of aid, and improving livelihoods for the
rural poor. I would certainly concur with the noble Lord, Lord
Dahrendorf, that we must work for security, statehood and
sustainability, and that is exactly what I believe we are
doing.</p><p><a name="061010179000006"></a>DfID believes that the
best way to achieve these goals is by supporting Afghans to help
themselves. Thus over 70 per cent of our aid goes directly to the
Government of Afghanistan. The UK is the largest donor to the
government's recurrent budget, covering essential costs such as
salaries for teachers and health workers. I note the concerns expressed
by the noble Baroness, Lady D&#146;Souza, but we believe that it is
the best chance for building effective state institutions that will
last. Directing funds through the Government of Afghanistan enhances
their accountability and authority and, as we know from experience
elsewhere, it is a more effective way of ensuring that development is
sustainable. However, I assure the noble Baroness that we shall
continue to support NGOs.</p><p><a name="061010179000007"></a>DfID
leads the British Government's efforts to develop legal economic
alternatives to opium poppy production. We spent approximately
&#163;45 million for this purpose last year. Part of this funding
contributes to improvements in agricultural opportunities for farmers.
This includes research to help identify, test and implement new crops
and technologies&#151;for example, improvements in the production of
high value crops such as saffron and wheat. We are also promoting other
non-farm economic alternatives. This includes small loans, support for
small scale local infrastructure and labour-intensive public 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_202"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>works. We are providing &#163;20 million over three years to the
Microfinance Investment Support Facility, and women receive nearly 80
per cent of the small loans. Like the USA, however, we do not support
direct compensation as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, but
we support a properly sequenced strategy which means only eradicating
poppy crops where legal livelihoods already
exist.</p><p><a name="061010179000008"></a>The Government share the
disappointment and concern about the increase in opium production in
2006, but we believe the strategy outlined by the Government of
Afghanistan is the right one. This requires not just provision of legal
economic alternatives, but also effective governance and law
enforcement. Some 70 per cent of the increase in planting is in
Helmand, reflecting the security situation, whereas in parts of the
country where there is better security and better governance, drug
cultivation has actually gone down. This is a long-term strategy.
Progress will be gradual and will take many
years.</p><p><a name="061010179000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Hannay, asked about the Senlis Council proposals. The Government of
Afghanistan do not support licit cultivation of opium, and we agree
with them. The proposals are unrealistic because there would be a risk
of a high level of diversion of legal opium into illegal channels. We
also understand it is unlikely that licit Afghan opium would be
economically viable.</p><p><a name="061010179000010"></a>In
Helmand, DfID is working closely with other departments as part of the
wider UK effort to promote economic and social development, to help
improve governance and bring visible benefits to local people. That is
challenging, given the very difficult security environment, but, as the
Statement earlier today made clear, there is now a short window of
opportunity with a more secure environment for reconstruction and
development, thanks to the magnificent efforts of our troops.
Government departments are working closely together, and with the
Afghans, to bring about tangible improvements. I assure the noble Lord,
Lord Garden, that there is common purpose throughout government
departments. However, as my noble friend Lord Drayson said, we need
further to explore opportunities for the military to undertake
projects, but only where security is difficult.</p><p><a name="061010179000011"></a>We are lucky that the British military
has considerable experience working in these sorts of environments, and
with a range of NGOs. There is a short-term and a long-term strategy,
and they are both working in tandem. We have committed over
&#163;30 million over the next three years to the Helmand Agriculture
and Rural Development Programme, which aims to increase economic
opportunities for the rural poor of Helmand through a variety of
programmes led by the Government of Afghanistan. We have also
contributed &#163;4 million to the delivery of quick-impact
activities in Helmand, which are already securing short-term
development results and will help create a foundation for longer-term
development in the province. They are implemented jointly by DfID, the
FCO and the military, and include improving

and sanitation; and building wells and roads.</p><p><a name="061010179000012"></a>With regard to the resurgence of the
Taliban on the porous Afghan/Pakistani border, the Pakistani Government
have recently agreed, in conjunction with the UNHCR and the Afghan
Government, on the need to close down two terrorist training camps in
Baluchistan, although the Pakistani Government do not have the means to
enforce that. Both governments are working closely with UNHCR to find a
long-term solution to the camps. In addition, the FCO, DfID and the
MoD, through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, have just agreed to
fund a project that will look at ways of electronic identification of
suspect individuals in the
camps.</p><p><a name="061010179000013"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady
Rawlings, the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, and others asked about
humanitarian assistance and drought in the north-west. Rural
development is a key priority for DfID. We expect to spend &#163;35
million this year, almost all through the Government of
Afghanistan&#146;s budget, which will help ensure that they have
predictable funding, thus allowing them to respond to their own
priorities, including the drought. We are in regular contact with
UNAMA, the Afghan Government and other UN agencies on their assessment
of the drought, and we attended the most recent update meeting. The
initial drought appeal was launched to secure pledges of in-principle
support, prior to the proper assessment of the scale of the drought.
The assessment results are due later this month, and we will then
consider a UK contribution.</p><p><a name="061010179000014"></a>In
relation to internally displaced persons, the UN is providing emergency
assistance in the form of non-food items and food assistance. Their
estimates suggest that basic needs are being met, and they are not
asking for additional funding. The US has set aside funding to support
the future return of IDPs in the south and the reconstruction of their
homes. It is likely to work through implementing partners such as the
International Organisation for Migration, UN-Habitat and local
business. The UK has already provided $60,000 to the office of the
governor in Helmand to help provide for the immediate needs of

Presidential and parliamentary elections were held. Six million

firmly committed to the long-term development of Afghanistan. We will
seek to ensure that the achievements that we have seen to date are

strongly that the Afghan Government must lead the development effort,

persons nominated by the Association of Police Authorities will assist

authorities&#148;</ul><p><a name="061010179000022"></a>The
noble Baroness said: My Lords, I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 94,
99 and 101 in this grouping in the names of my noble friend Lord
Dholakia and myself. These amendments seek to clarify how police
authorities will be inspected in future. I should be very grateful if
the Minister would explain exactly what is meant by Amendment No. 98. I
wondered whether it was code for giving HMIC the lead role. If so, we
would be happy, but not if that were not the
case.</p><p><a name="061010179000023"></a>The amendments in my name
and that of my noble friend would enable police authority expertise
explicitly to be involved in inspecting police authorities. When we
previously spoke about this amendment in Committee, the Minister was
confident that the current wording of the Bill would achieve this. It
is certainly true that the wording allows the chief inspector to secure
assistance with inspections and ensure there is sufficient expertise
available, but this is general wording applying to all inspections and
is a discretionary power.</p><p><a name="061010179000024"></a>At
this point I thought it might be helpful to read a briefing from HMIC.
Although the briefing deals with the single inspectorate issue, it is
worth highlighting the actual role of the inspector. I am grateful to
HMIC for the briefing, which states with regard to the current role of
HMIC:</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_205"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="061010179000032"></a>&#147;It is important to understand
that the role of inspector in HMIC is very different to that of the
inspection team leaders in the other criminal justice inspectorates. At
its heart, of course, there is a similar responsibility for inspection
of organisations, processes, outcomes and service delivery which would
be found in all the respective job descriptions. In addition, however,
and probably forming the greater part of their work, HMIC inspectors
undertake: Advice to the chief inspector on portfolio specialisms;
Advice to police authorities on chief officer appointments, complaints
and performance issues; Mentoring advice and counselling to chief
constables and chief officers; Trouble-shooting and arbitration in
sensitive and/or complex policing problem areas; Commissioned thematic
examination of key services or areas; Ensuring &#145;organisational
health&#146; through identifying and addressing issues relating to
diversity, information management, governance, resourcing and capacity
and capability; and PDRs of chief constables (in liaison with authority
chairs)&#148;.</ul><p><a name="061010179000025"></a>I thought
that it was important to highlight exactly what it is the inspectors
do. This is a very sensitive area. HMIC is largely made up of people
drawn from police forces, and the majority of people involved in the
arm of the new single inspectorate, which will inspect police
authorities, will continue to be police. This effectively means that
police authorities are being held to account by people whom they once
held to account. That is a constitutionally questionable and
potentially unbalanced situation, unless there is a significant
injection of independent police authority expertise into the
process.</p><p><a name="061010179000026"></a>The amendment would
place on a secure statutory footing the involvement of police authority
members and staff and/or other independent experts in police authority
inspections, overcoming these objections in primary legislation. The
involvement of APA and police authority members and staff in developing
inspection frameworks and conducting police authority inspections has
in the past been more or less accepted by HMIC, which has enough to do
itself. The skills of the Audit Commission in this area are even less
developed, as I will refer to under the next amendment. Because police
authorities are very specialised, we believe that the expert knowledge
and understanding necessary to conduct targeted, balanced and robust
inspections will most readily be found in police authorities.</p><p><a name="061010179000027"></a>The idea is that underlying this
arrangement will be a pool of police authority members and staff
co-ordinated by the APA who will assist with conducting inspections on
something akin to a peer review model. They will, of course, be
required to undertake specialist training before they can become
involved in inspections. Inspection is a very important function, on
which a great deal of public and professional confidence will rest. For
this reason, it is important that skilled and balanced structures
through which to conduct inspections are secured in primary legislation
and are not left to the discretion of one
individual.</p><p><a name="061010179000028"></a>Amendments Nos. 99
and 101 would remove references to police authorities being subject to
joint inspection with the Audit Commission, so that they would be
subject to inspection only by the new CJS inspectorate. That would
leave in place the existing proposals that would make crime and
disorder reduction partnerships subject to joint inspection. At
present, police authorities are inspected by HMIC but 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_206"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>audited by the Audit Commission, and I think we would all agree that
there is considerable room for crossover and duplication between those
two activities. I applaud the intention behind this part of the Bill to
better join up the demands that are made on police authorities in this
respect, but I am not convinced that providing for joint inspection
will achieve that aim.</p><p><a name="061010179000029"></a>I am mindful that the
government amendment in this area adds some clarity. It makes it clear
that the new CJS inspectorate will be in the lead on inspections of
police authorities; but it does not go quite far enough. The Audit
Commission has expert auditors, but they are definitely not experts on
conducting inspections of police authorities; they have no experience
in this field. Audit is, and should be, a distinctly separate function
and an independent safeguard on financial probity separate from
inspection.</p><p><a name="061010179000030"></a>I am all for trying
to reduce duplication, but there are other ways of doing that. I would
not wish that the important independent check on financial governance
is lost in blurring two functions in the way that these proposals risk
doing. Indeed, the prospect of two different sets of inspectors with
different ideas about what should be inspected and how it should be
done might have exactly the opposite effect to streamlining the
process, which is what is intended, and could muddy the waters even
further.</p><h5><a name="061010176000067"></a>8.45
pm</h5><p><a name="061010176000031"></a>Whose opinion takes
precedence? The Audit Commission already has powers in relation to
auditing police authorities and it would seem unnecessary and
superfluous to add inspection to those powers, when that could better
be undertaken by HMIC, or the elements of it that would transfer to the
new inspectorate, which has much more experience in this
area.</p><p><a name="061010176000032"></a>I agree that it would be
sensible for the Audit Commission to have a role in the inspection of
crime and disorder reduction partnerships, because local authorities
significantly contribute to those partnerships and the Audit Commission
has a remit in respect of their functions. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="061010176000033"></a><a name="spnew_134"></a><b><a name="061010176000070"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, this group contains
government amendments and I shall address those and the issues which
the noble Baroness touched on at an earlier
stage.</p><p><a name="061010176000034"></a>Government
Amendments Nos. 98 and 100 in this group are essentially technical in
nature, although they raise issues similar to the amendments to which
the noble Baroness referred. Paragraph 12 of Schedule 9 already places
a requirement on the chief inspector to act jointly with the Audit
Commission&#151;in Wales, the Auditor General&#151;when inspecting
police authorities and crime and disorder reduction
partnerships.</p><p><a name="061010176000035"></a>We consider it
important that in these areas, where there is a substantial overlap
between the interests of the two inspectorates, there should be no
doubt about the expectation of joint working, so that expertise is
shared and duplication of activity avoided. However, the inspection
powers of the chief inspector are not mirrored precisely in those of
the Audit Commission. 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_207"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum></p><p><a name="061010176000036"></a>Our amendment prevents a
situation arising where the chief inspector might be required to act
jointly with the Audit Commission, but could not do so because the
Audit Commission had no power to inspect the matter in question. It
also ensures that joint action is required only where the Audit
Commission considers it necessary or desirable to act jointly in the
interests of sharing expertise or avoiding duplication. We believe that
our amendment will ensure that the joint working requirement functions
as intended.</p><p><a name="061010176000037"></a>Amendment No. 94
seeks to provide for an element of peer review in the inspection of
police authorities. I confess sometimes to being ambivalent about the
case for peer review, but noble Lords have not been slow to express
their concerns about the perceived lack of independence of the
Inspectorate for Justice, Community Safety and Custody.</p><p><a name="061010176000038"></a>The amendment could be seen as
compromising the very independence that noble Lords on the Liberal
Democrat Benches are elsewhere seeking to reinforce. If we take the
amendment to its logical conclusion, the Association of Chief Police
Officers should be able to peer review the inspection of the police
service and the Prison Governors Association peer review the inspection
of prisons.</p><p><a name="061010176000039"></a>It could be
argued, as the noble Baroness has done, that police authorities are a
different beast and therefore a special case. In the spirit of wanting
to enhance the independence of the inspectorate, we should leave it to
the judgment of the chief inspector to determine how inspections are
carried out. It may be that the chief inspector concludes that there is
scope for some form of peer review, but we should not mandate this and
thereby tie the hands of the chief inspector.</p><p><a name="061010176000040"></a>Amendments Nos. 99 and 101 seek to
remove the role of the Audit Commission in the inspection of police
authorities and crime and disorder reduction partnerships. I know that
this matter has exercised the noble Baroness, but I do not agree that
the Audit Commission does not have a valuable role to play. We
can&#151;perhaps outside the debates around this
inspectorate&#151;all agree that the Audit Commission can be proud of
its record in the inspection of the quality and cost-effectiveness of a
whole range of local-authority-run services. It regularly works with
other inspectorates; for example, it works with Ofsted to deliver
comprehensive performance assessments and joint area reviews of
children and young people&#146;s services, and with Her
Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary to deliver community
safety inspections. Our contention is that, with the wealth of
experience that the Audit Commission can bring, it makes sense for it
to continue to have a role once the new inspectorate is
established.</p><p><a name="061010176000041"></a>If I heard the
noble Baroness correctly, I think that she was asserting that the Audit
Commission should just look at matters relating to money. I have
considerable experience of dealing with local and district auditors. To
understand where the money is going, they have to understand the
management processes and the way in which services are run. With 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_208"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that broader wealth of experience, those conducting audit inspections
are very well suited to carrying out joint inspections and work in
support of other types of inspectorate.</p><p><a name="061010176000042"></a>The joint action provisions in the Bill
ensure that the inspected bodies are inspected in a joined-up fashion,
where more than one body has a role to play in inspecting them. The
area covered by the new inspectorate will necessarily overlap with the
remit of the Audit Commission. Given the experience, role and duties of
the commission, it is important that the two bodies work closely
together to ensure that inspected bodies are not burdened with repeat
inspections by one organisation and then
another.</p><p><a name="061010176000043"></a>Finally, I should
mention now, by way of advance notice, that we expect to bring forward
at Third Reading a minor technical amendment to the provision for
transfer of staff to the new chief inspector in Schedule 10, to ensure
that it covers all the personnel of the existing
inspectorates.</p><p><a name="061010176000044"></a>I cannot agree
with the noble Baroness&#146;s rather narrow view of the role of the
Audit Commission and we cannot lend our support to her amendments. I
urge her to think long and hard about what she is trying to do with the
inspectorate and not to press the amendments this
evening.</p><p><a name="061010176000045"></a><a name="spnew_135"></a><b><a name="061010176000071"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, once again I have
listened carefully to what the noble Lord has said. We are as far apart
now as we ever were on what I am trying to do. He says that the Audit
Commission has to understand how authorities are run and he has
explained that he has had a lot of experience of seeing how it has
operated within councils. I have had 20 years of seeing how it has
operated within various councils, so he is not the only one who knows
about that. I am perfectly happy with what the Audit Commission does
there. It spends a great deal of money&#151;a huge amount of
money&#151;telling us how it is.</p><p><a name="061010176000046"></a>However, I want to know how it is going
to tell police authorities how it is when it has no expertise in how
those authorities are brought together, how they are run, or anything
else. I feel that this is not a job for the Audit Commission. By all
means, keep it doing the job that it is doing ensuring that police
authorities are spending their money properly. I am perfectly happy
with that, because it has done a good job in those areas. However, it
has not examined the quality and cost-effectiveness or otherwise of
police authorities up and down this country. That is a very specialist
and unusual job and it is very different from dealing with local
councils. The Audit Commission has a lot of expertise in those areas
but not in relation to police authorities. I do not want to give it
another role when it does not need it and it will be no good at
it.</p><p><a name="061010176000047"></a>Once again, I shall be
bringing this matter back at Third Reading. I am sorry that I have to
do that because the Minister has clearly indicated that he has no
intention of moving on it. I simply want the Audit Commission to be
taken out of this issue. It does not know how to do the job, and we
should let HMIC do it. I should be perfectly happy with that. We should

various specified bodies when preparing an inspection programme. That
is intended to ensure the responsiveness of the inspection regime to
those it serves.</p><p><a name="061010176000053"></a>In Committee,
my noble friend Lady Henig asked that we specifically include among the
bodies which must be consulted those that will be inspected as part of
the proposed programme. At the time, I agreed to bring back an
appropriate government amendment to place such a requirement on the
chief inspector.</p><p><a name="061010176000054"></a>I should add
that we are aware that many other kinds of bodies are now regularly
consulted by the five inspectorates on their programmes&#151;for
example, the Association of Police Authorities in respect of police
inspections. The amendment does not preclude the continuation by the
new chief inspector of those consultations; it merely emphasises the
need for consultation with those most directly impacted on by an
inspection.</p><p><a name="061010176000055"></a>We do not think
that it would be sensible to attempt to list all the other existing and
potential consultees in legislation. In our view, the continuation of
existing arrangements is something that can be left to the good sense
of the chief inspector. We are very reluctant to leave out someone whom
it might then be necessary to include. Therefore, I hope that noble
Lords will be content with the amendment. I beg to

I wonder whether the wording covers the responsibilities of police

limit consultation to those who are directly responsible for the
functions, establishment and other matters which are dealt with by the
inspectors. I know that the Home Office has said that it is basically
up to the common sense of the chief inspector, but it would be helpful
if we could be given a little more reassurance on this
matter.</p>

friend 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_212"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Northesk. He has asked that I convey his apologies to the House. He
simply cannot be present today due to other serious
commitments.</p><p><a name="061010178000022"></a>We covered most of
the ground pertaining to the amendment in Committee and so I do not
propose to dwell on too many of the underlying technicalities. I feel
that I would not be able to and I am extremely grateful to my noble
friend for providing me with a comprehensive speaking note. I also note
that the Government have reformulated the paragraph in the
shape of Amendment No. 129 in the name of the Minister. That ties the
matter to Section 1 and Section 3 offences in the Computer Misuse Act
beyond any doubt and to that extent it is welcome.</p><p><a name="061010178000023"></a>Nevertheless, in the opinion of my noble
friend, the substantive flaw of the provision, the likelihood test,
remains. As my noble friend explained earlier in our proceedings, this
equates to proscribing the supply and distribution of crowbars on the
basis that they are likely to be used in the commission of burglary
offences. Indeed, it is possible to envisage circumstances where the
provision could be deployed to proscribe the supply and distribution of
web-browsing and e-mail programs if only because they are more likely
than not to be used in the commission of hacking
offences.</p><p><a name="061010178000024"></a>The problem here
should not be underestimated. To state the obvious, as broadband and,
thereby, always-on access to the internet becomes more pervasive, so
there is an ever-increasing need for adequately secure and hack-free
systems. In Committee the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, who is in his place,
made the entirely appropriate point that that need is being serviced
more and more regularly by remote access. In this context, as
illustrated by my noble friend in Committee, there is a host of
examples of software programs, often open source code, that can be used
by systems administrators to test that the IT systems are secure, but
that could also be used maliciously. They are, by definition, dual
purpose tools. Frequently, those are downloaded as of need from
trustworthy, that is to say quality assured, sites on the
internet.</p><p><a name="061010178000025"></a>However, because of
the absence of legal certainty and clarity about how the likelihood
test would be applied by the courts, an effect of the provision, if
enacted, will be that trustworthy distribution sites of such software
in the UK will be closed down rather than face the risk of possible
prosecution. Indeed, there is some anecdotal evidence that that is
already happening. Bear in mind that there is simply no way of telling
whether any given program will be used more extensively by the good
guys or by the bad guys&#151;something which can, in any event, vary
considerably over time. In consequence, system administrators and the
like will have to source their software tools from less trustworthy
sites, thereby running the all-too-common risk that they could include
some hidden and, more likely than not, malicious,
functionalities.</p><p><a name="061010178000026"></a>In one rainy
week on holiday in Italy, my husband and I played rather a lot of
scrabble. If I had used that word, I think he might have challenged it,
but I am sure my noble friend knows what it means.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_213"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061010178000027"></a>In effect, the provision, whether in the
form of the current drafting or the amendment of the Minister, all but
guarantees that the internet will be considerably less safe for UK
users. That must be counterproductive and antipathetic, not only to the
Government&#146;s intention here, but also to their wider aspiration
of making the UK the best place in the world for
e-commerce.</p><p><a name="061010178000028"></a>It is also worth
contemplating what benefit would accrue were the provision to be
enacted. As a generality, the vast bulk of criminal and malicious
activity will be caught by the first arm of the clause, subject to the
test of intent. Presumably, therefore, the likelihood test is intended
to apply in instances where the internet is seeded with harmful, or
even malicious, code for potential onward use as an adjunct to hacking
activity, perhaps by &#147;script kiddies&#148;&#151;my noble
friend is testing me here&#151;&#147;code monkeys&#148; and the
like. Without delving too deeply&#151;thank goodness&#151;into the
psychology of such individuals, it is highly unlikely that the
provision would either prove a deterrent for them or that, in reality,
the offence could be adequately investigated and so prosecuted in
practice. In sum, therefore, the provision will almost inevitably do
much more harm than good.</p><p><a name="061010178000029"></a>In
Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, prayed in aid the
Government&#146;s adherence to the virtues of consultation. As he put
it:</p><ul><a name="061010178000125"></a>&#147;We consult
regularly, take on board the results of those consultations and try to
reflect them where relevant in any necessary changes to
legislation&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/07/06; col.
608.]</ul><a name="061010178000090"></a>We do not doubt the
sincerity of this. Nevertheless, given that my noble friend has not
found a single IT professional prepared to endorse the
Government&#146;s proposition here throughout the two-odd years it
has been under consideration, it would be helpful if the Minister could
flesh out how the Home Office perceives the industry&#146;s attitude
towards it. <p><a name="061010178000030"></a>I am enormously
grateful to my noble friend for his assistance with my speaking note. I
hope it will enable the Minister to address the matter fully and I look
forward to her reply. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="061010178000031"></a><a name="spnew_148"></a><b><a name="_spnew63"></a><a name="061010178000148"></a>Lord

Minister for the Government&#146;s amendment. I do so because the
Government have taken note of a number of anomalies identified by my
colleague in the House of Commons, David Howarth, and the amendment is
designed to put them right.</p><p><a name="061010178000032"></a><a name="spnew_149"></a><b><a name="_spnew64"></a><a name="061010178000149"></a>The

the difference between making and inventing the tools, and supply and
distribution of the tools, which is what they are trying to
hit.</p><p><a name="061010178000033"></a>However, I am afraid that
their amendment does not quite go far enough. It is a question of
effectiveness and whether it works, and I am afraid to say that it will
not. I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, that

<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_214"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>kiddies&#148; are quite common terms in the industry. Phishing is a
big worry at the moment; I was talking about it only last
week.</p><p><a name="061010178000034"></a>The real problem
probably stems from something we have just been talking about. I have
just been at dinner with the Hansard Society in the Commons, talking
about globalisation, regulation and a few other things. This is a
typical example. We think we can regulate, but in a global,
internet-based world we cannot. People can host these things abroad.
They can host sites which will supply tools to allow you to do this,
that and the other, and there is nothing we can do to prevent it. They
will be hosted on servers abroad by foreign companies, and you cannot
do anything about it. If they were hosted on British servers you could
give them notice and tell them to remove them or even prosecute them if
you were lucky enough.</p><p><a name="061010178000035"></a>Will it
work? It will not, I am afraid. It is one of those things that sounds
good but will do nothing. What it will do is cause a lot of trouble to
large companies that supply perfectly legitimate tools to help people
to carry out remote maintenance or use remote access. It will not help
parliamentary staff because if someone supplies the tools to them,
whereby they can shadow you working on your own terminal in Parliament
and thereby help you solve the problem that you just got trapped in,
those sorts of tools might be forbidden under the supply
rule.</p><p><a name="061010178000036"></a>The Home Office response
to this is: &#147;Well of course we won&#146;t chase the good guys.
We won&#146;t go after them. We are only after the bad guys.&#148;
The trouble with that is that it is all well until an enforcer trying
to achieve some other aim threatens someone. I do not think that, as
Parliament, we should be passing laws that give power to enforcement
agencies to blackmail companies into doing other things for them
because they know they can use something like this against them. It is
too much of a blanket power.</p><p><a name="061010178000037"></a>Further, it is useful for penetration
testing&#151;for instance, people testing to see whether their
company systems can be hacked. A typical example of this is phishing.
Last week I was sitting next door to a chap called Gary McKinnon, who
is the person the Americans are trying to extradite and put in jail
for 60 years because he put post-it notes all over the
Department of Defense systems. Five years ago he got into their systems
because he thought it would be fun to see how good their passwords
were. He ran a little program and discovered that a large number of
people with Windows access had not bothered to use passwords. For the
Department of Defense in America not to check that its stuff was
moderately secure and that its senior people at least had passwords to
prevent access is stupid. So he thought he would show them how stupid
they were.</p><p><a name="061010178000038"></a>As a result of that
Gary has got into hot water. I will not go into the merits of the case
or whatever, but the department should have been using tools like this
to ensure their own security was all right long before Gary got there.
And so should we. However, it will make these things illegal and large
groups, large banks and so on should be testing that their systems are
secure. In fact Parliament should. But, under this

committing an offence. It is all very well to say, &#147;They are the
good guys, we won&#146;t prosecute them&#148;, but I do not think
that is good enough. I have great trouble with laws that hand over
powers to the enforcers and say, &#147;It is at our discretion
whether we are going to prosecute you&#148;.</p><p><a name="061010178000039"></a>I stand very strongly on that, having
seen and heard of many incidents where people have been told that
unless they comply with something else there is an obscure rule and
they can throw the book at a company for something else. I know that
there will be efforts made at the European level to reverse this
provision if we pass it in this form. I was informed of that by some
international companies.</p><p><a name="061010178000040"></a>I
would prefer to see the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, go
through and remove the provision altogether. I do not think it will do
any good. It is a waste of time. It will not allow you to do anything
effective against enforcing what you want. However, I believe that the
Minister will not allow that. Therefore, I would suggest that you
should either say &#147;more likely than not&#148; if that is what
you mean. I suggested last time using the word
&#147;primarily&#148;; this time I suggest using
&#147;principally&#148;. We are looking at the objective of the
people supplying or trying to sell these tools. If it is principally to
sell it to the hacker community, I do not have a problem. In which case
say so in the Bill. We know these things are likely to be used. If the
Government mean that it is more likely than not, then they should say
more likely than not.</p><p><a name="061010178000041"></a>I would
like to push this issue at some stage. I know that there is only one
more stage of the Bill. It concerns me greatly that we should leave the
matter in this form. Therefore, I would like to hear what the
Government have to say.</p><h5><a name="061010178000138"></a>9.15

Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I am going to read
what the Government say and I will try to say it as best I can. I am
pleased with the half vote of support from the noble Earl, Lord Erroll,
and I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, for his
customary courtesy and thanks for the amendments that we have tabled in
this group. Although the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, did not say that
she was ever so pleased about what we were moving this evening, I
thought that perhaps there was some grudging acknowledgement that we
had recognised part of what the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, sees as a
problem. Obviously, we will never satisfy the noble Earl, Lord
Northesk. Sometimes, I would be worried if we did. However, I
congratulate him on his continued persistence. By tabling amendments
such as this, he makes us think much harder about what we are trying to
do better to perfect the legal framework with which we try to cover the
difficulties.</p><p><a name="061010178000043"></a>In general, we
are pleased with the support for creating a new offence to cover those
who make or adapt, supply or offer to supply articles&#151;so-called
hacking tools&#151;intending that they be used to commit 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_216"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>computer misuse offences. As I said, the debate is focused on how best
we deal with those who deliberately make such articles available but
whose state of mind falls short of intent, shall we say? The government
amendment narrows the offence so that those who make or adapt those
articles commit an offence only if they intend the article to be used
to commit offences, rather than if they believe that it is likely that
that is what they will be used
for.</p><p><a name="061010178000044"></a>The amendment tabled by
the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, goes further and would also exclude
those who supply or offer to supply articles believing that they are
likely to be used to commit an offence. The noble Earl, Lord Erroll,
proposes that the new offence is amended to replace believing that it
is &#147;likely&#148; with believing that it will
&#147;principally&#148; be so used. The use of the term
&#147;principally&#148; has similar difficulties associated with it
to that which the noble Earl preferred in Committee, which was
&#147;primarily&#148;. I am not sure that it is capable of legal
definition. Clearly, I am not an expert in these matters, but it is not
a word with which I am familiar as being used in statute to describe a
particular state of
affairs.</p><p><a name="061010178000045"></a>Such tools are
increasingly sophisticated and damaging. They are increasingly
available and increasingly used to commit crime. We cannot support the
approach taken by noble Lords because we believe that it is important
that the offence covers the supply of such articles for criminal use
even beyond the narrow circumstances of criminal intent. We also
believe that &#147;principally&#148; refers to the extent of the
usage. In other words, some of the time, the article will be used for
legitimate purposes but the person believes that it will be principally
used for Computer Misuse Act offences. Whereas, in our view,
&#147;likely&#148; reflects a belief that there is a strong
possibility that the article will be used for Computer Misuse Act
offences.</p><p><a name="061010178000046"></a><a name="spnew_151"></a><b><a name="061010178000151"></a>The
Earl of Erroll:</b> My Lords, does the Minister
accept that, actually, the sort of tools that are used to test systems
and gain remote access are normally used by hackers to gain access to
systems illegally? All of them are very likely to be used for that
purpose. That is the trouble. If the Government do not intend to catch
all these tools, why does &#147;likely&#148; mean &#147;more
likely than not&#148;? These systems will be used for that, whether
you like it or
not.</p><p><a name="061010178000047"></a><a name="spnew_152"></a><b><a name="061010178000152"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> Well, my Lords, that may well
be the case, but I invite the noble Earl to consider that we are trying
to write terminology into the Bill that has a proven track record of
being tested in a court of law. That is very important. I do not know
how the noble Earl can make that judgment about those tools being used
primarily or only by hackers. I am not sure how he reaches that
conclusion. In a sense, that is otherwise from this debate. That is his
view, but I invite him to bear with me while I complete my commentary
so that he can better understand where we are coming
from.</p><p><a name="061010178000048"></a>As
I said, having listened to the debate in Committee and to industry, we
accept that it would not be reasonable in all cases for the
manufacturer of 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_217"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a tool to be held responsible for its subsequent illegal use if they had
no such intent. I have been persuaded that the circumstances relating
to making or adapting a tool are often too far removed from the use of
it for the person to form a solid belief in the likelihood of criminal
use. However, the same does not apply to those who supply the articles
believing that it is likely that they will be used to commit offences.
As we discussed in Committee, &#147;believing that it is
likely&#148; is a high test in practice; the prosecution would need
to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the person supplying the tool
knew that it would be used for unlawful purposes in most instances. We
think on balance that that is the right, sensible and appropriate
approach.</p><p><a name="061010178000049"></a>Obviously, those in
the legitimate IT security sector make, adapt and supply these tools as
part of their daily work. They rightly need the confidence that the new
offence will be used appropriately&#151;one might also argue
proportionately&#151;to ensure that their practices and procedures
fall entirely within the law. The DPP will write and publish guidance
on how the new offence will be dealt with, with particular focus on the
factors that prosecutors will take into consideration in determining,
in accordance with the code for Crown prosecutors, whether there is
sufficient evidence to prosecute and whether it is in the public
interest to do so.</p><p><a name="061010178000050"></a>Finally, we
have made amendments to Clause 43 that make transitional provisions to
ensure that the changes which the Bill makes to the Computer Misuse Act
1990 do not have an impact on offences committed before the Police and
Justice Act comes into force.</p><p><a name="061010178000051"></a>A question was asked about the
assessment made by the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, of the
clause&#146;s impact. The assessment, which was given ample voice by
the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, differs from ours. We have consulted
industry members and the CBI on these provisions and have had no
representations from them suggesting that the provisions will force
them out of the UK market. In fact, the provisions will not criminalise
general applications such as browsing, as it is used more legitimately

It is clear that anything&#151;whether it be a fast motor car or what
we are talking about in this debate&#151;that can be used for a
malign purpose is likely to be used by someone of evil intent for that
purpose. The wording of the Government&#146;s amendment
is,</p><ul><a name="061010178000136"></a>&#147;is likely to be
used&#148;,</ul><a name="061010178000091"></a>which means
anything that is capable of being used. That goes much further than
this House should be comfortable with. I hope that the Government will
therefore give it consideration. With this amendment, they seek to
narrow the conditions, but they are not narrowing them at all. Another
look at this is warranted. I apologise for
intervening.

that the Government drafting could not be improved: he felt that it was
so defective that one could not achieve the right result, so he wants
to take out that section. I know that the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, was
trying his best to find a better definition that could adequately

right time, but now seems logical. The noble Lord, Lord Lawson, is
right. I do not believe that the courts will interpret the word
&#147;likely&#148; as meaning more likely than not, because it does
not say that. This is trying to catch people advertising on the
internet who say, &#147;Here you are. Here are some great hacker
tools. Why do you not download these?&#148; The trouble is that
people who are trying to supply&#151;possibly without
selling&#151;a subsidiary company or part of a group things that will
help to maintain, assist or test computer systems will be caught also
by this wording. It is impossible to write something to maintain a
computer system remotely or test the security of a computer system
which can be used only for that purpose. Everything written for that
purpose can be turned around by someone who wishes to use it for
hacking. As the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, said, it will be used by
hackers.</p><p><a name="061010178000065"></a>Therefore, the word
&#147;likely&#148; means that everyone is prosecutable by the
courts. I have heard people say, &#147;They can look at what the
Minister said&#148;, but unless it is ambiguous there is no
requirement to look at the parliamentary debate. The word
&#147;likely&#148; is unambiguous. Therefore, I am afraid that the
courts will find that the Government have a case just to say,
&#147;Well, we can prosecute you&#148;. They do not even need to
look. The intention behind this was not to prosecute the good guys.
Nowhere in the Bill says that. Another sentence saying, &#147;If you
are a good guy, we won&#146;t prosecute you&#148;, would perhaps be
all right. Between now and Third Reading, the Government need to think
of something that means &#147;more likely than not&#148; or
&#147;the primary purpose&#148; or something like that. Otherwise,

shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 133 and 158. I have tabled the
amendments to give the Government the opportunity to put on record any
progress that may have been made on these matters since we debated them
three months ago, on 11 July, as reported in <I>Hansard</I> at<I></I>cols. 617-622. The two new clauses would strengthen the law dealing
with sex offenders, especially those who offend against children.
Amendment No. 132 deals with encrypted data found on computers and
storage in cases where the police believe that the data contain abusive
images of children. It does not seek to create a new offence but amends
the sentencing regime under Section 53 of the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act
2000.</p><p><a name="061010178000076"></a>Part 3 requires a person
to comply with a notice issued by the police to hand over the
encryption key for protected data. The penalty for breach is two years.
That seems to us to be low given that the alternative penalty, if the
information were turned over, would often be five years or more. We
suggested increasing the penalty to achieve compliance. It could be
done only in cases where the court was satisfied that it was more than
likely that most of the encrypted data consisted of indecent
photographs of children. After the last debate about
&#147;likely&#148; or &#147;principally&#148;, I use those
words rather
carefully.</p><p><a name="061010178000077"></a>Amendment No. 133
would insert a new clause relating to offences requiring notification.
It would ensure that Sections 48 to 50 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003,
which make provision for the offences of

prostitution, would be prescribed under Part 2 of that Act for the
purposes of notification requirements. Amendment No. 158 is merely a
consequential change to the Long
Title.</p><p><a name="061010178000078"></a>In response to the first
amendment in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that the
Government remained very sympathetic to what I proposed but they wanted
further opportunity for public consideration and comment on the
proposals and to consider what legislative changes should be brought to
the House in the light of current consultation. In response to the
second amendment, the Minister said that officials intended to review
the contents of Schedules 3 and 5 over the summer and that he hoped
that any necessary changes might be made by order in the
autumn.</p><p><a name="061010178000079"></a>During the long, hot
summer I noticed one or two press stories with regard to government
consultation being concluded on related matters and therefore I thought
it important that we should return briefly to these issues tonight. I
hope there will be no necessity to bring them back at Third Reading and
that we can conclude the matter today. I invite the Minister to say
what progress has been made. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="061010178000080"></a><a name="spnew_160"></a><b><a name="061010178000160"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to
the noble Baroness for providing the Government with an opportunity to
explain where we have got to on this issue. As the noble Baroness
readily acknowledged, we are at one in our intentions and have great
sympathy with the proposition she puts before
us.</p><p><a name="061010178000081"></a>We entirely understand the
objective behind Amendment No. 132, which is designed to increase the
maximum penalty for an offence under Section 53 of the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act 2000; that is, failing to comply with a
requirement to disclose protected information or the key to it. The
increase in the maximum penalty will apply in the circumstances set out
in the new subsection (6) of Section 53 of the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act, including where the offender has a previous
conviction for possession of an indecent image of a child.</p><p><a name="061010178000082"></a>The use of information
technology by terrorists and criminals to facilitate and conceal
evidence of their unlawful conduct so as to evade detection or
prosecution is increasing. Consequently, the Government have concluded
that it is now timely to implement the provisions of Part 3 of the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, including Section 53, which are
not presently in force. The threat to public safety posed by
terrorists&#146; use of encryption technologies was recognised by the
House in Section 15 of the Terrorism Act 2006, which increased the
maximum penalty for the Section 53 offence to five years in a national
security case.</p><p><a name="061010178000083"></a>Schedule 3 does
not include the offences under Sections 48 to 50 of the 2003 Act. These
are the offences of causing or inciting child prostitution or
pornography, controlling a child prostitute or a child involved in
pornography and arranging or facilitating child prostitution or
pornography. The decision to omit them was taken because we believe
that these 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_222"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>offences, while undoubtedly despicable, were not, strictly speaking,
sexual offences unlike, say, rape, but could be motivated by a number
of factors such as simple greed. The offences are included, however, in
Schedule 5 to the 2003 Act. That inclusion ensures that if offenders
demonstrate that they pose a risk of serious sexual harm, courts can
make a sexual offences prevention order either when dealing with such
offenders or on subsequent application from the police. Being made
subject to such an order leads to the offender going on to the sex
offenders register, as well as being subject to prohibitions imposed by
the order itself.</p><p><a name="061010178000084"></a>We recognise
that while it may be true that these offences need not necessarily be
strictly sexual in nature, their perpetrators demonstrate at the very
least a callous disregard for the sexual well-being of children and
pose a threat, so they may require the monitoring that being made
subject to the register will bring.</p><p><a name="061010178000085"></a>Officials in the Home Office are engaged
in a review of the content of Schedules 3 and 5 to ensure that the
right offences are included and that they are placed in the appropriate
schedule. I can assure the House that the suggestions set out in the
amendment are receiving not just sympathetic but active consideration
as part of that review.</p><p><a name="061010178000086"></a>Changes to Schedules 3 and 5 do not
require primary legislation but can be made by order. Rather than make
piecemeal changes, we should await the results of the full review and
look to make all necessary changes through an order which will be laid
later in the autumn. I can give that assurance this evening. On that
basis, I hope that the noble Baroness recognises that she is pushing at
an open door, that we are at one on this and that she can feel able
comfortably to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="061010178000087"></a><a name="spnew_161"></a><b><a name="061010178000161"></a>Baroness

children held by the police. The report
stated:</p><ul><a name="0610113000131"></a>&#147;The mechanism
introduced by the Bill contains a number of safeguards for those who
may have an interest in property which is liable to forfeiture under
the Bill...There is an opportunity for a person who wishes to
contest forfeiture to make a notice of claim. Where a notice of claim
is received by the police, forfeiture can only be ordered by a court.
The court must order return of the property if not satisfied that it is
forfeitable, or if satisfied that the person making the claim has a
legitimate reason for possessing
it&#148;.</ul><p><a name="0610113000005"></a>These probing
amendments would insert new sub-paragraphs into Schedules 12 and 13 to
ensure that, where the court was not satisfied that the relevant
property was forfeitable, the relevant officer extinguished all the
information that he had obtained from the
forfeiture.</p><p><a name="0610113000006"></a>The aim of the
amendment is to question whether the police should or would keep copies
of information seized in this context if the court had ordered its
return. In some ways, it has a parallel in the debate surrounding data
protection and whether the police should keep DNA records of innocent
individuals on file, although it is a different medium. I beg to

Dholakia:</b> My Lords, the amendment was tabled by
the Conservatives in Committee, but it was not moved. We support the
amendment. It states that an officer should not keep any information
about the content of the property if the court finds that that person
does not have forfeitable property in his possession; for example,
indecent photographs, or pseudo-photographs, of a child. I presume that
this is to protect the child in the
images.</p><p><a name="0610113000008"></a><a name="spnew_167"></a><b><a name="0610113000156"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I shall go
carefully, because I am seeking to persuade noble Lords opposite that
their amendment is not effective in the way in which they might
envisage and could, to an extent, be self-defeating. I ask them to bear
with me.</p><p><a name="0610113000009"></a>The provisions in the
Bill allow the police to forfeit indecent images of children and the
storage equipment that holds them. The amendments would amend our
proposed procedures so that, once it is found that the property should
be returned to the owner, the police must destroy all information about
the property which is in their
possession.</p><p><a name="0610113000010"></a>Clauses 44 and 45 and
Schedules 12 and 13 amend the current law so as to close a small
technical loophole in the law. They will allow the police to forfeit
indecent images of children and the devices that hold them following
any lawful seizure. As we have explained previously, this is a small
loophole, because if the person is convicted of an offence in respect
of the material, it can be forfeited on conviction under Section 143 of
the Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. These new
provisions do not affect that power.</p><p><a name="0610113000011"></a>However, there are limited circumstances
in which there may be no conviction. In those cases, the Protection of
Children Act 1978 allows the courts to forfeit such articles following
a seizure under a

brought before it under other powers of seizure; for example, during a
fraud investigation. Technically, in such instances, the articles may
have to be returned to the offender.</p><p><a name="0610113000012"></a>Our reforms will move
the power of forfeiture into the hands of the police, regardless of the
powers of seizure used, and will provide an avenue of appeal to the
courts for owners or third parties with an interest in the articles.
The amendments would require the police to destroy any record of
lawfully seized material once the courts have decided that material is
non-forfeitable and should be returned to
owners.</p><p><a name="0610113000013"></a>I hope that I can
persuade noble Lords that these amendments are unnecessary. Their
effect would be to require the police to destroy records lawfully made
which would otherwise be retained in accordance with current
law, including the Data Protection Act 1998, and accepted operational
police practice and procedure whenever such property is seized and a
court orders its return. The amendments would amount to an unreasonable
restriction on the extent to which police are allowed, and expected, to
exercise discretion as to the need to retain and use all factually
accurate information. This is both in connection with the prevention,
detection, investigation and prosecution of crime, and when they are
called to account in civil
proceedings.</p><h5><a name="0610113000151"></a>9.45
pm</h5><p><a name="0610113000014"></a>For example, let us say that
in their dealings with a known sex offender, the police believe he no
longer has access to a computer in his home and is not viewing indecent
images of children or adult pornography. This suggests, in this case,
that the individual is of a lower risk and the police, through the
Multi-agency Public Protection Arrangements, adapt their management
plan accordingly. However, evidence comes to light that the
offender&#146;s credit card has been used to purchase indecent images
of children over the internet and the police arrest the offender and
find a laptop computer in his home. The images appear, to the police
and Crown Prosecution Service, to be of children aged 16 or 17 but the
court finds that they are of an adult aged 18 or over. Therefore, the
laptop and images would have to be duly returned to the offender and,
under this amendment, the police would have to remove from their
records any suggestion that the individual, who is a convicted sex
offender, has access to a computer and is viewing pornography. This is
despite the fact that such intelligence might be used by the police to
adapt their management plans, and might even be the evidence they need
to apply to a court for a sexual offences prevention order to impose
prohibitions on the offender in order to protect the public from
serious sexual harm.</p><p><a name="0610113000015"></a>The
provisions in the Bill provide the police with a simple but secure
mechanism to ensure that seized indecent images of children and the
devices that hold them can be forfeited once investigators no longer
need to retain them. In addition to this, we have provided a simple and
fair mechanism to allow owners and interested third parties to appeal
against forfeiture. So there is a safeguard there already.</p>

under the age of
eighteen.&#148;</ul><p><a name="0610113000020"></a>The
noble Baroness said: My Lords, I propose the insertion of a new clause
whose purpose is to end penal custody for all children under the age of
18. I fear that this door may not be as wide open as it has been to
some other proposals.</p><p><a name="0610113000021"></a>We believe
that those children for whom secure accommodation or custody is
necessary and appropriate should be accommodated and managed in local
authority secure children&#146;s homes or their nearest equivalent,
because this is about children, not adults who are young. The arguments
that we deploy for incarcerating people aged 18 and over are
essentially and crucially different for those under 18, the legal
definition of a child. This means that the child&#146;s welfare is
the central issue and general childcare standards as applied by all
those agencies which deal with children are paramount. Prison is simply
not the appropriate professional or effective response to children who
offend, where security and a quite different ethos obtains.</p><p><a name="0610113000022"></a>Many experts on this matter, including the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham,
who has a wealth of experience and is on record as saying something
along these lines if not in these very words, other experienced experts and a
range of childcare agencies who sign up to the Children&#146;s Rights
Alliance for England, believe that an age and needs-led approach to
a child&#146;s offending, compliant with the ECHR and the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, which also addresses the causes of crime
and how to stop very young people offending or reoffending, must inform
provision and practice. This is tough on all concerned. Penal
custody&#151;prison&#151;is the place for dangerous, persistently
offending adults, not children; for children it is unproductive and in
many cases causes further damage. Of course all offending is
unacceptable, and persistent offending is particularly serious, so the
system must teach all offenders to stop and how to change. It is how we
deal with children, however, that must be different.</p><p><a name="0610113000023"></a>It is well known that,
compared with those who do not offend, this group of children has had a
disproportionate experience of being in care, of lack of education
through exclusion, of special educational 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_226"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>needs, of significant mental health and personality problems, and of
serious issues with drugs and alcohol. The challenge is huge, and the
specialist provision necessary to meet it is very great.</p><p><a name="0610113000024"></a>The penal custody supplied by YOIs or STCs
cannot provide this degree of specialist provision. At great expense it
does little to make society safer, since somewhere in the region of 70
per cent re-offend within two years of release. Anyone who has worked
with such children, as I have, and all experts in social care,
healthcare or education know that. The Government know it; the
arguments have been rehearsed in this place many times. The astonishing
thing is, though, that the response by politicians, Government and
sentencers is to commit roughly 3,000 children to penal custody at any
one time. Indeed, during 2004 8,110 young people were received into
custody, of whom 4,500 were 15 and under. That last fact takes some
believing; that in this country we imprisoned 4,500 damaged and
difficult children of 15 and under, some as young as 12, in that
year.</p><p><a name="0610113000025"></a>Over the years I have been
in many YOIs, which hold the majority of these children. I know the
dedication of the work of many of the people in them, and the successes
they have had with groups and individuals in their charge. The work of
the Youth Justice Board in facilitating and supporting improvements has
also been impressive. At the same time, though, the YJB has assessed 56
per cent of 15 year-olds and 35 per cent of 17 year-olds in
YOIs as &#147;vulnerable&#148;. YOIs are part of the prison service
and are essentially geared to adults. By comparison with local
authority secure children&#146;s homes, which I shall refer to as
LASCHs from now on&#151;a rather terrible acronym&#151;the ratio of
officers to prisoners in a YOI is one to 10, while in a LASCH it is two
staff to three children. The scale of the institutions is up
to 60 on a wing, compared with units of around eight in a
LASCH. The provision is not child-centred. Training of nine weeks is
not geared to the particular specialist requirements of children.
Segregation is used, and the regulations on the use of force involving
pain during restraint are not amended for children in YOIs. The latest
Chief Inspector&#146;s report shows that one-third of children say
they feel unsafe, a quarter say they have been assaulted or insulted by
staff, and 2 per cent say they have been sexually assaulted. Since
1990, 29 children have actually died.</p><p><a name="0610113000026"></a>STCs, planned by the Conservatives but in
fact a creation of this Government, now cater for around 275 children,
some as young as 12, and have a strong emphasis on education. I have
seen some very good work by dedicated individuals in these STCs,
particularly at Hassockfield since its recent changes. The Carlile
inquiry, however, led by my noble friend, illustrated unacceptable use
of restraint&#151;in the course of which one child died&#151;and of
segregation and forcible strip-searching. They do not have the trained
staff to deal with the difficult range of needs I have described.
Contact with parents, carers and families is often minimal instead of
central, and contact with localities to which they will return often
non-existent; they are, after all, often miles away, and logistics do
not allow for easy or regular contact. A constant theme from those
working in STCs is the 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_227"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 227</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>difficulty of creating proper resettlement plans with
the relevant agencies, and children sometimes leave
with no idea of what is to become of them.</p><p><a name="0610113000027"></a>It is these latter key elements of family
contact, local contacts, appropriate staff training and living in an
environment which is primarily child-centred and welfare based that are
lacking. These are hugely expensive places involving resources which
should be ploughed into the LASCHs which are predicated on these
elements and which already provide a roughly equivalent number of beds
and where it is generally accepted that the best level of care is to be
found. That is what matters, but STCs over the past nine years have
been expanded at the expense of the
LASCHs.</p><p><a name="0610113000028"></a>It seems that we have
different standards when it comes to children who offend and are in
trouble as opposed to children who are troubled but have not done
anything wrong. My noble friend Lord Carlile
said:</p><ul><a name="0610113000136"></a>&#147;Some of the
treatment children in custody experience would in another setting be
considered abusive and could trigger a child protection
investigation&#148;.</ul><a name="0610113000124"></a>The
parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report on the
Convention on the Rights of the Child
stated:<ul><a name="0610113000137"></a>&#147;There is
abundant evidence that detention precipitates the loss of other
fundamental rights. We have addressed only some of these rights such as
the right to life, not to suffer inhuman or degrading treatment and the
right to an
education&#148;.</ul><a name="0610113000125"></a>And we know
that children in prison do, indeed, lose out on such rights. But if
children had painful restraint used on them&#151;as indeed occurred
768 times in the STCs, resulting in 51 injuries in 2004-05&#151;or if
children committed suicide in a school or hospital in the community,
what then would our reaction be? We would find it appalling, would we
not, and demand an immediate end to the places where that could occur?
Think of our own children, grandchildren or others we know. When they
have done wrong or get into trouble, what do we do about it? We want
them to know that wrong has been done and there must be some
appropriate way of paying back or making amends. We want them to
understand what is wrong and why, and what the effect of what they have
done has been on the victim or victims. We want them to say sorry, to
mean it and to determine not to do it again. They must understand the
consequences of their actions and do whatever is within their means to
make amends.<p><a name="0610113000029"></a>If I am right, if
this is indeed true, would we then want to send them away far from
where the event took place, far from the person or people affected and
incarcerate them with other children, all of whom have also offended,
detached from what they have done and with a multitude of other
difficulties and issues into the bargain? Would we want them to be sent
to a place where they are often unsafe, where there may be violence,
including by those who are in charge of them or supposed to be caring
for them? Would we expect our children or any child to learn positive
lessons from such an experience, or why he 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_228"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should not do it again, and indeed will not do it again? I think not,
yet we shut our eyes and minds to this reality of what we are doing
today to nearly 3,000 children. It is now our turn to make amends. I
beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0610113000030"></a><a name="spnew_170"></a><b><a name="_spnew66"></a><a name="0610113000159"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I very much support
this excellent amendment moved so ably by the noble Baroness, Lady
Linklater of Butterstone. We have grown to expect that every time she
rises to her feet.</p><p><a name="0610113000031"></a>I particularly
thank the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance for its excellent brief
which was sent to us all. It drew together the efforts that have been
made over the years to get the Government to agree to what the
amendment once again asks for. This matter has been raised over an
impressive number of years. The brief mentioned the comments of my
noble friend Lord Ramsbotham when he was Chief Inspector of Prisons in
1997. He described some conditions in youth offender institutions as
institutionalised child abuse.</p><p><a name="0610113000032"></a>Yesterday, we debated the Statement on the
Green Paper on children in care, with its many excellent ideas for
compensating the disgracefully inadequate support that over many years
we have failed to provide for children in care, with a disastrous
detrimental effect on their life chances. Prevention is a major
Government aim, which would have all our support, and compensation for
children in this situation&#151;with all those ideas and many more to
come no doubt from the consultation that has now begun on the Green
Paper&#151;is an excellent beginning. However, we must be hoping to
reclaim at least some of the children who we have failed so far that
they have arrived in a situation where still, deplorably, we put them
into custody.</p><p><a name="0610113000033"></a>On the education
side, which has been mentioned, those children are not even getting the
required 15 hours, except for in one institution, and there
is even a doubt about that. They are getting about half&#151;some
eight hours&#151;of education. When we think of people trying to
provide that education in the complete chaos of overcrowded prisons, we
can see that the situation is clearly going to get much worse. The
financial case against imprisoning children is strong, with the Audit
Commission in 2004 talking about the reformed youth justice system and
saying that custody is the most expensive and one of the least
effective methods. Certainly, some sentences deliver better outcomes
for children and are less expensive than others. The Local Government
Association clearly appears to agree, saying that it is time that we
explored more effective and sustainable ways of dealing with children
in trouble rather than resorting to locking them
up.</p><p><a name="0610113000034"></a>We have already heard that 70
per cent of those leaving custody are reconvicted within a year, so
this clearly is not working. I very much hope that the Government will
listen sympathetically to this excellent opportunity to put all the
aims and excellent ideas that they have for prevention into practice by
preventing the obvious downward path that children are going to follow
if they go into
custody.</p>

Carlile of Berriew:</b> My Lords, I start by
declaring an interest as the president of the Howard League for Penal
Reform. As has already been said, I was able to spend a considerable
time in the past year or so preparing a report for the Howard League on
the use of restraints on children in custody. While preparing that
report, I had the opportunity to visit a number of institutions and to
talk to staff and children in them, and I learnt a great
deal.</p><p><a name="0610113000036"></a>I applaud the initiative
of my noble friend Lady Linklater, who moved the amendment very
eloquently. In moving this radical new proposal, I would that we could
debate it before the threshold of the dinner hour in a much fuller
House, rather than in the twilight of the Horlicks hour. Having said
that, the issue loses none of its importance through being put on the
record in a rather empty House. The fundamental question being asked by
my noble friend Lady Linklater is, &#147;Should we be using the penal
model for children, or is it now completely outdated, and should we not
be moving towards a child-centred model?&#148;. I support her view
that we should be following the latter
course.</p><p><a name="0610113000037"></a>I share the views of the
noble Baronesses, Lady Linklater and Lady Howe, that some good practice
takes place in the youth estate, but it is not universal by any means.
My headline would be that if you look at what is happening in the
juvenile estate and to children detained in custody, you will see that
the system is destructive, underfunded and unfit for
purpose.</p><p><a name="0610113000038"></a>Yesterday, I chaired a
conference sponsored by the Greater London Authority, the Youth Justice
Board and Nacro. Between 70 and 80 practitioners were there and I did
not hear anyone demur from that view, including many chairs of youth
courts in the Greater London area. All of them feel like King Canute
and that is easy to
understand.</p><p><a name="0610113000039"></a>Briefly, I wish to
mention eight points that seem fundamental to the criticism that many
others now make of how young offenders are dealt with. First, the
system is outrageously expensive. If you think about it, it is
extraordinary that it is cheaper to send two children to Eton than to
keep one child in many of the custodial institutions that we have been
discussing. To put it another way, if a probation officer was appointed
to stand next to one young offender every day of the year, we would
save a great deal of money and probably achieve much more than by
putting that young offender in custody. These disposals are not working
and they are vastly
expensive.</p><p><a name="0610113000040"></a>Secondly, many young
offenders are being sentenced to short terms in custody; nine weeks is
a common period. Absolutely nothing can be achieved in nine weeks
except to separate the young offender from his or her family, to
dissociate them from normal life and to make them feel angry, vengeful
and neglected. That view is based on my discussions of these short
sentences with staff in young offenders&#146;
institutions.</p><p><a name="0610113000041"></a>My third point
relates to education, which was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady
Howe. The education provided in many establishments that hold 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_230"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>young offenders is patchy. Occasionally, it is excellent, but it is
desultory in some places. It is not sufficient in quantity and there is
a terrible variation in standards. It is astonishing that while
populations of such institutions have been allowed to grow, the
Government have neglected to deal with the shortfall in education. Many
youngsters go into these institutions unable to read, write or count
properly and they emerge just as unable to read, write or
count.</p><p><a name="0610113000042"></a>My
fourth point relates to something that astonished me as I visited these
places. I was not aware of how small they were. You put sometimes
hundreds of young males, all of whom have bags of energy, into an
institution which has no playing fields. Young men spend months in
these places and they never run. That is an extraordinary way to deal
with young people. On any objective view of the education of the young,
one of the first questions that a parent would ask would be, &#147;Is
there space for them to do activities outside the classroom?&#148;,
or, if it is a boarding school, outside their dormitories. Yet, for
some reason, Governments persist&#151;this is a historic problem that
is not necessarily attributable only to the present
Government&#151;in building or keeping these places in urban areas,
often where property is extremely expensive and where staff cannot
afford to live.</p><p><a name="0610113000043"></a>My fifth point
has been mentioned by both my noble friend Lady Linklater and the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe: the separation of children from their families.
There is no youth custodial institution in London. Feltham, which I
believe houses 700 or 800 young offenders at present, is the nearest to
London. But the young people do not stay at Feltham; they are dispersed
all over the country. Yesterday, at the conference that I mentioned, I
heard of many cases in which children are dispersed sometimes 200 miles
from London. That is no way of treating them if they are to be
reintegrated into the society that they have
left.</p><p><a name="0610113000044"></a>That brings me to my sixth
point, which is about how release is dealt with. When I was preparing
my Howard League report, I visited one institution where, entirely
voluntarily, the staff had started an excellent scheme to ensure that
when youngsters left the institution they knew where they were going,
whom they were going to, why they were going there and that somebody
would pay some attention to them afterwards. But the norm is often that
a 15 or 16 year-old is put in what is in effect a taxi, with a social
worker whom they have never seen before and who means nothing to them,
they are taken to accommodation of which they know nothing and the
following day they are out on the streets. What kind of sentence
planning is that?</p><p><a name="0610113000045"></a>My seventh
point is about racial imbalance. If you go to any custodial
institution, particularly those holding offenders convicted in London,
you will find that something like 50 per cent of them come from a black
or ethnic-minority community. What this surely demonstrates is that, in
areas where there is a large concentration of black and ethnic minority
youngsters, prevention of crime is not being dealt with adequately. In
1996, the Audit Commission produced an excellent report telling us
that, at the 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_231"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>money values of that time, &#163;1 spent on the prevention of youth
crime saved &#163;7 later. That is particularly so in areas where
there are large concentrations of minorities.</p><p><a name="0610113000046"></a>My final point relates to mental illness.
It is now a given that something like 50 per cent of the youngsters who
are detained in custody are suffering from a diagnostic mental
illness&#151;a mental illness identified in one of the two
international diagnostic manuals. It is also a given that children
suffering from mental illness are far less likely to receive
appropriate treatment if they are in custody than if they are not in
custody. That surely is neglect by the state. I suggest to the
Government that it is high time that the principle was accepted and put
into practice that a child who is in custody and mentally ill has the
same right to child and adolescent mental health services as any other
child and that it is an act of neglect by the state if they are not
given those
services.</p><p><a name="0610113000047"></a>What
are youth custody institutions for? If they are for anything, apart
from protecting society from a very small number of those whom we might
have to acknowledge as very dangerous offenders, they are for setting
boundaries, so that young people, when they leave those institutions,
are more able to understand what they are permitted to do and what they
will not get away with doing in the community. Are we achieving that?
In my view, not at all. My view is that we are imprisoning more and
more detainees and achieving less and less with every one. There is one
certainty about the present system, which is that almost every
youngster who serves a youth custody sentence of one kind or another
will be back. That surely is the saddest reflection on the way in which
we are dealing with young offenders. I ask the Government to take
advantage of the new clause proposed by my noble friend and to tell the
House that, at long last, they are taking this issue seriously and are
prepared to have a truly radical look at youth
sentencing.</p><h5><a name="0610113000152"></a>10.15

of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, under whose presidency I served as a
member of his inquiry.</p><p><a name="0610113000049"></a>When I
recommended in 1996 and 1997 that prison was no place for young
offenders, I meant precisely&#151;a point made by the noble Baroness,
Lady Linklater&#151;that prison is an adult system and not a place
for children. That is not to say that children should not be in custody
but, if they are, they should be in places that are designed for, and
equipped with staff trained to look after, young offenders. I am
concerned that since then, although this recommendation has been
repeated by many people, there has been no progress.</p><p><a name="0610113000050"></a>I support the amendment for the precise
reason suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile&#151;that is, in the
hope that the Government will take the opportunity to revisit this
matter and incorporate it in future developments. Originally, my
remarks were based on taking a social services inspector with me to

children. Following the visit, she told me that if it had been a local
government secure home, it would have been closed because neither its
regime nor the practices or training of the staff came up to what was
required elsewhere. That was indictment enough for
me.</p><p><a name="0610113000051"></a><a name="spnew_173"></a><b><a name="0610113000162"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I understand the
nature of the concerns raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater,
and echoed by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lords, Lord
Carlile and Lord Ramsbotham. We have debated these issues on a number
of occasions and there has rarely been a sliver of paper between what
we would all like to see but there have often been difficulties about
how we get there.</p><p><a name="0610113000052"></a>I turn to the
need for greater parity of treatment in education, health, outside
activity, planning for change, better management in moving children on,
dealing with mental illness and prevention. The noble Lord, Lord
Carlile, and the House will know that those are all very much woven
into the Government's plan for preventing young people getting into
crime and then reducing the level of recidivism. They are all very much
part of what we propose to do. This week, our most recent document
produced by the Department for Education and Skills, <I>Care Matters:
Transforming the Lives of Children and Young People in Care</I>, was
welcomed. That document very much feeds into this debate in that it
concerns the efforts that the Government are making to try to deal with
the issues more effectively.</p><p><a name="0610113000053"></a>The
secure estate for children and young people, with which those of us in
the House tonight are very familiar, is very diverse. It has different
types of establishments adapted to the needs of different age groups
and varying degrees of vulnerability. As we all know, those under the
age of 18 vary from an 11 or 12 year-old who commits a most grievous
offence&#151;sometimes, regrettably, homicide&#151;to a 17
year-old, who is bordering on adulthood. The needs of those disparate
children can be starkly different.</p><p><a name="0610113000054"></a>Young offender institutions provide for
the upper part of the age range&#151;that is, 15 to 17 year-old boys
and 17 year-old girls&#151;apart from those who are the most
vulnerable. Secure training centres are predominantly for younger
trainees and have a particular focus on providing education. They are
able to accommodate some offenders whom local authority secure
children&#146;s homes find too difficult to manage. That is a
reality. We know that there are such children who cannot be safely
accommodated in the secure children&#146;s home
estate.</p><p><a name="0610113000055"></a>The effect of the new clause will be to
limit custodial provision for under-18s to secure children's homes. I
do not really think that that is what the noble Baroness wishes.
However, I understand from the comments of the noble Lord, Lord
Carlile, that the amendment is really just asking us to look much more
radically at how we
respond.</p><p><a name="0610113000056"></a>Secure children's homes
are valuable institutions and form an important part of the secure
estate. I am glad to hear noble Lords say that they have seen some

are used primarily for the youngest offenders&#151;precisely for
those reasons. They would not be able to cope with a large influx
of 16 and 17 year-olds. The Youth Justice Board contracts
with local authorities for the use of 235 places in secure children's
homes and the entire capacity of the secure children's homes sector is
only 400 places. So, introducing 2,000 additional 16 and 17
year-olds would not be remotely practicable. Even if it were, the
introduction of large numbers of older offenders would put the younger
children seriously at risk. The Government have always made it clear
that, where offenders are children, sending them to custody can be only
a last
resort.</p><p><a name="0610113000057"></a>We
believe that there is some scope for reducing the number of under-18s
in custody. The Youth Justice Board has a target of reducing the
population of under-18s in custody by 10 per cent. However, we are
firmly persuaded that for serious or dangerous offenders, even though
they may be quite young, custody has to be available to protect the
public. We would be failing in our duty if we did not take the
necessary steps to achieve
that.</p><p><a name="0610113000058"></a>I recognise the excellent
intentions underlying this new clause, but removing under-18 places in
young offender institutions and secure training centres would not be
practicable, would do nothing to reduce crime, and would not help the
troubled young people whom they are intended to serve. Indeed, we fear
that it would endanger many of them in a wholly unacceptable
way.</p><p><a name="0610113000059"></a>There is still much that we
can do. We hope that the work we are undertaking with the three
alliances&#151;although I heard the comments made earlier by the
right reverend Prelate, Peter Selby, on those matters&#151;will
greatly help young people. The increased planning and the ability to
use the resources of the Department of Health and the Department for
Education and Skills, in a way which we could not do before, is
incredibly important. Our ability to work harder with schools, other
institutions and local communities to make alternatives to imprisonment
a reality which is seductive to the courts&#151;because they
work&#151;is also a challenge. There is much for us to
do.</p><p><a name="0610113000060"></a>One of the tragedies that we
now face&#151;and I sincerely believe that it is a tragedy&#151;is
the increasing number of our young people of a relatively tender age
who are committing some pretty heinous offences. Some of them are big,
some of them are bad and some of them are dangerous. We can debate how
they got there, but the reality is that we have to deal with them as
they are and not as we would like them to be. I very much agree with
thrust and intention of the amendment. However, I regret to say that
although the door is not closed to improvements to children, it is
closed to this
amendment.</p><p><a name="0610113000061"></a><a name="spnew_174"></a><b><a name="0610113000163"></a>Baroness

complementary to the problems of children which were so eloquently
debated by noble Lords in the previous group.</p><p><a name="0610113000070"></a>The Explanatory Notes inform us that
Clause 46 enables the remit of the Independent Police Complaints
Commission to be expanded to provide oversight of certain personnel in
the Immigration and Nationality Directorate exercising specified
enforcement functions. The IPCC was established under Part 2 of the
Police Reform Act 2002. Clause 46(1) of the Bill gives the Secretary of
State the power to make regulations by negative procedure, conferring
functions on the IPCC in relation to the exercise of specified
enforcement functions by immigration officers and the exercise by
officials of the Secretary of State of specified enforcement functions
relating to immigration and
asylum.</p><p><a name="0610113000071"></a>The amendment inserts a
new subsection to ensure that these regulatory powers may confer
functions on the IPCC to set up a procedure to enable children and
young people to register complaints with regard to these immigration
and asylum enforcement functions. The All-Party Parliamentary Group for
Children, in its child impact statement on the Bill, highlighted that
the IPCC has already recognised the special needs of children and young
people who wish to make

same for immigration and asylum-seeking children and young
people.</p><p><a name="0610113000072"></a>The &#147;No Place for
a Child&#148; campaign argues that the Government currently detain
more than 2,000 children, including babies, in immigration detention
centres every year. That is equivalent to the number of pupils at, say,
a large inner-city secondary school. A coalition of children&#146;s
NGOs are concerned that, despite the estimated number of children
involved, there is a distinct lack of awareness of children&#146;s
issues&#151;or, as one put it, a lack of child centeredness&#151;in
the asylum and immigration process. The Refugee Children&#146;s
Consortium in particular believes
that,</p><ul><a name="0610113000148"></a>&#147;current
safeguards are insufficient to protect them, especially in light of the
fact that the government resisted any statutory requirement on
immigration authorities to have regard to the need to safeguard and
promote the welfare of children during the passage of the Asylum and
Nationality Act 2006&#148;.</ul><a name="0610113000126"></a>It goes on to state
that,<ul><a name="0610113000149"></a>&#147;in this
context the importance of easily accessible and accountable complaints
processes is considerably
heightened&#148;.</ul><a name="0610113000127"></a>Will the
Minister tell the House what training IPCC officers currently receive
on children&#146;s issues&#151;or indeed asylum and immigration
officers, particularly contract workers enabled by the Immigration,
Asylum and Nationality Bill?<p><a name="0610113000073"></a>I
am sure that the Minister is fully aware of Professor Al Aynsley-Green,
the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England, and his report on his
visit to Yarl&#146;s Wood in October 2005. The inspection report
raised a number of points, including the fact that none of the young
people spoken to were aware of why they were being detained or how long
they might be there. Nor did they seem to have access to any complaints
procedures.</p><h5><a name="0610113000153"></a>10.30

and Lady Buscombe had debates before the Summer Recess on the voice of
the child in the childcare and education Bills. Many speakers to the
previous amendment referred to the same problem. There can be no doubt
that listening to children&#146;s views can enhance and help our
understanding of the process and impacts on those experiencing it. We
on these Benches wholeheartedly agree that there is a fine balance
between consulting children and burdening them with decisions beyond
their years. Facilitating the creation of a targeted procedure by which
children and young people can register concerns and complaints will not
only lead to potential improvement in the service but also help
children to feel that they are being listened to and have some way of
getting across their views, and that they are not isolated in this
regard. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0610113000075"></a><a name="spnew_176"></a><b><a name="0610113000165"></a>Baroness

not been carried out in a dignified or humane manner. Excessive or
gratuitous force has been used on occasion and significant
harm&#151;both mental and physical&#151;has been inflicted on
children as a result. As the range of people authorised to conduct
searches and, if necessary, to use reasonable force and to detain
people arriving at ports of entry has been extended, people without
proper training or accountability are carrying out these functions.
That is highly inappropriate. The same rules should apply to
immigration officers and private contractors
alike.</p><p><a name="0610113000076"></a>We agree with the Chief
Inspector of Prisons that the use of and conditions of the detention
centres are inappropriate for children, which is echoed by the
Children&#146;s Commissioner. There are complaints of assault, but
there is no proper body authorised to hear those complaints. There must
be an independent body to which individuals should complain. All that
is extremely worrying and unsatisfactory. We must maintain civilised,
dignified, human procedures and conditions for all detainees, with a
minimum requirement that their human rights should be observed. We
support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="0610113000077"></a><a name="spnew_177"></a><b><a name="0610113000166"></a>Lord
Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I have listened
with care to the contributions made by the noble Viscount and the noble
Baroness on this issue. I entirely understand their approach, and,
personally, have some sympathy with it. Anybody who has ever had or
worked with children could not fail to care in the impassioned way that
they have
demonstrated.</p><p><a name="0610113000078"></a>Regulations made
under Clause 46 would enable the Independent Police Complaints
Commission to investigate complaints about, and conduct arising from,
immigration enforcement activities in England and Wales. Any such
complaints will be investigated thoroughly. The particular
circumstances of the individuals concerned in each case, including age
and vulnerability, will be taken into account and sensitively
handled.</p><p><a name="0610113000079"></a>Clause 46 will ensure
that there is similar independent scrutiny of immigration officers and
officials exercising police-like powers within the community, as are in
place for the police themselves. Under the current legislation giving
the IPCC oversight of the police, there is no separate legislative
provision enabling children to register complaints with the commission
as has been suggested in the proposed amendment. We take the view that
such a provision is unnecessary. Procedures already exist within the
commission which are sufficient for children and young people who may
wish to make a complaint regarding the police. It is anticipated that
the same procedures will be put in place for children who wish to make
a complaint in connection with immigration
enforcement.</p><p><a name="0610113000080"></a>The commission's
current statutory guidance states that where a young person under the
age of 16 wishes to make a complaint, the commission encourages the
police to have regard to the principle in the Gillick competency
guidelines that children under the age of 16 years are able, under
common 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_237"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 237</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>law, to give valid consent provided that they have sufficient
understanding and intelligence to enable them fully to understand what
is involved.</p><p><a name="0610113000081"></a>Applying that to the
complaints system means that as long as a child under 16 understands
fully what is involved in making a complaint, they should be able to do
so. However, the police service and the commission have a
responsibility to ensure that a young person making a complaint
understands the process and potential outcomes and, where necessary, is
provided with appropriate support in making the complaint. A complaint
can be made on behalf of a child or a young person by a parent,
guardian or third person.</p><p><a name="0610113000082"></a>At
regional level, the commission's central England office is focusing on
increasing access to the complaints system for young people as a
priority for 2006 and 2007. This will enable better understanding of
the position with regard to young people and the police complaints
system with a view to increasing awareness, trust and confidence, as
well as access to the police complaints
system.</p><p><a name="0610113000083"></a>The work will involve:
analysing complaints data on young people to ascertain their
demographics and the type of complaints; identifying what the barriers
are to complaining; and identifying proactive steps that can be taken
to overcome those barriers and assessing them in terms of their
feasibility. Examining police force data in relation to complaints that
the commission deals with from young people will also be part of that
work.</p><p><a name="0610113000084"></a>A number of stakeholder
meetings have already taken place. That forms part of the
commission&#146;s guardianship role, concerned with the promotion of
public confidence in the complaints system&#151;including, I may add,
improving and ensuring accessibility. Through that role the commission
can ensure that the system is accessible to children. In addition, the
Immigration and Nationality Directorate recognises the importance of
providing information to children subject to immigration control and is
discussing with the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England how best
this can be achieved.</p><p><a name="0610113000085"></a>I hope
that what I have said has offered a measure of reassurance to the noble
Viscount and the noble Baroness that their concerns are being
addressed. The noble Viscount asked a particular question about IPCC
staff and training issues. I cannot provide him with an answer this
evening. However, I undertake to write to him and the noble Baroness,
Lady Linklater, on the issue. I quite understand its import and
recognise that it is sensible that we get training programmes right and
much more sensitised to the issues
raised.</p><p><a name="0610113000086"></a>It is perhaps worth
saying that during the development of the commission's statutory
guidance for the police service in England and Wales, which the Home
Secretary approved and the police service must follow, which took
effect from December last year, the IPCC met a range of children's
organisations, including the Children's Legal Centre&#151;based at
the University of Essex&#151;Barnardo's and the Children's Society to
consult on specific issues concerning

commission is committed to continuing work with the police and young
people's organisations on the issue in future. It is our anxious
anticipation that the same approach will be followed and adopted when
the commission is responsible for the oversight of immigration
enforcement as well. We have found our contact with those organisations
to be especially beneficial in framing the Government's
approach.</p><p><a name="0610113000087"></a>So we have some
agreement&#151;or comity, if you wish&#151;on the issue. We are
extremely happy to ensure that the active dialogue that I have
described continues so that we ensure that young people can access and
understand the complaints process and feel included in it, even though,
as most of would willingly concede, the processes and procedures can
appear somewhat complex and disconcerting at the outset. We want to
ensure that we get this right, and we are grateful for the help and
support that we have. I express my gratitude to the noble Viscount and
the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, for their interest and concern, but
I trust that, having heard my remarks, the noble Viscount will feel

national prisoners and repatriation. Although it is quite late, the
noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has several issues that she very much
wants to have clarified, and it is therefore right for me to spend a
little more time than I would otherwise spend at this late hour to
ensure that those issues are covered and that we can have a proper
debate.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_239"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 239</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0610113000092"></a>Foreign national prisoners currently make
up approximately 12 per cent of the prisoner population. The Government
believe that they should, wherever possible, serve their sentence in
their own country. At present, the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984
requires three-way consent involving the sentencing state, the
receiving state and the prisoner. That means that a prisoner can in
effect veto a transfer properly agreed between the two Governments
concerned by refusing to consent to the transfer, and the Government
believe that this is no longer appropriate.
</p><p><a name="0610113000093"></a>The new clause amends the
Repatriation of Prisoners Act by clarifying the circumstances in which
a prisoner will be required to consent to a transfer before that
transfer can take place. A prisoner will be required to consent to the
transfer only if the relevant international agreement makes consent a
prerequisite to the transfer. Amending the 1984 Act in this way will
enable the United Kingdom to ratify and conclude prisoner transfer
arrangements that do not require prisoner consent. The consent of both
Governments involved will still be required in each case, so where
prisoner consent is still required by the relevant international
arrangement, Ministers must be satisfied that that consent has been
given in accordance with the requirements of those arrangements before
transfer can take place.</p><p><a name="0610113000094"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has tabled an amendment that seeks to
replace &#147;satisfied&#148;
with,</p><ul><a name="0610113000150"></a>&#147;has reasonable
grounds for
believing&#148;.</ul><a name="0610113000128"></a>The
amendment would enable the Government to transfer a prisoner without
having established beyond doubt that the prisoner had given consent in
a case where the international arrangements require it to be given. We
respectfully suggest that repatriating a prisoner in such circumstances
without knowing for certain whether the requirement for consent had
been satisfied would be inconsistent with those arrangements.
Accordingly, I cannot commend the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment to
the House, but I am sure that she will say in the usual way that she
was simply giving me an opportunity to make it clear that such
iniquitous practice would not happen here, and I am happy to oblige
her. <p><a name="0610113000095"></a>The Repatriation of
Prisoners Act came into force about 21 years ago. Since then, the
international thinking and practice on prisoner transfer has moved on.
Arrangements such as the additional protocol to the Council of Europe
convention on the transfer of sentenced persons opened for signature in
1997, and provide for the transfer of prisoners without their consent
where they are to be deported or otherwise removed at the end of their
sentence.</p><p><a name="0610113000096"></a>The EU is also
considering a proposal for a framework decision on prisoner transfer
between member states, which would enable prisoners to be transferred
without consent if that framework decision were to be adopted in due
course. This amendment will enable the United Kingdom to start
negotiations with like-minded countries to put in place prisoner
transfer agreements that do not require prisoner consent. The
Government will also enter into discussions with those countries with
which they 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_240"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>already have an agreement with a view to removing the requirement for
consent. Their intention would be to transfer those prisoners who have
no links with the United Kingdom and those who, in any event, may face
deportation at the end of the sentence. Often prisoners, such as drug
offenders, will have entered the United Kingdom solely to commit a
criminal offence. In those circumstances, the Government believe that
it is right that the prisoner should serve his sentence in his own
country where he can also receive support from family, friends and the
community, aiding his chances of rehabilitation. Subject to the
agreement of the Government of the receiving state, prisoners will be
returned to their state of nationality or, if appropriate, to the state
of residence. The Government will not seek to transfer those prisoners
whose primary links are agreed to be with the United Kingdom and who
are therefore unlikely to be removed at the end of the sentence,
although each case will be considered on its individual
merits.</p><p><a name="0610113000097"></a>Those comments deal with
the generality of the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns, but she asked
some additional, specific questions in relation, for example, to how
many transfers per year the Government are expecting. It is not
possible to estimate the number of prisoners who may be transferred
without consent. That will depend on our ability to negotiate new and
revised prisoner transfer agreements. The provision is part of a
package of proposals aimed at increasing the number of foreign national
prisoners who return to their own country to continue serving their
sentence.</p><p><a name="0610113000098"></a>The noble Baroness
wants to know where some of those prisoners come from and, in
particular, whether Jamaicans form the largest group in the United
Kingdom, which they do. Negotiations on the prisoner transfer agreement
between the United Kingdom and Jamaica are now at an advanced stage. I
have the happy task of involving myself in those negotiations and we
await their outcome. The noble Baroness is also interested to know
whether the Government expect to make any savings on the expenditure of
maintaining prisoners within the prison estate in the United Kingdom.
Removing prisoners at an early stage of their sentence will free up
prison places. That is important at a time when the Prison Service is
facing considerable pressure on its accommodation.</p><p><a name="0610113000099"></a>The extent of savings in prison places is
of course similarly difficult to estimate. The savings will be
dependent, once again, on the agreements that the Government are able
to put in place and the stage in the sentence when a prisoner is
transferred. This is not a scheme in the normal understanding of the
word because it does not introduce any freestanding power to remove
prisoners without first obtaining their consent. The amendment simply
clarifies the domestic law provision on whether in future prison
consent is required before a transfer can take place. As I tried to
explain earlier, the option of negotiating agreements with other states
without this as a provision is not available to
us.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_241"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0610113000100"></a>We were also asked how we would know
whether foreign prisoners qualified for transfer. The recorded
nationality of a prisoner is self-declared, but work is in hand to
improve the quality of the data. Once an international agreement
without consent is in place, prison governors will be asked to identify
all those within their custody from the countries concerned. I say in
passing, since it is late at night, that if the noble Baroness&#146;s
party opposite was more amenable to identity cards and their effect, we
would be greatly assisted in identifying exactly who people are, where
they come from and, obviously, where they could happily go back to.
That is a matter on which the noble Baroness may want to reflect with
her colleagues opposite. I have tried to deal with sending prisoners
home, which could of course be to their country of nationality or where
they have a right to reside.</p><p><a name="0610113000101"></a>I
was asked about the impact of the European free movement law upon this
proposal. A prisoner&#146;s rights under the European Free Movement
Directive are not affected by these changes. The Government will seek
to transfer those prisoners who have no links with the United Kingdom
and those who would in any case be deported at the end of their
sentence. Those who have a right to reside in the United Kingdom are
unlikely to be transferred unless, of course, they have lost or would
otherwise lose the right of residence.</p><p><a name="0610113000102"></a>The noble Baroness also wanted to know
whether the process would be hampered by the prisoner&#146;s right to
appeal or human rights and asylum legislation. The amendment will not
have any effect on the obligation of the United Kingdom Government to
comply with their international obligations. Consequently, prisoners
affected by a decision to repatriate without consent will be able to
seek judicial review of the decision if implementing it would risk
infringing the ECHR, the refugee convention or another tenet of
international or public law. The Government will robustly defend any
decision properly taken.</p><p><a name="0610113000103"></a>I was
asked whether prisoners detained under mental health legislation would
be excluded from the process, and if so, how. A decision has not yet
been made on that. To be eligible for transfer, the relevant
international arrangement would need to specifically cover those
detained under mental health legislation. This is an enabling provision
which will be effected in the way I have
described.</p><p><a name="0610113000104"></a>The noble Baroness
asked whether prisoners who had previously been granted indefinite
leave to remain in the UK but who were removed under this process would
be able to return the UK once they had completed their sentence
overseas, and if not, why not. In those circumstances, if prisoners had
not already lost their indefinite leave to remain by reason of their
criminality, we would not be looking to transfer them. If leave had
been removed, they would not be able to return and would be on the
warnings index. So it depends on the decision we make about
that.</p><p><a name="0610113000105"></a>The last
question&#151;the noble Baroness will tell me if I have not covered
any of them&#151;was how the new scheme would impact on those subject
to the early release scheme. The amendment has no impact on the 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_242"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 242</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>removal of foreign national prisoners under the early removal scheme. If
a prisoner is transferred under a prisoner transfer agreement, the
United Kingdom release arrangements cease to apply on transfer. If a
prisoner remains in England and Wales at the point in a sentence at
which he becomes eligible for early removal, then he will be considered
for removal under the scheme in the normal
way.</p><p><a name="0610113000106"></a>I believe that I have dealt
with all the questions and the noble Baroness will be delighted to know
that if she has any further questions I will be happy to deal with them
now or to write to her and place a copy in the Library. I hope that I
have dealt with the questions that were likely to excite the noble
Lord, Lord Dholakia, too. I beg to

the amendment merely probes the basis on which the Minister would issue
a warrant, and I am grateful for her answer. Of course we support the
broad thrust of the policy that the noble Baroness has brought forward
today. We simply had concerns about the practicability of the
Government&#146;s proposals, and it was in that spirit that I put
forward the series of questions to the Bill team. I am grateful to the
Minister for addressing them. They were necessarily lengthy and
detailed questions simply because, of course, when these matters return
to another place, as ever, they can be considered only in the very
truncated procedure of Commons consideration of Lords amendments. It
was important not merely for this House and another place but for the
public generally that the noble Baroness should put the matter on
record in some detail, as she has today. I am very grateful to
her.</p><p><a name="0610113000109"></a>There is one issue that we
need to consider, although I do not think that the noble Baroness will
address it tonight. She has said that this is merely enabling
legislation and that the Government will wish to negotiate or
renegotiate a number of agreements. We need to consider the balance of
those going out and those coming in&#151;how many prisoners from
other countries we will be receiving and what impact that will have on
any net saving the Government can realistically achieve.</p><p><a name="0610113000110"></a>Just as the noble Baroness does not want
to tease me about ID cards, I do not want to tease her on the current
state of our prisons and the Government&#146;s haste in trying to get
rid of as many people as possible. As far as we are concerned, even if
the Government proceed with the costly process of having identity cards
for everybody in this country, I do not think they need the National
Identity Register to achieve a proper count of prisoners and where they
come from. But as I say, we are beyond teasing at this stage of the

Committee, the Government inserted into the Bill new clauses on live
links, with our support. We welcome the proposals to increase the
capacity to use video links in criminal proceedings contained within
Clauses 49 to 51, but we have some specific concerns about particular
aspects of the proposals, which my amendment is designed to
highlight.</p><p><a name="0610113000120"></a>Amendment No. 140
would require a defendant to consent to attend preliminary court
hearings by video link if she or he is in police custody in a police
station. These matters were brought to my attention by Liberty, and I
thank it for its briefing. Clause 49 would enable a court to require a
person to attend preliminary court hearings via a video link from a
police station. At present, a defendant can be required to attend
preliminary hearings via video link, but only when he or she is held in
custody in prison.</p><p><a name="0610113000121"></a>Preliminary
hearings that might take place while a person is held in a police
station include applications for extending pre-charge detention, an
initial bail hearing, consideration of a guilty plea and even
sentencing hearings following the guilty plea. As a result of the
clause, where the defendant pleads guilty, he or she could be dealt
with from a police station without ever setting foot in court. The only
point at which a defendant&#146;s consent would be required for the
case to be dealt with via a video link is at the sentencing stage.
Until that point, the defendant has no choice about whether to attend
the hearing in person.</p><p><a name="0610113000122"></a>The
physical appearance of defendants before the court can be an important
safeguard against abuse. The defendant can come to court and in an
environment away from the prison, complain to his or her legal
representative or the court about any ill 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_244"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>treatment that may have occurred. Appearance in court can also make it
easier for the court to assess the state of the defendant. The scars of
self-harm or abuse or behavioural traits pointing to a mental health
problem may be much more evident when suspects appear in person than
when they appear only via a television
screen.</p><p><a name="0610113000123"></a>The proposal that a
person could plead guilty and be sentenced by the magistrates from
police custody creates a risk that the person may be, by inducements or
oppression, persuaded to admit the offence and plead guilty at the
police station. It is thought that the procedural change could also
disadvantage the defendant in initial bail applications and hearings
for extending pre-charge detention. The fact that the person is in
custody when the court is considering their case could create inertia
against release on the part of the
court.</p><h5><a name="0610116000064"></a>11
pm</h5><p><a name="0610116000003"></a>There is also a concern that
the power to deal with all cases via a video link could persuade the
police and CPS to charge a person and put them before the video link
court rather than use alternative disposals such as cautions and
restorative
solutions.</p><p><a name="0610116000004"></a>In
the context of the other significant changes in the ability to use
video links&#151;that is, to give evidence at the trial and at the
sentencing stage&#151;the Government have accepted that safeguards
are necessary. I shall not quote the Minister, but she did so very
clearly at col. 677 of the <I>Official Report </I>on 11
July.</p><p><a name="0610116000005"></a>None of these safeguards
applies to the proposed new power to require a person to give evidence
at a preliminary hearing from a police station. Due to the dangers
highlighted above, the defendant&#146;s consent is a safeguard which
surely should be applied also to attendance at preliminary court
hearings via video link from a police station. The amendment should not
in any way remove the possible benefits of the pilot which the
Government envisage, and we would certainly support that pilot. Indeed,
we agree with the prediction that many defendants would like to get
matters over and done with and not spend a night in police cells. That
is common sense. In a high number of cases, we would therefore expect
and hope that defendants would give their consent, with significant
efficiency savings resulting from
that.</p><p><a name="0610116000006"></a>The Government have argued
also that these proposals would benefit victims of crime, for whom they
rightly comment that delays can be very distressing. We do not,
however, consider that a victim of crime would be distressed by the
kind of delays that might result from this amendment&#151;a single
night in a police cell until the defendant can appear before the next
available court. It is in that spirit of trying to advance the argument
a little further that I move the amendment. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0610116000007"></a><a name="spnew_183"></a><b><a name="0610116000065"></a>Lord

at least two occasions and I am satisfied with the explanation that she

noble friend Lady Harris of Richmond. Its purpose
is 


<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_245"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column 245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>simply to probe. It would be helpful to learn from the Minister whether
the live link would apply in appeal proceedings and how it would
work.</p><p><a name="0610116000008"></a><a name="spnew_184"></a><b><a name="0610116000066"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, for the
helpful way in which they have spoken to their amendments, because I
think that we are all in agreement that there could be a bounty for
both victim and defendant by doing this in a quick and effective way if
it were to everyone&#146;s
benefit.</p><p><a name="0610116000009"></a>I should emphasise at
the outset that we do not, at first blush, think that Amendment No. 140
is necessary, but there may be a way in which we can deal with the
issue. I emphasise that the court cannot give a live link direction
without giving the parties an opportunity to make representations. The
defendant&#146;s consent is already required, as the noble Baroness
highlighted in her remarks, before he can be sentenced over a link, and
the case can reach the point of conviction only if the defendant is
willing to plead guilty. Of course, he is under no obligation to do
so.</p><p><a name="0610116000010"></a>It follows that, although a
defendant in police custody could be required to make his appearance
over a link, the most that could then happen without his consent is
that the court would determine his remand status. That is what would
happen to any detained defendant who was charged early enough in the
day to make a physical appearance in court the same day. As the noble
Baroness indicated, it could be to the defendant&#146;s advantage if
the court decided to grant him bail and he was set free. It is likely,
therefore, that many defendants will wish to appear by live link. I
agree with the noble Baroness about
that.</p><p><a name="0610116000011"></a>However, the Government are
content to look at the issue of consent in Clause 49 again. We would at
the same time like to consider whether it would be possible, taking the
noble Baroness&#146;s logic a little further, and subject to similar
consent requirements, to extend the facility to appear over a link from
a police station to defendants who would be bailed as well as those who
are detained. It seems unfair almost that, if the prosecution is
sufficiently worried about you not to give you bail straightaway, you
get an opportunity to be disposed of through live link but if you are
not sufficiently worrisome to be detained, you do not get that
advantage, regardless of whether you would like it. Perhaps we could
look together at how we resolve that quandary when we come back to
Clause 49. That would mean that a defendant who wished to appear
promptly, but who under Clause 49 would be denied the use of the live
link because he qualified for police bail, could also do
so.</p><p><a name="0610116000013"></a>I am very much obliged to the
noble Baroness for tabling her amendment. If she thinks that what we
have discussed is sensible, I invite her to withdraw the amendment; we
could have a discussion and come back with a consensual amendment to
deal with Clause 49 for those who have and those who have not been
granted bail&#151;and I suggest it only at this stage&#151;subject
to their consent being given in both circumstances. I am certainly
happy to look at that possibility before Third
Reading.</p>

round in Clause 49. I will be happy to give way in a moment so that she
may respond to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. Her proposal to extend
live links to those granted bail is very helpful. It seems practical to
offer that facility to those who have not been deemed so dangerous to
society to have been refused
bail.</p><p><a name="0610116000015"></a><a name="spnew_186"></a><b><a name="0610116000068"></a>Baroness
Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I was so carried
away by our agreement that I forgot to explain properly to the noble
Lord why his amendment is unnecessary and how it will work. That would
give a deal of comfort not only to the noble Lord but to others outside
this House interested in the matter&#151;and I am sure that is why he
raised it.</p><p><a name="0610116000016"></a>Amendment No. 141
relates to the provisions which would give the Court of Appeal
discretion to direct that an appellant who is in custody should appear
by means of a live link rather than in person. The amendment would
require the consent of the appellant to appear by way of a live link
before any such direction could be made. That would cause some
difficulty in the
procedure.</p><p><a name="0610116000017"></a>Giving the Court of
Appeal the power to direct use of a live link will have several
advantages, including improved security for prisoners, particularly
those in category A, requiring the highest security, who will not need
to be accommodated at court; reducing prison escort costs&#151;noble
Lords have discussed on a number of occasions the difficulties with
moving people around&#151;and reducing pressure on overstretched
London prisons caused by the transfer of prisoners located in prisons
outside London for appeal hearings. We expect that the appellant will
indicate his or her preference for the method of appearance when making
the application for leave to appeal, and that the court will have
regard to this before making a direction. Introducing a requirement of
consent, thereby allowing prisoners to insist on appearing in person,
would potentially undermine the benefits and result in high costs and
possible delays for the criminal justice
system.</p><p><a name="0610116000018"></a>The amendment would also
introduce a requirement that the court should be satisfied that the
live link direction is not contrary to the interests of justice. We do
not consider it necessary to be overly prescriptive in the nature of
the power. The court already has an overriding obligation to ensure
that an appellant receives a fair hearing in accordance with Article 6.
Furthermore, the Criminal Procedure Rules require the court to further
the overriding objective when exercising any power given to it by
legislation. This means that criteria which by definition equate to the
interests of justice are automatically imported into the exercise of
the court's discretion in procedural decisions. The court will
therefore always exercise the proposed power in accordance with the
interests of justice and the appellant&#146;s right to a fair
hearing. I know that those are the issues that the noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia, is particularly concerned about&#151;and rightly
so.</p><p><a name="0610116000019"></a>I hope that, in the light of
that explanation, the noble Lord will not press his
amendment.</p>

Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Lord Rooker):</b> I am pleased to announce that,
together with my counterparts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland,
I have asked the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to take on the
responsibilities of UK competent authority for the proposed new EU
chemicals legislation REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation
of Chemicals) and that it will today be launching a helpdesk for UK
business.</p><p><a name="061010139000014"></a>The
competent authority will provide advice and support to UK business for
dealing with the requirements of REACH, liaise with the new European
Chemicals Agency in Helsinki and co-ordinate enforcement of the
regulations in the
UK.</p><p><a name="061010139000015"></a>The
Health and Safety Executive will be responsible for delivering the
functions of the competent authority, working with the Health and
Safety Executive for Northern Ireland and in close partnership with the
Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the
Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service, which will together
help ensure delivery of the environmental benefits of REACH. The full
competent authority will be operational when REACH enters into
force.</p><p><a name="061010139000016"></a>The legally designated
competent authority will be the Secretary of State in England and the
relevant Ministers or departments in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, who will then together delegate the functions of the competent
authority to the Health and Safety Executive while maintaining overall
ministerial responsibility.</p><p><a name="061010139000017"></a>We
will be working closely with the Health and Safety Executive and other
organisations involved to finalise details of the competent authority
role and financial arrangements and we hope to reach final agreement
shortly.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="state_2"></a><a name="061010139000003"></a>Civil

Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Gillian Merron)
has made the following Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="061010139000019"></a>My right honourable
friend the Secretary of State for Transport is responsible for
determining the remuneration of board members of the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA) under paragraphs 6 and 7 of Schedule 1 to the Civil
Aviation Act 1982. This responsibility includes determining pension
provision for current and former board members. In practice, board
members&#146; pensions are broadly analogous with the Civil Aviation
Authority Pension Scheme
(CAAPS).</p><p><a name="061010139000020"></a>Under
paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 1 to the 1982 Act, once the Secretary of
State has made a determination 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS42"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column WS42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he or she is obliged to lay a Statement before each House of Parliament
containing particulars of that
determination.</p><p><a name="061010139000021"></a>With
effect from 6 April 2006 the CAAPS rules have been amended to take
account of changes in pensions legislation introduced by the Finance
Act 2004. The CAA section of the CAAPS has been amended to reflect
these legislative changes. The determination, which has been laid
before Parliament today, has been made to bring the named current CAA
board member&#146;s pension into line with the
CAAPS.</p><p><a name="061010139000022"></a>As a consequence of the
changes the salary for pension purposes is now no longer subject to the
earnings cap (established under Section 590C of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988) which existed previously. Mr Arscott (a
pension member by analogy) will now have his benefits calculated on
that basis with a commensurate increase in his pension. The
determination relates only to the pension payable to Mr Arscott and
does not affect the pension arrangements for any other member of the
board.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="state_3"></a><a name="061010139000004"></a>Defence
Logistics Organisation and Defence Procurement
Agency</h3><p><a name="061010139000023"></a><a name="spnew_195"></a><b><a name="061010139000102"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister
of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following
Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="061010139000024"></a>On 3 July 2006
(<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 27-8 WS) my right honourable friend the
Secretary of State announced the decision in principle to approve
proposals to co-locate elements of the Defence Logistics Organisation
(DLO) with the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) in the Bristol/Bath
area. He also announced that he had accepted in principle the
recommendations of the <I>Enabling Acquisition Change</I> report. These
were both subject to subsequent consultation with the trades
unions.</p><p><a name="061010139000025"></a>The
department entered into the formal consultation period immediately
after the announcement. I and my ministerial colleagues met with trades
union representatives over the summer to discuss their views on the
proposals during this time. The formal consultation period has now
closed, although we remain committed to trades union engagement
throughout the next stages of both
projects.</p><p><a name="061010139000026"></a>After
careful consideration, and taking full account of the points raised by
the trades unions, I have decided to proceed with implementing the
co-location proposals. I announced this final decision on 29 September
2006 and am updating the House now at the earliest opportunity after
the parliamentary Summer
Recess.</p><p><a name="061010139000027"></a>We will now move into
the implementation and assessment phase of the project that will
include the moves from Andover and Telford, the tendering process for
the development of the new site in Bristol and introducing flexible
working arrangements at various sites. We expect to have completed the
co-location process by 2011.</p>



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS43"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column WS43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="061010139000028"></a>Co-location planning has, however, been
adjusted in two respects since the 3 July announcement. There will now
be no moves from Sapphire House, Telford, before March 2008, although
the closure date of 2009 remains. It is also now likely that some
current activity will be retained at RAF Wyton instead of moving to
main operating bases. This does not alter plans to move about 500
acquisition-focused posts to the Bath/Bristol area in subsequent phases
of the project that will also include the withdrawal from Caversfield
in 2009-10.</p><p><a name="061010139000029"></a>I appreciate that
this decision on the way forward for the co-location project will have
consequences for MoD employees and their families, particularly in
current DLO sites where we will be scaling down our presence or
withdrawing altogether. The department will work to mitigate this
effect by providing appropriate support for those affected by the
outcome of these necessary
changes.</p><p><a name="061010139000030"></a>The <I>Enabling
Acquisition Change</I> report also made a series of recommendations
intended to improve the MoD's ability to undertake through-life
capability management. Consultation with the trades unions on the
recommendations of the report has also concluded. One of the
recommendations in the report was to merge the DPA and DLO from 1 April
2007. It has now been decided that the merged organisation will be
called Defence Equipment and Support and on formation it will be led by
General Sir Kevin O'Donoghue as the first Chief of Defence
Materiel.</p><p><a name="061010139000031"></a>These decisions will
mean that in the future we will have one single, co-located
organisation responsible for the procurement, maintenance and
sustainment of military capability. This will provide a greater unity
of purpose in acquisition, facilitate better decision making in the
early stages of acquisition and effectively manage military capability
through life. I am confident that this is the right way forward for
defence as a whole and will improve the support we give to our Armed
Forces.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="state_4"></a><a name="061010139000005"></a>EU:
Transport
Council</h3><p><a name="061010139000032"></a><a name="spnew_196"></a><b><a name="061010139000103"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the
Minister of State for Transport (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the
following Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="061010139000033"></a>I will attend the
first Transport Council of the Finnish presidency which takes place in
Luxembourg on 12 October. The main items on the agenda are: the
mid-term review of the 2001 White Paper on transport policy; the
Galileo satellite navigation project; the draft regulation on aviation
security; and two aspects of aviation external
relations.</p><p><a name="061010139000034"></a>There will be a
policy debate on the mid-term review of the Commission white paper on
European transport policy. The review, entitled <I>Keep Europe
Moving&#151;Sustainable Mobility for our Continent</I>, appeared in
July. It reviews the EU's transport objectives between 2001 and 2010,
as set out in the 2001 white paper. Evident in the review is a change
of emphasis, the aim now being to get the best from each transport
mode, rather than seeing present and future 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS44"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column WS44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>policy in terms of conflict between road and rail. Key themes are better
regulation, competitiveness, transparency, innovation and
logistics.</p><p><a name="061010139000035"></a>The
UK's overall aim is to ensure continued emphasis on reducing regulatory
burden, ensuring the proper working of the internal market and
protection of the environment. This means that new Commission proposals
should be based upon a rigorous impact assessment; that the rules of
the internal market are monitored to see that they are working
properly; that liberalisation of the domestic passenger rail market is
treated as a priority; and that measures such as aviation emissions
trading are brought forward to help mitigate environmental
damage.</p><p><a name="061010139000036"></a>There will be a report
from the Commission on its communication on freight transport
logistics, entitled <I>Freight Logistics in Europe&#151;Key to
Sustainable Mobility</I>. The
communication,</p><ul><a name="061010139000098"></a>&#147;examines
whether and where the EU could offer added value to enhancing the
development of freight transport logistics in Europe and the
world&#148;.</ul><a name="061010139000097"></a>The
Commission plans to present an action plan for freight transport
logistics in 2007. The Finnish presidency will take forward
consultation on the communication and prepare for the action plan.
Logistics is Finland's central presidency priority in the transport
field. The UK supports this initiative from the Commission and the
proposal to develop an action plan. However, in future discussions on
the action plan we will need to ensure that any regulatory proposals
that emerge are proportional and supported by industry
needs.<p><a name="061010139000037"></a>The presidency will
aim for a general approach on two draft regulations related to
management of the Galileo programme. The first amends the statutes of
the Galileo Joint Undertaking (Regulation 876/2002 EC) to allow for its
closure at the end of 2006; the second amends the regulation (1321/2004
EC) which established the Galileo Supervisory Authority, allowing it to
take over the joint undertaking&#146;s responsibilities for the
current development phase. The UK supports these amendments, which aim
to ensure that an appropriate management structure is in place, with an
efficient transition of responsibilities for managing the Galileo
programme.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="state_5"></a><a name="061010139000006"></a>Gas:
Safety</h3><p><a name="061010139000038"></a><a name="spnew_197"></a><b><a name="061010139000104"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and
Pensions (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> Gas is
widely used in households across the country. Gas is safer to use today
than 10 years ago, with the number of fatalities down by a third. Yet
20 to 30 people still needlessly die every year from preventable
gas-related carbon monoxide poisoning. New research suggests that
faulty gas appliances are still being used in many homes and that
public awareness of carbon monoxide poisoning risks is worryingly
low.</p><p><a name="061010139000039"></a>It is not right for the
current situation to continue. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is
conducting a review to improve consumer gas safety. Gas safety
stakeholders need to work with the HSE in that

gas safety regime. I am calling on the gas industry meanwhile to do all
it can to increase public knowledge of the dangers of unsafe use of
gas. I intend, with ministerial colleagues, to meet the industry to
review its actions and
progress.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="state_6"></a><a name="061010139000007"></a>Middle
East Peace Process and
Lebanon</h3><p><a name="061010139000040"></a><a name="spnew_198"></a><b><a name="_spnew69"></a><a name="061010139000105"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(Lord Triesman):</b> My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Margaret
Beckett) has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="061010139000041"></a>I welcome the
opportunity to update the House on developments in the Middle East
since my last Statement on 13
September.</p><p><a name="061010139000042"></a>As my right
honourable friend the Prime Minister has made clear, advancing the
Middle East peace process is a key priority for this Government. This
is vital for the Israeli and Palestinian people above all, but also for
the stability and prosperity of the region. As events this summer
demonstrated, the failure to resolve this conflict has serious
consequences for the international community, including for the
security of our citizens.</p><p><a name="061010139000043"></a>Since
my last Statement to the House I have met my Israeli counterpart, Tzipi
Livni, and Palestinian President Abbas, and together with Security
Council colleagues I have met the Arab League and the parties to
discuss how best to re-energise the Middle East peace process. Over the
coming period we will remain fully engaged in helping to drive the
peace process forward, working closely with both parties and our
international partners. We welcome the decision of the quartet to meet
with the parties and with the key regional players. We continue to
encourage Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas to meet as soon as
possible.</p><p><a name="061010139000044"></a>In particular, we
must work with our partners, particularly in the EU, to develop a new
programme to build viable institutions for a future Palestinian state.
As we set out at the London meeting in 2005, capacity building in the
Occupied Territories remains central to advancing the peace process. We
will continue to do all we can to support this work. We will also work
closely with the US Security Co-ordinator, General Dayton, and other
international partners to improve Palestinian security. Past events
have repeatedly shown that without progress on this, extremists will
always be able to block the political
process.</p><p><a name="061010139000045"></a>We and the
international community must continue to support President Abbas. I
would like to pay tribute again to his courage in advancing the
interests of his people and the cause of peace. We support his efforts
to work for a Palestinian Authority government based on the three
quartet principles of non-violence, recognition of Israel and
acceptance of past agreements. As the Prime Minister has made clear, we
would work with such a government. We remain deeply concerned by the
situation on the 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS46"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column WS46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ground, particularly in Gaza. We call for the immediate release of
Corporal Shalit, and particularly welcome efforts by the Government of
Egypt and President Abbas to secure his
release.</p><p><a name="061010139000046"></a>The
UK is committed to helping the Palestinian people. The Department for
International Development has committed &#163;30 million to the
Palestinians this year. This is in addition to the &#8364;329 million
given by the European Commission this year&#151;the largest
contribution in a single year. The UK supports an extension of the
&#147;temporary international mechanism&#148; to help alleviate the
situation. We are working with EU and quartet partners to deliver this.
As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International
Development (Hilary Benn), announced yesterday, the UK is providing an
extra &#163;3 million to the
mechanism.</p><p><a name="061010139000047"></a><I>Lebanon</I></p><p><a name="061010139000048"></a>The
situation in Lebanon has improved significantly since the unanimous
adoption on 11 August by the UN Security Council of
Resolution 1701. The ceasefire which the resolution established
continues to hold. Israeli forces have withdrawn from Lebanon except
for those in the divided village of Ghajar. The Lebanese Armed Forces
have deployed in large numbers across the country, including along the
blue line and in areas in southern Lebanon in which they have not been
seen for many years. The first phase of the expansion of UN Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), over 5,000 troops, has been deployed in
full. A second phase of some 5,000 further troops is in
preparation.</p><p><a name="061010139000049"></a>The Prime
Minister, during his visit to Lebanon in September, stressed our
continuing commitment to supporting the Lebanese armed forces, with
equipment and training, as they take control throughout the territory
of Lebanon. Javier Solana announced on 3 October that the EU will send
a team of experts to Beirut to take the EU's work in this area
forward.</p><p><a name="061010139000050"></a>I pay tribute to the
UN, its agencies and the many NGOs involved for the manner in which,
during the height of the humanitarian crisis, they delivered essential
supplies in difficult circumstances. Most of the Lebanese people
displaced by the conflict have now returned, but some 200,000 have been
unable to reoccupy their homes because of the level of destruction in
their villages or contamination by unexploded
munitions.</p><p><a name="061010139000051"></a>The reconstruction
effort is now under way. On 31 August, the Secretary of State
for International Development attended the Stockholm Conference for
Lebanon's Early Recovery. The Government of Lebanon set a target of
$530 million for their recovery plan, but in the event pledges from
countries attending the conference reached over $940 million. The
Secretary of State announced in Stockholm a further &#163;4 million
package of UK assistance, covering unexploded munitions clearance,
shelter, water and sanitation, and bringing the UK total to
over &#163;21
million.</p><p><a name="061010139000052"></a>We continue to work
with the UN Secretary-General and international partners to ensure the
full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the
earlier resolutions relating to Lebanon.

Korea: Nuclear
Weapons</h3><p><a name="061010139000053"></a><a name="spnew_199"></a><b><a name="061010139000106"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(Lord Triesman):</b> My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Margaret
Beckett) has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="061010139000054"></a>On 9 October, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Foreign Ministry announced
that it had conducted an underground nuclear test. There is still some
doubt about the exact nature of this test, but given North Korea's
stated intention last week, there can be very little doubt that it was
a nuclear test. We await further information to confirm this, but the
international community is proceeding on the basis that this was indeed
what the DPRK has said.</p><p><a name="061010139000055"></a>The
world has been united in its condemnation of North Korea's action,
which was carried out in direct defiance of the will of the
international community. Comments made by world leaders, nuclear
experts and international organisations have highlighted North Korea's
isolation. This issue has underlined the scale of the
counter-proliferation threat that we face. The international community
is working together to overcome this threat to peace and
security.</p><p><a name="061010139000056"></a>Discussions are
taking place within the UN Security Council in New York. Partners have
unanimously condemned the DPRK's actions and agreed that a robust
response is needed. Negotiations will continue. The UK will be pushing
for a robust response given the clear threat posed to international
peace and security by North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons,
including legally binding sanctions. Under Security Council Resolution
1695, adopted in July, there exists already a sanctions regime which
requires all states to prevent missile-related items being transferred
to or from North Korea. Any new sanctions will have to go further than
this. They will make it clear to North Korea that it must return to the
six-party talks and stop disregarding the concerns of its neighbours
and the international community. We should in particular strongly
support the need for measures to prevent the DPRK from exporting goods
and technologies that would help others to develop nuclear and
ballistic missile
capabilities.</p><p><a name="061010139000057"></a>Immediately
following the test my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and I
both issued statements making it clear that North Korea's actions were
both highly irresponsible and provocative. Since then, I have discussed
the situation with Foreign Ministers including Chinese Foreign Minister
Li Zhaoxing, Japanese Foreign Minister Aso and US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice. Those contacts will continue over the hours and days
ahead. We have also called the DPRK ambassador in London to the Foreign
Office to make clear our views.</p>

Trains operates the busy commuter routes into London Waterloo and
serves destinations in south-west London as well as places further
afield such as Bournemouth, Bristol, Exeter, Paignton, Plymouth,
Portsmouth, Reading, Salisbury, Southampton and Weymouth. Island Line
is a much smaller business, serving five towns between Ryde Pier Head
and Shanklin over 14 kilometres of
track.</p><p><a name="061010139000061"></a>The
department has awarded the franchise in line with the requirements set
out in the invitation to tender (ITT), a commercially confidential
document issued to bidders in March 2006. A supporting stakeholder
briefing document was published at the same time setting out the
specification included in the
ITT.</p><p><a name="061010139000062"></a>The current timetable
operated will remain largely unchanged. However, there are a number of
improvements including a second train each hour to Weymouth from
Waterloo, a new Salisbury-Romsey service via Southampton and
Southampton Airport Parkway and additional late evening and Sunday
services on several London suburban
routes.</p><p><a name="061010139000063"></a>The new operator has
addressed the continuing growth in passenger demand by redeploying the
existing rolling stock, initiating a refurbishment programme to
increase capacity on the suburban fleet and investing in additional
rolling stock. Smartcard technology will be rolled out by 2009 so that
passengers will benefit from electronic ticketing across the franchise
area. This will include the acceptance of existing Oyster products in
London zones 1 to 6. This means that passengers on South Western
services in London can use Oyster pay-as-you-go products as well as
newly available smart
tickets.</p><p><a name="061010139000064"></a>Fare structures will
change to incentivise travel outside the busiest periods of peak time
and, in conjunction with the rolling stock initiatives, will address
the key objective of accommodating future demand levels. The
introduction of smartcards will facilitate the ability of the operator
to offer flexible tickets to support this goal. Regulated fares will
continue to be consistent with government fares policy, while
Stagecoach will continue to have flexibility to make changes to
unregulated fares.</p>

enhancements at stations will be delivered. Waterloo station
and 13 other stations in the franchise area will be gated.
Extra security measures, including more visible staff and CCTV at all
stations and on all trains, will be
introduced.</p><p><a name="061010139000066"></a>The department
required bidders to submit a number of priced options as part of their
bids. Stagecoach has been asked to ensure that 95 per cent of the
passenger franchise footfall will travel through stations that have
been granted Secure Station
Accreditation.</p><p><a name="061010139000067"></a>Stagecoach will
also operate an hourly Waterloo-Exeter service once Network Rail has
built the necessary infrastructure, expected to be by December 2009.
Until this new service can be implemented, existing services operating
west of Exeter to Plymouth and Paignton will continue to run. The
current two trains per day operation between Bristol and Waterloo will
be retained throughout the new
franchise.</p><p><a name="061010139000068"></a>New GSM-R radio
equipment will also be fitted to all units in line with Network Rail's
programme of updating radio systems across the
network.</p><p><a name="061010139000069"></a>The decision on the
future of the Island Line has been deferred to allow time for more
extensive discussion with key stakeholders on the most appropriate way
forward, and recognising the recent community rail designation of the
railway. Further work is also needed to assess the most appropriate use
of the platforms at Waterloo International once Eurostar operations
vacate in late 2007.</p><p><a name="061010139000070"></a>In
summary, the successful bid has addressed the objectives for the South
Western franchise. Performance will increase to 92.5 per cent by
2009-10 (93.3 per cent by the end of the franchise); demand growth will
be accommodated through capacity and ticketing initiatives; and
stakeholder aspirations have been reflected in the timetable. The
franchise improves security on trains and at stations and offers value
for money to passengers and
taxpayers.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="state_9"></a><a name="061010139000010"></a>Regional

consultation seeking views on the designation of future assisted areas
from 2007-13 took place from February to August 2006. Approximately 420
written responses were received from a wide range of stakeholders and
interested parties. There were several regional and national
information events hosted across the country. Furthermore, the review
team and I personally met several delegations to consider individual
representations. We have responded positively to all representations
and amended the proposed map where in our judgment this is possible and
consistent with the principles and criteria which the UK Government
have determined and the constraints

Government's response to the consultation and the assisted areas
map<sup>1</sup> being sent to the European Commission for approval have
been placed in the House
Library.</p><p><a name="061010139000073"></a>The assisted areas map
will be sent to the European Commission today and it has up to two
months to approve it. The assisted areas map is not final until it is
approved by the European Commission as complying with it's guidelines
on regional aid. Upon receipt of this approval, the assisted areas map
will be implemented through UK legislation making it operational from
January 2007.</p><p><a name="061010139000074"></a>Much has changed
since the last review of assisted areas in 1998-99. The UK economy has
prospered, growing faster than any of the G7 industrialised nations.
Further countries have joined the European Union. The combination of
these two factors has meant that less of Britain is eligible for
assisted areas status. The European Commission guidelines published
last December specified that the proportion of, the UK population
covered by assisted areas for 2007-13 will be reduced from the 30.9 per
cent currently covered to 23.9 per
cent.</p><p><a name="061010139000075"></a>Assisted areas status
gives us flexibility to support investment, job creation and retention
propositions in the more disadvantaged areas of the UK. This helps us
to tackle regional disparities in the economic performance and to
promote social cohesion across the UK. In England we will be working
with the regional development agencies to recommend that areas losing
assisted areas status in 2007-13 be recommended for Tier 3 coverage.
This will offer SFIE to small and medium-sized enterprises under the
new European Commission SME block

McKenzie of Luton:</b> My honourable friend the
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls) has made the following
Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="061010139000079"></a>The Government are
strongly committed to tackling terrorist financing. Just as there
should be no hiding place for those who perpetrate terrorism, so there
should be no hiding place for those who finance terrorism. This
Statement updates Parliament on counter-terrorist finance actions taken
over the Summer Recess to strengthen further our framework for rooting
out the financial networks underpinning
terrorism.</p><p><a name="061010139000080"></a>On 10 August 2006,
the police arrested a number of suspected terrorists in connection with
an alleged plot to blow up airplanes leaving the UK in mid-flight.
Acting on the advice of the police and the Security Service, the
Treasury froze the assets of 19 of these individuals on 11 August. The
asset freeze was 



<notus-date day="10" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS51"></a><b>10 Oct 2006 : Column WS51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>imposed within 24 hours of the police arrests and was in place before
banks opened in the morning. This was the quickest and most
comprehensive asset freeze that the Treasury has undertaken and it has
yielded valuable operational benefits. The Executive Secretary of the
international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has said in relation
to the 11 August freeze
that,</p><ul><a name="061010139000099"></a>&#147;The measures
taken [by the Treasury] were exemplary, this is a concrete application
and implementation of FATF
standards&#148;.</ul><a name="061010139000081"></a>This
latest action means that a total of 188 accounts and around half a
million pounds of suspected terrorist funds have now been frozen in the
UK.<p><a name="061010139000082"></a>The measures set out here
are designed to help to detect, deter and disrupt money laundering and
terrorist finance, while safeguarding the UK's position as the world's
most secure and dynamic financial sector. The Treasury plans to produce
a detailed strategy-document around the end of the
year.</p><p><a name="061010139000083"></a><I>Terrorism (United
Nations Measures)
Order</I></p><p><a name="061010139000084"></a>Today, the Treasury
is asking the Privy Council to adopt a new Terrorism (United Nations
Measures) Order updating the existing order. This makes a number of
changes to the UK's domestic asset freezing regime, allowing us to
prevent funds, economic resources and financial services being made
available to anyone who is designated under the order on suspicion of
involvement with terrorism, while introducing a confidentiality
provision to protect, where necessary, information that may be
disclosed on a confidential
basis.</p><p><a name="061010139000085"></a><I>Closed-Source
Evidence</I></p><p><a name="061010139000086"></a>The Treasury has
agreed, on the advice of law enforcement agencies, to use closed-source
evidence in asset freezing cases where there are strong operational
reasons to impose a freeze but insufficient open-source evidence
available. The use of closed-source material will be subject to proper
judicial safeguards. The Government intend to put in place a special
advocate procedure to ensure that appeals and reviews in these cases
can be heard on a fair and consistent basis. In order to ensure
appropriate accountability to Parliament, we will report to Parliament
quarterly on the operation of the UK's asset freezing
regime.</p><p><a name="061010139000087"></a><I>Money Service
Businesses</I></p><p><a name="061010139000088"></a>On 29 September,
the Treasury published a review into the regulation and performance of
money service businesses in preventing money laundering and terrorist
financing. The vast majority of bureaux de change, cheque cashers and
money remitters are honest and important partners in the fight against
financial crime. But the scale of the challenge we now face demands we
strengthen our current financial controls so that we can root out money
laundering

system with a licensing system, take tougher action against
non-compliance and demand firms keep better records, build on the
controls we introduced five years ago and give us the powers we need. I
also want to give firms in the sector better support and guidance and
recognise the important contribution they make to our financial system
at home and abroad.</p><p><a name="061010139000089"></a><I>State
Benefits</I></p><p><a name="061010139000090"></a>On 3 July, I made
a Statement to Parliament announcing that the Government would be
restricting the payment of state benefits to the households of
UN-listed terror suspects. This policy has now been applied to six
households. Following a legal challenge, the High Court ruled on 22
September that the Government's approach was lawful and was consistent
with its obligations under the relevant UN Security Council
resolutions.</p><p><a name="061010139000091"></a><I>Charities</I></p><p><a name="061010139000092"></a>In
February, the Government launched a review into the regulation and
performance of the charitable sector in preventing terrorist financing
and will make recommendations later this year for protecting the
charitable sector from terrorist infiltration. It is essential that
charities are protected from abuse by terrorists seeking to exploit the
goodwill of donors. On 24 August, the Charity Commission, having
consulted Treasury and Home Office Ministers, launched an enquiry into
the charity Crescent Relief and froze its bank
accounts.</p><p><a name="061010139000093"></a><I>Third Money
Laundering Directive</I></p><p><a name="061010139000094"></a>On 31
July, the Treasury published a consultation document on implementing
the EC Third Money Laundering Directive. This will ensure our systems
for tackling money laundering and terrorist financing continue to be in
line with international best practice and will implement a risk-based
approach, allowing businesses to target their resources in the most
effective and proportionate manner. The consultation closes on 20
October and we will report the results when we publish draft
regulations around the turn of the
year.</p><p><a name="061010139000095"></a><I>International
Action</I></p><p><a name="061010139000096"></a>Because terrorist
financing operates globally, so the response must be global. Last year,
the UK used its presidencies of the G7 and the EU to step up
international action against terrorist financing. The Chancellor will
today write to EU finance ministers about taking this agenda forward.
The UK has recently been appointed to serve as president of the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) from summer 2007. We will use our
presidency to drive forward a reform agenda urging the FATF to be more
outward looking and more clearly focused on tackling abuses and risks
in the international financial
system.</p>

part of stage 3 of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force

preliminary team that deployed in late 2005 to Helmand. The
Government's view then, as now, was that the Taliban and other
illegally armed groups represented a significant impediment to the
country's near-term reconstruction, particularly in the south. That is
why we deployed a robust force including attack helicopters and
artillery.</p><p><a name="061010143000030"></a>The level of forces

reconstruction activity. We are working with NATO allies and non-NATO
troop contributors to ensure that commanders on the ground have access
to the resources they need to carry out the ISAF mission. Bringing
about reconstruction and development in Afghanistan will require
substantial economic, developmental and political support for some time
to come. The precise force package that will need to be deployed to

to implementing all European Court of Human Rights judgments fully in
accordance with the United Kingdom's international obligations. Most
judgments against the UK are implemented promptly by the lead
government department. Delays occur in a few cases, sometimes because
of the need for legislation, or because of debate as to the action
required to implement the judgment. In cases where judgments are not
promptly implemented in their entirety, interim measures may be taken
to prevent a recurrence of the violation. The Government do not
therefore propose to introduce any new mechanism for the implementation
of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights since the Government

Davies of Oldham:</b> We do not have estimates for
the total carbon emissions from vehicles travelling in excess of 70
miles per hour for each of the past five years. As part of the review
of the UK climate change programme, however, the Government have looked
at the potential carbon savings that might result in the year 2010
under a wide range of different policy scenarios. These included one
scenario under which no vehicles exceeded the speed limits on motorways
and dual carriageways. Our estimates suggest that savings in the region
of 0.5 million tonnes of carbon per annum could theoretically occur
under such a scenario. In practice, however, it would be virtually
impossible to enforce blanket compliance with the 70 miles per hour
speed limit, and the Government have no intention of introducing such a
policy. With regard to the effect of carbon emissions as a result of a
reduction in speed limits, I would refer the noble Lord to my Answer of

council adopted UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1591 in March
2005 to sanction individuals who are impeding the peace process and
violating human rights in Darfur. It established a panel of experts to
make recommendations in this respect. The council adopted UNSCR 1672 in
April 2006 to impose sanctions on a first group of individuals. We

council established an international commission of inquiry to
investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and
human rights law in Darfur by all parties. This body reported in
January 2005. In March 2005, we helped secure UNSCR 1593, referring the
situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC). We

parties to the DPA implement their commitments and to bring
non-signatories to sign the

council authorised a UN Mission for Darfur to replace the current
African Union (AU) Mission (AMIS). We are working with the UN
Secretary-General, Security Council partners, the AU and the League of
Arab States to secure Sudanese consent and co-operation for that
mission. In the mean time, the United Nations will provide additional
support to help bolster AMIS until a UN mission can
deploy.</p><p><a name="061010143000176"></a>The security situation
in Darfur remains critical. The Sudanese armed forces launched a major
offensive against rebels in Darfur in late August, which has also
resulted in civilian deaths and displacements. Rebel violence has also
affected humanitarian operations. We are calling urgently for an end to
these military offensives.</p><p><a name="061010143000177"></a>The
humanitarian situation is precarious and has the potential to
deteriorate very rapidly. Access for humanitarian agencies is already
severely hampered by banditry, fighting and attacks on aid workers and
hijacking of their vehicles. Any significant change in the security
situation could result in a sharp decline in humanitarian conditions.
For example, the withdrawal of agencies from Gereida in South Darfur,
following prolonged interfactional fighting last weekend, has left an
extremely vulnerable population of over 100,000. The number of persons

Since April 2004, we have contributed over &#163;190 million in
humanitarian assistance to Sudan. We are supporting the World Food
