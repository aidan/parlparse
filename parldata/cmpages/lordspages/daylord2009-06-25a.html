It is very basic and not difficult to learn how to use those services, which are essential to a lot of people and will be in the future.</p>

The drainage problems and major defects have been identified, the junior ranks mess has been significantly improved and there have been significant changes. There are still problems and there is still work to be done. Money is tight and it has been decided, as far as concerns the defence estates, to concentrate on living accommodation rather than band accommodation.

It was far from conclusive. Will the Minister urgently invite LOCOG to look again at the presentation shown by British Shooting on 16 February&#151;it was seemingly dismissed as inaccurate information&#151;that demonstrated that the Olympic shooting events can still be staged at Bisley, within existing boundaries, in time and on budget, if LOCOG now fully engages with British Shooting and its consultants? Would that not leave a much better legacy of a world-class centre for the next Commonwealth Games, international and national events and training, as well as military marksmanship?</p>

I was not present at the meeting, but I would be astonished if it had not been made definitively clear that Woolwich is the decision. The shooting is to be located at Woolwich for very good reasons, which have been explained. As I understand it, the purpose of the meeting was partly to define that situation.</p>

As far as I am aware, the only legacy that is proposed is the kit to be used for the shooting event. With whom is the Ministry in contact in the British shooting world to make sure that the kit that is specified and ordered is suitable for dispersal to local shooting clubs, or in some other way, to provide a legacy? That clearly must be a crucial decision. Following on from what the Minister said, has the Ministry any other legacy proposals?</p>

I understand exactly the point made by the noble Lord. We consider the physical legacy from the shooting range at Woolwich to be at least as extensive as anything from Bisley. We do not see a great deal of legacy for the future in Bisley. That is one reason why this decision has been taken. However, I entirely accept that, as the noble Lords says, if the legacy is to be promoted effectively in terms of shooting kits and encouragement of the sport, the relationship between the Olympic authorities and British Shooting and all shooting groups must improve on what has obviously obtained in recent months.</p>

The House will appreciate that British Shooting has been strong in its view that Bisley ought to have been the location. The decision is final that Woolwich is the better option in the overall strategy for the Games. It is important that the Olympic authorities now relate closely to British Shooting and all those with the interests of the sport at heart to guarantee that this issue of legacy is promoted satisfactorily.</p>

I understand what my noble friend is saying about this sport. The same issue could be presented for the equestrian events, another contentious issue that we have discussed. Everybody knows the worldwide renown of Burghley and of Badminton. The decision that those events should be taken in Greenwich Park, close to the Olympic Village, is on exactly the same logic. These are the London Games. The integrity of these sports, which are often somewhat distant from the focal points of the Games, will be, in the London instance, closely related to the excitement round the immediate area of the Olympic village.</p>

The Milk Marketing Board, shut down by the Official Opposition when they were in government in the 1990s, had a contract obligation to every dairy farmer to collect all their milk however remote their location. The collapse of Dairy Farmers of Britain, referred to by the Minister, leaves 200 dairy farmers without guaranteed milk collection from their farms. Will the Government step in and ensure collection of this milk, underwrite these producers&#146; May milk cheques and bring forward a new milk marketing Act, as in the 1930s, to ensure that these dairy farmers get a fair price for their milk which is above their production costs? The 10p per litre currently being given to these 200 dairy farmers is a disgrace.</p>

The milk market is a commercial operation and reflects the fact that the milk production industry in the United Kingdom and in Europe is suffering from the recession because demand has dropped. However, the Government are optimistic about the future of the British industry. If the noble Lord is using the recent collapse of Dairy Farmers of Britain as an instance of crisis, he may be exaggerating the point because, as I indicated in my Answer, 96 per cent of the milk being produced has found another buyer.</p>

It is all very well for the Minister to say that 96 per cent of the milk will be collected, but that does not necessarily mean that 96 per cent of dairy farmers are protected, because the milk that other buyers do not want very often comes from small, family farms. Will the Minister also comment on how much of the agricultural industry as a whole will be affected? We are talking not just about dairy farmers but about feed merchants, the transport business and the production&#151;or at least the processing&#151;areas. As for the Minister&#146;s latest comment about the industry being in good heart, can he explain why it seems necessary to reopen intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder?</p>

I am saying that milk production in this country cannot be identified as being in crisis. It is no more in crisis than is the whole of the British economy in relation to the slump in world demand arising from the present recession. I marvel at the fact that although noble Lords opposite continually advocate the free market, the moment they identify a stick with which to beat the Government they demand government subsidy and intervention.</p>

Therefore, I do not think that it will stand up to suggest that the milk industry is in crisis in those terms. There are certainly pressures on some small producers&#151;we recognise that and we have sympathy for them. We are concerned. We called a meeting to analyse this problem and to give a reassurance that every mechanism would be employed to sustain as many of the small farmers concerned as possible. I am pleased to report that it was quite clear from that meeting that constructive action was being taken by all those concerned. However, we cannot extrapolate from that that the British milk industry is facing a bleak future, because it is not. What it is suffering from, in certain very exposed areas, such as the very small producers, is reduced demand, but we all recognise the reasons for that.</p>

I maintain, however, that the long-run future of the dairy industry and the milk-producing industry looks good. There are problems in the interim, but, as I indicated, milk production in this country will be reduced by a fraction of 1 per cent by the loss of these farms. The loss of production on these farms is a personal tragedy for each of the farmers concerned and their families&#151;I am not underestimating that at all&#151;but when considering the industry, which is what the noble Lord addressed his Question to, I do not accept that the industry is going through anything other than short-term difficulties with a long-run prosperity beckoning it.</p>

Half of all my patients had one of the variants of dementia.

Those I see around me here today are too well informed to need me to do this. I am also proud to be a vice-president of the Alzheimer&#146;s Society, which has done so much in these past 25 years to bring this dreadful disorder into the sunlight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09062549000065"></a>When I was younger, I was often asked why I chose this field, which carried so much stigma for those who undertake it as well as the sufferers. Of course, one&#146;s personal motivations are never straightforward, but mine owed much to growing up at home with my grandmother, who developed dementia in her mid-80s, and gradually becoming aware of the terrible stress that that imposed on my parents. Later I came under the influence of one of the truly great visionaries of his medical generation, Tom Arie, whose influence on service developments for older people, both here and abroad, has been remarkable. He taught me the fun, the fascination, the extraordinary personal rewards, that come from working in a highly professional multidisciplinary service with patients and their families.</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09062549000066"></a>The National Dementia Strategy has the potential to be one of this Government&#146;s triumphs. It is a splendid piece of work, achieved under the excellent leadership of Professor Sube Banerjee and Jenny Owen, to whom I pay tribute. Its provisions are comprehensive and it is all good stuff. I do, however, worry about the &#163;150 million notionally allocated from central funds to support its implementation; it will not be ring- fenced by primary care trusts, so we can assume that in some places even this small amount of pump-priming money will be rapidly diverted elsewhere the minute the expected NHS period of austerity begins to bite. How do the Government intend to monitor the spending and the progress of the implementation of the strategy?</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09062549000067"></a>There is still precious little understanding by health and social care services of the impact of dementia on families or on the economy. The &#163;17 billion spent annually is the direct costs of care on those already diagnosed. Well over 80 per cent of the money spent on adult social care is spent on people with dementia, although most local authorities do not seem to have twigged this yet. We even waste &#163;200 million or so in acute hospitals on inappropriate care.</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09062549000068"></a>If we are to begin to get services in to help families in the early stages, then diagnosis is the key, as the strategy recognises. Like any other neurodegenerative disease, dementia and its clinical precursor, cognitive decline, need to be diagnosed and treated. I used to rage at the NHS and local authority services which said my patients must be &#147;assessed&#148;, going direct for a social care package, when everyone else got a diagnosis for care and treatment. This does not happen to people with Parkinson's and motor neurone disease. Too often, people with this catastrophic disorder have been dismissed as a social problem to be tidied up. About half of all people with dementia will not get a diagnosis and there are some very perverse reasons for this.</p>

In theory, you cannot go into an ordinary care home if you have a label of Alzheimer's or one of the other named dementias. You can go in with &#147;a little bit of memory impairment&#148; and a smidgen of cognitive decline. So of course, we professionals pretend. But in reality no older person now goes into care unless they have serious cognitive impairment and dementia; we just call it by a euphemism.</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09062549000070"></a>If you have a nasty label such as Alzheimer's, you are supposed to go to an expensive EMI home rather than an ordinary one, which is probably of no better quality than an ordinary care home, and quite often worse. The family does not want that, the hospital waiting for a discharge will not want that and the local authority certainly will not pay the extra. We need to be honest about it and we will not be until the Government sort out this funding problem.</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09062549000071"></a>Dementia is a terminal illness&#151;patients survive only two to three years in their final care home. Homes are, in effect, providing end-of-life care for patients with a neurological disease the way hospices provide care for terminally ill cancer patients. The difference is that you get hospice or hospital care free but if you have dementia you have to pay for your own care until your money has more or less run out. This is what the Alzheimer&#146;s Society has called the &#147;dementia tax&#148;. For care at home, 26 per cent pay for it all themselves; another 42 per cent pay a significant proportion. More than half of those in residential care pay more than &#163;300 a week towards the costs of being cared for. Can you imagine the outcry if the Government decided to charge hospital patients that amount?</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09062549000072"></a>I have never campaigned for social care to be provided free out of current taxation. I think rather it would be better if all health and social care was provided on a level playing field, with a mixture of state and personal investment. I am a fan of the minority report by the noble Lords, Lord Lipsey and Lord Joffe, on the Royal Commission on Long Term Care and very attracted to Sir Derek Wanless&#146;s analysis, <I>Securing Good Care </I><I>f</I><I>or Older People</I>, published in 2006. We still wait with bated breath for the social care Green Paper&#151;I believe it is expected any day now. I hear a rumour about next Tuesday, but it had better be good as social care is in meltdown out there. There are so few services, and often of such poor quality, that these new dementia advisers, described so well in the strategy, are going to have a very thin time trying to put a package together. Some of the NHS and local authority commissioning practices have been disgraceful.</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09062549000073"></a>Joan Bakewell recently commented in the <I>Times</I> on the online e-auction system of tendering care for older people with dementia. Costs are driven down to rock bottom, meaning that authorities accept levels of care we would not tolerate in a well-run zoo. She is right. These were her words, not mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09062549000074"></a>The training of both domiciliary and residential care staff is almost non-existent. They have no idea how to manage behavioural problems. We have a high

It is time we insisted that staff learn to speak fluent English. It is time we learnt to value them too. Staff are extraordinarily poorly paid at minimum wage levels; we simply do not value sufficiently the vital work they do. The lives of the residents are often starkly empty as a result of this.</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09062549000075"></a>Once a person is in care they get less access to healthcare than at home&#151;less nursing, less physio, less speech therapy, less chiropody, less doctoring, less mental health nursing. Often the primary care trust feels they do not need to access community health services because they are somehow being paid for as part of the private care package. Authorities pay far more for similar residential care for younger adults with disabilities. This is straight age discrimination and perhaps we will need to challenge this under the new equality legislation.</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09062549000076"></a>I know that after this speech I shall be inundated with letters from care homes proud of the quality of their care. It is true there are some reasonable ones but they are a minority and I would guess that there are many noble Lords here today who have tried to find a suitable care home for their own parents, only to be disappointed and disheartened by the quality of what they saw around them. Training is vital. Has the Minister had an opportunity to read the report of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia on training needs called <I>Prepared to Care</I>? That seems to me to be a good start on training requirements but we have to solve the workforce issue.</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09062549000077"></a>Turning to research, the Government are holding a summit in July with the great and the good, academics and funders, to talk about possibly having a plan. I hope it is a plan for a proper strategy for research development. There is more money than ever before in research programmes into the science of the dementias, about &#163;32 million, but the Government invest eight times less in dementia research than cancer research and similarly less than in cardiovascular disease, even though economically, and tragically for families, the impact of dementia is greater. Furthermore, they do not invest in a long-term predictable way, but in sporadic bursts when pushed. How can the Government continue to justify that, given the economic and personal impact of this disease?</p>

<a name="90625-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09062549000078"></a>We have a science base in the UK that is world beating. All bar one of the genes that have been discovered to be predictors of the familial types of dementias have been discovered here in the UK. Here, we get far better bangs for our bucks investing in basic molecular science, and better quality outcomes for smaller investment, than in the United States. The NHS is well organised to do clinical research in this country and we also have university departments of social research that are set up to do the research&#151;if only they could get the research funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09062549000079"></a>Almost all the research undertaken at present is on the smallish younger groups of people: it is not focused on the everyday, common stages of dementia. We have no idea how that research will translate to older people. Of course, I should like to have a poly pill that we could all take at 40 that would prevent us developing this disorder, but the problem is that dementia and ageing are closely associated. There is no escaping the

It is likely that decreasing the risk of dementia with prevention strategies will lead to an increased ageing population and therefore the survival of the later cohort of dementia sufferers. Of course, it is very much worthwhile making it later, but the results of successful early treatment and prevention are not as clear as one would like on a population basis.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09062549000080"></a>The Alzheimer's Research Trust, which provides something like &#163;4.5 million of research money, and the Alzheimer's Society, which also provides some money for research, have talked together about how to pool their research-promoting energies. I hope that they will continue to talk because working together on this strategy would be helpful. Can the Minister assure us that the forthcoming summit will lead to a proper strategy for promoting research in this field?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09062549000081"></a>I am greatly looking forward to the contributions of other noble Lords here today and have said quite enough, but I should like to end with my grandmother, Elizabeth Lawson. She was born a Geordie girl and was a key person for me as I was growing up. She told me wonderful stories of her dancing party days in Gateshead and sang Geordie songs, which I still remember. She confided to me that her first love, a soldier, died of typhus on the boat coming home from the Boer War, so you can guess what age she was born in. She later married my taciturn and brainy grandfather, who was a colliery engineer, who brought her south to Nottingham, where he joined the then brand-new Clifton Colliery and she raised a family.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09062549000082"></a>On the whole, I think it was a good life, but after being widowed, my parents cared for her for many years as she developed dementia. She died&#151;I was amazed to find this morning that it was 40 years ago&#151;in an anonymous ghastly long-stay ward in Sherwood Hospital&#151;a former workhouse infirmary&#151;where regimented beds were so close together there was scarcely room to stand between them. It was such a horrible place that her son, my father, found it almost too distressing to visit.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09062549000083"></a>Sherwood Hospital later became a superb example of really good care, curiously enough under the care of Professor Tom Arie, my mentor. But how much have we really improved the chances of good care in the community of a kind that we can all be proud of, which is not stigmatising? This strategy had better work, because it really is us next.</p>

It is a cause for celebration

However, while we celebrate, we must be clear that the incidence of dementia will increase with age as the noble Baroness has reminded us. In parenthesis we should perhaps remember that it is not always older people who are sufferers; there are many distressing instances of early-onset dementia given by the Alzheimer&#146;s Society.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09062549000086"></a>It is good news that this Government take the issue seriously and that they have published a strategy earlier this year. As someone who has spent many years working with carers, I was very glad indeed, and welcome most warmly, that the strategy recognises that families are an important resource&#151;probably the most important resource&#151;in providing care for somebody with dementia. The Government have recognised the heavy and difficult challenges that the carers of those with dementia often experience and the need to deliver better support.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09062549000087"></a>The strategy sets out important steps in improving dementia awareness and information provision to help the public, carers and sufferers to better understand, prepare for and cope with the disease. In addition, there is a welcome recognition of the role that technology, like &#147;telehealth&#148; and &#147;telecare&#148;, can play in maintaining independence for dementia sufferers and flexibility for their carers.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09062549000088"></a>No one could disagree that there should be better knowledge about dementia and that the stigma that surrounds the conditions should end. We should remove the perception that dementia is a natural consequence of ageing and that nothing can be done for people with this condition. In that regard, there needs to be much better education and training for professionals. This should not just be for people providing dementia services but for other people in the NHS too. Certainly, much more sensitivity about this condition is needed in general hospitals.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09062549000089"></a>We must ensure that people with dementia are correctly diagnosed. Currently, I believe only one third of people with dementia ever receive a diagnosis. This puts excessive strain on the carers who do not get the support or information they need. Neither is their expertise recognised. I have lost count of the number of carers who have said to me, &#147;I took him into hospital or to the day centre and nobody asked me about him, nobody asked me about how to deal with him and what his medication is and so on. They just said, &#145;You run off now, dear, and have some good respite&#146;&#148;. For carers with a great deal of expertise in this area, this is demeaning. Certainly, we all understand that people with dementia, and their carers, should get easy access to care, support and advice, following diagnosis. I very much hope that the dementia advisers set out in the strategy will help this.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09062549000090"></a>Much progress has been made with carers in recent years. I applaud the Government for the lead that they have given, as well as campaigning organisations such as Carers UK. However, they will only be adequately supported in this arena if we link the dementia strategy with the national carers&#146; strategy. The dementia strategy focuses mainly on the health and social care sector in  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1678"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1678</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>supporting people with dementia. Carers also need a decent income, the ability to continue working, back-to-work support, health checks and better support from the health service for their own health. They need better information about housing and about their rights, and skills and confidence, too.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09062549000091"></a>The dementia strategy says that support for carers needs to be delivered through the national carers strategy but it does not mention work or income. We need to ensure that the key professionals who are implementing the dementia strategy have a clear idea of their responsibility under the carers strategy and of how it can help carers. Conversely, we need those who are implementing the carers strategy to ensure that carers of people with dementia are better supported. If these two strategies do not work together, the outcomes for carers of people with dementia will be considerably weaker.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09062549000092"></a>One example that was referred to by the noble Baroness is the &#163;150 million that was given to primary care trusts to provide respite care. There is a great deal of confusion about this money. A few primary care trusts, we understand, have indicated that they will be spending all or some of their allocation on breaks. Many are confused and have not yet entered into discussions about what to do, and many acknowledge the extra funding but do not want to spend it on carers. I heard of one PCT which set up a planning group on how to use the money before realising that it was not ring-fenced. When it realised that, it said, &#147;Ah. Well, we don&#146;t need to spend it carers at all, then&#148;. This is not satisfactory, so I hope that the Minister will tell us, while acknowledging that unpaid carers deliver the majority of care to people with dementia, what additional steps the department will take to ensure that carers of people with dementia benefit from the whole New Deal for Carers strategy and are better able to access not only funding but information.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09062549000093"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, mentioned the Green Paper, which we all await with baited breath. She thinks that it will come next Tuesday; funnily enough, I heard that it would be the following Tuesday&#151;but never mind. Does the Minister agree that a long-term settlement for social care is essential to ensure full delivery of the National Dementia Strategy? People with dementia, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, told us, are hardest hit by the system of charging for care. Will the Green Paper set out options for reform which will deliver a better deal for people with dementia and their carers? I have heard it said that what we are requiring and expecting from this Green Paper is nothing less than a new Beveridge.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09062549000094"></a>In commending the strategy, I also point up its limitations; principally, that while it is very good that it sets out a plan of action that should benefit the half a million carers looking after somebody with dementia, it needs to be combined with good implementation of the national carers strategy if it really is to benefit those with dementia and their carers.</p>

Dementia is a national crisis and too little is being done to address an urgent need. I should declare my interest as a patron of the Alzheimer&#146;s Research Trust and as the recently widowed wife of an Alzheimer&#146;s sufferer.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09062549000096"></a>I welcome the publication of a national dementia strategy; &#163;150 million over the next few years, however it is spent, will certainly help. Nevertheless, as other noble Baronesses have said, it is woefully inadequate in the face of the problem facing us as a nation. Better training for GPs and a dementia specialist in every general hospital are welcome reforms which should have existed long ago. However, the fine words promising patients more involvement and control in their treatment and the additional help for carers do little to resonate with the reality of dementia for the thousands of sufferers and their families today.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09062549000097"></a>The problem is indeed urgent, as the noble Baroness has said. More than 700,000 people suffer from this terrible affliction, involving untold distress and hardship for them and their families. But matters can only get worse. We have over the past century greatly increased life expectancy, but for more and more of us, our bodies will, in all meaningful ways, outlive our minds. It is estimated that by 2025, 1 million people will suffer from dementia.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09062549000098"></a>I should like to reflect for a moment on the reality of the disease that we are debating. Dementia affects memory, orientation, thinking capacity, comprehension, calculation, learning, judgment and language. It is a progressive disorder for which there is, as yet, no cure. For many sufferers, it brings with it loss of emotional control, in social behaviour and in the ability to make even the most simple decisions. Although it can occur in early life it is strongly age-related; the number of cases roughly doubles for every five years past the age of 60. The personal grief which lies behind the statistics is incalculable.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09062549000099"></a>The cost to the country is beyond imagination. Currently, as others have said, the cost is &#163;17 billion per year, eased only by the massive contribution made by the partners, children and family members who act as unpaid carers.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09062549000100"></a>I make an urgent plea to the Government, of any political persuasion, to make it a priority to address particularly three major issues: research; information and support for carers; and an improvement in the quality of residential care. First and most urgently, there must be investment in research. The Government still have no real research strategy for dementia, although there are many developments, in both genetic and stem cell research particularly, which promise a real breakthrough in preventing, curing or delaying the onset of this disease. The facts are stark&#151;as many people suffer from dementia as from cancer, yet the Government are spending eight times as much on cancer research as on dementia. In 2007-08 the total government spend was &#163;248.5 million on cancer, and only &#163;32.2 million on dementia. The US Government wisely spend 13 times more than the UK on this research, and within Europe, our government spend is behind that of either Germany or France.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09062549000101"></a>I believe that research should have been a major plank of the national dementia strategy. At present we must be thankful for the two charities, which, as the  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1680"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1680</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said, support research to the tune of a further &#163;6 million a year&#151;&#163;4.5 million from the Alzheimer&#146;s Research Trust and &#163;1.5 million from the Alzheimer&#146;s Society. The national strategy does make proposals for increasing GP training and awareness, and that could lead to earlier diagnosis. However, without a breakthrough in research that delays the progress of the disease&#151;or best of all, finds a cure&#151;this will only marginally improve the lives of individuals or ease the lives of carers.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09062549000102"></a>My second plea to Government is for better information and support for carers. Reluctantly here, I must tell my own painful story as an example. I do not know if it would have made any difference to my darling husband if we had known earlier what ailed him, but at least we could have discussed things with him while he was still able to take decisions about what he wanted, and made provision for the fate that was to overtake him. As it was, the diagnosis came late, and his descent into darkness was swift. A happy, loving and highly intelligent man, a former Oxford don with advanced degrees from both Oxford and Harvard, he soon lost the power to finish a sentence, to recognise his own home, his friends, and finally even to dress or feed himself.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09062549000103"></a>Experts tell us that people with high intelligence and education are often not diagnosed until the disease is in an advanced stage&#151;because they live at a level of mental performance above the average, they are able to function apparently adequately for a longer period of the illness. The consultant who looked after my husband in the last stages of his life told me a story that illustrates this phenomenon. A brilliant world-class chess player went to visit his doctor, saying, &#147;Something&#146;s wrong with me, I can only see six moves ahead&#148;. Six moves being still more than the average chess player can see, no one else had noticed his problem. However, he was diagnosed with advanced Alzheimer&#146;s and died within six months.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09062549000104"></a>So it was for my husband, and as his sole carer, I found myself carrying the burden of physical care and of emotional grief over the loss of my beloved lifetime companion, with almost no help from outside. I pay the warmest tributes to my local interim care team in Wandsworth, whose care when my husband first came out of hospital after a bad fall, alas, lasted only six weeks. Without them&#151;and their team incidentally has now been disbanded by the PCT&#151;there would have been nowhere to turn for help or advice. I, with the help of my adult children, had to research the possibilities of care assistance and home adaptations on my own. I struggled to provide care and adapt our home, with the minimum of official advice or information. A reliable and identifiable source of such advice or support would be a huge advantage and should be addressed in the future strategy.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09062549000105"></a>The worst, and most painful, decision, finally to opt for residential care, is where, more than at any other time, information is needed. For most of us, residential care seems a terrible last resort, but it was the therapist from the team&#151;who remained an informal telephone adviser and friend&#151;who bluntly told me that all I was struggling to do, and the care I could give at home, was not as good as a residential care home could provide. Like most of the population, I knew  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1681"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1681</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nothing about care homes and had no idea even where to start looking. Proper sources of information and support in the decision are the very least that should be provided. Most people avoid care homes, even when they live next door to them&#151;so finding where they are and identifying the right place for a particular person is an impossibly daunting task, almost as daunting as wondering where to find the means to pay for it. I was lucky enough to be told about a website which gave brilliant assistance, and that was my introduction to the hidden world of residential care&#151;a world which no one knew or wanted to know outside those who lived and worked within it, and those who love them.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09062549000106"></a>That leads me to my third plea to government. Better staff and resources for residential care should be a priority. Behind the walls of care homes are real people, with real lives and personalities. Some have had distinguished careers. Many, as I was sadly to observe, are virtually abandoned by family and friends, and many are confused and disabled. However, those who care for them there are disgracefully poorly paid, and, although many are dedicated and caring people, they are under-trained and often poorly managed by equally poorly paid and under-educated senior staff.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09062549000107"></a>I welcome the commitment in the strategy to better training and support for carers, and to an improved inspection regime. However, the quality and educational standards will improve only if the levels of pay attract a wider range of well educated people into the role of care workers and into the crucial role of managers.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09062549000108"></a>If, as is projected and as has been said, one-third of us now over 65 are to end our lives with dementia, and many will need residential care, the betterment of this provision is a national priority. While we retain our voice and our capacity to argue the case, the over-65 age group should shout loud our demand for a civilised provision of residential care. We all hope that we will not need it, and we all hope to die in our own beds with our minds intact, but many of us will not achieve that good death, and those affected deserve the country&#146;s promise of at least a measure of dignity in their final years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09062549000110"></a>Like many people, I have some experience of dementia in that I was the person most closely involved in the care of my mother as she gradually disappeared into the mists of the disease. I recall that one of her most frequent questions was, &#147;Who is paying for all this?&#148;. She was always reassured when I managed to say, &#147;Well you are, darling&#148;. That was one of the last questions that she asked me before she died. So the patient may be &#147;demented&#148; but that does not mean that they have lost all their good sense, their marbles or their customary behaviour. One of the other things that she used to say when I arrived to see her was, &#147;Would you like a glass of sherry, darling?&#148;. There was not a glass of sherry in the room but it was her habitual wish to offer refreshment to a guest that prompted her to ask that question.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09062549000111"></a>Last year, I took part in the work of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, which concentrated on the prescription of anti-psychotic drugs to people with dementia who are living in care homes and on the need for better trained and better paid staff, both of which have already been referred to. The all-party group&#146;s recommendations reflected our serious concerns about the use and misuse of these psychotic drugs. It emerged that patients with mild behavioural symptoms were being given anti-psychotic drugs, often for long periods. Although the Mental Capacity Act requires care personnel to consult patients and their carers, the group found that this was not done, with the result that neither patients nor their carers understood the reasons for prescribing these drugs or what their effect might be on patients. At the same time, doctors prescribing anti-psychotic drugs often did not visit patients sufficiently to appreciate their effect on those with dementia. We concluded that better monitoring of patients by physicians might well lead to a reduction of doses or even to the discontinuation of the use of the medication for a patient.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09062549000112"></a>More profoundly, we concluded that the rapid resort to anti-psychotic drugs for patients who might, for example, be distressed by the move to a different and unknown place was, in itself, a sign of underlying problems with respect to the training, recruitment, development and pay levels of those working within the care sector. The more recent report from the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia&#151;I did not take part in that&#151;recommends that all care staff working with elderly people should receive dementia care training.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09062549000113"></a>The Alzheimer&#146;s Society supports these recommendations and is calling on the Department of Health to develop dementia-care-related skills in the workforce. In my opinion, it is of great importance that all care workers share a common training and a common understanding of the needs of Alzheimer patients. Equally, leadership of care home staff by the senior staff member can assist the staff to understand, and therefore serve, their patients more thoughtfully and sensitively. Good examples of that were brought to us during the work of the all-party group.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09062549000114"></a>I make these points because they indicate the very precise targeting of proposed solutions to the practical problems encountered in care homes. Obviously a government strategy will be more comprehensive than what I am talking about, but we have to keep remembering that it is the high proportion of patients in private homes, and the high proportion of patients who are still not receiving proper care, who need to be encompassed in such a strategy, with the right protocols and training for staff and the right protocols for medical practitioners to ensure that, in things like the giving of drugs, the process is properly and correctly aligned to the needs of the patient and is not simply an automatic way of dealing with a difficult patient.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09062549000115"></a>One of the problems about being in an old people&#146;s home is that, by definition, you are vulnerable there. You are on your own; there may not be anyone in your family who can visit you on a daily or even a weekly basis. It depends where you are living in relation to the rest of your family. Cases where the nearest family

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09062549000116"></a>The first advice that I would give any responsible family member is to ensure that any residential home chosen for the patient should not be far from the home of the person most likely to visit the patient. I made what turned out to be the stupid mistake of thinking that my mother would be better off in her own home town. That was not true; she would have been better off down the road from where I lived. That would have been much better for her and, obviously, much easier for me. Again, if I were advising a family on learning to cope with an Alzheimer patient, I would suggest creating a rota of visits in such a way that the entire burden is not left to one person and that the patient is helped to remember their grandchildren&#151;and, in the case of my mother, their great-grandchildren&#151;in other words, their true life outside the residential home.</p>

<a name="90625-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09062549000117"></a>The all-party group&#146;s reports have made several important recommendations about the use of anti-psychotic drugs, the major subject of the report. They have dealt with the question of harm and the question of their not being kept under supervision by doctors. A recommendation was made that a new system for regular specialist assessment of vulnerable patients in care homes should be established, which would also involve the GPs responsible for day-to-day medical care. I am not sure whether any progress has been made in response to the recommendations of the previous report from the all-party group, rather than the most recent one. How much have the Government been able to do in response?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90625-0004.htm"/>


<a name="90625-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09062549000118"></a>The group&#146;s second report on this matter, the most recent, is concerned with the training for the care of people with dementia. It recommended that dementia training, including communication skills, should be mandatory for all care home staff; that dementia training should play a larger role in the training of GPs; that staff turnover needed to be reduced; and that local authorities should use their commissioning powers to drive up standards. Again, I am not sure whether the Government have responded to these suggestions. I am also not certain that any serious steps have been taken to create a recognised training programme for care home staff. The need for such a training programme has been mentioned by everyone who has spoken so far.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09062549000119"></a>I apologise if this speech has appeared somewhat scrappy. Neither the document with which we have been supplied nor the subject lend themselves to this sort of debate; in other words, one needs more time to expand one&#146;s thoughts. I have not been able to make any response to any of the excellent speeches made, for example, by those who spoke before me. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response and hope, for all our sakes, whether as suffers or carers, that the new approach really will make the difference.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09062549000121"></a>I am delighted by the publication of the National Dementia Strategy and its wide-ranging aims of improved awareness, earlier diagnosis, intervention and a higher quality of care. This strategy is vital in light of the fact that people with learning disabilities have a significantly higher risk than the general population of developing dementia, at a much earlier age, particularly those with Down&#146;s syndrome, such as my daughter, who displayed distressing symptoms for some years before she died.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09062549000122"></a>I am glad to say that the awareness of dementia in people with learning disabilities, particularly in adults with Down&#146;s syndrome, has increased significantly and is now well recognised in many parts of the country, with screening services either available or in development. However, I am concerned that there continues to be a mismatch between the services that are available and the ability of someone with learning disabilities who suffers from dementia to access them. In particular, delays in diagnosis are leaving people with a learning disability isolated. I would be interested to hear what plans the Minister has to help to speed up referrals to specialists so that the correct care and treatment can be made available as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09062549000123"></a>I would like to take a moment to give a human face to our discussions today. Let me tell your Lordships about Sandra. She is 46, has Down&#146;s syndrome and was in supported living in the south of England. When she began to show signs of deterioration, despite being allocated support workers, she worsened to the point of remaining in bed, soiling sheets, crying and shunning contact before she was taken into residential care. A further 12 months passed before the question of dementia was raised and she was eventually assessed by a psychologist. That report has never been finished. The psychologist left the service and Sandra is now waiting again for another assessment to take place. In the mean time, there is no diagnosis, no treatment and, of course, further deterioration. I am absolutely appalled by this case. Sandra may or may not have dementia, but until she gets an assessment of her needs she will get no treatment.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09062549000124"></a>The Government could take a number of simple measures to assist services to improve and to meet better the needs of people with a learning disability. First, a baseline should be established for every adult with Down&#146;s syndrome while they are healthy, as the detection of early signs of dementia relies on a good baseline. Secondly, assessment for dementia in any adult with learning disabilities should be readily available as soon as concerns have been raised. Thirdly, services might also consider prospective screening for dementia for adults with Down&#146;s syndrome, conducted at intervals, say, from the age of 40 or 50. I would be grateful for the Government&#146;s views, although it is very difficult to see how we can achieve improvements in assessment and diagnosis unless we invest in more resources.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09062549000125"></a>The Government also need to recognise the increasing possibility that people with learning disabilities will be living in a range of accommodation: independently,  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1685"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1685</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with family, supported by other services such as social care or healthcare, or in residential care. It will be essential to ensure that services such as those for dementia reach the target audience.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09062549000126"></a>The Government have said that they intend to ensure that all health and social care staff involved in the care of people with dementia have the skills needed to provide the best quality care in the roles and settings where they work. This is welcome. However, we must have such training for all those who work with people with learning disabilities throughout the health and social care sectors in order to prevent further cases such as Sandra&#146;s or our hearing once again those dread words, &#147;Lessons have been learnt&#148;.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09062549000127"></a>The social care funding crisis, where resources have not kept pace with the increasing numbers of people with a learning disability requiring them, is also having a major impact on the lives of people with a learning disability who experience dementia. Many are being excluded from appropriate support or are reporting cuts in their services. Indeed, a report published last year by the Learning Disability Coalition found that 34 per cent of respondents had experienced cuts. These reductions in care mean that there is less chance that symptoms of dementia will be identified or recognised.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09062549000128"></a>Next mouth sees the publication by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Psychological Society of guidance for the assessment, diagnosis, treatment and support for people with learning disabilities who develop dementia. It highlights the specific issues that people with learning disabilities and dementia present and identifies the key elements of an excellent service that would lead to a high-quality, safe and person-centred lifestyle as the dementia progresses. I would be interested to hear what the Government plan to do to promote this guidance.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09062549000129"></a>I am afraid that this inequality in care facing people with a learning disability echoes throughout the health service, as evidenced by Mencap&#146;s campaign for justice for the families of people with a learning disability who died unnecessarily in the care of the NHS after they were treated differently because of their learning disability. Indeed, one of the six cases highlighted by <I>Death by Indifference</I> was that of Ted, who did indeed suffer from dementia. An ombudsman&#146;s investigation published earlier this year found that the NHS trust in charge of Ted&#146;s care was guilty of service failure.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09062549000130"></a>Too often medical professionals cannot see past someone&#146;s learning disability through to his physical health needs. With regard to dementia, that means that the condition is often misdiagnosed as being behavioural and those in need miss out on treatment and pain management. I certainly took forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response to the points that I have raised today.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09062549000132"></a>I was very interested in the strategy and glad that the Government published it. The word &#147;stigma&#148; was used in the document and by some noble Lords who have spoken. I do not think that it is quite the right expression. I do not think that there is a stigma attached to dementia; rather, I think that it is a taboo subject, which is rather different. It is taboo because it is so extremely horrible and people are not willing to talk about it. This is an important distinction.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09062549000133"></a>In a recent paper from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two doctors demonstrated statistically how beneficial, both socially and financially, was early intervention with dementia. They recommended that drugs should be given at an early stage to lengthen the life of sufferers. I do not know whether these were anti-psychotic drugs. There must be more research, as everybody has said, and much better knowledge about the effects of whatever drugs may be given&#151;I hope that we may hear more about this later&#151;to slow down the progress of what is a terminal illness, albeit one that may last for years.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09062549000134"></a>The doctors from Wisconsin showed that, for early intervention to work&#151;and this is common sense&#151;early diagnosis is essential. However, I do not underestimate the great difficulty of early diagnosis. The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, has pointed out that sometimes the most intelligent people are diagnosed latest, because not only have they had a very active and interesting life, but also they are capable of developing strategies to disguise what they know are defects&#151;even defects in their chess playing, but certainly defects in their social behaviour. The story told by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, about her mother offering sherry, is typical. Many people with severe and far-progressed dementia retain a very agreeable social manner for a long time and will always be polite to visitors, even if they do not have the foggiest idea who they are. I always find touching the stories from people with direct experience of dementia. They are also difficult to bear when one thinks of one&#146;s own possible future.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09062549000135"></a>The trouble with early intervention is partly that people develop strategies and partly that they are in denial. We know that the older population dread the onset of dementia far more than they dread cancer or heart disease: it is the dread of everybody&#146;s life as they get older, which is why the subject has been taboo. We should therefore be grateful for the publication of the strategy.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09062549000136"></a>However, I was particularly alarmed to detect in the strategy&#151;optimistic and useful though it is&#151;an assumption that most people who develop dementia will have someone living in their house to look after them. Everything that was said seemed best fitted to the case of somebody with a spouse who will heroically take charge and become a carer. Early diagnosis is especially difficult in the case of people who have no one living with them. Huge numbers of people live by themselves as they get older&#151;a fact that is seldom  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1687"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1687</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noticed by people who want to deliver parcels, or expect there to be someone at home to welcome the plumber. People who live by themselves are often in denial&#151;they will not notice changes&#151;and their family who come to see them do not live with them, so may not notice the early signs of dementia.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09062549000137"></a>This brings me to something that is terribly important. The possibility of early diagnosis rests with the GP. Most GPs, when people go to see them, understandably attend to the problem that the patient has gone with, which may be anything. They do not have time to assess the general state of the patient. This is partly because they have five minutes or less to talk to them, but partly also because so many GPs now do not know the patient well. They know their case history, but they do not know the person and cannot see signs of deterioration in the way that, in the old days, the family doctor would have done. There is an enormous responsibility on the medical profession, in particular general practitioners, to be alert to possible signs of dementia and to question the older person who comes to see them about how their life is going and whether they have any worries. That is not often done, but it would help early diagnosis if doctors learnt, first, the signs of dementia and, secondly, the necessity to probe when making their diagnosis.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09062549000138"></a>The main reason why I feel so strongly about early diagnosis is that, when the disease is diagnosed, the person should be allowed to talk about their future and make a specific advance decision about how they want their life to end. This seems to be of the greatest possible importance. What I seek from the Minister is the assurance that, if someone has been diagnosed with dementia, that will not in itself constitute a diagnosis of mental incapacity. If it did, the advance statement would be of no use. I would like to see a situation where we can make an advance statement about our own death before the steep decline that comes at the end of dementia has set in. I would like the Minister to say something about that.</p>

It is a matter that should be aired. I disagree slightly with the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock. Her distinction between taboo and stigma is interesting, but ordinary people still think that a stigma attaches to dementia. Many have adopted the word &#147;Alzheimer&#146;s&#148; for all forms of dementia, because they feel that it is more acceptable to society than &#147;dementia&#148;, which is a much older word. However, in some ways the noble Baroness is right&#151;I agree absolutely that for most people the dread of dementia is very worrying.</p>

She was a bright young woman. When I went to see her in Australia in 1958, she had had a stroke, mini-strokes and was suffering from early dementia, from which she never recovered. She went on to become quite childlike and lived for a number of years. Fortunately, I was one of nine children and the other members of the family were able to look after her, but she was in residential care. She lived to quite an age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09062549000141"></a>Another interesting case is that of Iris Murdoch&#151;many of us have seen the film. Years ago, I was asked to meet Iris Murdoch when she was signing books. Her latest book was <I>The Sea</I><I>, t</I><I>he Sea</I>. I met her in Marylebone library, where the reading and book signing was held. She was such a clever woman&#151;I was very impressed, and the book was very complicated, too. A few years later, when I moved to the country, I found that my house was immediately opposite hers. I had no idea that she lived there, but we met again in the village street. She was still quite well, but not very well. She remembered clearly having met me before, and welcomed me to the village&#151;she was charming. We all know that she deteriorated very badly. I used to see her when her husband took her for walks in the village. They moved out of the village altogether when they needed to be closer to medical care. Again, she was a very clever woman in whom we saw a lot of changes. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lady Perry. George was a most brilliant man and I know how much she did to look after him in his last years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09062549000142"></a>When I was chairman of the Royal Free Hospital, we had a special section of the hospital that had been the home of Sir Thomas Lipton, the famous man from the days of the America&#146;s Cup who was going to win it back for Britain. This home was converted into a special place for the care of dementia cases. It was a huge Victorian home, on to which the hospital had built a lot more. Every year we had a garden party for everyone, including the relatives, and I went every year while I was chairman of the hospital. Many relatives told me that the problem with dementia is that it is a living bereavement and I agree with that. Early onset dementia is uncommon, but it happens, and can occur in people as young as 30. One man came every day to see his wife who had been in a bad state from the age of 40. It is hard when people are old, but it is more anticipated. It is rare in young people, but it is very upsetting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09062549000143"></a>I was given a marvellous book, <I>Alzheimer&#146;s at your Fingertips</I>, which was written by Dr Nori Graham, a consultant at the Royal Free Hospital, Harry Cayton and Dr James Warner. It was published in 1997. It is so good because it answers the practical problems of the people who have so much to do with caring for people, particularly in the early stages of Alzheimer&#146;s. It answers questions, such as who will get Alzheimer&#146;s disease. It says that it is uncommon in younger people, but it can affect them, and that it occurs more in some groups. Alzheimer&#146;s is the most usual occurrence of dementia. After that comes vascular dementia, the type that my mother had, which is due to a stroke. We all know many people who have had a series of mini-strokes. Often they make a partial recovery between the strokes, then they have another one and they go a further step downhill.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09062549000144"></a>I rushed to read this book when my wonderful godson was diagnosed with Pick&#146;s disease. Unfortunately, that is not good. The book sets out the details of the forms of dementia, which people do not understand, and explains that the causes are not fully understood. It refers to the importance of seeking a diagnosis, which so many speakers have emphasised today, and I could not agree more. The book covers practical care,

Non-recognition is very distressing for loved ones who find that they are not known.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09062549000145"></a>The book is written in the form of questions and answers, for example:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="09062549000504"></a>&#147;My wife often says to me &#145;When are you going to take me home&#146;. Then she packs some things into a bag&#151;pictures, ornaments, etc. How can I explain that this is her home?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062549000486"></a>Another example is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09062549000505"></a>&#147;Sometimes, in the evenings, my husband looks at me and asks me when am I leaving. He then hands me the telephone and says &#145;Tell my wife to come home, so that you can go back to your home&#146;. What can I do?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062549000487"></a>People find themselves in these types of situation all the time. The answers are reassuring and it is comforting for people to know that others suffer the same situation. The book then gives answers to the questions.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09062549000146"></a>Another interesting question is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09062549000506"></a>&#147;My husband, who has Alzheimer&#146;s disease, often gets angry, and sometimes hits me. He never used to do this. What can I do to calm things down&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062549000488"></a>I have met many people who find themselves very distressed by a husband who has always been a calm and loving person suddenly becoming quite violent. Restlessness, agitation, wandering, anger, aggression and bitterness are all problems that people face. Knowing that others face the same problems consoles them and helps understanding.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09062549000147"></a>However, there is a need for a greater public awareness. People often know nothing about it until they find themselves in that position. Public awareness changes attitudes and means that people are more supportive in general. I support the view that diagnosis is undoubtedly the key. I was rather pleased to meet a young German doctor at an Alzheimer&#146;s function here. He told me that he had come to England to do research into this because he believes that our research is probably further ahead than that of most other countries. What we all want to see is not research into either prevention or cure, but research into both. The strategy is excellent, but we should deal with this matter in such a way that we do not have this distressing number of cases.</p>

The speeches I have heard have also been moving. When dementia hits, it is a tragedy for everyone, not just for the patient but for their family and friends. Therefore, the National Dementia Strategy is extremely welcome. Much of it is excellent and gives us hope for the future. Sadly, the promised review of anti-psychotic drugs has been delayed and, as has been pointed out, research is not an integral part of it.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09062549000149"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, that dementia is not quite as much of a taboo subject as it previously was and that it is now recognised. We have heard that funding for research is just over 2 per cent of our total research spend. As the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said, that is eight times less than is spent on research into cancer and heart disease, but we know that the incidence is far greater than both of  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1690"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1690</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those. I still think it is shaming that in the United Kingdom, we spend &#163;13 per person on dementia research per year, whereas in the United States the spend is &#163;121 per person. I hope that the Minister can assure me that the forthcoming research summit, led by the Government with the Medical Research Council, will lead to a comprehensive research strategy. Cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary collaboration are essential. We need a really broad research strategy, including a reversal of the totally inadequate number of trials to ensure that prompt translation of scientific developments into new drugs and treatments can be assured.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09062549000150"></a>We also know that apart from the huge scale of suffering, the economic consequences of dementia are enormous. In the UK, we already have 750,000 people with the disease and 53,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. The demand for care will increase exponentially and we know that at present only 30 per cent of people suffering from dementia are in care homes. Most are in the community. As the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, pointed out, most are cared for by family and friends.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09062549000151"></a>We cannot guarantee that that situation will continue; that people will be able or willing to continue to do that job. Certainly, many people are hindered by a lack of support. A lot of the paid carer support services are often not fit for purpose. Families and other carers face a huge number of disadvantages, even in getting adequate advice and guidance. The dementia strategy must remedy that situation. The strategy does not adequately address the challenges and possible opportunities presented by the personalisation agenda. I hope that the Minister can reassure me on that as well. As we have heard, the development of our workforce must be prioritised and training must be a mandatory part of care through commissioning. Again, I hope that the Minister will reassure me that this will happen.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09062549000152"></a>People who work in the field of dementia are low paid and invariably poorly qualified. We know that low pay and poor qualifications lead to a skills shortage. It is better and more socially rewarding to get a job at the Tesco cash till than working in many homes. People leave when they can. Care in people&#146;s own homes is often bought by the care companies and agencies by the hour or even by the minute. This has to be reversed. Care needs to be based on achieving quality of life. It has to be outcome-driven, not task-driven. That is another priority.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09062549000153"></a>We have heard that there is a problem in care homes with the overuse of anti-psychotic medication. I was part of the All-Party Group on Dementia inquiry report that pointed this out. Similarly, we have to look at the use of restraint in homes and hospitals, which can be both overt and hidden. Restraint can easily slip into abuse. Only adequate training can prevent that happening.</p>

<a name="90625-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09062549000154"></a>On pharmaceutical treatments and prevention, Professor Ballard commented earlier this month that the use of cholinesterase inhibitors and amyloid cascade interactors has been delayed by poor prioritisation and funding. We need to consider that seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09062549000155"></a>We have heard from noble Lords about the discrimination against older people that still persists. Otherwise, 50 per cent of patients would not be without  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1691"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1691</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a formal medical diagnosis. Labelling the care they need as social care is proof of that discriminatory prejudice against older people. The National Audit Office found that GPs are also not sufficiently trained to recognise early symptoms or to manage the disease. It is difficult, but people should be made aware of their diagnoses. For that to happen, GPs&#151;apart from training&#151;have to know that some treatment and support will be available. Otherwise, they are not going to add to the distress of their patients by diagnosing them when nothing will be done to help them. The widespread introduction of memory clinics across the UK in this strategy should enable earlier diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09062549000156"></a>We have to pay more attention to those people in the final stages of dementia who need palliative care. There are other worrying trends. The noble Lord, Lord Rix, has mentioned one. The Social Care Institute for Excellence reported recently on a growing incidence of younger people suffering from one type of dementia, Korsakoff&#146;s syndrome, through the overuse of alcohol. We have to watch for new types of dementia that are emerging.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09062549000157"></a>The dementia advisory role in the strategy is a welcome development. It should provide a point of contact and support. At present, in spite of the huge amount of work done by the charities&#151;they do a wonderful job&#151;people and families often wait for up to three years before seeking help.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09062549000158"></a>We can learn an awful lot from other countries and we should not resist doing so. The French have produced their third national Alzheimer&#146;s plan and there are points in that we could learn from. In the Netherlands, there are specialist care home physicians.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09062549000159"></a>We need a set of goals to which we aspire. Let us aim to have real improvement in diagnosis, treatment and care for dementia patients within the next five years, and immediately integrate health and social services in this field while developing specific skills and training at all levels. For this we need a major public awareness campaign that places dementia in the forefront of public priorities. We probably also need a dementia tsar or champion&#151;I know this is being considered&#151;to lead our country in awareness of dementia and acceptance of the challenges it brings.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09062549000160"></a>One of our leading care home providers has called dementia the &#147;silent epidemic&#148;&#151;an adequate description. We have to remove any remaining stigma and lack of interest that leads to this sort of discrimination. We must be determined to give dementia the priority it deserves. We need a national framework together with local and enforced standards in care. The role of the Care Quality Commission will be critical in looking, for example, at healthcare in residential homes, where so many people with dementia live.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09062549000161"></a>People with dementia are among the most vulnerable in our society. Action and total commitment are needed now. It is the least we can expect.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1692"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1692</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09062549000163"></a>In 1999, just after my retirement from chairing the Broadcasting Standards Commission, I was asked to be one of the judges for ITV&#146;s best documentary of the year. It turned out to be an interesting assignment. It was also my personal introduction to the subject of today&#146;s debate. The film that made by far the most vivid impression on me was &#147;Malcolm and Barbara: A Love Story&#148;, created by Paul Watson. Malcolm and Barbara were husband and wife and Paul Watson their long-standing close friend. When Malcolm, a talented musician then in his early 50s, was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#146;s, they reacted to the bad news by agreeing that, however horrifying the developments, Watson would film the disease as it developed over the years ahead. It was indeed horrifying and distressing to watch the stages of the disease unfold on film, and, at the same time, to observe the lack of appropriate support for Barbara that occurred along the way.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09062549000164"></a>If anything was needed to alert me to the huge sums that carers save the national budget in this area, as well as to wake me up to the need for a totally different national approach to dementia, it was to see just how much Barbara was able to&#151;indeed, had to&#151;achieve, by coping so heroically with fearful mood swings, not excluding violence, from her distressed husband. It is therefore no wonder that I was particularly glad to see that Barbara featured in a recent Honours List&#151;a more than well-deserved recognition of the love and dedication that she and so many other carers in these situations provide. Currently 500,000 family carers are providing, unpaid, some &#163;6 billion worth of care.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09062549000165"></a>In the 10 years which have elapsed since I first saw that documentary I think that we have all become increasingly aware that we are indeed an ageing population, and increasingly aware of the many implications that this has and will have for our own and for our children&#146;s future. I am certainly aware that I am 10 years older, and I am beginning to recognise my own moments of tell-tale forgetfulness. So, against that background, it is more than fitting that I should congratulate the Government on their decision this year to publish and roll out a National Dementia Strategy. I hope that that way forward will include the contribution that employers also can make by retaining for as long as possible the valuable skills of dementia sufferers via means such as flexible working.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09062549000166"></a>We should all give considerable priority to the Government&#146;s plan because it is clearly in everyone&#146;s interest. In its 2008 report <I>The Dementia Tax</I><I>,</I> the Alzheimer&#146;s Society predicted that the number of people with dementia will rise rapidly from 700,000 today to over 1 million by 2025. I know that different people will quote different figures but another of its reports predicted that one in three people over 65 will end their lives with a form of dementia. Bluntly, the financial cost of all this will be unmanageable if we continue as we are now.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09062549000167"></a>As the Alzheimer&#146;s Society points out, dementia is the UK&#146;s biggest health and social care challenge. So the more I read about the strategy, the more important four aspects of it seem. Other noble Lords have already mentioned many of these. The first and most urgent aspect is the Government&#146;s commitment to a national public awareness campaign. It is essential that the stigma&#151;indeed, the fear&#151;that dementia engenders must be confronted and changed.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1693"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1693</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09062549000168"></a>The second aspect is earlier diagnosis. It is good to know that the Government believe that with earlier diagnosis, more effective and well-researched medication and, above all, improved training and awareness among doctors, nurses and all those involved with the care of these patients, &#147;living well with dementia&#148; can be achieved. That is particularly important for end-of-life care, which is manifestly inadequate at present. This whole area needs to improve, as currently only 31 per cent of GPs believe that they received sufficient basic and post-qualification training in diagnosing and managing dementia. Only this week I heard from an Australian friend that every GP in that country is already required to test all their 70 year-old patients for dementia. So we are clearly behind other countries.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09062549000169"></a>Thirdly, for those with dementia and for their carers, the crucial need which they themselves identified in the consultation process was to have,</p>
<ul><a name="09062549000523"></a>&#147;someone with them on their journey&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062549000489"></a>In other words, they need a local, knowledgeable contact who, from the moment dementia<sup></sup>has been diagnosed&#151;and, equally important, before then&#151;can give support, information, advice and access to the services needed.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09062549000170"></a>One important feature to bear in mind is the evidence showing that people want to stay in their own home and, preferably, ultimately, to die there. In many ways that is so much the better&#151;not only do they fare better out of hospital; another tangible benefit is considerable financial relief for the NHS budget. As we have heard, 70 per cent of acute hospital beds are occupied by older people receiving inadequate care. That does not make any sense.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09062549000171"></a>However, if dementia patients are to be able to stay at home while at the same time enjoying the benefits of companionship, they will ideally need to find themselves in a diverse as well as comprehensive community. Most people&#151;patients and carers alike&#151;would prefer access when wanted to personalised social activity, from bingo to bridge, and short breaks for carers within a peer group with whom they can share activities and compare experiences.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09062549000172"></a>Fourthly, dementia is a disease. I was glad to hear a number of other noble Lords say that it is quite wrong<I><b></b></I>for<I><b></b></I>its treatment effectively to be classified as social rather than medical care and therefore means-tested. For dementia patients, that is all too often the practical consequence of the present system of charging for care. This fundamental point is most clearly spelt out by the Alzheimer's Society in its report <I>The Dementia Tax</I>. And what a value we have in the Alzheimer&#146;s Society&#151;without it, I do not think that we would not know half of what we know. I look forward most to the Minister&#146;s reply on this point. Is the treatment and care of dementia likely in future to be managed and financed on the same basis as any other disease tackled by the NHS? If not, why not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09062549000176"></a>Alongside obesity and type 2 diabetes, dementia stands now as one of the greatest public health challenges of the age. As Members of your Lordships' House have said today, it is likely that by 2025 the number of people with dementia in the United Kingdom will almost have doubled. As the Alzheimer&#146;s Society has made clear in its excellent briefing, the cost of dementia will rise from &#163;15 billion today to more than &#163;23 billion by 2018.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09062549000177"></a>One of the problems is early diagnosis, to which many noble Lords have today referred. I propose to spend a little time on that, because it is crucial. My noble friend Lady Murphy said in her excellent introduction that there are about 150 causes of dementia, many of them exceptionally rare. More than 80 per cent of patients with dementia are suffering from Alzheimer&#146;s disease, but there are other, not uncommon causes&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, said, multi-infarct dementia resulting from repeated minor or major strokes is an important one. So, too, is Lewy body dementia. It is less common, occurring in association with, but not invariably so, Parkinson&#146;s disease, because of the deposition of Lewy bodies throughout the cortex of the brain. Fronto-temporal dementia is also quite different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09062549000178"></a>It is crucial to get the diagnosis right because research is progressing in many parts of the world which is bringing within sight the prospect of a more effective treatment for the various dementias, particularly for Alzheimer&#146;s disease, which may be a crucial development alongside the improvement in the standards of care to which many noble Lords have referred.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09062549000179"></a>Unfortunately, there is no precise diagnostic test for Alzheimer&#146;s disease. CT scanning and magnetic resonance imaging may help to show shrinkage of the brain. There are other tests, such as those for memory. More recently, a precisely defined test-your-memory test has proved to be extremely valid. It has been designed to minimise operator time and to be suitable for non-specialists to use. However, as a recent editorial in the <I>British Medical Journal</I> stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09062549000507"></a>&#147;Diagnosis requires consideration of the person&#146;s education, culture, and circumstances; dementia presents when a person&#146;s cognitive abilities are no longer adequate for them to cope with their environment. A high flying executive may experience problems early in the ... process, whereas a resident of a care home may have no difficulty with his or her routine until pronounced changes have occurred&#148;.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09062549000180"></a>Many years ago, when I held a chair of neurology in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, I was involved with Professor Roth, Doctor Blessed and Professor Tomlinson in studying the changes in the brain occurring in patients with Alzheimer&#146;s disease. We all recognise, as several people have referred to today, that, as we get older&#151;I am approaching my 87th birthday&#151;we often find problems with the memory, particularly memory for proper names. It is extremely embarrassing when you encounter somebody whom you know extremely well and suddenly find that their name has gone&#151;you can call that selective nominal aphasia, benign cognitive impairment or benign senescent forgetfulness. In a way, Alzheimer&#146;s disease is a rapidly progressing, advanced  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1695"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1695</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>form of that kind of impairment, as the work of Blessed, Roth and Tomlinson showed, because, even with normal ageing, there is an increase in the number of senile plaques in the brain cortex. That number is vastly increased in patients with Alzheimer&#146;s disease.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09062549000181"></a>What about research? The Newcastle scientists, helped by the biochemists, the Perrys&#151;husband and wife&#151;found a serious reduction in the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain cortex. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter which carries messages from one nerve to another. That finding led to the introduction of drugs which inhibited the enzyme which degrades acetylcholine. Those are the drugs called donepezil, and many of its other derivatives, which have proved to be helpful in delaying to some extent the progression of the disease. However, that is symptomatic treatment; it does not strike at the root cause of the disease. In these senile plaques, which are so characteristic, and the neurofibrillary tangles which appear throughout the brain cortex, chemical substances have been identified, not least beta-amyloid and its precursor, but also a substance called phosphorylated tau, which appear to be markers of the process occurring in the cortex in these conditions. Work is now in progress in a number of centres in the UK and abroad where individuals are attempting to introduce techniques to reduce the level of those substances within the brain cortex.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09062549000182"></a>A few years ago, an attempt was made to produce a vaccine and the vaccine against beta-amyloid was shown to be, in some ways, effective. Unfortunately, in clinical trials, it also produced unacceptable degrees of brain inflammation and the trials had to be discontinued, but other methods are now being explored.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09062549000183"></a>Although, as a number of noble Lords have said, the amount of money being spent on dementia research in the UK is much less than in other countries, we do have centres of excellence&#151;I was talking yesterday to Professor Martin Rossor, who is a leader in this field at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square. He commends, incidentally, as do I, the National Dementia Strategy, though he feels&#151;and I ask the Minister to comment upon this&#151;that though the dementia strategy is excellent in what it plans and proposes for the elderly patient with dementia, he feels it is less suitable for those who develop dementia at a relatively early age, in their 40s and 50s. The Minister may wish to comment on that point, but it is an excellent document.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09062549000184"></a>These centres of excellence are in London, in Oxford and at the outstanding Centre for Brain Ageing and Vitality, led by Professor Tom Kirkwood, in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, funded by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, where some outstanding work is going on. I stress these points because I genuinely believe that, within the next 10 years, we will see mechanisms introduced whereby forms of treatment for Alzheimer&#146;s disease will become much more effective than those available now. That kind of treatment must stand alongside the crucial improvements in care and the other objectives so clearly set out in this dementia strategy. I think we have considerable optimism for the future.</p>

I pay particular tribute to the speeches by the noble Baronesses, Lady Murphy and Lady Perry, and my noble friend Lady Thomas of Walliswood. I should declare an interest as one of the 18 per cent of Members of your Lordships&#146; House who does not qualify for a bus pass. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, with every passing year, I become more inclined to think that I ought to carry a card that says, &#147;in case of an emergency, please note, she has never been any good at remembering people&#146;s names&#151;do not assume that she has got Alzheimer&#146;s.&#148;</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09062549000186"></a>In thinking about this debate and reading this document today, I was trying to place this disease in its historical context. I think we have moved from an age in which Alzheimer&#146;s, or dementia, was a thing of such fear and dread that it was locked away and ignored. Dementia has become something which people talk about in euphemism. When I talk to older people, something I do quite often, and they talk to me about other older people they know, they will say things like, &#147;She is really losing the place&#148;, or &#147;You know Mrs So-and-so? She doesn&#146;t know her husband any more.&#148; Recently, I was talking to some younger people and they were telling me that one of them is practising for his driving test. They said, &#147;It is really good, because his nan lives with them and she&#146;s got Alzheimer&#146;s and one thing that calms her down is that she loves being driven around in the car, so he is driving her around all over.&#148;</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09062549000187"></a>The point is that Alzheimer&#146;s and dementia are beginning to become part of family and community life. The thing that is missing from this document, good though it is in many ways, and the thing that restricts it as a strategy, is that it does not really address the key issues about how this disease becomes part of community and family life, with effects way beyond the narrow confines of health and social care. I think that that is the point my noble friend Lady Thomas of Walliswood was making when she talked about the disparate nature of this debate. This document, laudable and welcome though it is, is a series of unconnected points. That is unfortunate, when we are going to be looking at its implementation at a time of severe restrictions in public expenditure.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09062549000188"></a>If the department had been bold, this would have been a strategy to enable individuals and communities to manage what the noble Lord, Lord Walton, rightly called one of the biggest public health developments that we have. It would have acknowledged, for example, that this is a disease with a greater incidence in areas of affluence. It is a disease that happens when people are sufficiently well and are not affected by other co-morbidities, so that they live longer. It is a disease the incidence of which is a manifestation of other health inequalities, or what I would call health poverty. It is no surprise that people who have had very distinguished careers get this disease more than others, because they have not been affected by other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09062549000189"></a>At the beginning of setting out a strategy, we on these Benches ask, how is it that we can enable individuals, families and the state to deal with this issue as it grows? There is no doubt that responsibility for care will rest on a partnership between individuals and the state for a very long time to come.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09062549000190"></a>I want to talk briefly about a strategy for research. A lot of people have talked about research into early diagnosis. Noble Lords who listened to the Reith lecture on Radio 4 will have noted the very interesting point made by this year&#146;s Reith lecturer that much of the commercial investment in this sort of research is about early diagnosis. This is in order to produce drugs which not only help people who have dementia, but people who are beginning to go through those very early forms of forgetfulness and who wish to maintain their brain performance. The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said in her introduction, that there is going to be a research summit. Will the strategy for research be about discovering treatments and mitigations for early onset of the disease, which will enable people to remain economically active for longer, or will it be about research into treatments and mitigations for those who are significantly older and will therefore live longer with other co-morbidities? Will the research be about improvements in quality of life for people who have this disease and their carers, or about prevention for a younger group?</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09062549000191"></a>Noble Lords listening to Radio 4 this morning will have heard what has been happening with the cancer strategy and the cancer plan. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that it was interesting to note that the cancer strategy has not worked as well for older people. Having said that, the cancer plan and the way the cancer plan has worked, bringing together academic research, the NHS, charities and principally to focus the involvement of sufferers is exemplary. For breast cancer, for example, it has led to the establishment of centres of clinical excellence in research and treatment, but it has done so in a way that has enabled those who have the disease to make improvements in their social care.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09062549000192"></a>It was very interesting that when Professor Mike Richards was tackled recently about the cancer plan and how our cancer survival rates are not as good as those of other countries, he defended the plan, saying that any plan had to address cancer prevention and treatment as well as early diagnosis and care, and there has been an all-round improvement. If we were to have a strategy for dementia that worked in that way, it would be worth investing a very great deal of money in it.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09062549000193"></a>I echo the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Rix&#151;I never repeat his points, as he makes them far more eloquently than I do. There is a growing need for people throughout the whole of health and social care to understand dementia as it affects their discipline. Dentists, for example, need to know what to do when somebody with dementia presents to them. I would go much further and say that in the commercial world, smart companies will recognise that dementia will have a huge impact on family life. When housebuilders start building houses again, will they build very small boxy units or will they actually build houses into

I think that it could go much further.</p>

<a name="90625-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09062549000194"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, referred to the comments made by Joan Bakewell. I have been saying for some considerable time that the process of tendering for social care is wreaking a great deal of havoc, particularly upon specialist services. It is increasingly the case that a service&#151;information and advice, domiciliary care, or whatever&#151;is commissioned not on the basis of need or of client groups but of all people over the age of 60. I think that in future there will be many fewer specialist agencies around, particularly in the voluntary sector, to help implement some of the worthy but at times very unrealistic ambitions of this document.</p>

I have always found it rather surprising and disappointing that so many apparently intelligent people can make disparaging remarks about those with mental illness. Making comments such as, &#147;He&#146;s nutty&#148;, or &#147;He&#146;s bananas&#148;, or &#147;He&#146;s away with fairies&#148; is totally inappropriate and, in psychiatry, might be described as &#147;incongruity of affect&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09062549000197"></a>Age Concern and Help the Aged wanted a stronger emphasis on research in the report, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, and my noble friend Lady Perry have emphasised. They want the same level of investment in dementia research as currently exists for research into cancer and heart disease. The Alzheimer&#146;s Society compared research papers on chronic disorders and found that since 2002, 23 per cent were devoted to cancer, 17 per cent to cardiovascular disease and only 1.4 per cent to dementia, to which my noble friend Lady Perry alluded. More research is needed into preventing dementia and slowing down the development of the disease. There is always a need for more emphasis on training doctors and nurses in this subject, especially as one-third of the people in hospital beds are elderly, with mental health problems in addition to the illness that brought them into hospital in the first place.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09062549000198"></a>As the noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas of Walliswood and Lady Barker, have said, there is a great need for a much more comprehensive approach to the whole problem. I think that the report might usefully have emphasised what millions of carers can do right now, without any extra expenditure, to improve the quality of the lives of these patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09062549000199"></a>An exciting recent development in the management of dementia is the widespread adoption of the SPECAL method, which stands for specialised early care for Alzheimer&#146;s. It is based at Burford in Oxfordshire and was developed by Penelope Garner. It has been validated in the past by the Royal College of Nursing and the Care Consortium of the Alzheimer&#146;s Society. I am

His book, <I>Contented Dementia,</I> describes the method which is now used all over the country, with carers and professionals now able to provide 24-hour well-being. It is the only management method which seems to confer contentment. A 2005 review published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I><I></I>shows that none of the conventional methods is very helpful, which is presumably why there is such a heavy use of antipsychotic medication for these people.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09062549000200"></a>There are now dozens of centres throughout the country which train carers in this SPECAL method. In cost-benefit terms it has massive implications: it reduces the need for emergency care, eliminates the necessity for antipsychotic medication and relieves the stress of carers. Without any impetus from Government, coming up from the grass roots, SPECAL is rapidly becoming the best accepted way of managing dementia.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09062549000201"></a>Penny Garner, the founder, uses the analogy of a photograph album. If you think of the individual photographs as memories, then in a healthy individual the album is full. But in Alzheimer&#146;s sufferers, many new experiences fail to get stored as photos in the album at all. The recent pages of a sufferer become increasingly blank, while the earlier ones remain intact. Suppose your husband tells you at breakfast to book some cinema tickets and you agree to do so. Unbeknown to you, your dementia means that this discussion has not been stored in the album. When asked about the tickets in the evening, you have no record of the original plan. You may get annoyed at being &#147;wrongly&#148; accused of having failed to carry it out. You become angry, then confused and scared.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09062549000202"></a>Penny argues that the distress is compounded by well meaning attempts to remind the sufferer of what they have forgotten. Nellie, aged 81, was creating mayhem by wandering around the house and garden. In response, her fiercely loyal, military-trained husband, Richard, was providing detailed lists of what she had to do that day to &#147;get the old girl sorted out&#148;. This is the standard response, known as reality orientation. But it usually results in the sufferer thinking, &#147;Why is this person constantly telling me my name? Are they mad?&#148;. Instead, Penny Garner gets alongside the sufferer by finding out what used to be in their album. Extensive evidence from brain scans now proves that although short-term memory is damaged, the long-term memory is largely or completely intact. So Penny ferrets out from the family members the emotional places where they liked to be, stored in the long-term memory. Using this as a context, and taking the lead from the sufferer, Penny enables them to live almost all the time in a happy place. She &#147;makes a present of the past&#148;, as she puts it.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09062549000203"></a>Gardening was Nellie&#146;s happy context. With SPECAL&#146;s help, Richard provides clues from her album which remind her of pruning flowers, so secateurs were placed all around the house. Soon she stopped drawing blanks; instead, she would wander around the house on the way to the garden to do some pruning. Mostly, she never got there, waylaid by discussions about the best implements for pruning, moving from one pair to the next. Living this happy way her mood improved dramatically. By finding benign, historical context,

Oliver James states that dementia does not need to be hellish as it is possible to create a sense of well-being for the rest of the patient&#146;s life. The person with dementia can no longer reliably store new facts but does continue to store feelings in the normal way.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09062549000204"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, drew attention to the value of practical advice. Penny Garner found that the following advice is helpful. First, it is important to realise that people with dementia find it difficult and frustrating to answer questions. This is due to their impaired ability to remember. The solution therefore is to avoid asking them questions. Secondly, as their long-term memory is usually intact, one should concentrate on their long-term memory and celebrate it. Thirdly, always agree, never argue should be the policy at all costs. It does not really matter if they believe that a dead relative is alive or if they think that they are at the airport when they are actually shopping in the supermarket. Fourthly, when the short-term memory deteriorates further it is quite usual for the patient to ask the same question over and over again and it is very easy to become exasperated. The best thing is to be hesitant in answering the question, so when the repeated question is, &#147;What day is it?&#148;, one says: &#147;Well, let&#146;s see, um,&#148; then look at the watch or the calendar and say, &#147;it&#146;s Wednesday&#148;&#151;actually it is Thursday. One does all this without appearing to be patronising in any way. We need to identify pleasurable themes from the past to help them make sense of the present. For example, it is possible to spend much of the day planning to watch a favourite old film. Routine, based on life well before the dementia developed, is very important and, if at all possible, once established should not be altered.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09062549000205"></a>In conclusion, may I repeat that Alzheimer&#146;s disease does not need to be hellish as it is possible to create a sense of well-being for the patient. The methods advocated by the charity, SPECAL, are much better than smothering the patients with excessive drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09062549000208"></a>Dementia is one of the main causes of disability later in life, ahead of some cancers, cardiovascular disease and stroke. It is estimated that there are already around 700,000 people with dementia in the United Kingdom, a figure that is set to double in the next 30 years. The direct costs of dementia to the NHS are approximately &#163;3.3 billion a year. The overall annual economic burden is estimated to be &#163;14.3 billion a year, or &#163;25,391 per head. The estimated prevalence of dementia in people aged over 65 living in nursing homes is between 66 per cent and 80 per cent, with similar rates in care homes. To deal with this growing problem, it is right that we develop the services to deal effectively with dementia while ensuring that people with dementia and their carers are treated with dignity and respect and receive the support that they deserve.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09062549000209"></a>The publication of the first ever National Dementia Strategy this February was an important milestone in raising dementia up the agenda and giving priority to improving dementia services and raising the quality of care. The content of the strategy was welcomed by a wide range of the stakeholders involved. I am glad to say that it has received support across the political spectrum. The praise it received is a direct consequence of the extensive and detailed consultation that took place in preparing the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09062549000210"></a>The shortcomings of existing dementia services have been well documented and mentioned today. It should be recognised that many people with dementia do receive wonderful support from dedicated health and social care teams who provide high quality care. A good example is the Croydon Memory Service, which the Minister for Care Services will be visiting shortly. We are working to ensure that this sort of provision becomes the norm rather than the exception that it is at present.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09062549000211"></a>The National Dementia Strategy provides a strategic framework within which local services can deliver quality improvements to dementia services and address health inequalities relating to dementia. The strategy has 17 key objectives and we do not apologise for that number of key themes. I very rarely disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, but on this occasion I will as I think the strategy hangs together rather well. It does address many of the issues that were raised by the noble Baroness and by other Members of Your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09062549000212"></a>The first theme is one that was referred to by many noble Lords&#151;raising awareness amongst professionals and the general public alike. It is a vital component if we are to make progress. If we are to challenge the stigma and the taboo that was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, we need to improve people&#146;s understanding, remove the level of stigma that exists and tackle the misconception that dementias are untreatable. The Department of Health has already provided funding of more than &#163;500,000 to support the Alzheimer&#146;s Society&#146;s &#147;Worried about Your Memory&#148; campaign. A range of materials has been issued to all GP surgeries in England to help raise awareness of dementia in the general public and better to inform those concerned that they may have the early signs of dementia. A further &#163;1 million is to be made available later this year for more work on raising public awareness.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1702"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1702</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09062549000213"></a>The second theme of the strategy addresses early diagnosis and intervention, mentioned by most of the noble Lords who contributed to the debate. The lack of early diagnosis, and services to deliver it, is a major problem and one where action clearly needs to be taken. Only one third of people with dementia ever receive a formal diagnosis. That is unacceptable. A core aim therefore of the dementia strategy is to ensure that effective services for early intervention are available on a nationwide basis.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09062549000214"></a>The third theme is improving the quality of care, again mentioned by many noble Lords. We are at the beginning of a process of implementing the National Dementia Strategy over a five-year period. It is backed by &#163;150 million of initial funding. I stress that this is initial funding as &#163;150 million would not be adequate if it was all that was there. The Government&#146;s aim is for services to transcend existing boundaries between health and social care, as well as between service providers and people with dementia and their carers. We will be addressing the vital issue of training and development for NHS and social care staff who come into contact with people with dementia. I take the point that one noble Lord made that this does not just concern people working in social care or who nurse people with dementia, but includes most health professionals&#151;dentists and so on.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09062549000215"></a>There are already examples of good local training in dementia taking place across the country. We need to standardise this and ensure that everyone working with people who have dementia are aware of the signs and symptoms of the disease. We will be working with the royal colleges and professional bodies to ensure there is appropriate training on dementia in undergraduate and postgraduate training in both health and social care courses. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, and my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley particularly mentioned the training of home care staff and carers. I absolutely take their point.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09062549000216"></a>We have made headway in terms of vocational training for social care staff. Skills for Care has produced guidance on what care workers need to know and the skills that they should possess to provide good-quality dementia care. Similarly, the General Social Care Council has recommended that all domiciliary care workers should gain a relevant qualification on entry to the social care register. That will help to drive up standards and ensure that staff working with dementia sufferers are properly trained. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, was concerned that that should happen, and she is absolutely correct.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09062549000217"></a>We will make extensive use of national levers, such as the <I>Joint Strategic Needs Assessment</I>, local area agreements, the NHS operating framework, the commissioning framework for health and well-being and the world class commissioning programme, to ensure that the strategy is fully implemented locally and that services improve as a result. I hope that that addresses the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, at the very beginning of this debate about how we would ensure proper implementation. We intend to use the levers that we have established to drive that forward.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1703"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1703</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09062549000218"></a>Improving dementia services is not just a matter for central government&#151;it is a matter for local government, NHS managers, frontline practitioners and, vitally, those who use health and social care services. Neither is it just a matter of funding for dementia services. It is as much about how all the players involved can learn from best practice better to meet the needs of those suffering from dementia and their families. We must recognise that, in practice, the pace of change brought about by the implementation of the strategy will vary, depending on where services are at present. Some areas will have achieved all the strategy&#146;s aims and objectives within the five-year implementation period. Those starting from a low base may take longer. Our job is to drive that forward, monitor it and ensure that we are giving local services the right kind of support so that they can deliver the right services. We have every intention of ensuring that that is the case.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09062549000219"></a>To help make the changes needed, we have already set up a nationwide support programme with expert regional teams working closely with the NHS and local authorities in implementing the strategy. Their particular focus will be on supporting those services that are starting from a lower base and need most help and guidance. I should also mention that the department is currently setting up demonstrator sites to provide evidence on the role of dementia advisers and peer-support networks. Bids from more than 100 PCTs and local authorities were received to run these sites. This work is progressing well, and we will be announcing the chosen demonstrator sites in early July. I am pleased to be able to tell the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, that we are addressing the important area of research into dementia, looking at our future need for research relating to the causes of the illness, potential cures, treatment and care for people with dementia. I hope that that partly addresses the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. I was recently able to attend an enormously helpful round table discussion on this chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and I am very glad that she has also agreed to chair the Government&#146;s dementia research summit taking place on 21 July.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09062549000220"></a>The summit will involve key researchers from all the relevant aspects of research, from the UK and abroad, as well as people with dementia and their carers. We believe that it will provide us with a better picture of the current body of research, where there are gaps in our knowledge, and what the priorities should be in focusing on research effort. The noble Baronesses, Lady Murphy, Lady Barker and Lady Greengross, asked whether I could assure them that the dementia research summit will provide a future strategy. I promise that that is our intention. The Medical Research Council, which is jointly running the summit, will produce a framework for the future of research and will take account of the conclusions reached at the summit and the gaps that are identified.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09062549000221"></a>National clinical leadership for the strategy is of course of huge importance, and will be provided in future by a new National Clinical Director for Older People and Dementia. The post has recently been advertised and we expect it to be filled in the autumn. I should stress that there is much that needs to be done locally in terms of leadership to drive forward  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1704"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1704</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>implementation. The strategy makes very specific recommendations on the need for better leadership in hospitals and care homes. We want to see the identification of a senior clinician in all general hospitals and an appropriate member of staff in care homes to be given the specific responsibility of ensuring good quality dementia care.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09062549000222"></a>I now turn to some specific points raised by noble Lords. I will try to address them all in my remaining time, but if I do not address everything, I promise to go through the debate and write to anyone who has not had their question answered. The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, raised the issue of how the Government intend to monitor spending and implementation. I think that I have addressed that point, but Objective 17 of the strategy calls for good quality information to be made available on the development of dementia services, so it is definitely integrated into the strategy. The noble Baroness also asked about the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia report on training. I know that we are not allowed to use visual aids, but I read this report as part of my briefing and we know that improved training for all those involved in dementia care is a core part of the national strategy. Our challenge is of course to change the undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum for professional and vocational training, as I have already mentioned.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09062549000223"></a>My noble friend Lady Pitkeathley quite rightly made the link between the National Dementia Strategy and the Carers Strategy. It is of course essential. Family carers are central to the National Dementia Strategy<I></I>and I can confirm that those developing the strategy worked closely with those working on the Carers Strategy and will continue to do so as we enter the implementation stages of both those strategies.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09062549000224"></a>My noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, both referred to the Green Paper. I will repeat exactly what my right honourable friend the Secretary of State said in another place:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09062549000508"></a>&#147;In early July, we will publish a Green Paper setting out options to reform the care and support system&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/6/09; Commons col. 656.]</p>

<p><a name="09062549000490"></a>I suspect that the date will be nearer that mentioned by my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, but I am not allowed to mention any date specifically.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09062549000225"></a>My noble friend continued to make the point about carers and I should like to add to my remarks that the &#163;150 million available to PCTs in addition to the &#163;25 million available to councils to help them to provide short-term cover in emergencies may help to reassure them. By March 2011, we will have invested &#163;1.7 billion to councils to support carers.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09062549000226"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, made a most moving speech and I felt privileged to listen to it. Most eloquent in terms of the description of her husband's dementia was the plea for information. I completely agree. We are determined that that is part of the strategy and that we need to deliver it. I am completely at one with the noble Baroness about that.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09062549000227"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Greengross, both raised the issue of anti-psychotic drugs. The Government agree that the potential overuse of anti-psychotic drugs for people with dementia is a  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1705"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1705</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>serious issue. The department is undertaking a review of the over prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs for people with dementia in care homes. That follows emerging evidence that such drugs were being prescribed excessively and inappropriately. The review remains a priority and we will publish the results shortly.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09062549000228"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, raised the issue of dementia and people with learning difficulties. He was completely correct about the need for the dementia strategy to explicitly include those with dementia who have learning difficulties. Indeed, it does. Of all the people who present problems, it is very important that early diagnosis and appropriate care is there for people with learning disabilities. The noble Lord quite rightly pointed to the shortcomings. The National Dementia Strategy is designed to change that and good quality care for people with learning disabilities and dementia will quite clearly require joint working and a specifically tailored approach. We are discussing that, as advocated by the royal college. The implementation strategy will provide some of those solutions.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09062549000229"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, raised an interesting issue about stigma and taboo. It was a point very well made. The noble Baroness also raised the issue of early diagnosis. She is completely correct. Our strategy is clear about the need for early diagnosis for all those with dementia. One of the reasons is that this gives people the ability to make choices themselves while they have the capacity. It gives people with dementia the chance to discuss their future care and to record decisions about their future care. I can assure the noble Baroness that the diagnosis of dementia does not mean that a person lacks the capacity to make such advanced directives for information about their future care. In fact, that is extremely important.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09062549000230"></a>I always love listening to the speeches of noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes. They are always informative; they always make a pertinent point; and they are always very human in what they relay to us. She was completely correct, and illustrated it with the points that she made, that early diagnosis is absolutely the key.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09062549000231"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, referred to money for research. We know that it is not sufficient and that there is much more work to do on that. I am extremely pleased that the noble Baroness is chairing the summit on science and research. I very much enjoyed the round table that she organised the other day, particularly when the group was discussing GP diagnoses. It is an issue that is being raised by many noble Lords. I was very struck by the remarks made by Professor Steve Iliffe about the problems that GPs themselves face in making the diagnosis.</p>

<a name="90625-0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09062549000232"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, made an important point about the role of employers in this matter. She was the only person who made that point. I agree with the noble Baroness about the value of the Alzheimer&#146;s Society and the work that it does. As ever, the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, gave us a master class in the research and the science of research. I really appreciated the message of hope that he left us with at the end of his remarks. I thank him very much for doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09062549000233"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, made a very pertinent point about the cancer plan being a very good model and about how one takes this forward in terms of research. As ever, the noble Lord, Lord McColl, had something unusual to say. I remember reading about the programme in a Sunday newspaper and being very struck myself about the imaginative nature of that programme.</p>

With the agreement of the usual channels, it is being repeated in this place as a Statement, as is the practice. The Statement is as follows:</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09062549000237"></a>&#147;Mr Speaker, at 10 o&#146; clock this morning my right honourable friend the Prime Minister made a Written Ministerial Statement, laying before the House this year&#146;s update to the national security strategy. Accompanying the strategy update is the first national cybersecurity strategy for the United Kingdom. Last week, the Government presented to the House the Digital Britain strategy. This country is well placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the digital age. However, we can seize these opportunities only if people are confident that they can operate safely in cyberspace.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09062549000238"></a>Every day, millions of people across the UK rely on the services and information that make up cyberspace. The internet is accessible in 65 per cent of United Kingdom households, a figure that is growing by about 8 per cent per year. Plastic transactions, which depend on wired or wireless communication, make up 90 per cent of our high street purchases.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1707"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1707</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09062549000239"></a>The national security strategy, published for the first time by this Government last March and updated this year, sets out an honest and transparent appraisal of the risks that we face, including the threat that organised crime poses to our country. Organised crime costs this country &#163;20 billion per year. We have a duty to the British public, and to British industry, to take all measures to reduce dramatically this cost. The Government also need to assess the threat from terrorist organisations and other states and prepare our response to that. The public would expect no less.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09062549000240"></a>All these threats can arise in cyberspace. As the director-general of the Security Service has said,</p>
<ul><a name="09062549000524"></a>&#145;a number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects, and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense. They do not only use traditional methods to collect intelligence but increasingly deploy sophisticated technical attacks, using the internet to penetrate computer networks&#146;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062549000241"></a>We know the importance that terrorist groups&#151;notably al-Qaeda and its affiliates&#151;place on the internet and cyberspace. This is particularly important at the moment for propaganda. We know that terrorists would like to be able to operate more effectively in cyberspace. This Government are not in the business of scaremongering. We do not assess at present that terrorists have the capability to mount such an attack imminently but we must prepare as terrorists become more sophisticated.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09062549000242"></a>These threats from states or terrorists could affect critical national systems. There is a real threat to millions of ordinary citizens, their transactions and the businesses that they work for. Online fraud generated &#163;52 billion worldwide in 2007. The average cost of an information security incident for a small company is in the range of &#163;10,000 to &#163;20,000. For a large company, it can be more like &#163;1 million to &#163;2 million. As the UK&#146;s dependence on cyberspace grows, so the security of cyberspace becomes ever more critical to the health of the nation.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09062549000243"></a>So, today, the Government are publishing the first cybersecurity strategy. As a result, we will establish the office of cybersecurity in the Cabinet Office, to lead on cybersecurity issues, and a cybersecurity operations centre, a multi-agency body based alongside GCHQ in Cheltenham. This organisation will also examine the operations and technical capabilities needed.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09062549000244"></a>As a result of the new strategy, we will develop a cyberindustrial strategy for critical UK cybersecurity needs, in the same way as we have a defence industrial strategy. We will develop a cybersecurity skills strategy for the UK, plugging existing gaps and creating more high-tech employment opportunities. We will make critical systems in the public and private sector more resilient and enhance our ability to detect attack. We will develop the international law and doctrines of national defence in cyberspace, working with other countries. We will better advise business and citizens about the cybersecurity risk picture and the steps that they need to take to address it. We will develop new strategies for tackling terrorists&#146; and criminals&#146; use of cyberspace with our colleagues, in line with the ACPO strategy for law enforcement on cybercrime due out shortly. We will also plan emergency response. The new centre will test the UK&#146;s ability to respond to a major attack, as we do for terrorism, in setting up a strengthened analysis function for cyberthreats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09062549000245"></a>As with all our national security activity, it is important that government powers are used proportionately and in a way consistent with individual liberty. So we will set up an ethics advisory group to advise on this. I will update the House on its membership when it is formed. The centres will be operational in September and new funding will be announced before then, building on the existing resources allocated largely to intelligence agencies. I will report back to the House.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09062549000246"></a>On the wider national security update, the Government have taken forward the good start made last year. We look across the broad range of national security threats. We have set out an updated analysis of the threats that we face and made new commitments on tackling what drives insecurity in the world. These are conflict, energy shortages, poverty and, looking to the long term, the impact of climate change.</p>

We agree with the Government that there is no more important responsibility for government than national security, so we find it extraordinary that this Government have published the country&#146;s first cybersecurity strategy and the 2009 update to the national security strategy by way of a Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09062549000250"></a>These have come after the strategies had first been trailed in the press in an extraordinary way. Indeed, I understand that in another place yesterday Mr Speaker made a Statement, his first after being elected, pointing out the importance of Ministers presenting to both Houses of Parliament changes in policy on important matters before trailing them in the press. It is only as a result of an Urgent Question from our Benches in another place that the Minister is before our House today and we have this somewhat limited opportunity to debate the strategies. By using a Written Ministerial Statement, the Government were, in effect, trying to ensure that both Houses of Parliament did not have the appropriate opportunity to discuss or debate the strategies.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09062549000251"></a>The Government are making much of their new cybersecurity strategy. Action in this crucial domain is due&#151;indeed, long overdue. And what does it amount to? It includes the establishment of an office for cybersecurity in the Cabinet Office and the upgrading of an already existing unit in Cheltenham, which is to be called the cybersecurity operations centre. It is impossible to know, however, how significant these changes are, because we are not told what funding is being made available to enhance our ability to tackle cyberthreats. The Government&#146;s special supplement on cybersecurity contains some figures as to the costs of cyberinsecurity to the nation, but we will have to wait until the autumn to know how much money the Government will devote to the tasks set out in the Statement.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09062549000252"></a>The Government also tell us that they are now giving leadership to this issue. But how does that  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1709"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1709</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>square with using the gag of a D notice to stop us knowing who the new director is? I understand that, regardless of that, the name has been leaked.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09062549000253"></a>Cybercrime proceeds apace in the absence of cybersecurity. There is significant cybercrime in the United Kingdom. Many in this House will have had experience of it in relation to bank accounts, but the strategy has virtually nothing to say about the response. It simply tells us that the Association of Chief Police Officers will produce an anti-e-crime strategy later. I might say that at present the Metropolitan Police has a unit of 12 officers devoted to national e-crime. It is hardly surprising that it is difficult to get action when an e-crime is committed. We have a long way to go on this matter.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09062549000254"></a>There is some confusion about the way in which these structures will work and whether or not there is overlapping and overbureaucracy in all of this. Can the Minister assure this House that the Government have not set in place structures that will duplicate existing work on cybersecurity and information assurance? There seems to be a real risk of duplication, since other units appear to continue to do work in this area without being tied properly into the new structures. There are no efficiency savings here, it would seem. What do the Government mean when they say that the office for cybersecurity will be based initially in the Cabinet Office? What are the longer-term intentions?</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09062549000255"></a>Clearly, the Government have missed an opportunity here to review more widely and make sense of the very muddled security structures that exist across Whitehall. The need to produce a substantial update to the national security strategy just over a year after publishing the first version is an admission that the Government&#146;s first attempt was not actually a strategy, as it did not adequately set long-term direction for different departments and agencies.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09062549000256"></a>It remains to be seen what effect this update will have in the absence of a proper national security council with a dedicated staff and a proper national security budget. Indeed, we are also left waiting for a lot of detail on organised crime, maritime security and energy security, which are promised for later. Instead of saying what will be announced later, as the Minister repeating the Statement made clear, and coming back to the House again and again on other matters, the Government should have done the work first and should have been be able to tell us now how we are to proceed. Will there perhaps be a third update next year? In particular, will the Minister be more specific on when the energy strategy will be published? Will he say when the reviews of the organised crime strategy and the maritime threat will be completed and whether they will be published?</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09062549000257"></a>In this House we have the opportunity by way of a Statement to have a few more minutes than were available in another place. It was regrettable that this matter could be debated in another place only by way of an Urgent Question, which is all too brief. I should be grateful if the Minister indicated that the Government would welcome an approach from the usual channels to ensure that there is a fuller opportunity to debate these matters on another day.</p>

<a name="09062549000258"></a><b><a name="90625-0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062549000663"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches, too, find the process by which this Statement has been made extremely regrettable. The Minister will remember that, on the Second Reading of the Policing and Crime Bill, I raised at some length the issue of cybercrime, because we felt that it was a very much more serious issue than those dealt with in some of the unnecessary parts of the Bill. It is particularly surprising and regrettable that, if the Minister had in mind the fact that there would be this big revelation on cybercrime, we could not have considered something in this House in a more structured way.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09062549000259"></a>This Statement is a lot more about headlines, because there is actually not much action in it. I shall give the Minister a few examples of the action that we would have been pleased to see. However, perhaps he can first tell me whether we have ratified the European Convention on Cybercrime. Particularly important is Article 25, which enables us to co-operate properly, have mutual legal assistance, respond to requests for help from other countries and make the best use of all the international provisions. This is because a lot of e-crime is perpetrated in countries such as Brazil, China and so on. Without a proper co-ordinated international effort, we will not get very far. Perhaps the Minister could also confirm that, where serious e-crime is perpetrated in third countries, the extradition arrangements are satisfactory, because the tariffs have been so low for these offences that they were not extraditable.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09062549000260"></a>The Minister talked of the ordinary citizen. Another enormous problem for the ordinary citizen on whom e-crime impacts heavily is that, according to a Written Answer that the Minister was kind enough to send me earlier this year, the Government do not collect central figures on e-crime in any case, so we do not know its scale. It would be interesting to know from the Minister whether the liability of banks for losses suffered by people as a result of e-crime when the banks&#146; security systems are not efficient is underpinned by legislation, because that area remains dependent on just the <I>Banking Code</I>. Will the Government look at strengthening that?</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09062549000261"></a>The public need a lot more help in getting safe online. Will the Government, as a result of this new effort on cybercrime, launch a much more targeted and satisfactory effort on helping the public to get safe online? They should start by running an advertising campaign, obliging retailers to offer a &#147;get safe online&#148; package every time they sell a new computer and encouraging colleges to offer short courses on exactly what is necessary. There is an awful lot to be done in this area. Most people who are fairly computer literate are still astonishingly illiterate when it comes to how to get safe online. I admit that it is quite difficult to know all the things that you should be doing. In the parliamentary system, we are somewhat helped by having it done for us, but that cannot be said for the ordinary citizen and that needs to be addressed.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09062549000262"></a>The Minister spoke of an ethics advisory committee, which may offer some reassurance when we look at the centre that is to sit alongside GCHQ. However, a more practical step was suggested in this House last Friday,  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1711"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1711</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which was that there should be a Joint Committee, as recommended by the Constitution Committee of this House. However, the Government said in their response that they had no intention of pursuing that idea. That is a big gap. There is a lack of parliamentary oversight of this area. It is falling in a gap between the Home Office and other departments, so a Joint Committee&#151;a considered suggestion from the Constitution Committee&#151;would be a very good first step. If we are going to have a cybersecurity operations centre, doing all the data mining and interception of web traffic that that involves, we surely need proper parliamentary scrutiny, starting with the Joint Committee. Finally, will the Minister tell me whether he still feels, in the light of the new cybersecurity operations centre, whether RIPA is fit for purpose? I hope that we have the opportunity to debate this at greater length, because there are an awful lot of questions that we need to ask about it.</p>

It was good to see her at the start of the debate. I have noticed that a colleague of hers has appeared on every media channel in the past two hours, talking about this national security strategy, and I must say I am impressed by the speed with which she had managed to read it and absorb it all. I apologise for the fact that there was an error in a department with a D Notice that went out quite normally. We try to protect people who have been working in very sensitive areas, but I am afraid that department put in a D Notice rather earlier than it should have done, and that led to a couple of articles. I wrote a letter to the Speaker and to the honourable Crispin Blunt in the other place, explaining that. I apologised for that having happened. The department that did it realised the error of its ways&#151;there are some people walking on stumps&#151;but I will not go into any more detail on that. The way we have issued this, with my right honourable friend the Prime Minister producing this as a Written Ministerial Statement, with two documents, was absolutely right.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09062549000264"></a>I agree with both speakers so far&#151;I absolutely hope that there will be a debate on these really important issues. However, I had hoped that we would have the debate after people had read the documents in detail, because they are highly complicated. We could then have a deep and meaningful debate. I am aware, because of happenstance and this unfortunate D Notice, that this has all happened in rather a gallop. I certainly want to have a proper debate later, and I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, very much for the noble way she has pushed this forward today. It is unfortunate that people are talking about this without actually really knowing very much about it, and I am a little disappointed about how that has been done.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09062549000265"></a>The noble Baroness talked about duplicating various things, but I think the document merits considerable attention. Far from duplicating things, we are actually co-ordinating and pulling together all the work that goes on. We have been aware of these threats now for some time. When I was Chief of Defence Intelligence, back in 1997, I was aware of various threats, but of course we were not so well joined-up and so close  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1712"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1712</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>together. When I took over this job in 2007, it became very clear to me that we needed a co-ordinated strategy. A lot of very good work was being done in the CESG in Cheltenham, in other centres of excellence, and in many of the financial institutions, but the people who were getting at us were getting cleverer and cleverer at doing it. However, we were getting more and more interconnected. There is always an extraordinary balance in which all of these lovely things we have now&#151;these amazing computer capabilities, hand-held sets, the ability to transfer data and to use satellites&#151;are designed to be as open as possible to let us share data. That is great for business, globalisation and for lots of things, but it is of course a huge vulnerability when there are nasty people who want to get at it. Steadily, it has got more and more complex and people have got cleverer and cleverer at actually attacking us in those areas. Therefore, it became very clear when I took over in 2007 that we needed to co-ordinate all the very good work that was going on.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09062549000266"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the amount of funding involved here, and of course we will look specifically at funding. My honourable friend in the other place gave a specific commitment to come back to Parliament to look at the funding available for training people and for another work stream, which I have forgotten at the moment. He will come back with evidence on those two areas. Lots of money is being spent, and I want to co-ordinate this better. It is too easy, and it is wrong and old-fashioned, to just try to throw money at something. We need to get it co-ordinated, use all the money that is there and get this efficiency and use it properly. That is what I am trying to do within this strategy, and I think that will be achieved.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09062549000267"></a>The first national security strategy was a huge step forward&#151;we had not done something like that before in this country. We looked at it across the board, for all threats, and we thought of it in terms of the citizen. We said we would develop and build on that, and that is what we have done. We are still building it around the citizen, so that we can relate this to the citizen in every single area. One of the great successes of the last strategy was that out of that I pulled a National Risk Register, which goes right down to the various local areas, to the local risk forums. In that, we said that pandemic flu was probably the most likely and most dangerous risk, and so we started making preparations. There is now a pandemic&#151;although luckily it does not seem to be really virulent at the moment&#151;and when it began the World Health Organisation said that Britain was the most prepared country in the world. That was because we had identified it in our national security strategy.</p>

<a name="90625-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09062549000268"></a>We have now covered more areas, and are working through this is a much more structured way. There is a logical sense to the way we have gone about the strategy so that people can follow it. The average citizen can read it, work it out, and say, &#147;Oh yes they&#146;ve done that&#148;. The strategy looks at various domains, which is why cyber is such an instant success as a domain that we need to work in. A lot of work is going on in the maritime area, but it leapt out at me as one where there are so many fingers in the pie that we need to co-ordinate it better. That is what we will do. Within 12 months, we will actually have an answer and

We will know what is around our coast. Space was another area that we had not really addressed properly. I have said we need to co-ordinate it, and we are now doing that. However, you cannot do everything instantly&#151;there is only limited resource in terms of brains and people. However, we have done a remarkable amount&#151;we are delivering these things and we now know very clearly which way we are going. The cybersecurity strategy is just one chunk of that, another domain rather like maritime&#151;it is a new domain and one we need to work in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09062549000269"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned that she has talked about cybercrime for some time. I have touched on that&#151;it has been growing and we have been aware of it. The reason we have gone about it the way we have is because the connectivity increased and the capability of attacks got bigger. We needed to co-ordinate it more, and that is why we are where we are. However, it is a complex thing, and to get all these people to work together is complex and difficult. We are very lucky in this country&#151;we have some remarkably capable people, and we need to grow more of them. We need to become a centre of excellence in the world, because we are ahead of anywhere else. We worked really closely with our American cousins and there are very close links between GCHQ and the NSA. But of course they are in a far worse place than us because they were connected up long before we were. They were using computers and talking to each other when we were still on quill pens&#151;not quite, but you know what I mean. But as we came into that computer age later, our government net, for example&#151;the gsi.gov.uk net&#151;has a very restricted number of portals. It is quite difficult for people get in, and we know the number of attacks. In the American system has more than 8,000 portals in its government network. We know from some of our pointy-headed hackers how easy it is to get into it, and therefore the Americans have a real problem to resolve. We are working very closely with them on this, and in fact we were doing this work at the same time, if not before, them. Therefore, it is rubbish when people say that President Obama has grabbed this, that he has jumped ahead of us and that we are not catching up. We have been working with the Americans and I think that we have delivered a great deal.</p>

Although I have now been made the Minister responsible for cybersecurity, I sometimes feel like an ing&#233;nue in this area. It is quite daunting and horrifying to see how people who want to get money out of you or cause damage can fool you into giving up data. Part of this whole package is intended to teach our people so that they are aware of the risks. Very often, the weakest link in any net is the

People are sent something, they open it up and are then asked a question in a clever way. They answer and&#151;bang&#151;every bit of their computer is suddenly available for others to use. I will not mention some of the clever things that these people do to get information because we do not want to let other people know about them, but I can say that they are quite terrifying. Our aim is to teach people about these things. We will set things up to let people know about these matters and train them, letting them know the right things to do and putting in place mechanisms within the system to make things safer.</p>

There is no confusion or duplication; we are tying things together. Very shortly, the Home Office will produce something on serious and organised crime. We are addressing every one of these areas and pulling them together. I think that what we have done is rather impressive, but I had better stop now and allow more questions to be asked.</p>

However, does he agree that measures to address the threat to states from cyber attack have to be global and all-inclusive? I hope to heaven that he does agree with that.

<p><a name="09062549000491"></a>That is only a tiny fragment dealing with the essential urgency of a global approach to these matters. One cannot help but come to the conclusion that the Government&#146;s approach to this, once again, is all talk and no action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09062549000274"></a>The Minister has been boasting about what the Government have done but perhaps I may ask him two questions. First, if the Government regard this massive threat as urgent, why has the Council of Europe&#146;s Draft Convention on Cyber-crime, which the United Kingdom signed seven and a half years ago in November 2001, not yet been ratified? What could the reason be for that? Secondly, NATO&#146;s Cyber Defence Management Authority has been operative since April last year. The United States has signed up to it but the United Kingdom has not. All this adds up to the irresistible view that the Government have spent these past years half asleep in relation to these matters. What are they going to do to harness the serious threat of cybercrime on a global scale?</p>

We are engaged internationally. As I said, we are almost joined at the hip with the US, and that stems from the agreement signed in the late 1940s between the NSA and GCHQ. We are working very closely with the US on its huge project to sort out the problems that it has in this area. Indeed, at times the US has used us to help in finding out what some of the problems are. We

I agree entirely about NATO, and I think that we will have to put in more effort there. That is why I want an international engagement stream, because I believe that we need to be closely involved. It is a global issue, although I think that there is a difference of equity among people. We have a greater understanding with the US by a quantum amount than we do with almost any other country.

I listened to the Minister and heard his passion for co-ordination. Perhaps I may ask him to think again and not just to give an off-the-cuff reaction to the idea put forward by the Constitution Committee and my noble friend for a Joint Committee to look at these issues. The more he spoke, and the more enthusiasm he expressed, it seemed that the bit of co-ordination missing from the puzzle was parliamentary oversight.

It was felt that it was such a wonderfully dynamic opportunity that it was wrong to encumber it with legislation. However, should the amazing growth of technology be revisited or should the internet still be free?</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09062549000279"></a>Linked to that, I also worked on the RIPA legislation, where it was often a case of the blind leading the blind. I make no comment about the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, but certainly some of the technology went way above my head. I remember that we built in quite strong safeguards for civil liberties. My noble friend asked whether the RIPA legislation was still fit for purpose in term of developments in technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09062549000280"></a>Finally, I went to a very interesting briefing by Vodafone the other evening, where, again, the convergence of technologies was explained&#151;the phone as a computer with access to the internet and so on. To make this work, we will have to have an active buy-in by private companies with commercial considerations as well as national and international obligations. Is the Minister sure that we can get the buy-in from the private sector for the objectives that he has set out?</p>

As noble Lords will know, we are looking at the RIPA legislation because we are not convinced that it is being used by, for example, local councils in the right way. That was never intended and we want to ensure that that is resolved and that there is proper guidance. Without a doubt, we need to look at the legislation in that context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09062549000282"></a>As regards ethics and the Joint Committee and the question of parliamentary oversight, there is of course the committee for the national security strategy. I thought that it would have been named already, as I know that it is being talked about in the other place with the Speaker and so on. It will have some oversight of the national security strategy. I undertake to look at cybersecurity on its own and see whether the committee will cover that, or whether we need, with the ethics committee, some other joint aspect. So I commit to that, but I would not want to give an off-the-cuff answer on it. The matter is too complicated; some of it will be the business of people within the other place as well as here, and to say more would be beyond my remit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09062549000283"></a>One feels at times that the internet is a bit of an ungoverned space. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has often mentioned the issue of deep packet inspections and the like, and I have some concern about that. We have managed to get a lot of voluntary agreement on things such as child pornography, which is super, and I am pleased that we have achieved that. However, it proves more difficult in some other areas, and the internet is now so all-pervasive that we will have to think about this. At the moment, though, there is nothing planned, and we would have to think about how to move forward in a very broad all-party context. So we are not doing anything, but it is a nagging concern at the back of my mind.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09062549000284"></a>Some of the CSPs and ISPs have been very good about working with us. BT, for example, has been fantastic: it has engaged with us and helped us in saying, &#147;We&#146;ve had this many attacks; this is happening; what about trying this?&#148;. It works closely with us, as generally these companies do, but some are better than others. All of them, though, are beginning to understand that, given the state threats, the threats from serious and organised crime&#151;&#163;50 billion a year or so is lost around the world, and that amount is getting bigger all the time&#151;and the threat to each individual person, such as identity theft or bank account attacks, it is in all our interest to work together, and I think that generally they will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09062549000286"></a>In the 64 years since I became a doctor, advances in medical and scientific knowledge have been astonishing, and my theme today is to convince your Lordships that today&#146;s discovery in basic medical science results in tomorrow&#146;s practical development in patient care. This is translational research, meaning that basic scientific discoveries are translated into new methods of management of disease and its prevention. For anyone practising medicine before the NHS, as I did, the vast range of new and effective drugs has been phenomenal. Serious diseases which I saw as a young doctor, like diphtheria, poliomyelitis and scarlet fever, are rarely, if ever, seen, due to effective vaccination, while rubella, which may damage the foetus in a pregnant woman, and mumps are now controlled. Measles, too, should have virtually disappeared in the UK, were it not for the misguided campaign, based on flawed research, that caused the MMR vaccine scare.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09062549000287"></a>With new antibiotics emerging, many bacterial infections have been defeated, but antibiotic resistance has caused the emergence of strains like MRSA and drug-resistant tuberculosis, while AIDS, still a major challenge, is now more effectively controlled by appropriate medication. Methods used when I was a young neurologist to identify the cause of strokes and to locate brain tumours, for example, often involved great discomfort and potential risks, but new methods of imaging, such as CT and ultrasound scanning, magnetic resonance imaging and its functional variant, have given us information about abnormalities in the body&#146;s internal organs undreamed of a few decades ago.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09062549000288"></a>Admittedly, there are still some incurable diseases, not least in neurology, even though developments in molecular biology, including gene identification and the discovery of the missing or abnormal proteins resulting from such gene defects, have raised hopes of new treatments for many such conditions, perhaps by gene therapy or other variants. The prospect of the repair of damaged tissues, so-called regenerative medicine, sometimes using adult stem cells but more often using the highly effective pluripotential embryonic stem cells, which can readily be converted into nerve cells, liver cells, kidney cells, heart cells and indeed many cell types, brings within sight the prospect, if not of immediate cure, certainly of amelioration.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09062549000289"></a>As I always told my students, though, while there are still many incurable diseases, none is untreatable. All can have their effects modified by pharmacological, biological, physical or psychological means. I quote as an example the improved care of patients with the most severe form of muscular dystrophy, the Duchenne type, affecting young boys, who have progressive difficulty in walking and are confined to a wheelchair from about the age of 10. When I first began research in the 1950s, many such boys died in their mid-teens from heart failure or respiratory infection, having become grossly deformed through neglect of supportive measures. Now, in specialised centres such as London, Oxford and Newcastle, where ventilatory care is available, the average age at death of these boys is in the 30s, whereas in the south-west of England it is still in the late teens. As a result of a detailed survey by an All-Party Parliamentary Group and the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, improvements in services for

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09062549000290"></a>I must mention briefly the issue of stroke. This country has been lagging in its introduction and development of stroke units and in introducing new and improved methods of treatment. We know now that if one can recognise stroke and one regards it as an emergency&#151;the public, the paramedics and the medical profession need to be much better informed about this&#151;and if a patient is admitted within the three-hour deadline and can have an immediate scan to demonstrate whether the stroke is due to an infarct, as the result of the blockage of a vessel or a haemorrhage, then, if it is an infarct, clot-busting drugs and thrombolysis can improve the condition greatly. At the moment only 1.5 per cent of patients with ischaemic stroke in the UK are receiving thrombolysis. This is unacceptable, and measures must be taken to improve that position.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09062549000291"></a>Many years ago, as a member of your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on Science and Technology, I chaired an inquiry into research in the NHS. Our report was endorsed by the then Conservative Government, who accepted that while much research and many treatment trials were being conducted in the NHS, there was no dedicated line of funding for health service research. Concerns then about the freezing of clinical academic posts in universities, appointments that involved not only teaching and research but also patient care, led to a major decline in recruitment. That inquiry led first to the Culyer report on NHS research, the Richards report on clinical academic medicine and, several years later, the outstanding Cooksey report on NHS research. Dame Sally Davies now presides over a National Institute for Health Research, supporting much research in the NHS.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09062549000292"></a>The Conservative Government responded to our report by agreeing that 1.5 per cent of the NHS budget should ultimately be devoted to R&amp;D, but the figure has never yet exceeded 0.9 per cent. While that is substantial, in view of increased NHS funding, what plans do the Government have to increase this figure to somewhere nearer the agreed target? Might additional academic health science research centres be established in places that narrowly missed out in the first tranche? As the recession bites, may we also hope&#151;recent government statements are encouraging&#151;that increased government spending on science, especially in the annual grants to the Medical Research Council and the BBSRC, will be maintained?</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09062549000293"></a>We must also acknowledge the massive support of research funding provided by the Association of Medical Research Charities, of which the Wellcome Trust is pre-eminent, although the disease-oriented charities have also made crucial contributions. In my view, it was a sad day when, some 20 years ago, the Advisory Board for the Research Councils removed infrastructure funding from the University Grants Committee, funds specifically allocated under the dual-support system to provide well-found university and hospital departments and laboratories, and passed that money to the research  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1719"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1719</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>councils, fearing that the new universities, the former polytechnics, might seek such support, diluting resources available for the old-established universities. As a result, confusion arose about overheads to be paid by research charities. Under the UGC, overheads were not paid but now universities are acquiring full economic costing.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09062549000294"></a>The Charity Research Support Fund, introduced by government and providing infrastructure funding for charity-funded research, is, I fear, inadequate, and I would welcome the Minister's comments. A recent survey by a notable charity found that only 5 per cent of 245 researchers funded by charities considered that fund adequate. One-third of those researchers found that universities were becoming increasingly reluctant to support applications for charities for research grants for that reason.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09062549000295"></a>The NHS does, of course, play a vital role in the undergraduate and postgraduate education of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. I was disappointed that education was not highlighted in the NHS Constitution. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister how the proposed health innovation and education clusters will nurture such education. The doctors and nurses of tomorrow are dependent on the facilities of the NHS for their undergraduate and postgraduate training. Do the Government accept that we must maintain the opt-out from the European working time directive for young trainee doctors? The restriction on working hours will have an adverse effect on training, and surgeons in particular are deeply concerned that, under the restricted hours now proposed, the training of surgeons will suffer.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09062549000296"></a>Has the MTAS scheme proved a disincentive for young doctors wishing to take time out from training to undertake research? When I was head of a department, many young men and women came to the department in the course of training&#151;as registrars and senior registrars&#151;before moving on to apply for consultant posts, but a very large number of them took a year out from their formal NHS training to undertake a programme of research. I am informed by many heads of departments that, because of the MTAS scheme, that is becoming increasingly difficult for many young doctors to do. In my view it is crucial to recognise that a period of time spent in research nurtures the development of young doctors who benefit from that, and in the end it improves their ability to undertake practice and clinical care.</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09062549000297"></a>Happily, the NHS continues to fund many clinical academic posts in our universities, recognising the crucial role that such individuals play not only in teaching and research but also in patient care. Initiatives of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Wellcome Trust in supporting clinical academia have been admirable, so that academic medicine is now in better heart. However, there are storms on the horizon as some health service trusts and even foundation trusts have questioned the need for such posts to be funded by the NHS. Does the Minister agree that the vitality of clinical academic medicine is essential if high quality research, teaching and patient care are to be maintained?</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09062549000298"></a>Finally, the NHS offers an ideal environment for clinical trials of new forms of treatment, trials often expertly assessed by the National Institute for Health

Has the European Union directive on clinical trials had any adverse effect? Are the Government satisfied that seeking ethical approval of research protocols, especially for multicentre and multinational trials, where unacceptable delays have often occurred in the past, is now satisfactory? Can we be confident that research ethics committees contain a majority of scientifically literate individuals able fully to appreciate and to consider the scientific content of such research programmes?</p>

<a name="90625-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09062549000299"></a>For more than 40 years I was stimulated and inspired by my responsibilities in clinical academic medicine, involving teaching, patient care and research. I firmly believe that those three branches of academic activity are interdependent and mutually beneficial, and that the NHS is probably the finest clinical laboratory that exists anywhere in the world for the pursuit of clinical and translational research with the objective of improving disease prevention, treatment and cure. May it continue to flourish. I beg to move.</p>

I pay tribute to him for his distinguished medical and academic career in this area. As a non-medic, among a number of distinguished medics who are to address your Lordships this afternoon, I shall speak with some humility about the issue of quality. To set the scene, I shall talk about quantity. Ninety-three per cent of patients requiring admission to hospital are admitted within 18 weeks; not many years ago the waiting time was two years. In quantity terms there has been a real improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09062549000301"></a>When I was an MP, 30 years ago, I got to know someone in my constituency who had cataracts in both eyes. He was a working-class man who was quite poor and could not afford private treatment. He was virtually blind but he never received treatment in the health service before he died. Now there are 250,000 cataract operations a year and the average wait is 10 weeks. I often think of that man when I consider that statistic.</p>

Under the National Health Service, she had cochlear implants on both sides and, thank goodness, she is a very vigorous and energetic four year-old. Hearing is a very big problem for a lot of people: 400,000 people a year are referred to audiology departments. They are not the big glamour operations for many people but they are very important to people's lives. That is the quantity issue and I now turn to the issue of quality.</p>

If quality is to be at the heart of everything done in the NHS, it must be understood from the perspective of patients. That is quite a change in many parts of the NHS. Patients are

If you go to a restaurant you tend to go back to one where perhaps the food is not always good but the overall treatment, including courtesy, is good.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09062549000304"></a>Improving the quality of service has to involve everyone. It requires a true team effort, with everyone committed and everyone proud of the achievements. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, was right to say that change is most likely to be achieved if it is led by clinicians. I agree with that. The emphasis should be on teamwork and inclusiveness. In many hospitals, still too large a proportion of staff feel undervalued and in some&#151;I do not say all&#151;major hospitals senior medical staff are still viewed with awe or fear rather than as lead partners in achieving high quality outcomes and patient experience.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09062549000305"></a>The NHS is a large and daunting structure for patients, and I wonder whether we do enough to integrate the patient&#146;s needs and experience through primary, secondary and tertiary care. People often go through all those. Is enough done to take people through that on a continual basis, avoiding cancelled appointments, missing or out-of-date information, so that they have to go back again to see the consultant, and all the things that we know can go wrong?</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09062549000306"></a>A few years ago, I suffered from an underactive thyroid&#151;I still do, of course&#151;and I went to see many NHS consultants, until I found one who knew what it was, although it was not his specialisation. I had an appointment to see one chap and, as noble Lords would expect, I arrived for the 12 o&#146;clock appointment at about three or four minutes to 12 o&#146;clock and discovered eight people waiting. When I asked the secretary whether the specialist was on time, she said, &#147;Yes, but you&#146;re eighth in the queue&#148;. Twelve o&#146;clock did not mean 12 o&#146;clock; it meant that that was when a group of people turned up. I had to cancel the appointment because I had a number of other things to do that were extremely important, more important than my health. I cancelled the appointment and felt very bad about that. In that little microcosm, that NHS cost itself resources and money, it did not do the patient experience any favours and left me feeling very frustrated. Nobody gained, and nobody got a grip on it.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09062549000307"></a>Raising quality does not mean increasing costs or reducing productivity, far from it. In my view, raising quality is about addressing the whole process of delivering a health requirement and means finding ways to deliver more for less, provide more time to improve the patient experience, review outcomes and seek further improvements. My view, speaking with a business school background, is that the message that improving quality will cost more and reduce productivity so that we cannot afford to do it is far from the truth. We can have more for less if it is seen as a process, not in isolation. Times are going to be tough for the NHS in the next few years. There will be plenty of people saying that they cannot afford to have meetings to discuss these things because they have enough on as it is, but I believe that it can be achieved.</p>

I came back to this country and asked for the figure and it is about 2 per cent. The difference is staggering. I ask the Minister to consider whether there is a serious career structure for medically qualified people who want to add value to the NHS on that basis. In my view, that is critical to improving quality and performance. Is the financial reward structure adequate? My guess is that it is woefully inadequate. My message is that quality matters and is not something that cannot be afforded when times are tough. Quality improvements are even more important when times are tough, and getting the right people leading teams and making a real team effort requires an improvement in the way in which medically qualified people are involved in the senior management running the health service.</p>

I am wholly a layman and I speak as a patient about one niche of concern. Eight years ago, I had a stroke. I was very lucky; there was no apparent physical damage, but my reading, writing, speaking and comprehension were severely affected, and I had two and a half years of speech therapy.

The Stroke Association called its recent document <I>Getting Better</I>, which is just about right. I should add that I am a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Stroke, which is ably chaired by Andrew Lansley MP, the Conservative health shadow who has recently been having a rather tough time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09062549000311"></a>Today, I am looking at stroke again, on this occasion in the context of the new National Sentinel Stroke Audit published by the Royal College of Physicians in April, and at the role of stroke research. I have already warned the Minister of my particular interest, and I hope she will be able to respond. In sum, I am disturbed that the new sentinel audit report shows that there remains a serious gap between what is actually happening and what should happen. There have been significant improvements. Twenty-nine per cent of patients are now admitted to a stroke unit on the same day and 57 per cent are admitted either the same day or on the following day. That is a major step forward since 2006. There have also been marked improvements in the speed of assessment by therapists after admission. All this is good.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09062549000312"></a>However, the headline of the sentinel audit is that a quarter of stroke patients are still not given the best treatment. It refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09062549000526"></a>&#147;unacceptable variations in the quality of care between hospitals with some parts of the country still failing to provide anything approaching an acceptable service&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1723"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1723</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09062549000492"></a>There is even a group of hospitals,</p>
<ul><a name="09062549000527"></a>&#147;that appear to have deteriorated - a few by very significant amounts&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062549000493"></a>I regard that as alarming.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09062549000313"></a>Professor Roger Boyle, national director for heart disease and stroke, the so-called tsar, has commented on the audit. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09062549000509"></a>&#147;The national stroke strategy is a ten-year plan, and there are no simplistic quick-fixes ... But, by making stroke a number one priority for the NHS, providing extra funding and establishing the Stroke Improvement Programme and local stroke networks, we are now firmly aiming at the revolution in stroke services&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062549000494"></a>I have great respect for Professor Boyle and admire his commitment. However, will the Minister confirm that the 10-year plan is on target, that the extra funding is in place and that it will remain undiminished with no delay or redesign, which is a familiar euphemism for setting something aside?</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09062549000314"></a>Within the national stroke strategy, there is yet another strategy, the stroke research network or SRN. The health department says that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09062549000510"></a>&#147;The SRN provides a world-class health infrastructure to support clinical stroke research and remove barriers to its conduct&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062549000495"></a>I should say that three years or so ago, I agreed to become a patient representative on the Thames Stroke Research Network and, later, played a very modest role in its launch in April 2007. I am concerned about the stroke networks and whether they have been established on time and are achieving their preliminary purpose. I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that that is the case and that the department intends to make them a permanent feature within the continuing national stroke strategy</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09062549000315"></a>I have said that strokes have been the poor relation&#151;if I may put it in an awkward way&#151;of other diseases. This has been reflected in inadequate research funding. According to a Written Answer in the House of Commons, the aggregated expenditure on stroke research in 2006-07 was &#163;9.87 million&#151;a tiny sum. I find the Answer confusing, because it adds that comparable information in respect of the department&#146;s centrally managed research programmes is not available. I ask the Minister why not, and, in particular, where can I find the costs of the Stroke Research Network?</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09062549000316"></a>I come briefly to the current outlook, taking into account the national financial and debt crisis and the prospects for public spending, especially on health and health research. In a long political life I have become familiar with such crises, to which I have been uncomfortably close. Ministers of the day have admitted the quantum of lower expenditure, but tried to hide the damage. They have concealed the consequences by discreetly scaling down plans, delaying capital investment and using expenditure figures in cash rather than real terms. They have talked about huge sums in unspecified efficiency savings, making everything stronger, leaner and fitter. However, I am afraid that much of what has been called painless has been cuts by stealth.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09062549000317"></a>Until a few weeks ago, there was a remarkable silence about public expenditure cuts beyond 2011. The King&#146;s Fund says that the NHS could face drastic cuts as the service moves from years of significant growth in its real terms funding to very low, zero or negative growth. Will the Minister say in plain terms whether the Government agree with the King&#146;s Fund

If the latter is the case, I am reasonably reassured about stroke research, such as it is. If not, I am deeply concerned.</p>

I begin my contribution to the debate on the future of the NHS by addressing my remarks to the opportunities presented by social enterprise for the future of health and, in particular, primary care.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09062549000319"></a>In recent months, many of us have listened with growing concern to the unfolding story of Baby Peter in Haringey&#151;one of the tragedies that point to the lack of joined-up working between health and social care services and to an insufficient focus on people. Despite years of talk about joined-up working and putting people first, this is still very patchy in practice. While we have moved some way down the road to co-locating services in primary care buildings and to recognising the role of social entrepreneurs in health, we still have a way to go in making greater use of community and integrated approaches to health and in using the talents and ingenuity of local people.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09062549000320"></a>I was interested to hear my noble friend Lord Laming, in a Radio 4 interview, describing how difficult it was for Ministers to get the words about joining up health and social care off the pages of glossy reports and into reality on the streets of our towns and cities before yet another crisis erupts on to our television screens. I suggest that putting people before structures is the only practical way of joining up services and implementing a truly integrated approach to primary healthcare in this country. We need to use the innovative skills of social entrepreneurs and organisations that have a proven track record and to back such people by giving them the resources and freedoms that they need to transform the health and well-being of the communities that they serve.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09062549000321"></a>Many of these people are doctors&#151;I have worked with some of them. Many others are individuals working in third sector organisations and leading teams of dedicated people committed to improving health and social care services in their local communities. These people seldom appear on the NHS radar and, even when they do, are rarely valued for the contribution that they make. The tragedy is that despite the years of commitment to new commissioning structures&#151;third sector compacts, social enterprise initiatives and the like&#151;there is still little widespread procurement of local holistic services from social enterprises or the third sector. The true meaning of &#147;third sector procurement&#148; seems to be in the name itself. Successful third sector organisations and social enterprises often feel that they are the third choice&#151;that the bits that the public sector might not want to deliver get passed down the line. Second in line is the private commercial sector and, finally, at the end of the queue, we have the third sector patiently waiting its turn for the crumbs from the table.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09062549000322"></a>The poor souls in the third sector are no third-rate choice. The third sector is like any other sector&#151;better in some places than others. Our approach to procuring health and social care services is ignoring some of the most talented and innovative individuals and organisations&#151;people who have been working tirelessly in their communities for far longer than the perennially reconstituted PCTs and health authorities.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09062549000323"></a>This is my experience over 25 years in Bromley-by-Bow in east London. Over the years, rhetoric around the holistic integrated model has never been matched by an integrated commissioning structure that delivers a Bromley-by-Bow-style approach to public service delivery, community regeneration and social enterprise.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09062549000324"></a>I am afraid that I see little room for optimism in the latest polyclinic initiatives. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, and his team have produced a programme for primary care that will produce wonderful new buildings and a new level of integration that has never been seen before. However, I have a profound problem with the scheme. At its heart it is still a biomedical model of healthcare that focuses on delivering clinical interventions for patients. Important as this is, it is only one dimension of a multidimensional problem. We are building not polyclinics but monoclinics.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09062549000325"></a>I am sure that the Department of Health recognises the multicausal nature of chronic ill health in our communities. However, after all these years of rhetoric, we still seem unable in this country to create commissioning structures that cut across the departmental silos of government and focus on the customer. Why should that be? In my view, there is a problem at the core of our understanding of integration. Many in the public sector still think that this is about only traditional bits of the public services working more closely together.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09062549000326"></a>We need holistic approaches to public service delivery that use social enterprises to deliver better services and better value for money across a range of measures. Where better to start this approach than in primary care? These solutions are particularly relevant today when the financing of the medical intervention model has been put under severe strain as a result of the financial crisis. However, I fear that despite the rhetoric the Government&#151;and perhaps a future Government&#151;still do not understand how practically to use entrepreneurs in the delivery of health services. I know that it works because in the past few years I have had the privilege of seeing and working with such entrepreneurial health organisations across the country. These organisations put people first because they understand and are part of their communities. They bring together health and social programmes. They are trusted, not because they engage in elaborate consultations but because they have a track record of delivering services that local people need.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09062549000327"></a>There is of course no shortage of action by the Government. A multiplicity of programmes for the provision of integrated health services by the public, private and social enterprise sectors has been initiated. My concern as I travel across the country is that these initiatives, while well intentioned, by and large do not rely on the ingenuity and talent of entrepreneurs and local people but continue to use the old bureaucratic and paper-based mechanisms. Bureaucracies like talking to bureaucracies and doing many of the same old

We are putting old men in new clothes. The rhetoric has changed but in practice it is still difficult for social enterprises to win APMS contracts to run GP surgeries, despite that being possibly the best way to spread entrepreneurial talent in the health sector, as my friend Dr Michael Dixon of the NHS Alliance has suggested.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09062549000328"></a>As I have listened to debates in your Lordships&#146; House in recent months, Ministers, including the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, have highlighted in public conferences the virtues of social enterprise. Yet in the health sector basic conversations are still not taking place. I have spent the past five months since the publication of our report on social enterprise and health&#151;here I must declare an interest&#151;attempting to bring Ministers to the same table as colleagues from NHS LIFT and the Big Lottery Fund in order to bring new joined-up investments to support an integrated approach to health.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09062549000329"></a>What the Government have done to date is commendable, but the NHS now needs to change its paradigm from the expensive clinical model to one based on networks and more modest-scale and sustainable initiatives that can be private, public or social enterprise&#151;it does not matter. What matters is that entrepreneurial leadership and organisational culture put people, not systems, first.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09062549000330"></a>If this Government&#151;or a future Government&#151;are serious about the future of the NHS and about social enterprise and community cohesion, I humbly suggest that a first step might be to do the following. First, they should ensure that their programmes are led by individuals with a strong track record of enterprise and appropriate risk-taking, as well as delivering innovation in mid-sized organisations. These should be people who understand the challenges of growth businesses; this is a job not for academic civil servants but for social entrepreneurs. Secondly, the Government must stop being fixated on new health initiatives and focus on making sure that the basic framework is in place to support communities in the delivery of their health services. Thirdly, they should move from a generalised support for social entrepreneurs to an informed support, which understands in detail how an entrepreneurial approach helps to deliver efficient services in the health sector. As always, the devil is in the practical details. Fourthly, they must start to assess health interventions not through reports and targets but through a focus on the health of patients and their care. Too often you get what you inspect and not what you expect. Fifthly, we need to ensure that all procurement opportunities by the Government are open to social enterprises and that procurement is not biased against small organisations. This applies very clearly to the procurement for GP surgeries under the APMS arrangement. Finally, we need to ensure that different interventions by the Government and actors talk to each other. This is not happening at a very basic level across the country. This is the road to enterprising healthcare and social cohesion.</p>

If anyone needed convincing, they had only to listen to the debate introduced earlier today by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, to realise the enormous personal and economic costs of dementia and Alzheimer&#146;s disease and the potential benefits that could accrue from successful research in that area. I make no excuse for focusing heavily on research, to which this Government have shown a clear commitment. They have put more into general and medical research in particular than ever before. The Prime Minister has reiterated his strong support in giving research high priority, as have my noble friends Lord Darzi and Lord Drayson on our Front Bench.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09062549000332"></a>I focus my remarks on two topics that are seen to be major inhibitors of research in the UK. First, there are the difficulties posed by the multitude of regulatory bodies that have to be satisfied before research can go ahead. Secondly, there are the hurdles that have to be jumped before research can be done not on the patients themselves but on information and data about them.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09062549000333"></a>I return to the subject of regulation. Despite valiant attempts at bureaucracy-busting by many, including my noble friend Lord Warner when he was the Minister, researchers are still faced with a rising tide of form-filling required by innumerable bodies that seem to take for ever to respond. A recently appointed lecturer, funded by the new and welcome investment from government and charities, will often spend the whole of his or her first 12 months waiting for approval to do the research that they were appointed to do. What a terrible waste of time and money. The pharmaceutical industry is also looking to other countries in which to do its research because of the long delay before it can get approval here.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09062549000334"></a>No one denies the need for careful and thorough regulation of research on patients&#151;certainly not the researchers themselves. They gain funding through a rigorous peer review, against considerable competition. They have to gain the approval of the Research Ethics Committee, which is entirely appropriate and necessary. Yet sometimes they have to go through several ethics committees if patients come from different trust areas. We can run into problems where different ethics committees come to different conclusions on whether they should approve the same research. There is a bit of a postcode lottery.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09062549000335"></a>Yet it is the multitude of other bodies that need satisfying where the main difficulties arise. We have the local trust R&amp;D committee, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the Human Tissue Authority&#151;where tissues are to be used&#151;and several other bodies depending on what type of research is proposed. All require their own forms to be filled in, which are often long&#151;up to 80 pages for some&#151;and they all have different timeframes and dates at which they will consider submissions.</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09062549000336"></a>Paul Stewart, a distinguished researcher in Birmingham, writes that the current bureaucracy placed on investigators,</p>
<ul><a name="09062549000528"></a>&#147;is poorly coordinated, lacks consistency at all levels, and at times is completely illogical&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1728"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1728</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09062549000496"></a>This is no way for the UK to keep up with the competition. Our patients, the ultimate beneficiaries, deserve better. I am afraid that I have asked this before, but will the Minister have another go at bureaucracy-busting and rationalise the number of different bodies involved in this confusing array of regulators?</p>

<a name="90625-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09062549000337"></a>Secondly, there is the need to do research not directly on patients themselves but on information or data that already exist about them in the NHS. The NHS is an enormously valuable repository of information about patients, their diagnoses, treatments, cure rates, causes of death and so on. It is the envy of the world in the completeness of its information about the whole population. It provides an extremely fertile resource for research. The problem lies in trying to balance the need to carry out that research with preserving patients&#146; confidentiality and trust. Questions of data protection and definitions of what constitutes informed consent or anonymisation&#151;a horrible word&#151;remain difficult to resolve.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90625-0010.htm"/>


<a name="90625-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09062549000338"></a>There is usually little problem where patients can give their consent and understand the nature of the research, the consent of an ethics committee has been obtained and there is the knowledge that those conducting the research have a professional responsibility to maintain confidentiality. Yet there are many situations where research is needed on stored data where patients are no longer accessible. They may have moved, died or be otherwise untraceable&#151;a seeming Catch-22 situation. Similarly, where a researcher is gathering data from large populations with whom he or she has no direct contact, he has to rely on others to seek their consent even to be approached to obtain consent.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09062549000339"></a>There are ways through this difficulty. One that I hope can be actively pursued is that proposed in the Walport-Thomas data-sharing review of last year, which involves the depositing of patients&#146; data in a databank under the control of a regulated controller. He or she may then agree access to elements of the data to bona fide researchers who have an ethically approved and rigorously reviewed research project. This would have to be entirely dependent on the patients&#146; approval to place their data in such a bank. For that to happen, the NHS needs to inform patients so that they are aware not only of the uses to which information about them may be put and are comfortable with that but also of the value of the research to them and to future generations. These are the bones of a system which could work and which I believe Dame Sally Davies, director of NIHR, and Harry Cayton, director of the National Information Governance Board, are striving to achieve. I am not sure how much of a push they need to achieve it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09062549000340"></a>Earlier this week I was at a meeting of the organisation DIPEx, a charity of which I am a trustee and which funds the website healthtalkonline. It is a wonderful organisation that takes interviews with real patients in which they describe their illnesses&#151;breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and so on. It has gathered about 50 of those interviews online for patients to gain an inside picture of what it is like to have their illness from others suffering from the same thing. The website gets lots of hits every week. The interviews are enormously valuable, too, for medical students in training. I mention

I hope that, in the PR exercise that the NHS should engage in about the importance of research and the need to use patients&#146; data, the department will make use of this resource and information to help to get its message across.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09062549000345"></a>The second is paragraph 30, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09062549000512"></a>&#147;We will empower clinicians further to provide more integrated services for patients by piloting new integrated care organisations (ICOs) bringing together health and social care professionals from a range of organisations &#151; community services, hospitals, local authorities and others, depending on local needs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062549000497"></a>The third, paragraph 31, headed, <I>Fostering leadership for quality</I>, begins:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09062549000513"></a>&#147;Greater freedom, enhanced accountability and empowering staff ... making change actually happen takes leadership&#148;.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09062549000346"></a>The patient pathways have been welcomed, but many gaps remain on the patient journey, as both the noble Lords, Lord Woolmer and Lord Rodgers, mentioned. Paragraphs 24 to 25 indicate that the measurement of quality care is not limited to the acute sector alone. Therefore, during 2009, a quality framework to develop services will also be completed, with a standard but flexible contract to enable commissioners to hold community health services to account for quality health improvement. That will take account of local populations, including the most vulnerable or excluded people with complex needs. It will be managed by the strategic health authorities and include annual associated health outcomes, competencies and governance. PCTs will have started to implement the system in March 2009, and first results will be formally published in March 2010.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09062549000347"></a>These are admirable targets, but we know that patient pathways are not entirely NHS managed. Immediate families, carers and other statutory or third-sector agencies need to be involved, as was clearly set out by my noble friend Lord Mawson. This requires empowering NHS staff and can best be described as &#147;learning and doing&#148;. There is a need to restore passion combined with experience to ensure that holistic, high-quality care is delivered against the important backcloth of theory, statistics and policies arrived at from evidence-based practice, but always taking account of the prevailing needs of the individual and immediate family or carers and local community environment. Will the Minister indicate the progress being made in implementing the integrated care organisations, illustrating that patient pathways are not limited in access and that integrated services are the overall aim?</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09062549000348"></a>That brings us to the requirement for leadership skills to ensure that these implementations can successfully take place. Leadership is central to ensuring the delivery of high-quality care. In the words of the report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09062549000514"></a>&#147;Leadership has been a neglected element of the reforms of recent years&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062549000498"></a>It is acknowledged that there are many routes to effective leadership, but what is required here is for people to hold meaningful conversations that transcend organisational boundaries. The core elements of any approach to leadership towards change in the NHS are, first, vision; identifying what improvements need to be made. Secondly, method; how will they make the change happen? Thirdly, expectations; what difference will the necessary behavioural change make to people?</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09062549000349"></a>I too listened to the radio report by my noble friend Lord Laming following the Baby P case and I summarise his words. It seems to be generally agreed that the current policies, legislation and practice guidance is fundamentally sound. The problem is the gap between the written word and the day-to-day activity at the front door of each of the key services. The challenge is to get the written word off the page and into the bloodstream of each of the services. Failure to do so has resulted in a marked reduction in the confidence and willingness of health visitors, paediatricians, GPs and accident and emergency departments, as well as the other front-line services, to become involved in the safeguarding of children. The gap between theory and practice is great; similarly the gap between the claims of senior managers and the experience of front-line staff is too great. Yet the vulnerable depend, not on brave words, but on practice skills. Now is the time to address both the competence and confidence of front-line staff and to ensure that the performance of senior managers is judged against the quality of services delivered. The focus must be on better outcomes for service users. That being so, there must now be a major review of the quality and content of training. I suspect that many trainers are more comfortable debating different theories rather than focusing on practice skills. Now is the time to ensure that in future courses should be assessed on their ability to promote the highest standards of good practice.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09062549000350"></a>I can identify with this very erudite statement, having had, during my career, experience in teaching a course correlating theory and practice and as a manager leading the closure programme of two large mental

Leadership skills were needed to cross the boundaries between the NHS and social services in an unprecedented way during that 10-year programme, which involved patients, families, communities, housing associations, and third-sector organisations. However, that was 20 years ago and there are still lessons to be learnt. Not all barriers have been eradicated and gaps do still exist in many places, but in others, high-quality services are in place or are being developed. I declare an interest in that I am one of the 20 commissioners appointed to the Prime Minister&#146;s Commission on the Future of Nursing and Midwifery. Within the terms of reference, there is an opportunity to progress the work already in hand following the recommendations of the <I>High Quality Care for All</I> report, but also to explore and recommend innovative ways of closing the gaps in patient pathways and overcoming the boundaries that prevent the holistic, seamless care that we all know is necessary in order to deliver world-class quality care to the communities we serve. These communities differ according to their locations and range of populations, but the three key requirements I began with are fundamental&#151;transparency not limited to the acute sector; empowerment of staff through appropriate education, training and support; and leadership of front-line services by accountable boards, able to cross boundaries and not confined in silos.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09062549000351"></a>I hope that the commission will be able to make recommendations that allow for innovation and for the entrepreneurial skills so eloquently demonstrated as necessary by my noble friend Lord Mawson. These issues need to be addressed, so that patient pathways can be complete and holistic care of high quality received by patients and families.</p>

I intend to follow up on one of his chosen themes of social cohesion and focus on that factor.

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09062549000353"></a>At a time when it is commonplace to read in the media about former terrorists travelling the world and giving advice about conflict resolution to other countries, and to see them receiving much applause for so doing, it is an appropriate moment in this House&#151;it is thanks to my noble friend Lord Walton that we have this chance&#151;to talk about some of the real heroes of the Troubles. In Northern Ireland, more than 3,500 people out of a small population of 1.5 million were murdered through political violence. Tens of thousands more were mutilated and suffered the most horrible injuries. That placed an extraordinary burden on the NHS over a 30-year period, a burden it met in an absolutely remarkable way.</p>

I think it is important to acknowledge the role that the health service played.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09062549000355"></a>Let me begin by presenting a general picture: doctors experienced serious difficulties going about even daily work; regular bomb hoaxes led to massive traffic jams in which nurses and doctors would be stuck in frustrating positions, trying to reach their hospital or their place of work. That was almost the easiest part of the Troubles. Illegal checkpoints at certain points during an occasion such as the UWC strike in 1974 led to health officials negotiating with strikers to get permits so that doctors and nurses could be let through. It may have been a necessary and, indeed, a pragmatic adjustment, but it was undoubtedly felt by doctors and nurses to be humiliating.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09062549000356"></a>Things became even nastier. Staff were murdered at the Royal Victoria Hospital site, which also witnessed a gunfight in the main corridor. Musgrave Park Hospital was bombed. Three hospitals in Belfast&#151;the City, the Mater and the Royal Victoria&#151;suffered the ultimate insult of having patients shot in their beds.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09062549000357"></a>During the hunger strike movement of 1980-81, again the medical profession was thrust into the forefront of the crisis and emerged with its status and professionalism enhanced. Throughout the entire time of the hunger strikes, it acted under previously agreed protocols but at the price of stepping back from the requirement to save life. So it was not a moment without ambiguity.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09062549000358"></a>From the standpoint of medicine, novel forms of injury arising from the Troubles presented themselves. Expertise in the treating of gunshot and bomb wounds emerged, and a new expertise was gained in running a hospital under the pressure of an influx of the severely wounded and dying. This was learnt the hard way&#151;almost an anodyne phrase. One nurse interviewed about this recently said that when the casualties came in from the Abercorn bombing, she felt that she was actually at the gates of hell.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09062549000359"></a>One doctor quoted in <I>Candles in the Dark</I>, the forthcoming Nuffield Trust study of the impact of the Troubles on the NHS, said something which summarises the ethos of the NHS during this period:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09062549000515"></a>&#147;I don&#146;t remember very much about ethics training but I do remember a very strong informal ethos which was that we were doctors, we were Health Service and we would treat everyone with respect&#151;regardless of who, why, where, their involvement, non-involvement and what part of the community they came from&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062549000499"></a>This quotation expresses a profound truth and in its way is the best possible tribute to the work of the NHS during the Troubles. It is a tribute which should also embrace those pharmacists who kept open their dispensaries when riots were going on nearby and often under very difficult circumstances.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09062549000360"></a>Having said that, I do not wish to end by giving a purely panglossian picture of the NHS and how it works in Northern Ireland. In his very fine book, <I>Minority Verdict,</I> published in 1995, Maurice Hayes, a distinguished Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland, and a most eloquent defender of the core principles of the NHS, none the less admits that it was hard to defend, for example, a level of prescribing in Northern  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1733"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1733</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ireland which was 25 per cent to 30 per cent above the UK average. It reminds us also of another unsung hero of the Troubles, the unknown British taxpayer. Dr Hayes adds in his fine book:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09062549000516"></a>&#147;A more basic question was whether the NHS was adequately funded and properly managed. The answer on both counts is, I think, no&#148;.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09062549000361"></a>Dr Hayes&#146; book was published 14 years ago. At that time, NHS expenditure was 5.6 per cent of GDP. Since then, expenditure has risen markedly, but there is still, in certain quarters, and for reasons already listed by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and other speakers, disappointment with certain outcomes; certain key issues which have to be resolved. That is the core subject of our debate&#151;whether we are talking about Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09062549000363"></a>Will the NHS be an engine of lobbying within government to achieve certain objectives in other departments? The noble Baroness will not be terribly surprised that I am talking primarily about encouraging greater physical activity and exercise&#151;an issue which has lately received a greater degree of push primarily because of the Olympics, which have upped awareness not only of sport generally but of healthier lifestyles. There have also been revelations about this becoming an increasingly obese society.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09062549000364"></a>There are many things you can do, but much of what we hear about from the Department of Health and the NHS is about dealing with those who are already morbidly obese. What we do not hear as much about, and very little until very recently, is how we can stop people getting obese. One of the most important things we can do is to get the NHS to lobby to make sure that it is easier to take exercise.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09062549000365"></a>Much can be said about food and overeating. Eating for many of us is at least partly a leisure activity&#151;something that is pleasant. Very few of us eat purely for fuel. Eating is something we do when we are sitting down. It is something to do with our hands when we are watching television&#151;probably the great driver of obesity is watching television and snacking. If we encourage people to take physical activity and exercise in other ways, they will probably not spend as much time sitting down, doing nothing and snacking, and they will be burning off calories.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09062549000366"></a>Your body is designed to be used. It is designed to have a degree of physical activity to function properly. We also get obsessed with the idea of weight. I will not give the House another diatribe on how useless I think the body mass index is as a description of health. When Steve Redgrave won his last Olympic medal, he was not obese; he was merely very heavily overweight, according to the index. It does not refer to the fact that

You can carry a lot of fat and it weighs less than a smaller amount of muscle. In fact, you can get much fitter and gain weight in many cases.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09062549000367"></a>Will the NHS have some form of input into the rest of government, including local government, to make sure that it is easier to take exercise, so that exercise can be a fun activity? Will it use its huge political power to make sure that it does this job? You cannot cut the NHS, or say that you will cut it, without paying a price in the press. If it were, for example, to ask other parts of government, including local government, for the provision of parks that were pleasant to walk in and that children could play sports in, with properly maintained swings and playgrounds, that would do more to move the rest of government than would action by almost any other department. It could put pressure on the rest of government to ensure that we deliver something beneficial to health.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09062549000368"></a>Physical activity was recently described to me as a wonder drug&#151;it prevents the problems of being overweight and can act as a cure. However, not everyone wants to give up a huge chunk of their life to play sport&#151;I did not for many years; that is the fact of the matter. If you do not have what is effectively an addiction to give up one day a week for eight months of the year to play a sport, and a number of other days for training, you will not get a buzz from it and you will not do it. But if it is light exercise and a pleasant activity, people will do it. We can encourage them to walk dogs and go out for a walk themselves. A journey by foot that you would have had to make anyway can be a pleasant way to exercise.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09062549000369"></a>We could get away from the need for such measures by getting rid of half the technology in our lives, but we are not in a hurry to do that. How can we make sure that the NHS drives this on? It could save considerable sums by getting involved in some of the acute problems for which there is no easy preventive solution. How can this investment be used? What thinking is going on? How does the NHS see its involvement in pressuring the rest of government to achieve this? That is the question that we should be asking today. If we do not have an answer, it is probably because the NHS has been warned off. The Department of Health has warned it off. Unless the NHS is prepared to interfere and make itself thoroughly unpopular with one or two people by changing their plans, it will not happen. Achieving consensus is all very well, but occasionally you have to make one or two enemies to make one or two friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09062549000371"></a>Since 1991, the NHS has had real expenditure growth averaging 5.5 per cent a year. That growth has been even higher under this Government. Never in its history has the NHS had such a sustained improvement in its resources and we have of course, as a number of noble Lords mentioned today, seen many improvements. However, now it faces a period of considerable retrenchment. How it conducts itself as a &#163;110 billion a year business over the next year or so will influence significantly the available resources for research, translating research into clinical services and even medical education itself.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09062549000372"></a>I do not intend today to get into a debate over which party will best protect public services, other than to say that being straight with the public is likely to pay better political dividends. I will take as my starting point, however, a quotation from the recent annual report for 2008-09 by the NHS chief executive, David Nicholson. I commend the report to the House. On page 47 of the report, Mr Nicholson says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09062549000517"></a>&#147;We should also plan on the assumption that we will need to release unprecedented levels of efficiency savings between 2011 and 2014&#151;between &#163;15 billion and &#163;20 billion across the service over the three years&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062549000500"></a>I have a question for the Minister and, indeed, for the opposition Front Benches. Do they and their colleagues agree with the chief executive&#146;s assessment of the scale of NHS retrenchment likely to be needed between 2011 and 2014? I suspect many people in the NHS would like to know where the political parties stand on that particular issue.</p>

<a name="90625-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09062549000373"></a>One of the best predictors of future behaviour is past behaviour. Applying this principle to NHS productivity and efficiency is not, however, reassuring, as the Office for National Statistics has shown. Despite NHS revenue nearly doubling in the past decade, and an investment of nearly &#163;30 billion in capital assets, ONS data show NHS productivity falling consistently from 1995 to 2004. Only in 2005 and 2006 did it rise, a period when Patricia Hewitt and I were winning friends and influence in the NHS and getting into a considerable amount of trouble for energetically pursuing NHS reform and control over NHS finances and pay deals. After this period of challenging vested interests the NHS appears to have reverted to its old ways of falling productivity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09062549000374"></a>We are approaching a difficult time for public expenditure for whoever is in Government, with high expenditure on debt interest, falling tax revenues and higher recession-driven transfer payments. Now is the time for the critical friends of the NHS to push for a bit action on its flabbier parts, a kind of anti-obesity campaign with the NHS management of services. I start with another item from Mr Nicholson&#146;s annual report on page 40. He says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09062549000518"></a>&#147;While the NHS has had a good year, can we say we have done our best when 25 per cent of patients in hospital beds don&#146;t need to be there and could be looked after by NHS staff at home?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="09062549000375"></a>It seemed to me, when I read it, a rather good question to which we need some answers before pouring too much extra cash into the NHS coffers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09062549000376"></a>Let me offer a few suggestions in my final remarks. The key to driving productivity and efficiency is for a huge improvement in the quality of commissioning by concentrating the activities in a much smaller number  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1736"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1736</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of larger, more competent, bodies. It would also help to streamline the processes for changing unsustainable, often unnecessary, and sometimes downright dangerous, local hospital services. Simply buying more of the 35 per cent of spend that currently goes on fixed-price tariff items in local hospitals keeps services in those hospitals unnecessarily and will not remove unnecessary beds.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09062549000377"></a>We have to drive the provision of healthcare outside acute hospital beds, more in line, I suggest, with the rather neglected 2006 White Paper, <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our S</I><I>ay</I>, which was based on a massive consultation with the public. Consolidation of specialist acute services, especially with the final stage of the European working time directive, which has already been referred to, is essential if we are to make services safe and effective for patients. I notice that my noble friend Lady Wall will be speaking. We need look no further than north London to see a large area with too many hospital services on too many sites consuming NHS resources that should be used for other health purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09062549000378"></a>I share the views of the Health Select Committee&#146;s strong reservations about primary care trust commissioners. I remain unconvinced by the Government&#146;s response to that report on this issue. It is not possible, or even, I would suggest, worth the effort, to try to produce 150 world-class commissioning PCTs. We simply will not get to the end of that journey.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09062549000379"></a>To reduce our dependence on inappropriate hospital services, we have to improve significantly primary care and community services. From some of the work I initiated in London, I suggest a hefty dose of performance management and market testing on primary care trust community services. It could produce something in excess of a 25 per cent efficiency gain over time. The management of these services needs to be scaled up and improved, integrated better with GPs, social care and other services&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, said&#151;and far more effectively managed. I suggest that that could be done by using greater competition and new entrants to local markets. Personally, I do not care whether those new entrants come from the public sector, the private sector or from social entrepreneurs. I strongly suggest that the public do not care that much, either.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09062549000380"></a>This approach is more likely to deliver the kinds of changes that the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, and others are looking for. I could mention other cases&#151;pathology services come to mind, as do the management of estates, facilities and buildings in the NHS. The NHS has a footprint that is too big for the services it needs to provide. All these areas need to be looked at.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09062549000381"></a>I end on this note. If we do not start to tackle these issues more energetically, as the NHS chief executive seems to be suggesting, it will be difficult to strengthen those areas that we probably all know need to be strengthened, such as the new dementia strategy, end-of-life care and adult social care. They have not had anything like the generosity of funding that exists in the NHS. All these Cinderella areas will be neglected if we do not tackle the issue of resources going unnecessarily into the acute hospital sector. I wish to finish with a quote from President Obama&#146;s Chief of Staff. He said,</p>
<ul><a name="09062549000519"></a>&#147;it would be a shame to waste a good crisis&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09062549000383"></a>Good quality of care, the correct diagnosis and safety at all times while in hospital are what all patients desire, and they need the same quality when they rely on their care being given in the community. First-class medical training is vital, and with many complicated conditions specialised training is essential. When the specialised units are linked with universities, this enables research to expand. There should be good communication and co-operation between the universities and hospitals.</p>

He did not have enough time and freedom in the UK to do his clinical research for improving patient treatment. He is a microbiologist and is now working in Australia. He has undertaken interesting research and enjoys life. It is so important that we do not lose too many of our dedicated clinical researchers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09062549000385"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and I opposed the closure of community health councils. The Government, instead of building on them, set up the health forums in their place as a patient voice and support, only to close them down after two years. The Government then set up LINks, and this is the current situation. I quote from what they have said to me in an e-mail:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09062549000520"></a>&#147;Many of us have made supreme efforts to make the new LINks model work. LINks are now 14 months old and many have managed little at all of active oversight of health and social care. They have become bogged down in processes rather than outcomes and the so-called support from the Government has been passed from pillar to post, adding to the confusion and demoralisation. Events at Stafford have since come to light and there is real concern that other Staffords out there will go unnoticed in the current situation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09062549000386"></a>Senior doctors who speak out against dangerous practices are being frustrated, or even bullied into silence, according to new research by the British Medical Association. Doctors and nurses claim that the current law is inadequate, and that whistleblowers need much greater legal protection if they are to prevent another patient safety disaster. An NHS trust has been accused of victimising an eminent paediatrician, who claimed that a baby&#146;s death and at least 28 botched operations on children were caused by unskilled doctors. The consultant&#146;s concerns were ignored by hospital chiefs&#151;who then suspended him, saying they were concerned about the state of his mental health. However, his colleagues at the University Hospital in North Staffordshire say that the surgeon&#151;a former adviser to the Healthcare Commission&#151;was suspended for blowing the whistle over children&#146;s safety. There must be better protection for patients, and for these people, who try to protect them from unsafe practices. I

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09062549000387"></a>I must mention a very serious problem, which is the increase in the number of antibiotics becoming resistant to infections. There is an urgent need for new antibiotics&#151;we have become reliant on them, and we do not want the infections to win. There is a desperate need for research and development on new antibiotics, which the Government may have to take the lead on. Could there be legislation to encourage investment for the pharmaceutical industry? This is beginning to happen in the USA&#151;could the Government set up a working group to help this to happen here? It will be a disaster for future generations if they are without antibiotics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09062549000388"></a>A strong message came out of a seminar on diabetes that I attended last Thursday, with many experts present&#151;that specialist nurses are an essential part of the best treatment and follow-up for patients with diabetes. One consultant from Ipswich had lost his specialist nurse, to his and his patients&#146; dismay. Specialist nurses are also as valuable a part of a team for treatment of stroke patients, as are physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Also the specialist nurses are so important for patients with epilepsy, dermatological problems, Parkinson&#146;s disease, cancers and many more. They are an investment&#151;not only do they support patients in hospital and the community, they teach other nurses and junior doctors, who so often do not understand the treatments of such patients.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09062549000389"></a>Dehydration in ill and elderly patients is putting them at risk when they come into hospital, and so often one hears of neglect of these vulnerable patients. If one watches hospitals at five o&#146;clock on a Friday evening, one will see staff pouring out of the doors. Over the weekends, patients are left with only essential staff, and little goes on. If only hospitals could keep fully working for seven days a week, so much more could be achieved, and patients would not be put at risk by getting dehydrated, if they cannot drink unaided. This can also be a problem in care homes, when residents are fearful they will be scolded by staff if they drink and then have to go to the lavatory. So they restrict their fluid intake, making them dehydrated, and that makes them confused and unwell. This area needs more research and guidelines. Perhaps this is something that CQC members could check in both hospitals and care homes so that patients and residents are kept contented and safe.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1739"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1739</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09062549000392"></a>The NHS is a huge organisation with many facets and it is charged with maintaining the health of the nation&#151;a huge responsibility. It is an organisation that is continually changing and adapting to new challenges. These range from new exciting treatments to the way in which healthcare is delivered, ensuring that the focus is on the patient, as referred to by my noble friend Lord Woolmer. Innovations such as same-day or short-stay surgery, minimally invasive surgery and major developments in the treatment of cancer have all come from the service&#146;s ability to learn from research and experience and from feedback from the patients and their families and our staff.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09062549000393"></a>My trust is a partner member of the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement and is actively engaging that organisation in a range of development initiatives aimed at improving patient care, such as the Productive Ward programme, Lean thinking, No Delays Achiever, patient safety and the Delivering Quality and Value strategy&#151;all things that I think we would applaud.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09062549000394"></a>An acute trust such as Barnet and Chase Farm has a major responsibility for providing safe and timely care to our patients. This is rigorously monitored to maximise the efficiency of the organisation in terms of access by patients into the system and I am pleased to say that the patient experience and the quality of care are increasingly being monitored. I say that I am pleased because that is exactly why we are there. The whole range of clinical governance tools are employed to do this, but listening to what patients and their families tell us is crucial to the ability of the organisation to learn from this experience.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09062549000395"></a>The national patient survey feeds us with important information on how our service is viewed by patients. Their views may be very subjective, but we have to remember that their perception of the service is vital to our understanding and our ability to make changes to improve their experience. This, of course, may be in the form of a complaint, to which our organisation pays utmost attention&#151;it views the whole process as a learning experience. Much work goes into training our staff in the handling of criticism and using that knowledge to improve our service.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09062549000396"></a>In my view, one of the health service&#146;s huge strengths is its total commitment to training and education. The term &#147;lifelong learning&#148; is embraced within the service for all grades of staff in both clinical and non-clinical areas. Through the process of appraisal, the potential of our workforce is identified and nurtured to the benefit of the service and of those who receive our services. There is a well used phrase&#151;that our staff are our most important asset&#151;and we should not dismiss that easily.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09062549000397"></a>It also has to be remembered that the service trains the vast majority of staff who go on to work in the private sector and in many other settings both at home and abroad. It should be recognised that training goes on in virtually all healthcare settings and not just in teaching hospitals, although sometimes general hospitals worry that that may be the message that goes out. The challenge and debate that that brings to individual departments are very healthy in that they introduce innovation and change to enable the service to be fit for purpose. Training also develops the trainers in

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09062549000398"></a>Research and development has a key role in the service. Since the early 1990s, money has been identified within the NHS budget to foster and promote research. The Culyer report in 1994, to which the noble Lord, Lord Walton, referred, paved the way for research to become embedded in most NHS trusts, including my own, which is a necessary tool for the service to develop.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09062549000399"></a>The nature of research in our organisation spans all disciplines, with some focusing directly and immediately on the delivery of healthcare. This system has recently been superseded by a network system of research-active organisations. They will promote the links between primary and secondary healthcare, along with academic institutions.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09062549000400"></a>My trust plays an active part in our local network; indeed, it receives an income in recognition of the research activity undertaken, which helps to support the process and develop the culture of research. As I said when referring to education, research raises the quality of an organisation, enabling a culture that embraces change and innovation, which can only benefit the future of healthcare.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09062549000401"></a>My noble friend Lord Warner will not necessarily agree with this, but the local hospital is an essential component of the local community. In my area of north London, which is populated by many cultures, religions and economic groups, it plays an important role. The equitable access to our service for all has a large influence on communities living together. We must now work hard to ensure that the services that patients need are the services that they get. We will continue working with local clinicians, residents, our patients and other partners to ensure that all improvements to local healthcare are sustainable, delivered smoothly and effectively and in the best interests of all patients.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09062549000402"></a>In conclusion, the NHS is an overarching organisation that continually learns from its experience and its research to deliver the safe and appropriate care for which it was created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09062549000404"></a>Over the past year or thereabouts, I have had the privilege to chair an independent review of autism services for the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. My review team found that, despite a wealth of knowledge acquired, mainly by and through the voluntary sector organisations that have done some wonderful work over the past 20 years, throughout the entire period of direct rule in Northern Ireland there had been virtually no co-ordination, no command and control hierarchy and no structured pathway for autism. I believe that this deficit is overall of national proportions and I shall concentrate on this issue.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1741"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1741</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09062549000405"></a>It appeared to me that the Hall and Elliman report, specifically the one known as the &#147;Hall 4&#148; report, in its conclusion that there was no foolproof method of screening for autism, was able to allow off the hook those who direct within the health service. Well, things have moved on. The team of professionals that I chaired has concluded that effective assessments of developmental progress are possible from around two years of age. That means in effect that, from January 2010 in Northern Ireland, 22,000 children aged two to three years will be screened each year.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09062549000406"></a>One may ask whether that will be a massive and costly exercise, but that will not be the case. We already have in place&#151;I assume that it is the same in Great Britain&#151;a health visitor system, which over the past 60 years has successfully and willingly adapted to changing demands. It is eager to adapt and embrace up-training with regard to early identification of autism tendencies, which will be achieved at acceptable cost with the voluntary sector and departmental agencies working in partnership. Much of this is about efficiency gains.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09062549000407"></a>In line with an expectation that roughly 1 per cent of the population is on the autism spectrum, we have calculated that 3 to 4 per cent of two years-olds will be queried, some 750 children per year in Northern Ireland. By assessing on the basis of population and with simple primary school maths, it will surely not be difficult to plan&#151;largely, if not entirely, on the basis of the existing consultant provision&#151;what is required to provide immediate early assessment and diagnosis. Each healthcare trust will know exactly what to expect and consultants can plan ahead, up-training themselves where necessary. They will refine the initial 750 children identified down to 1 per cent, which will probably be 200 to 250 children each year, who will from that early age be able to benefit from early interventions.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09062549000408"></a>I come back to costs for a moment. We will be using almost the same professional practitioners, but in a way that is planned and structured better. Extra costs will occur but mainly in up-training, and those updated skills can be built into training programmes for those planning to enter the medical and associated professions.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09062549000409"></a>Of course, that cannot be the simple end to my thesis. Children with autism spectrum disorder have to face transition to primary school and to secondary school and then they have to adapt to adolescence and so on. But is it not better to begin to learn to cope in the vital learning years between two and eight than for us to find a confused eight year-old with behavioural problems falling behind his peers and unable to adapt?</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09062549000410"></a>Here is the opportunity for progress, but it is not the end of the story. That is a matter for further adaptation and joined-up government. The Department of Health can break down the front door but every other department has to smooth the path that lies ahead: teacher training, police training, the Prison Service, sports clubs, the workplace and so on. I believe that each stage can be dealt with as effectively as we plan in Northern Ireland for the two to eight year-old phase. We do not have to reinvent the wheel; we do not have to tear down and replace existing administrative structures. We have to adapt to a reality

It was simply not good enough to have an Answer that implied, &#147;Prisons and autism we don&#146;t do; we don&#146;t provide; we don&#146;t really want to go there&#148;.

I am sure that the House appreciated it. It was ably backed by the personal story in the speech of my noble friend Lord Rodgers. I thank my noble friend Lord Addington for reminding us that we should be thinking about a national health service. He reminded us that prevention is better than cure. I would add that my noble friend is not overweight; it is all muscle.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09062549000413"></a>The National Health Service today is a strange organisation. It is neither totally planned from above, nor does it free its patients to obtain treatment and care from any health facility, public or private, that they wish. It is something of a muddle and rather confusing. It is leading to a lot of fragmentation and confusion. I shall illustrate the law of unintended consequences in some of the things that are happening in the health service, especially in medical education and research. Teaching and research used to be done primarily by the academic workforce in medical schools, medical faculties and the teaching hospitals, often in collaboration with doctors and physiologists in the non-teaching hospitals and using all the extra clinical material in those places. However, between 2000 and 2007, there was a fall of 27 per cent in the medical academic workforce. There are now only 2,937 academics working in our hospitals, medical schools and universities. Despite that, there has been a huge increase in the number of undergraduates: a 50 per cent increase in the number of medical students in the past 10 years, which is hugely welcome. The student population is currently 30,000, excluding all the postgraduate students, but that means that there is only one medical academic working in this country per 100 undergraduate students.</p>

<a name="90625-0011.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09062549000414"></a>As a result of the decline in academic staff, there is more pressure on clinical staff in hospitals to teach and do research, but managers of those hospitals are often interested only in data collection, patient throughputs, targets and waiting lists. Teaching and research are very low on their radar screens and we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that PCT commissioning is questionable at times and does not always consider research and education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09062549000415"></a>We also need to look at a few other reasons for the demise of medical academics. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, mentioned bureaucracy. One would expect a Government that managed to deregulate the City in such a dramatic and fantastic way to be able to do something about deregulating medical research. We must remember that there is not pay parity between clinical and academic staff. Newly qualified doctors have huge debts. Medical students have a longer training and it is full time, so they cannot take part-time jobs to help pay their fees and debts when they qualify, so they are more likely to want to go into medical and clinical training and get on the ladder quickly to earn a decent salary as clinical staff than to spend time doing academic work or research.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09062549000416"></a>I raise the question also of women in medicine. I am delighted that most medical schools now take in more women students than men. This is excellent news for women, who are eminently suited to a medical career. However, they, too, may be in a hurry to get their higher qualifications. They may want to earn money not only to pay off their debts, but also perhaps to pay for childcare in future; so they may reject medical research and get on with clinical work to earn a higher salary. Is the NHS doing any research to analyse the hopes and aspirations of the women doctors who are qualifying and are their circumstances being taken into consideration for properly planning the workforce in future?</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09062549000417"></a>Another factor is the private finance initiatives. Polyclinics and new health centres were mentioned by one noble Lord. The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, mentioned the integration of social care&#151;how I wish that we could have integrated health and social care. Polyclinics would be an ideal place. However, no private developer will want to waste money on facilities for teaching and research. He will want a return on his money, and it will be much more difficult to make a profit if there is social care as well as teaching and research going on in an establishment.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09062549000418"></a>I read something interesting about contracts with the private sector and commissions for routine surgery that are often taken out by PCTs. I read about a gastroenterologist who had his entire endoscopy list taken away from him without being consulted by his managers. The endoscopies were to be done by a private hospital, away from the main hospital. Most of his research and teaching of students was based on how endoscopies should be done and what he was discovering. When that sort of thing happens, it is crazy and counterproductive.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09062549000419"></a>In conclusion, in the past 10 years the National Health Service has improved beyond recognition. Many new facilities have been built and a great deal more equipment supplied, along with more doctors and nurses&#151;I do not have to recite the Government mantra for them. Everything has improved hugely. We know that quality is an issue, but the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, is addressing that. Surely the challenge now is to make sure that medical education and research go on being the best in the world, as they have always been. They must not fall behind because we are concentrating on profitability, efficiency and patient throughput. We must remain the best in the world for medical research and education.</p>

<a name="09062549000420"></a><b><a name="90625-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09062549000683"></a>Lord McColl of Dulwich:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, for initiating this important debate and for introducing it in such a lucid and informative way.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09062549000421"></a>The report <I>Best Research for Best Health</I> stated that the objective of Her Majesty&#146;s Government is to ensure that patients benefit from clinical research, that areas of unmet needs are addressed and that the health of the people is improved. Bearing in mind these worthy objectives, I will examine how they relate to the greatest hazard that threatens millions of people in the UK. I refer to the obesity epidemic, which is increasing all the time and represents a dangerous threat not only to the nation&#146;s health, but also to the NHS and to the economy as a whole.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09062549000422"></a>Evidence-based medicine is quite rightly the best basis for the practice of medicine, but sometimes lobby groups position themselves between science and good evidence-based practice. The food industry has concentrated on the lack of exercise as the cause of obesity, which of course suits it very well because, understandably, it does not want any reduction in its trade. The science is clear: if one wants to take a pound of weight off by exercise, one has to run a mile; whereas simply reducing the number of calories eaten or drunk is guaranteed to reduce weight. Exercise is very good for the integrity of the cardiovascular system and is effective in reducing the wrong sort of cholesterol. There is also evidence that exercise helps in reducing the amount of fat in a patient&#146;s body, rather than a reduction in muscle. But that is when exercise is combined with a reduction in the number of calories, as the noble Lord, Lord Addington, knows well. It should be emphasised that one can put on weight just by drinking fluids. Let us take, for instance, the cocktail, Mai Tai: three such cocktails provide 1,000 calories.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="09062549000423"></a>In a predominantly sedentary population such as ours, it is clear that exercise is not an efficient method of weight reduction. In fact, many obese adults are precluded from exercise by problems such as arthritis, heart disease and respiratory inadequacy. The emphasis on physical activity has political supporters, however, as there are fewer commercial interests opposing the message and it fits with the promotion of events such as the 2012 Olympics. The alternative message, which proposes a move towards healthier diets and reducing the consumption of energy dense foods, such as fatty snacks, confectionary, soft drinks and so on, is much more sensitive politically. A man who was confined to an electric wheelchair and therefore could not exercise decided to reduce his weight by two stone, or 13 kilograms, which he did in a rather revolutionary way. He simply ate less and quite soon he came down to the size he wanted.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09062549000424"></a>There are a number of red herrings in this subject, including brown fat, big bones and hormones, but at the end of the day we are what we eat. An overweight man consulted me about his excessive weight and he assured me that he had tried every diet in the book, but without any effect. He asked whether I could help. I noticed that his wife was quite thin&#151;perhaps I should say she was a normal size. So I suggested that he ate the same quantity as his wife. He saw the danger  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1745"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1745</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of that and was somewhat reluctant, but he agreed to give it a try. Three months later when I inquired of his wife how successful this regime had been, she said, &#147;It has been a disaster because I&#146;m putting on weight&#148;.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09062549000425"></a>Danish doctors have reported that a British formula based diet was successful in reducing the weight of their patients by more than 12 per cent, which gave very good symptom relief in obese men and women with arthritis of their knees. One hundred and ninety two of them followed a 500 calories a day or an 800 calories a day diet for eight weeks and were maintained on a stabilising diet for about six years. On average, the patients weighed 16 stones and lost two stones in 16 weeks, and 60 per cent had a significant improvement in relieving their symptoms, especially pain in their knees.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09062549000426"></a>Professor Bliddal from the Parker Institute, Frederiksberg Hospital, commented that obese patients have very bad knees and if they exercise before losing weight they almost certainly wear the knees down and make things worse. In his programme people lose weight first and when they are a lighter weight, they usually regain their former activity. He ends by saying that bad knees are no excuse for failure in losing weight.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09062549000427"></a>Those who insist that exercise is the solution to the problem of obesity give obese patients just the excuse they need to say that they cannot exercise to lose weight. They remain in their morbid and eventually fatal outcome. Yet there is some comfort for those obese people who find it difficult to lose weight. A strange mechanism in the brain is relevant in weight control. As one&#146;s weight increases, a complex brain regulatory system adapts to lock in to the new, heavier weight. It becomes the new level which the appetite and activity control centres then try to maintain. This explains why some people have difficulty in reducing weight. Even so, they can still lose weight if they diet.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="09062549000428"></a>I have so far dealt with adult obesity. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, mentioned, we need a different approach with children, one combining a reduction in calories with increased activity and counselling. At the same time, all children have to be encouraged to be much more active: walking or cycling to school, plenty of games and reducing the amount of TV and computer pastimes. Prevention is much better than trying to cure the obesity when it occurs. The culture has to change radically if the nation&#146;s health is to improve.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09062549000429"></a>Life today is such that we need to eat 500 calories less than was the case. The food industry has got to produce new, mainstream foods with far lower calorie densities. At the start of the last war, one-third of the British people were either underfed or ill-fed. The introduction of food rationing changed that within a few weeks. That was the greatest public health experiment ever. We cannot put the clock back but we must have voluntary change. This can be helped if Her Majesty&#146;s Government in particular and politicians in general accept what research has already revealed: we are what we eat and there are no mysteries.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="09062549000430"></a>I have forgotten to declare an interest. When a person tells me that I am lucky to be thin, I am tempted to say &#147;Actually, I am normal&#148;. As that might be construed as a criticism of his obesity, I explain  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1746"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1746</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that I cannot claim any credit for being the size that I am. It is all due to a patient of mine 40 years ago. I was on my way to a black-tie dinner wearing the black-tie outfit belonging to my father-in-law. It was 50 years old and green round the edges. I was called out to St Bartholomew&#146;s Hospital to see a lady who was bleeding to death from a tumour in her groin. I went up to the bedside. To my amazement she seized hold of my jacket and said, &#147;That jacket is very old&#148;. I said, &#147;It is 50 years old&#148;. She said, &#147;It looks it.&#148;</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="09062549000431"></a>I did not quite know how to cope with this. There was this lady dying yet joking away. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09062549000521"></a>&#147;Now, look. I know I&#146;m dying. I know there&#146;s no hope and it&#146;s inoperable. But I want you to take me to the operating theatre and have a go. Take a risk and try to remove this tumour. You will have to put a new artery in&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09062549000502"></a>she knew her medicine.</p>
<ul><a name="09062549000529"></a>&#147;I am in the cloth trade in the East End and if I survive I will make you a new black-tie outfit&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062549000503"></a>I was amazed to here this. I operated all that night and because she was indestructible she survived eight years. During that time she made me a new suit.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="09062549000432"></a>As a tribute to her, I have to stay the same size. As I am Scot I do not want to buy a new suit. We are what we eat.</p>

I am grateful, as other noble Lords clearly are, to the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, for initiating it. If nothing else, it has been wide-ranging&#151;a veritable potpourri of contributions. I hope I will be able to address all the themes and individual issues. I confess that I have a large pile of notes in front of me and it may be necessary to write to some noble Lords, for which I apologise in advance. I will do my best.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="09062549000434"></a>I turn first to health research. The Government fully recognise that a vibrant and well-organised health research sector is of enormous importance to our healthcare system, to our economy and to countless individuals and their families. That is why we have the radical and ambitious health research strategy that the National Institute for Health Research is delivering. That is why funding for all aspects of research has been increased to the highest-ever levels and why the place of research within the NHS has been given renewed emphasis. We hope the combination of our strategy and the growth in funding is powerful. No one can fail to be struck by the progress that the NIHR has made or by the efforts being made under Sir John Bell and the Office for Strategic Co-ordination of Health Research in invigorating translational research.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="09062549000435"></a>What we are beginning to achieve through that research&#151;through what the OSCHR partners are doing together&#151;is, as several noble Lords have mentioned, unequalled anywhere else in the world. We are doing it by building on, and in no way diminishing, our strengths in basic science. That much and a great deal more are clear from the progress report that the chairman of the OSCHR published last November.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="09062549000436"></a>Progress is unquestionably what the NIHR&#151;I apologise for using initials&#151;has achieved. The energy and determination which so many people in the Department of Health and the NHS have put into  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1747"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1747</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>implementing <I>Best Research for Best Health</I> has enabled enormous strides to be made. The evidence is clear in the positive impact that the new funding regime is having on all parts of the research community and across the NHS. It is clear from the impact of the clinical research network on the numbers of trials taking place in the NHS and the scale of patient recruitment to them. It is clear from the effect of bringing together and supporting the people who conduct research in the NIHR Faculty.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="09062549000437"></a>We want a research-intensive NHS. It is good for patients and, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, rightly said, it is good for clinical teaching at all levels and across disciplines. The quality improvements and innovation that lead to productivity gains and better patient outcomes depend on the new ideas that research generates and evaluates. We recognise the need for vitality, which was mentioned by several noble Lords, including the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, who correctly said that we have to remain at the top. Clinical fellowships and lectureships provide research, exposure and experience for academically gifted medical and dental trainees. We are moving to the stage where there will be some 750 academic clinical fellowships and 400 clinical lectureships in the NHS, which is equivalent to more than 2 per cent of all hospital doctors in professional training.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="09062549000438"></a>We are uniquely placed in this country in the scope the NHS offers as a base from which to conduct clinical trials. We and our research partners in industry and the charitable sector believe that we have the right policies and right structures to capitalise on that potential. There are of course challenges internationally and at home to the full realisation of that objective, but I do not believe that the European clinical trials directive&#151;mentioned by several noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant&#151;is one of them. The total number of clinical trials in the UK has remained stable since the introduction of the directive and we continue to be at the top end of the European league table in our sponsorship of both commercially and non-commercially funded trials. If we are to remain there, and to face the international competition, we need efficient, robust and, above all, transparent ethical and governance systems. I shall return shortly to the points raised by my noble friend Lord Turnberg on those issues.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="09062549000439"></a>Real and considerable effort is being made in this area. We are making our research ethics committee structure simpler and stronger and integrating it more closely with other aspects of research regulation. We are simplifying and streamlining the administrative and regulatory procedures governing trials and other studies and updating our research management systems.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="09062549000440"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, mentioned research charities and their excellent umbrella organisation. The support we give those charities is as important to them as it is to us. The clinical research network now provides automatic infrastructure support for all eligible trials, and the 2004 science and innovation investment framework committed the Government to underpin the charity-funded research undertaken in our universities. This investment is made through the Higher Education Funding Council for England through its quality-related funding stream and will rise to &#163;194 million in 2009-10.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1748"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1748</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="09062549000441"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, also raised the issue of the European working time directive. There is no evidence that greater numbers of trainees are failing in their end of year assessments where 48-hour working has been introduced. No junior doctor can become a consultant until the appropriate royal college has issued a certificate of completion of training. This is an essential safeguard ensuring that medical training remains of the highest standard. Given the concerns raised by some professionals, we have listened and acted. The former Secretary of State for Health announced a review on the impact of the implementation of the European working time directive on 20 May. This review will consider concerns that the introduction of a 48-hour working week may have a detrimental effect on junior doctors&#146; training, particularly on the training they receive while at work. It is important that there is an independent and objective assessment of whether the introduction of the directive fully into the NHS will necessitate changes to the current system of postgraduate medical training.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="09062549000442"></a>I shall address the issue of social enterprise as part of these remarks and then return to the individual points raised by noble Lords. I feel that I should declare an historic interest, as it were, as the founding chair of the Social Enterprise Coalition and as someone who has been working with social enterprises and co-operatives almost all my working life. I believe that social enterprises can make a big difference to the lives of the people and local communities they serve. We agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, that they are able to transform the way services are delivered and to improve health outcomes. Innovative and flexible solutions to transform health and social care can be found in social enterprises and they have strong potential in other sectors, such as housing, leisure and transport. That is why encouraging social enterprise in health and social care is a key part of our patient-led reform of services.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="09062549000443"></a>The department is actively promoting social enterprise in health and social care through the Social Enterprise Investment Fund and by supporting the next stage review commitment for the staff&#146;s right to request. The Social Enterprise Investment Fund has so far provided &#163;20 million of funding to 200 social enterprises and the new fund manager is working to build on this success to support even more. The fund offers a range of financial services, including grants and loans, as well as providing business support tailored to the needs of social enterprises in various stages of development.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="09062549000444"></a>In addition to evaluating the impact of these investments, the department is working with the Office of the Third Sector to pilot the social return on investment. We are working with six social enterprises delivering mainstream health and social care services, to measure the social value that they are bringing to their local communities. The department&#146;s investments include funding for several healthy living centres, such as Well UK, Community Docs for All and St Luke&#146;s Healthy Living Centre. These centres address local health inequalities and improve access to services for the local population, making a real difference to local communities. The right-to-request commitment in the next stage review is enabling clinical staff in primary

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="09062549000445"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, raised the issue of social enterprise and expressed his frustration. He is correct that we have yet to crack the need for holistic commissioning and he knows that I am a great champion and supporter of this issue. He knows that it works and there is no doubt that we still have to crack the issue of rolling this provision out. We are committed to encouraging commissioners to grasp the opportunities offered by this sector. For example, Manchester PCT has commissioned the Big Life Group to run the Kath Locke Centre, a primary care centre in Moss Side. The centre allows local people to access services and to help deliver them. We have published two documents that we hope will help local commissioners to crack this.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="09062549000446"></a>I take issue with the noble Lord about polyclinics being based on a biomedical model. One of the largest community-owned health organisations is Local Care Direct. It was set up to provide out-of-hospital care to 2.5 million patients in Yorkshire and Humber. Being a Yorkshirewoman, I am particularly fond of this organisation. Local Care Direct was the first organisation to open one of the new GP-led access centres nationally in December 2008. These services complement existing GP and out-of-hours services in the area and demonstrate how a social enterprise can help transform primary care.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="09062549000447"></a>I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, for the work he has been promoting on healthy living centres and I hope that I can help him to crack the bureaucracy. He is quite right that getting bureaucrats to be entrepreneurial and to recognise the benefits of social enterprise is a major challenge, and that is clearly what we have to crack. He is absolutely right to make that point.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="09062549000448"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, mentioned academic health science centres. These bring together a small number of health and academic partners. The aim is to help speed up the process of translating developments in research into benefits for patients and the local community, and to promote the adoption of their discoveries within the NHS and across the NHS and the world. Designation is awarded for a period of five years and the successful centres will be subject to review. The international panel of designation recommended that there should be a reapplication process. The Secretary of State has accepted this recommendation and he also reserves the right to suspend or remove designation if that is deemed necessary.</p>

<a name="90625-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="09062549000449"></a>The noble Lord asked about the 1.5 per cent research spend. The Government have made unprecedented increases in funding for health research. Total government investment in health research will be &#163;1.7 billion by 2010-11, an increase of more than &#163;290,000 in the three-year period covered in the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review. There is no evidence to suggest that a particular proportion represents a right level of support to aim for. We need to aim to make that investment work for us and to make it as effective as possible.</p>

Since the old system was abolished the Department of Health has worked with the medical professions at various levels to design the best possible recruitment system for doctors in training. Nearly all the deaneries use the same IT system for their local recruitment. National recruitment has continued to improve. The establishment of Medical Education England represents a unique opportunity to work with professions and get the right number of staff in the NHS, at the right level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="09062549000451"></a>My noble friend Lord Woolmer was correct to mention the next stage review and made a good point about patients&#146; needs and experience and how they should inform how services are organised. I will address funding issues in a moment. He also made the point about more clinicians in leadership roles. Clinical leadership is key to the future success of the NHS and the National Leadership Council has been established to support the service delivery in this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="09062549000452"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, raised the issue of stroke, as did several other noble Lords including the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant. He was right to point out that we have a new national framework for stroke and we are endeavouring to give it the right kind of emphasis and prioritisation that stroke requires. I can confirm that the 10-year plan is on track, that the stroke strategy acknowledges that the networks are of great benefit and that all the stroke services in England now fall within one of the 28 networks. The work of the stroke improvement programme, including the networks, will be evaluated over the next year, after which future work plans will be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="09062549000453"></a>The noble Lord also asked about research. The NIHR clinical research network is building on the extraordinary success of the cancer research network to maximise the potential of the NHS to support clinical trials and involve more patients in them. The stroke network, to which the noble Lord referred, is one of six topic-specific networks and well over 200,000 people were recruited into studies across the whole network last year. Among other things, the result is an increasing integration of research and patient care, about which the noble Lord was concerned. The noble Lord asked where he could find out about the cost of the stroke research network. Improving the level of quality of research provides new opportunities for stroke research in the NHS and the integration of research within the delivery. There is a commitment of &#163;20 million over the next five years that has been made to support the UK stroke network. That does not answer the question about where you find that information and I undertake to write and tell the noble Lord. It says that we are doing it, but not where you find the information, for which I apologise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="09062549000454"></a>My noble friend Lord Turnberg talked about regulation, data sharing and the DIPEx website. He asked whether we could have another go at bureaucracy busting. We are redoubling our efforts to reduce bureaucracy and are fully aware of his and other concerns. We are working with Professor Paul Stewart in Birmingham on these issues and others and taking practical steps to include the creation of an integrated research application service. This is transforming the application process. Single application forms are necessary and we want to move towards a much simpler way of

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="09062549000455"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, as usual made a very well-informed speech about the importance of building community cohesion&#151;<I>High Quality Care for All</I> being the beginning of the revolution not the end. I am pleased that the noble Baroness is serving on the commission that the department has established. The former Secretary of State announced a review of the impact of the implementation of the European working time directive on 20 May, which is an issue that the noble Baroness mentioned, and I hope that I have answered that question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="09062549000456"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, gave an important and eloquent description of how the NHS coped during the Troubles and I join him in paying tribute to NHS staff at all levels during that period.</p>

I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that we are working across government. Change4Life and the Olympic legacy show that we are fully aware of the need for people to walk, cycle, swim, dance in their bedrooms and take exercise. We have policy documents to deal with that and they are rolling out across government. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, gave us an important master class of good sense on the prevention of obesity. The only thing that I would add is that we are leading development in obesity research strategy across government, with a strong emphasis on prevention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="09062549000458"></a>I need to deal with the issues raised by my noble friend Lord Warner. He asked about a speech made by the head of the NHS. That text was agreed and cleared with the then Secretary of State. It started with what we know: that PCT allocation will grow by an average of 5.5 per cent each year 2009-10 to 2010-11. It then sets the scene that although we do not know what the spending review settlement for April 2011 will be, we at least know that total public spending will slow significantly and large productivity gains will be needed to cope with the rising demand for health and social care systems. The argument is that unprecedented productivity gains can be made only by improving quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="09062549000461"></a>We know that we need to get better care delivering better value. There will be great efforts within the NHS to tackle, for example, healthcare associated infections. We estimate that we have already saved &#163;75 million in reduced bed days and drug costs, while improving outcomes for patients. I have quite a large amount of information about the costs and savings that we are seeking to make, so I will write to the noble Lord because I am probably running out of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="09062549000462"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, raised the importance of the patient&#146;s voice, the issue of Mid-Staffordshire and whether we should be having a public inquiry. We are unconvinced at this time that a public inquiry would add anything to our understanding of what went wrong in that hospital and what needs to be done to prevent such events happening again.</p>

Her remarks were relevant and supportive. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, raised the issue of autism. I pay tribute to the noble Lord&#146;s pioneering work on autism. We have discussed this in your Lordships&#146; House in the past. I hope that we will see the noble Lord participating in the forthcoming discussion on the Private Member&#146;s Bill on autism which is about to come to your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

This is the last Thursday of debates in your Lordships&#146; House before we enter the time of trying to complete the Government&#146;s legislative programme before Parliament rises in the autumn.

At the end of that debate, I tried, valiantly, to comment upon all of the contributions that had been made during the debate. As I attempted that I was roundly rebuked by the Minister on the Front Bench and told that was not appropriate in these circumstances. I have learnt that lesson. Hence, I am not going to say more, except to thank everyone who has contributed to a debate that has covered an enormous range.

It is good to see the noble Lord, Lord Roper, in his place after recent surgery. We are delighted to see him back in full harness as chairman of the EU Select Committee. We took oral evidence between May and July, and I will come to some of that in a moment. For the present, I want to say how grateful we are to all the witnesses who gave oral and written evidence. The bulk of our report gives testimony to the evidence that we received.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="09062549000468"></a>I pay tribute to the work of our outstanding clerk, Michael Collon, who did so much to make this report the success which I believe it is. He was ably assisted by Anneliese Baldaccini, our committee specialist. I pay a special tribute to Kevin O&#146;Connell, our specialist adviser who brought all his expertise to assist us in drawing up this report.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="09062549000469"></a>Noble Lords may recall that a year ago I asked the House to take note of another report by our sub-committee, of which I was the chairman, on FRONTEX, the European borders agency. In that case, I had cause to complain that the Government&#146;s response, signed by Mr Liam Byrne, who at that time was a ministerial colleague of the Minister at the Home Office, reached the committee well outside the mandatory two-month period and only five days before your Lordships debated the report. I have to say that the removal of Mr Byrne from that position did not cause any tears to be shed by members of our committee, because we had a most unsatisfactory relationship with him.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="09062549000470"></a>I am, therefore, very glad to be able to thank the Minister for the fact that the Government&#146;s response to this report, signed by Mr Vernon Coaker&#151;another erstwhile colleague&#151;was received within the two-month period. I am only sorry that circumstances have conspired so that a further five months have elapsed before we could have this debate. I hope I am not to blame for the fact that the Minister who gave evidence to the committee for this inquiry, Mr McNulty, is a third erstwhile colleague. I am delighted that the noble Lord who will answer in this debate&#151;I have already had a go at him this morning&#151;seems to be the one fixed point inhabiting the Home Office ministerial universe. I shall try not to say any more rude things about the Home Office, but the Minister probably knows that I have a satchel full of them if I am provoked.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="09062549000471"></a>All of your Lordships know that Europol, the European Police Office, is a vital weapon for co-ordinating the European fight against serious organised crime. However, when in the early 1990s it was first proposed to set up a European police office, there was no legal basis for this to be done under the treaties. The member states therefore concluded between them a convention for establishing Europol. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, a legal basis has been available. A decision was negotiated allowing Europol to be reconstituted as an agency of the EU; it was signed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in April this year&#151;six months after it was first on the agenda of the council for signature&#151;and on 1 January 2010, Europol will be reconstituted as an agency of the European Union. This was one of the factors which influenced the timing of our inquiry.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="09062549000472"></a>At the same meeting, the Council of Ministers unanimously agreed on the appointment of a new director for Europol. Thereby hangs a story. We took evidence from the Serious Organised Crime Agency, SOCA, on 4 June last year. We were told that its deputy director, Mr Rob Wainwright, was to apply for the post of director when it became vacant. This was news to us, and I have to say it was also news to the director of Europol himself, who first learnt of this when he was reading Mr Wainwright&#146;s evidence. I do not suppose it was particularly good news for the director, but to us, it was certainly good news because we felt that Europol could do with new and vigorous leadership, although we did not say as much in our report. I think we were sufficiently tactful&#151;and as it transpired, rightly tactful&#151;fearing that we might prejudice Mr Wainwright&#146;s candidature if we drew attention to it in our report. Now that Mr Wainwright has been appointed to take up this post, I should like to take this moment to welcome his appointment very strongly, and to offer him the committee&#146;s congratulations. He has got a difficult job ahead of him, and we wish him well in that work.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="09062549000473"></a>In its report the committee reached a number of conclusions and made a large number of recommendations, which are currently before the House. I want today to concentrate on three of them: first, the exchange of information; secondly, the governance and management of Europol; and, thirdly, the relationship between SOCA&#151;the Serious and Organised Crime Agency&#151;and the United Kingdom police forces, which supply SOCA with most of its information.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="09062549000474"></a>I start with the first of those, which is the exchange of information. After all, that is what Europol is all about&#151;passing information about serious cross-border crime to police forces of other member states, and, conversely, obtaining such information from them. This is not the same as giving other forces information that they have requested. Information is put on the Europol database, to be available to the forces of any other member state which may find it of use. If therefore the information does not reach that database, it will not be available&#151;and this unfortunately is exactly what happens. The national liaison officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague exchange four-fifths of this information between themselves, without putting it on their database. Access to information is thus greatly reduced, and it may be that crimes could have been prevented or solved, and criminals deterred or caught, if this information had been made more widely available.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="09062549000475"></a>We concluded that the reason for that was basically a lack of trust&#151;much of this information is highly sensitive, and could lose all its value if it was disseminated too widely. However, once on the database, it is available to all forces of all 27 member states, and to anyone to whom they please to pass it. That of course is the objective, but it is also the reason why liaison officers are reluctant to make sensitive information available, if the liaison officers of even one of the other member states are not thought to be trustworthy. That is one of the problems we face. We did not wish to discourage bilateral exchanges between liaison officers of two member states&#151;far from it, but we did feel that any information exchanged between them should also be  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1755"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1755</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>put on the database. The Home Office told us in its written evidence, that it was prepared to take the lead, and we invited it to tell us how it proposed to set about doing this. In its response, it told us that SOCA had reviewed its procedures and would routinely copy details of bilateral exchanges to the Europol database. This would be excellent were it not qualified by two words which were inserted in the original small print. Those words were &#147;sensitivity permitting&#148;, which precisely illustrates the point that the committee has been trying to make. We would like to see the structure and make-up of Europol to be such that sensitivity is no obstacle. I should like to hear what the Minister thinks can be done to increase trust at Europol between all officials who are posted there, not just some.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="09062549000476"></a>The exchange of large volumes of information depends on the data being uploaded. We were told that SOCA was not yet in a position to use the systems for the automated uploading of data on to the Europol information system. The response told us that the Government viewed the upgrading of SOCA&#146;s information technology systems as a priority and that they hoped this would be achieved &#147;by 2010&#148;. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us what exactly that means. I hope that, when the Government talk about 2010, they do not mean the end of 2010, 18 months away. I hope that, rather, they mean the beginning of 2010, six months away. That is important.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="09062549000477"></a>I turn to the second point that I want to discuss&#151;the governance and management of Europol. An organisation based on trust needs an executive that can help to foster that trust and a structure that can allow it to be developed. This is not what we found. The management board which supervises the director has a chairmanship rotating with the presidency, and the result was that Mr Max-Peter Ratzel, the then director from whom we took evidence, had in nearly four years worked with eight different chairmen of the management board. He can hardly be blamed for finding it difficult to build and retain trust between the chairman and the director, and indeed trust within the organisation.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="09062549000478"></a>We should have liked to see a system similar to the one to which I referred earlier in my remarks about our FRONTEX report a year ago, where the chairman is elected by and from the members of that board. Instead, under the decision, a chairman will be appointed by and from the three members who happen to be those appointed by the three member states holding the current and next two presidencies. This is scarcely better. It scarcely increases the likelihood of the best man or woman being appointed as chairman. It means that the chairman will serve for 18 rather than six months. That is an advantage only if the chairman chosen from among the three presidencies is better than the one chosen from a single presidency. There is really no guarantee of that in the system.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="09062549000479"></a>In their response, the Government, to give them credit, agreed entirely with our view and said that they had proposed an open competition for the selection of an individual who would hold the chair for at least two years. Apparently, a significant number of member states refused to agree to this. Apparently, too, there is no prospect of their changing their minds once the decision is in force. I ask the Minister why that is. Who  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1756"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1756</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are these people? Are they doing it just for political reasons? Are so many member states afraid that choosing the best man or woman for the job will mean that one of their national members will never be chosen to do it? Does the Minister not agree that the fight against international crime is far too serious a matter to be left to political bickering? If he does agree, which I feel sure he does, is this not something that should be raised at the highest levels? Perhaps I might suggest that it would be a start if it could be agreed by the Interior Ministers of the G6 at their forthcoming meeting in Birmingham, about which we had some correspondence with the Home Secretary&#151;or perhaps I should again say the erstwhile Home Secretary.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="09062549000480"></a>As it happens, I know that we have already experienced political bickering of this type in the appointment of the new director, which I mentioned earlier. Mr Wainwright was agreed on all sides to be the best candidate put forward by any state, so why were there problems and delays about his appointment? If, to take a random example, the best candidate had been a Hungarian, it is scarcely conceivable that the United Kingdom would have objected to his appointment on the ground that it was not Hungary&#146;s turn. I hope the Minister will agree that as the EU moves increasingly into the areas of crime and police co-operation, it is time for member states to show a bit of maturity about such matters.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="09062549000481"></a>I turn to the relationship between SOCA and the United Kingdom police forces that supply SOCA with most of their information. As I have said, Europol&#146;s co-ordination role is based on the exchange of information. Those who gather that information are the police forces of the member states. Without the information that they supply, there would be nothing for Europol to do&#151;we should understand that&#151;but the police forces must be told what is happening. From the evidence we received from the Association of Chief Police Officers, it was clear that too often police forces passed information to SOCA without knowing what was going to happen to it; they did not know if it went to Europol; if it did, they did not know if it was useful; and if they received information back from SOCA, too often they did not know if it was information from Europol rebranded, or information originating from SOCA itself. They can do their job properly only if they know these things. If they know, they will have a proper incentive to do better.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="09062549000482"></a>We were glad that, in their response, the Government accepted that more could and should be done. They told us that SOCA would act on our recommendations, that it would indicate to police forces which channels of international communication were being used and that it would inform them of the outcome of their inquiries. Does the Minister think that if the Committee took evidence today from ACPO, nearly a year after we last did so, we would be told that things really had improved, that Europol now had a higher profile among UK police forces and that they were now aware of what happened to the information they were dutifully passing on? I hope that he will be able to expand on that when he replies.</p>

Although we had criticisms of the Government, we applauded much of what they had done and were doing. Our main criticisms were reserved for the international stage. Much of what needs doing requires the agreement of other member states, but that is all the more reason why the Government should use the considerable reputation of this country in the fight against international crime to persuade our partners that things can be improved, if only they can find the will to do so.</p>

I want to pay my tribute to the committee&#146;s chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, for all his hard work and his clear focus on ensuring that the inquiry into the changing nature of Europol was conducted thoroughly and rigorously and that the report was comprehensive. I reiterate the thanks of the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, to our committee clerk, Michael Collon, for his help, advice and considerable drafting skills, to the other specialists who served the sub-committee and to our specialist adviser, Kevin O&#146;Connell, for his invaluable insight and practical knowledge of policing issues.</p>

<a name="90625-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="09062564000003"></a>Over the past few years in Britain, the phenomenon of intelligence-led policing has gathered pace. I witnessed its development from my vantage point as chairman of the Lancashire Police Authority and of the Association of Police Authorities. In Britain, it finally resulted in the implementation on a national scale of the national intelligence model to which all forces signed up, under the watchful eye of the police inspectorate. The national intelligence model has been extremely important in the United Kingdom in enabling forces to target their resources on particular areas of activity or on individuals or locations identified by the crime data that they collected and the trends and patterns that have clearly emerged. The adoption of the national intelligence model has also enabled forces in the United Kingdom to work together more effectively, as they are now sharing a common methodology and approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="09062564000004"></a>Under the United Kingdom presidency of the EU in 2005, there was a drive to establish intelligence-led policing as a concept and as a methodology across member states. That led to the adoption of the European equivalent of the national intelligence model&#151;the European criminal intelligence model. We investigated that as part of our inquiries. It is clear that not all member states in the EU were equally enthusiastic about that move or paid it more than lip service to start with. It has to be said that the doctrine of &#147;not invented here&#148; is not just a United Kingdom phenomenon.  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1758"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1758</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>To be fair, policing is delivered through very different structures and in quite diverse ways across the European Union. None for less, the concept of intelligence-led law enforcement at EU level has been endorsed and welcomed by the council and has in recent years been an important development from the perspective of enhancing the effectiveness of Europol.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="09062564000005"></a>In the course of our inquiry, differences of view emerged about how firmly this new approach has, in practical terms, taken root in different member states. There has clearly been some dragging of feet and some reluctance on the part of policing agencies in some countries to sign up to it in practical terms or even to profess to understand what the term &#147;intelligence-led policing&#148; actually means. Thus the committee felt that renewed energy and focus need to be directed to establishing among member states&#146; police forces a common understanding of what intelligence-led policing entails and the methodology and approach that underpin and drive it.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="09062564000006"></a>We believe that Europol is in a good position to undertake this important task and that it should work with the heads of national units and the European Police College to organise training to encourage the adoption and use of intelligence-led policing as the common working method across Europe. Just as great benefits flowed in the United Kingdom from the establishment of the national intelligence model, so similar benefits are surely there to be obtained from its adoption across the EU. I now understand that the Europol draft work programme for 2010 contains an objective to embed the principles of intelligence-led policing in Europol&#146;s decision-making processes.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="09062564000007"></a>I agree with the Government&#146;s assessment, in their response to our report, that there is a role for SOCA in promoting this initiative at the level of heads of Europol national units and for our National Policing Improvement Agency to use its influence at the EU police training college. I look forward to hearing how successful Europol is able to be in relation to that initiative in the next few years.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="09062564000008"></a>The organised crime threat assessment was first introduced in 2004 under the Hague programme. A year later, one of the United Kingdom&#146;s presidency objectives in the area of justice and home affairs was to ensure that good intelligence and its analysis would feed through into good-quality threat assessment, which had not existed in this form at EU level before. Europol therefore drafted the first organised crime threat assessment by the end of 2005 and now publishes them annually, giving an overview of the principal threats faced across the EU, allowing Europol to facilitate joint operational responses by member states. According to evidence that we took from SOCA, this is helping to usher in a new phase in the development of Europol and is,</p>
<ul><a name="09062564000068"></a>&#147;establishing the agency as a central intelligence base in the EU supporting a range of subregional initiatives around the EU&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062564000066"></a>This has clearly been a very important development in the effectiveness of Europol&#146;s role, resulting in the establishment of a centralised knowledge base and information systems to deliver effective operations. We must pay tribute to the British Government and to United Kingdom officials for exporting across the EU  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1759"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1759</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and to Europol the concept of the organised crime threat assessment. However, it now needs to be further developed alongside intelligence-led policing. I hope that in time it will bring about important results as well as closer liaison arrangements between prosecuting and investigating officials, improved information exchange and more accurate communication.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="09062564000009"></a>Europol also has an important role to play in providing a general information exchange service to enable member states to search a central EU repository for data relating to serious and organised crime. However, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, there is not, at present, enough data coming into Europol. One reason for this is that only five member states are currently using the automated loading system to feed in the large quantities of data involved. I reiterate the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, that it is imperative that SOCA&#146;s information technology systems are upgraded as a matter of urgency so that it can take advantage of the automatic data-loading facilities available. I also welcome the planned introduction of a direct link to police forces in England and Wales via the police national network system. That, again, will facilitate data access and exchange, which is a central function of Europol&#146;s role.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="09062564000010"></a>Europol has also developed a number of analysis work files to which member states have access. The UK certainly values the high-quality service of data analysis offered by Europol on issues such as drug trafficking, financial and property crime, forgery and, increasingly, terrorism and organised crime groups. However, while our report supports Europol&#146;s role as an intelligence co-ordinator, we would not want to see Europol facilitating investigations. We make it clear in the report that its role should be to support, facilitate and co-ordinate investigations but not to initiate them. In their response, the Government agreed with that view.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="09062564000011"></a>I end by raising the important issue of the accountability of Europol. Europol is an important and growing resource for member states, but it needs to be scrutinised effectively, not just by the European Parliament but possibly by national parliaments in some way. Its work needs to be regularly and systematically evaluated. We need to know exactly where it is adding value, what the obstacles are to its further development and how they can be removed. I know that some of this will begin to happen in the next four years, but I urge the Government to do everything that they can to support a move towards ensuring greater accountability of Europol to the European Parliament and, in some form or other alongside European Parliament scrutiny, to national parliaments.</p>

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, for such an excellent introduction to the report. The report is very useful, not least because it lays out some of the issues that we have heard about this afternoon from the noble Lord, Lord Jopling. It also dispels some myths, the first of which is that Europol is a European police force. That is clearly a dangerous  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1760"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1760</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>myth and the report makes it clear that Europol is a resource for national police forces. The issues that Europol addresses, and on which it facilitates much closer working, were touched on by the Minister in his Statement this afternoon. They are some of the most serious issues that we face. Cross-border crimes such as terrorism, money-laundering and the trafficking of people and drugs are serious crimes that require cross-border co-operation to deal with.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="09062564000013"></a>Surveys show that, even if UK citizens are sometimes unclear about the benefits of Europe, fighting crime is something that they are keen on when it come to European co-operation. According to Eurobarometer in December 2007, 70 per cent of British people believe that decisions on terrorism should be taken jointly with the EU. The report says a number of things about co-operation against terrorism. It highlights the fact that Europol does not get systematic information on terrorist cases. Although the committee rightly urges caution on intelligence sharing, it is clear that there needs to be, as the report highlights, a lot more discussion on the matter in Brussels and, indeed, here.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="09062564000014"></a>I was interested that the report highlighted the two-country rule, under which at least two European countries must be involved before the 2005 decision applies. That seems quite arbitrary when terrorism can take so many forms. Cross-border crime is costing the EU in the order of &#163;20 billion a year. That is the figure quoted, but it must be hard to estimate. Europol is one of the most needed aspects of co-operation in Europe, because criminals regard the constraints on domestic police forces of national boundaries as a great help, so everything that can be done to diminish those constraints is essential.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="09062564000015"></a>The report is timely. In January 2010, Europol becomes an EU agency, funded by the Community budget. With this in mind, it is especially important to address the matter of democratic accountability raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, which remains unresolved. We were disappointed that the reform treaty did not address the matter of Europol in as much detail as it should have done. Europol should be subject to full democratic and judicial scrutiny, both by the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice. The decision to strengthen Europol should have gone hand in hand with the reforms introduced by the treaty of Lisbon. Nevertheless, we support strongly the concept of Europol.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="09062564000016"></a>We are worried about the Conservative position; I will be interested to hear from the Conservative spokesman in a moment. I know that the Conservatives have a number of reservations, including about Eurojust, the body that helps to co-ordinate prosecutions across Europe and recently led the successful prosecutions following Operation Koala, which broke up a paedophile ring and resulted in the arrests of 93 people and the rescue of 23 victims. Conservative MEPs voted against the EAW, which slashed extradition times between Britain and other EU countries from an average of 18 months to just 43 days and resulted in 920 criminals being swiftly extradited from British prisons to face justice in Europe. Not only is it streamlining the system, but it is also saving British taxpayers&#146; money. I hope that the Conservatives will feel more enthusiastic about European co-operation.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1761"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1761</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="09062564000017"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Henig, mentioned the European criminal records information system, which again Conservative MEPs voted against. That was surprising, because it standardises the format of criminal records in Europe and allows streamlining and more efficient exchange between police forces and between employers such as airports. We see that sort of thing as essential to fighting crime.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="09062564000018"></a>I thought that the report was particularly interesting on data. It contains a number of lessons. It is essential to recognise that a sloppy, weak or unclear policy on data is not acceptable. While we accept that data exchange is invaluable in the fight against crime, it is immensely important that the corresponding safeguards for those data are excellent. Of course, we have this debate a lot about domestic data and we know how easily data can be lost. We have to be confident that the European system will be sufficiently strong not to undermine public confidence in any country, especially ours, in the operation of Europol. EU countries are now exchanging the data, but the report has some reservations about the adequacy of protection. I believe that the arrangements for transferring data were agreed behind closed doors under the Pr1/4m treaty, which possibly weakens them, as they were not open to adequate scrutiny at the time.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="09062564000019"></a>As Europol becomes an EU agency, two aspects concern us most: accountability must be addressed and data safeguards must be adequate. Overall, we see this as a positive move. The report highlights for the Government some helpful areas but, because they were not within its remit, the report did not address a couple of things that should be addressed at the same time. I mention them now because they are critical issues as regards crime and security: the European border security force and a database on illegal immigration. The Minister may want to comment on those.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="09062564000021"></a>Let us first look at Europol&#146;s successes in the 17 years of its existence. They include the disruption of a network of people smugglers which spanned six countries, the dismantling of a large international cashpoint skimming operation and, impressively, Operation Koala, which resulted in customers ordering videos showing child abuse being arrested in 19 countries following an investigation which began in Australia.</p>

Had she given me prior notice, I might have been in a position to address that. But let us give credit in this debate to Europol for what it has achieved; that is, real, tangible successes. However, the report has highlighted a number of shortcomings, which have been addressed in this debate. The sub-committee concluded that attempts to tackle crime across Europe are being hampered because police  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1762"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1762</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intelligence is not being shared effectively. In the early years of its existence, there was a lack of trust and fear of leaks, which is understandable where matters of intelligence are involved. But we hope that these are lessening as the agency matures.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="09062564000023"></a>A subsidiary, although important, but more easily rectifiable, problem has been the SOCA IT system, which is not compatible with that of Europol, as my noble friend mentioned. In comparison with other problems, this surely can be addressed with reasonable dispatch and we hope that the end of 2010 does not mean what he suspects it might mean. We will welcome the Minister&#146;s assurance on this point, with my noble friend&#146;s trenchant comments ringing in his ears.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="09062564000024"></a>A more fundamental problem arises from the system of liaison officers from member states. This again has been highlighted by the sub-committee and by my noble friend. These liaison officers are, I understand, housed in the same building as Europol. It is hardly surprising that much of the intelligence is shared in person between liaison officers, thus bypassing Europol. As my noble friend said, the Home Office said in its evidence that it was a matter of concern that up to 80 per cent of bilateral engagements are shared in this way. The sub-committee was unequivocal in its criticism. I will quote it; it is significant and to the point:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09062564000067"></a>&#147;For Member States to share information in a limited way through liaison officers is the antithesis of the purpose of Europol, which is the enhancement of the already existing combined effort of the Member States&#146; competent authorities so that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Limited sharing of information will not achieve a common approach to crossborder cooperation against serious crimes&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062564000025"></a>This says it all.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="09062564000026"></a>The liaison system has much to recommend it, not least the rapid exchange of intelligence at the personal level. This is an example of unintended consequences&#151;in this case, the bypassing of Europol. I am pleased that the Government&#146;s response following the Home Office&#146;s concerns states that, on this matter, the Government are prepared to lead by example Yet in their response to the report they have failed properly to address the bypassing issue.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="09062564000027"></a>I am sorry that one of the weak links is a domestic issue within the United Kingdom and not directly concerned with Europol. Again I have to thank my noble friend for raising this. It is the poor liaison between SOCA and the police forces in the United Kingdom, to which the report has drawn attention. As your Lordships will be only too well aware, the creation of SOCA took up a huge amount of parliamentary time and resources. It was launched in 2006 as the UK&#146;s first dedicated enforcement agency responsible for tackling drug trafficking, organised crime, money laundering and identity theft. My party has previously been critical of SOCA&#146;s poor performance. Despite a budget of &#163;894 million over two years and 4,000 staff, the agency achieved only five more convictions in 2007-08 compared with 2006-07&#151;276 against 271. The agency missed three of its five asset-recovery targets.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="09062564000028"></a>We have a further problem with SOCA. The liaison between Europol and national authorities takes place through what is known as the national unit. In the United Kingdom, this national unit is SOCA. The  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1763"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1763</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>report highlighted the fact that SOCA has no counterterrorism unit. That is why it is all the more important that SOCA should work closely with the Metropolitan Police and other forces which have such a remit. The report recognised that, while the relationship between SOCA and Europol was good, the relationship between SOCA and the UK police forces left a lot to be desired. In other words, in the chain &#147;UK police forces-SOCA-Europol&#148;, it is the domestic link that is weak. That must be a potentially serious handicap to the United Kingdom&#146;s leadership in Europol.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="09062564000029"></a>The disappointing performance of SOCA that the report highlights has implications stretching far wider than this debate. The Government have made a robust defence of the present arrangements, emphasising in particular the close liaison between SOCA and the Met. What steps are the Government taking to ensure that this good relationship is being extended to all forces in the United Kingdom? In the Government&#146;s reply they also state that UK forces are engaged regularly and directly with Europol on counterterrorism. What role, if any, does SOCA have in this liaison?</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="09062564000030"></a>The report has highlighted two areas where the United Kingdom can be said to be leading the field: intelligence-led policing and organised crime threat assessment. I am pleased that the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, concentrated on this and gave us such good background. Both these concepts can be said to have been exported by the United Kingdom to other states. I do not want to be denied the privilege of sharing with the many noble Lords in this Chamber that &#147;intelligence-led policing&#148; means moving resources away from retrospective crime investigations to pre-emptive operations based on analysed intelligence. The two areas are recognised by the Government in their response. I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that these important initiatives, which reflect so well on this country, are being maintained and built on.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="09062564000031"></a>The expansion and increasing sophistication of organised crime never sleeps. Europol has the potential of being just the right vehicle to deal with this. The report has provided a valuable service in addressing not only the challenges facing this organisation and some of its shortcomings but also some of its potential. A huge amount of work has gone into the preparation of the report. The House will be grateful to my noble friend, his committee, its clerk and its advisers for this important document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="09062564000033"></a>Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, that I have a marvellous, crafted response from the Box on FRONTEX which says: &#147;We recognise there were some issues a year ago but these have been addressed by the Home Office. Performance improved significantly. We are delivering 79 per cent&#148;. We are getting better, but I have to say that I agree entirely with the noble Lord. The delay of which he spoke was outrageous and completely unacceptable, and it came

I was rather irked by it. I take his point completely. We have learnt the lesson; we are doing better in the Home Office.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="09062564000034"></a>I agree that my colleagues seem to be falling like flies. I feel rather like Admiral Collingwood on the quarterdeck of the &#147;Royal Sovereign&#148; at Trafalgar. The only difference is that I am not munching an apple as they all fall by the side of me. There is an element of that.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="09062564000035"></a>The Government welcome the European Union Committee&#146;s report following its inquiry into Europol. Rather like other speakers, I commend the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, and his committee for conducting such a thorough and wide-ranging review. I join him in thanking all those involved in producing it. The importance of the review should not be underestimated; Europol is a vital element of the European Union&#146;s fight against serious and organised crime. As was said by the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, and a number of other speakers, there are not many things more important to us than that.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="09062564000036"></a>An awful lot in the report was positive, and it is always encouraging to have confirmation where things are working well. However, the inquiry also identified a number of issues which the committee felt should be addressed in order to improve Europol&#146;s capacity and capability to support our law enforcement officers and those of the other European Union member states in their fight against serious and organised crime and terrorism. In their written response to the committee in January this year, the Government acknowledged the findings of the inquiry and, for the most part, fully agreed with the recommendations. It will be useful to update your Lordships on the progress being made on implementing those recommendations, not least to get it in <I>Hansard</I> so that we know exactly where we stand.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="09062564000037"></a>Europol is facing an exciting and challenging time. It has a new director whose immediate priority is to ensure that the organisation is fully prepared for the introduction at the beginning of next year of the new Europol council decision. I am pleased to say that this preparatory work is on schedule for completion by the end of this year. I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, shares our pleasure at the success of Rob Wainwright&#151;his appointment was a very good move and I am delighted that he is there&#151;who was the previous head of the international department at SOCA. Mr Wainwright gave evidence to the inquiry. It will be helpful and valuable that he will have in mind the committee&#146;s recommendations as he approaches his new job. Even though he has been in post for just two months, we are already receiving reports of a more open and engaged approach by Europol to its stakeholders and partners.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="09062564000038"></a>Europol continues to provide significant support to our law enforcement authorities, and there are a number of cases where violent and dangerous international criminals have been brought to justice with Europol&#146;s assistance. The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, quoted some real successes. A typical example is an operation targeting an armed and violent Eastern European gang which committed around 20 armed robberies against high-quality jeweller&#146;s shops in this country and more than 200 similar attacks across the European Union. In an action co-ordinated by Europol, officers  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1765"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1765</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from three UK police forces visited Estonia and, with the support of local authorities, seven suspects were arrested. With further support from Europol, UK police then identified offenders in 16 cases in this country and were able to bring prosecutions in 11 of those.</p>

<a name="90625-0014.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="09062564000039"></a>I mentioned Europol&#146;s new legal base in my opening remarks. The Government believe that the new council decision will introduce a number of benefits when it replaces the Europol convention on 1 January 2010. While negotiation of this new legal instrument was lengthy and sometimes difficult, we are broadly pleased with the outcome. For example, we feel that we have achieved a good balance between extending Europol&#146;s mandate so that it could support investigations into very serious crimes where there was no obvious organised crime link but also limiting Europol&#146;s involvement to the extent that the investigation had to be cross-border in nature and involve at least two member states. It will be helpful that Europol will not now have to prove that a crime was &#147;organised&#148;, which can sometimes take one into rather technical areas of definition. It will be able to contribute its expertise to serious crime, such as multiple murders affecting several member states, but, equally, it will not see its mandate being diluted by being drawn into crimes that are more appropriate to national police investigation.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90625-0015.htm"/>


<a name="90625-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="09062564000040"></a>The Government are also pleased to see a strengthening of the rights of the data subject to gain access to personal information held about them in Europol&#146;s systems and to have personal data deleted where prolonged storage cannot be justified. We note that Europol&#146;s data protection standards exceed those that were envisaged by the data protection framework decision. However, we will continue to press for the highest standards of data security and data protection.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="09062564000041"></a>Another important aspect of Europol&#146;s new legal base is the effect it will have on the roles and the relationship between the Europol management board and the Europol director. We have long believed that the management board has tended to become too involved in the day-to-day activities of Europol, the result being that it could be seen that the position of the director was being undermined. At the same time, the management board has had less time at its disposal to develop its strategic thinking. We believe that the new council decision will be helpful in providing more clarity about the roles as well as a clearer demarcation of responsibilities. In general terms, we expect to see the new director become more responsible for the day-to-day operation of Europol with the management board holding him to account for delivery of his objectives.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="09062564000042"></a>We also felt that the rotation of the chairmanship of the management board every six months with the presidency of the European Union was unhelpful in two respects. First, six months did not give sufficient time to develop an effective working relationship with the director; and, secondly, with such a short tenure, the chairman of the board had little time&#151;and possibly little incentive&#151;to start to develop a long-term strategy for the organisation.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="09062564000043"></a>We share the disappointment of the members of the committee that we were not able to get agreement from a majority of member states during the negotiations  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1766"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1766</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to appoint a board chair by open competition between Europol members. Noble Lords can be assured that we tried very hard. We agree with the view expressed in the inquiry report that there is no logical connection between the nationality of the person best qualified to become the board chair and the country holding the presidency. However, we take some comfort from the compromise that the chair will be identified from among the trio of presidencies to serve for 18 months. This is an improvement on the current situation and we will push to reopen the discussion on the selection of the board chair by open competition when an opportunity to review and amend the legislation next arises. But, of course, any future success will be contingent on a change of attitude by the vast majority of member states. As the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, quite rightly said, it is very wrong that something so important should descend into political, nationality-type bickering. I fear that that sometimes happens in these international organisations; I have seen it happen at times within NATO. We will keep pushing, because it is important to go down that route.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="09062564000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, also spoke about the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, as did the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, my noble friend Lady Henig and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. I would like to touch on the role of SOCA, which has a pivotal role to play in developing and maintaining an effective connection between Europol and our law enforcement agencies. It is the home of the United Kingdom&#146;s national Europol unit, which is connected to Europol by secure communications links for speedy and secure exchange of intelligence material. From within the national unit, SOCA provides a focal point for UK law enforcement agencies to access Europol. We believe that there is already an efficient network of contacts between the Europol national unit and police forces. Each force has an international liaison officer who is the local source of expertise in dealing with international police co-operation and these liaison officers maintain close contact with SOCA.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="09062564000045"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, spoke specifically about this area and we accept that more could be done to improve awareness of police force links with SOCA and about links with Europol in general. More can be done, in particular Europol&#146;s involvement in resolving requests for help submitted to SOCA. We need to do more domestically to promote Europol. SOCA has already started this process through keynote speeches and workshops in its annual international liaison officers&#146; conference, which is attended by representatives of the ACPO forces and key law enforcement partner agencies. Ongoing regional awareness and training events hosted by SOCA are also providing an opportunity to publicise Europol and its capability to a wider audience at the grass roots level of policing the United Kingdom, which is a point specifically raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="09062564000046"></a>Another network that is essential for exchanging information between member states, and between individual member states and Europol, is the network of liaison bureaux established at Europol&#146;s headquarters in The Hague. The 10 UK liaison officers include experts from SOCA, HMRC, the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and the Metropolitan Police  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1767"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1767</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Service. SOCA has a very close working relationship with the Metropolitan Police Service and for the last four years a senior officer from the Met Terrorist Command has been seconded to the UK liaison bureau. This has ensured effective contact with UK police counterterrorism units and other agencies. It ensures that there is full and direct access to Europol&#146;s counterterrorism activities.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="09062564000047"></a>A significant benefit of having a liaison bureau for every member state is the opportunity for bilateral and multilateral information exchange. Your Lordships can imagine how convenient it is to simply walk a few yards and to have access to counterparts from all other member states who can provide information and support to aid our criminal investigations. The Government accept that the vast majority of the interactions simply bypass Europol. The information gathered from these bilateral exchanges is rarely entered into Europol&#146;s systems and the opportunity for collecting potentially useful intelligence is lost. The issue is one that affects all member states to one degree or another, but we have taken a lead and SOCA now routinely copies details of its bilateral exchanges, sensitivity permitting. The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, mentioned the sensitivity issue but it is extremely difficult sometimes. We cannot see how we can arrive at a position where we can totally share all data. There will always be some issues that are so sensitive that you have to get approval from a bilateral partner who you got it from. If they do not give that, it is extremely difficult to do that. While ideally it would be lovely to share everything, it is quite difficult in some of these intelligence areas.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="09062564000048"></a>Europol has established a front office which can receive such information even where it does not fall within one of the existing analytical work files. This, allied to our initiative, is increasing our engagement with Europol. The UK at the level of heads of national unit meeting and at the Europol management board has actively promoted these steps and received considerable support from the other member states.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="09062564000049"></a>A key function of the Europol national unit is to provide information to Europol&#146;s information system. This is essentially an indexing system enabling law enforcement to find data obtained by member states. Europol information system has the potential to link individuals who have been arrested or are under investigation and once these links are identified then traditional international police co-operation can take over. The noble Lord, Lord Joplin, quite rightly focused on information sharing and your Lordships will appreciate that the information system will only realise its potential if member states send their material in large volumes to Europol. As we have heard, the UK is one of the many member states that is not yet able to upload large volumes of data to the Europol information system. What information that is currently transmitted by SOCA is of high quality but it has to be input manually and this is resource intensive. In order to use the automatic data loader facility SOCA has to replace its legacy database system.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="09062564000050"></a>Progress has also been made on connecting police forces to the Europol information system. The Metropolitan Police are now connected via the secure  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1768"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1768</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>police national network. Europol experts visited the UK in April to provide the necessary training and they will return in July to provide further training.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="09062564000051"></a>SOCA has revised its policy of rolling out access to the Europol information system to individual forces in favour of a regional approach. Plans are well advanced for the creation of regional intelligence units and these will be linked to the Europol information system as a priority. This will extend the reach of the system to police forces far more quickly and in a more focused way. Following the rollout of this regional approach, SOCA will review further connectivity once the impact of linking the Europol information system to the regional units has been assessed.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="09062564000052"></a>In its deliberations, the committee also took a close look at Europol and made a number of recommendations for improving that organisation&#146;s capability. An initiative of the United Kingdom presidency in 2005 was the introduction to Europol of the concept of intelligence-led policing principles. I thank my noble friend Lady Henig for her strong support of what has been done there. It was mentioned by a number of other speakers as well. SOCA manages a national intelligence framework to support inter-agency activity against the main serious and organised crime threats to this country.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="09062564000053"></a>There are three key elements to this approach&#151;an intelligence gathering process; a threat assessment; and a control strategy. Europol has embraced this concept in the form of the European criminal intelligence model and the most obvious manifestation of this approach is the production by Europol of the third annual organised crime threat assessment&#151;or OCTA&#151;which was approved by the Council in July 2008.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="09062564000054"></a>The European criminal intelligence model includes an intelligence-gathering requirement used by Europol to collect information from member states and EU agencies and organisations. It is the collection of this core information that we feel needs to be further developed. The model is still in its infancy, but we are optimistic that we can go forward in this and we are working hard to develop it. Last year, at the request of the Council, Europol drafted a threat assessment on the impact on the EU member states of Russian organised crime&#151;the so-called ROCTA&#151;and this represents another step in the application of the European criminal intelligence model.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="09062564000055"></a>Following the development of the organised crime threat assessment, Europol drafts specific threat assessments which support political decision-making. It is very encouraging that Europol&#146;s draft work programme 2010 contains at least two objectives that promote the use of intelligence-led policing.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a><a name="09062564000056"></a>It is a source of optimism to the Government that the new Europol director was responsible for the introduction of the intelligence-led policing concept to Europol when he chaired the management board during our presidency in 2005. I am confident that the future of intelligence-led policing is in the best hands and Europol will continue to be promoted across the European Union.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="09062564000057"></a>We recognise that Europol can function effectively as an information exchange agent only if its partners are willing to share information. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, confidence is an important issue.  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1769"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1769</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We have heard concerns voiced by some member states about Europol&#146;s ability to keep secure data. Some member states feel that Europol is a bit distant and disengaged from them. However, we are confident that Europol has very stringent data security and data protection rules and compliance is overseen by internal and external oversight functions. But we shared the concern voiced by the committee when the then Europol director said in evidence that he delegated overall responsibility for security to one of his deputy directors. Noble Lords can be assured that the current Europol director takes his security responsibilities extremely seriously and has indicated that he does take personal responsibility for security. We absolutely support that line.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="09062564000058"></a>Another security issue that emerged from the inquiry was the time taken by some member states to respond to security clearance information requests from Europol when their nationals take up employment contracts with the organisation. Until they are security cleared, such staff have only limited access. Apart from that being an inefficient use of the resources that could be at its disposal, we would acknowledge that the suggestion of staff being at Europol without security clearance will not engender confidence in the minds of the users of Europol&#146;s service. I am pleased to say that that issue is currently being considered by a working group and along with a number of other member states we are taking a firm line on improving the situation.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="09062564000059"></a>I hope that I have painted a picture that shows a positive response to the recommendations made by the Home Affairs Sub-Committee. There is a way to go, but not all the solutions lie in our hands. We can and are getting our house in order but of course the United Kingdom is just one of 27 member states which use Europol&#146;s services. Through our seat on the management board we can encourage our partners to increase their engagement with Europol, and of course we are doing that.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="09062564000060"></a>Europol itself has a very critical role to play in promoting awareness of its services. I am extremely heartened to note the objective in the current Europol work programme that aims to enhance the trust and confidence in all those involved and to improve the exchange of information with Europol national units and liaison bureaux.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="09062564000061"></a>There are a couple of other points that I have not answered yet. The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, talked about the problems in delays in appointing Europol directors. Part of the problem is the selection process, which did not provide sufficient evidence of the strengths of the candidate to rebut claims from candidates who  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1770"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column 1770</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are not proposed for appointment. The selection process has already been revised and is in place for the current selection of deputy director, which will be a lot better.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="09062564000062"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jopling, also asked about ACPO. If ACPO was asked now, it would say that things have improved a great deal but that there is also still much to be done, especially in linking forces with Europe. Your Lordships have heard what we are doing to try to achieve that. My noble friend Lady Henig and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, talked about accountability. We agree that Europol should be held accountable. There is a role here for the European Parliament and national parliaments. We will continue to push for greater accountability in that area.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="09062564000063"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, said that SOCA had not achieved what it had hoped to achieve and that, indeed, perhaps it was not achieving very much. The formation of SOCA was highly complex, pulling together five national organisations. It is now beginning to function properly and is moving forward. There is no doubt that the big, serious criminal groups are very concerned about SOCA. However, the noble Viscount is absolutely right that the liaison between the police and SOCA in this country is not as good as it should be. A small part of this is turf warfare, people saying, &#147;We did that; you did that&#148;, or whatever it might be. It has to be made better. I am absolutely sure that we are going down the right track and that it will get better. That SOCA has such a good link with Europol can perhaps help the disjointedness that it has in working with our own police force, which is absolutely the way forward.</p>

<a name="90625-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="09062564000064"></a>I hope that I have covered the majority of points. I have gone slightly over my time. I apologise if I have missed anything. This has been a useful and valuable debate. I thank everyone who was involved in it. It is important to get these matters into <I>Hansar</I><I>d </I>and to get people talking about them. The Government thank the noble Lord and his committee.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000002"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062557000446"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> We had a substantial discussion about the possibility of the removal of eligibility for income support at our last meeting. Several of us made it very clear that we had received letters from women&#151;mostly carers&#151;who were concerned lest their income support be removed and not replaced by anything else. We had some assurances from the Minister, who made it quite clear that he understood these worries. Indeed, he committed that there would no removal of eligibility except after an affirmative resolution. We are very grateful for that. On the other hand, there are a lot of very concerned people out there. A lot of people are worried that they may lose their entitlement to income support, and income support is all that they have to exist on, particularly if they are carers.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000003"></a>In particular, I brought to the Committee&#146;s notice a letter that I had received from a woman who was the carer for a disabled child. Quite clearly she was concerned that she would have her income support removed and not replaced by anything else unless she committed herself to waged work or work-related activity. It therefore seemed worth pursuing this amendment, the text of which was suggested by the TUC. As I said last time, the TUC is also very concerned about this because the clause gives the impression that there would be a substantial investigation by people concerned with social security, hence the requirement in the amendment that it be removed only following examination of the proposal to do so by the Social Security Advisory Committee. That would give further assurances to the people who have written to me, and to others who are so concerned that the income support that they have relied on may disappear without anything taking its place unless they commit themselves to work-related activity or some sort of waged employment. For those reasons, I think it is worth pursuing. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000004"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062557000447"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> As the noble Baroness, Lady Turner said, we had a substantial debate on this in the last sitting of the Grand Committee, but it is no bad thing that she has moved her amendment. I am a huge fan of the Social Security Advisory Committee  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC480"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC480</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and very much admire its reports, which I draw on a lot when I speak. This is a good safeguard but I hope the Minister will tell us that we will get a report from the advisory committee anyway, under either the affirmative order or the negative procedure. It should be affirmative because he has promised us that it will be, as long as it is not brought in within six months of the passing of the Bill. The advisory committee does not look at any proposal of under six months, does it? I think that is right, but perhaps the Minister could confirm it. We very much need the advisory committee&#146;s wise words; the noble Baroness is quite right.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000005"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062557000448"></a>Baroness Afshar:</b> I add my support. In some of the letters that I have seen sent to lone parents, the last thing that seems to have been of concern is whether they were able to do waged work. The letters emphatically state that they will lose their benefits unless they present themselves for work. For many single parents and many other women it is not that easy because they do not have easy access to good transport and they do not have the time to do it. When they will be free is very unpredictable. I very much hope that this amendment will be included.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000006"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062557000449"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> The Committee will realise, if it remembers what I said on the last group of amendments, that I am sympathetic to the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, on this one. However, I am not so sure that just putting the amendment into the Bill will be enough to satisfy those people from whom she has received correspondence.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000007"></a>I note from page 23 of the Peers&#146; information pack that, after the Bill gets cracking, 13 groups of people will remain on income support until they are migrated. As I understand the matter&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;that is to be by statutory instrument for each group, so we will be able to look exactly at how the modified JSA affects individual groups under, presumably, some sort of period; I cannot imagine that it will all be done rapidly. A lot of thought will have to be given to those on income support who are entitled to statutory sick pay, for example, or&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, would be interested in this&#151;people involved in trade disputes. Each will have a slightly different formulation.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000008"></a>I cannot yet discover something; perhaps the Minister will help us. Page 23 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000386"></a>&#147;With the exception of sick and disabled claimants and possibly those in receipt of statutory sick pay DWP plans to move them all onto the modified form of jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000368"></a>The question behind the amendment is really whether the modified formulation of JSA will be appropriate to each and every one of the 13 groups. That is what the Minister needs to answer.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC481"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC481</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>On the issue about reference and engagement of the SSAC, I hope that I can specifically satisfy her on why it is not necessary for the provision to be in the form that she proposes.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000010"></a>The amendment is aimed at ensuring that we cannot remove entitlement to income support from any category of person without the SSAC&#146;s thorough examination of the proposals. Throughout the process, we have always maintained that abolishing income support is the next logical step in streamlining and simplifying the benefit system. It builds on much of the work we have already done and will move us to a system based on two main benefits for people of working age&#151;employment and support allowance and jobseeker&#146;s allowance. However, we have also maintained that the process cannot be rushed; I say that in response to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. Step-by-step change is the only way we can ensure safe delivery and minimise disruption for our customers. Income support will be abolished only when there are no longer any groups for which it is needed, because alternative provision will have been made using either the new powers in Clause 3 or other available powers.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000011"></a>Although we have not made any final decisions yet, at this stage we do not expect to move everyone off income support at the same time. We have made it clear in previous debates that we will need to look carefully at the position of certain groups, particularly carers, which is why we need the flexibility that the clause provides.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000012"></a>On that basis, the removal of entitlement to income support for most groups is likely to be achieved through regulations made under Section 124 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. As a result, they will be subject to scrutiny by the advisory committee as part of its statutory duty to examine any regulations under Acts of Parliament governing social security.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000013"></a>It is true that when the clause is commenced, there may be some groups who have not yet moved off income support, although we will have set out where they will be moving to. As a result, the committee may not have the formal role suggested by the amendment when they are moved off it. However, in practice, we will continue to talk to the SSAC on issues such as this. There are voluntary arrangements currently in place that allow us to provide the committee with information on new legislation that would not normally fall within its remit. This includes new primary powers and the regulations made within six months of the commencement of those powers&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, quite correctly referred to that. These arrangements are certainly something that we would pursue in respect of the clause.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000014"></a>Furthermore, as I said earlier, we have accepted the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Committee, which concluded that Clause 7 should be subject to affirmative procedures, and will be tabling an amendment on Report to do just that.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000015"></a>I reiterate that income support is not abolished in the Bill; the Bill provides a mechanism to abolish income support by order. One of the main reasons for that approach is that there is no firm timetable because of the need for flexibility to ensure that all groups are  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC482"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC482</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>properly provided for. The Bill provides for income support to be abolished when there are no longer any groups who need it, but not before. To reiterate, no firm decision has yet been taken on the timetable.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000016"></a>I hope that that is a reassurance to my noble friend and other noble Lords who have spoken that the SSAC will inevitably be involved in the detail as these matters move forward.</p>

After all, these groups will no longer be on income support; there will be no income support customers for whom income support will be abolished. I therefore repeat my comment last Monday that it seems a very strange use of parliamentary time to use the affirmative procedure in those circumstances.</p>

I listened to what my noble friend said with considerable interest. I think he went quite some way to deal with the concerns expressed by all of us about the letters we have had from women who are very worried that they will not get any benefit at all if they do not sign up for a work-related or other kind of commitment. I made a careful note when he said that no groups will be excluded or lose their entitlement before they have any other entitlement. In other words, individuals will not be simply left without anything. That is very important. People are concerned that if they do not sign up they will lose any benefit. It is important to have on the record that it is not the intention that groups of any kind should be left without an income, irrespective of what they may have in the way of caring or other commitments and so on.</p>

I agreed to table the amendment as it did not get much of an airing in another place. I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, have added their names to that of my noble friend Lord Taylor and my own.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000025"></a>The amendment would work by giving all ESA claimants an entitlement to an assessment carried out by, or linked to, Access to Work funding, to determine what adjustments might reasonably be made to improve the likelihood of a pension should they find employment. A claimant would not be compelled to undertake compulsory work-related activity until this assessment had taken place. The amendment would ensure that reasonable adjustments recommended in the assessment are to be funded through Access to Work, and are to be available to any employer.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000026"></a>Access to Work is of course administered by Jobcentre Plus and aims to assist people with a disability or health condition who are in paid employment or about to start a job by providing practical support and help to meet additional costs associated with overcoming work-related obstacles resulting from their disability or health condition. Dame Carol Black&#146;s review of employment, which the Minister and I were discussing in part last night, called for tailored support for people out of work, in both finding employment and keeping it. The scheme proposed in the amendment should be seen in this context, as a complement to existing schemes, very much in tune with the individual nature of the action plans that we have been developing.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000027"></a>Evidence gathered by the organisation that developed the amendment suggests that Access to Work does not yet work effectively for people with mental health problems. Too few people with mental health problems are taking advantage of the scheme, and employers do not have sufficient support and understanding.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000028"></a>In 2007-08, just 180 claims to Access to Work were made for mental health adjustments out of an overall total of just under 30,000. This seems, to me at least, to be a painfully low figure. The conclusion that one comes to is that if we can create greater flexibility in the timing of Access to Work assessments so that people can receive an estimate of the support they can expect to receive, take-up would improve and one hopes that employer discrimination would be reduced. Individual assessments before interview would help make people with mental health problems more attractive to employers. These adjustments should follow the person through their career to ensure that barriers are not perpetuated for people with mental health problems as they progress through that career. We must presume that it will be a powerful counterbalance to the fears of an employer of costs involved in adjustments and potential time off if a person is able to explain how much help Access to Work is likely to provide to the firm they are trying to work for.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000029"></a>I shall be very interested to hear the views of other noble Lords on this matter, not least the Minister, because I feel that we have an opportunity to address an area where we know there to be a weakness in the system; namely, helping those with diagnosed mental health problems to get into and retain employment. I beg to move.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC485"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC485</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09062557000030"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09062557000460"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> We strongly support this amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said, it brings us to a discussion about an entitlement to an assessment under the admirable Access to Work scheme for those with a diagnosed mental health problem which impacts&#151;as the amendment says&#151;on their ability to undertake work.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000031"></a>Last year the funding of Access to Work was doubled but there is no evidence yet to suggest that it is working particularly well in the mental health field, as the noble Lord has just said, or for people with learning difficulties, although I accept that the latter category of people are not specified in this amendment. What is clear is that far too few employers understand what Access to Work is all about. If there is some understanding about help for those with mobility problems, there is even less understanding about help for those with mental health problems. The amendment would ensure that all ESA claimants in the employment group would be entitled to an assessment with a view to determining the necessary adjustments needed under the Access to Work fund to enable them eventually to find and then keep a job, which is a very practical way of helping both claimants and prospective employers. As MIND has said, Access to Work does not support individuals to &#147;sell&#148; themselves to prospective employers at present as it is not perceived to be part of an individual&#146;s &#147;capital&#148;. Often, the slow bureaucracy puts people at a severe disadvantage.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000032"></a>Another very important voice in this whole debate is the committee we have just been talking about&#151;the Social Security Advisory Committee, which says that the engagement of small and medium-sized enterprise employers with the whole issue of the reasonable adaptations that need to be made to overcome barriers for disabled people has not been considered in enough depth. In particular, it stresses that the needs of those with fluctuating mental health conditions should be considered more fully. I shall come back to that in a moment. The committee makes the point that engagement with employers is important, as is the education and training provided to personal advisers in providing services to claimants in this position. As I have said before, that has been something of a leitmotiv through this whole Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000033"></a>Coming back to the mental health issue, two groups of people with severe mental health problems have been brought to my attention in the past few days, about whom there is great concern. There is a letter in today&#146;s <I>Guardian</I> about it. These are mostly people with schizophrenia and those who are bipolar. These are serious but fluctuating conditions with a wide range of characteristics. It is quite possible that claimants who suffer from either condition will be in the employment rather than in the support group, and will therefore be expected to be on the journey into work by undertaking work-related activity. I could have raised this issue under a Clause 8 stand part debate, but I hope that noble Lords will agree that it is relevant enough to this amendment to raise it here.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000034"></a>Others in this Grand Committee know far more about schizophrenia than I do, but I have taken some instruction from my noble friend Lord Alderdice, who is a psychiatrist. He said that when people who have

Those who work in the field are extremely concerned about this possibility and, although it is not strictly relevant to the amendment, I hope the noble Baroness will address this concern.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000035"></a>As the <I>Guardian</I> letter says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000395"></a>&#147;We need a system in which people suffering fluctuating conditions are able to move in and out of work without fear of punishment or loss of income. It will require flexibility in a properly funded system, government support for employers, an integration of non-coercive support, therapy and care for people with mental illness. Instead of the Bill contributing to the problem of mental illness in Britain, it could become part of the solution&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000369"></a>The last sentence is important because it demonstrates that the kind of support outlined in part in the amendment is what people are calling for, and not that those with fluctuating mental health conditions should be exempt from seeking work. One scheme which is having some success in the pathfinder project is the condition management programme and I wonder whether there are any plans to expand it under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000036"></a>An offer for paid-for adjustments through the Access to Work fund would make prospective employees with a history of mental health problems much more attractive to employers. What could this mean in practice? It could mean providing in the short term a potential employee with a personal mentor or a job coach, or, in the longer term, a counsellor or support worker, or even a travel companion to and from work.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000037"></a>The more I look at the amendment, the more important I believe it to be. Making the Access to Work scheme fully portable and likely to be available before a person has left the jobcentre would also be a very positive step. I look forward to the rest of the debate and to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

I was, therefore, very much involved in all the work leading up to the amendment, not in the drafting but certainly in the posing.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000039"></a>I have mentioned many times, in connection not only with this Bill but other Bills that are going through the House at this time, the fact that I find it extraordinary that no assessment has been made of the impact of any of these Bills on any other Bills. At the moment, those of us who are involved in the apprenticeships Bill are also involved in the assessment of those with mental health and learning difficulties to ensure that they get education. Why should these not have come together? The Committee will not be surprised that I, as a former Chief Inspector of Prisons, find it extraordinary that the needs of prisoners with mental health problems are not addressed either in the Coroners and Justice Bill from the Ministry of Justice or in the Policing and Crime Bill from the Home Office, when both are concerned with diverting people with mental health problems away from prison and into places where they should be properly treated. In other words, we go round and round trying to find a place to inject.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000040"></a>This month the Sainsbury Centre has published a document called <I>Measuring What Matters</I>, which will not have reached everyone yet because I got it only  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC487"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>yesterday. It is about measuring the size of the problem which is included in the amendment, together with a guide as to what that assessment might be. Rather than be just a guide, it is based on pilots that have been conducted in 17 sites around the country over the past two years. The pilots were to find out the size and shape of the problem and how getting people with mental health problems into employment was being tackled. I shall not bore the Committee, even if there was time, with all the details, but some of the measures in the report&#151;which I commend&#151;are very significant. When talking about participation in the pilot, which included the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health, it said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000396"></a>&#147;In general, the level of engagement of commissioners in the project was poor ... The engagement of employment service providers, particularly those from the independent sector, was far more encouraging ... Local &#145;champions&#146; were invaluable in facilitating adoption of the framework&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09062557000370"></a>because they were the people who were,</p>
<ul><a name="09062557000417"></a>&#147;capable of winning over the &#145;hearts and minds&#146; of busy clinicians and key managers&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062557000371"></a>and:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000397"></a>&#147;There was no doubt that those sites which invested most fully in the project gained the most benefits&#148;.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000041"></a>If we are talking about helping people into work and maintaining that work, we are actually talking about what the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, was just now: the individual placement and support model, which has been in action since 1994. It remains the best model to be followed. It is absolutely what it says: individual placement and support. The point is that all these people are individuals with individual problems. You cannot predict them; you cannot put them into great groups. Each one has to be handled separately. The message to each and every group of commissioners and providers around the country is that they must be prepared to deal with these people.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000042"></a>The interesting facts and figures show that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000398"></a>&#147;In most sites, two-fifths of incapacity benefit claimants were out of work because of &#145;mental health and behavioural disorders&#146;, while only one-fifth of people of working age in contact with specialist mental health services were in paid employment&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000372"></a>&#147;Only one-fifth&#148; out of the whole lot is something for which we should take no credit.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000043"></a>The Minister and others should take the amendment very seriously. Its importance is that it comes from people who have been doing this work on the ground with these people over many years but particularly for the past two years. None of us in this House really has the benefit of them. We meet them, we hear them and we are briefed by them, but we have not actually been doing the work. In my experience, there is no substitute for those who have actually done it, which is why I so strongly support this amendment.</p>

My only regret is that I did not table an amendment to the amendment to include people with fluctuating medical conditions.

<p><a name="09062557000045"></a>The Minister will have had a letter this week, I hope, from a lady called Sarah Smith, who describes how she has tried and tried to work but eventually had to give up. She has been rejected by Atos Healthcare twice and has appealed. This is no way to treat people who are trying to work. They need support and assistance, so I support the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale.</p>

In some ways, it is one of the most important amendments of the whole lot in terms of the Government&#146;s own objective of getting 1 million people off employment support allowance within, I think, 10 years, particularly when 40 per cent of people on the employment support allowance have mental health problems.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000047"></a>Although I have not done the work of individual placement and support, I have spoken to a number of people who have, and we have introduced those sorts of workers across my own mental health trust in east London in all our community mental health teams. They are working to help people through the applications and interview process, to help employers, and to help the individual to hang on to a job as best they can once they are in it. This is the hard end of mental health, but the Access to Work programme has tremendous potential to contribute fundamentally and significantly to the Government&#146;s objective.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000048"></a>Obviously I should not encourage money to be diverted from physical disability to mental health, so I am not suggesting that, but ultimately one wishes more money to come into this wonderful programme so that far more people with mental health problems could be included. I hope that the Minister will take seriously the comments already made well by other noble Lords. If the Government want to achieve their objective, they need to take the amendment seriously.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000049"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062557000464"></a>Baroness Afshar:</b> I add my support, particularly due to the considerable invisibility of mental health among minorities because of the unwillingness of people to admit to having mental health issues. It is a taboo and not expected. If there is a tailor-made programme developed in conversation with particular women or men, they may be able and willing to find out what is wrong with them to seek the appropriate treatment and go on to work. That would be an enormously helpful step.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000051"></a>I support the amendment. The wording of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, really encompasses some of the core problems that we have been trying to address throughout the Bill, particularly on people with mental health problems. It is a mechanism that would enable us to tackle this in a way that would reassure many of us that the problem is being taken seriously. The rest has been said eloquently by others.</p>

I understand the aims of this laudable amendment, and the Government do indeed take it seriously. However, we have a number of difficulties associated with it.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000053"></a>The amendment seeks to ensure that everyone with a diagnosed mental health condition should be assessed before they carry out any work-related activity, so that any reasonable adjustments are made once someone finds work. This is unnecessary, in the sense that we already cover this ground; I will obviously go on to expand on that. It duplicates existing provision, is impractical and would introduce extra bureaucracy and quite serious cost.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000054"></a>It is unnecessary because we already assess an individual&#146;s needs and have provision in place to ensure that they are met. We do this in a number of ways. The noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, talked about the importance of keeping flexibility in the system and keeping that relationship personal. Within the employment and support allowance, as part of the work capability assessment, we carry out a work-focused health-related assessment. This assessment explores the impact of a claimant&#146;s health condition and their barriers to work. This assessment is carried out in a face-to-face interview with the claimant by a health professional, and the outcome is then passed on to the personal adviser.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000055"></a>In addition to this, work-focused interviews are designed especially to discuss positive steps towards work. In many cases, this will involve a discussion around the need for particular adjustments to be made should an individual move into a job. Support through Pathways to Work provides help to move closer to the labour market, and to look for work.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000056"></a>Clause 8 will give a personal adviser the power to direct a customer to a work-related activity in prescribed circumstances. This direction must be reasonable, having regard to a person&#146;s circumstances. This will of course include the customer&#146;s health condition. An additional assessment, therefore, is not necessary given that Clause 8 will cover these areas.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000057"></a>Access to work already provides an assessment for anyone who may require in-work support once they have a job offer or a job interview.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000064"></a>Crucially, this assessment identifies the specific support required to undertake a particular role. Given this, we believe the amendment is impractical because it is impossible to determine what reasonable adjustment someone might need until you know what job they are going to do. The amendment would have us carry out assessments before someone even begins a work-related activity. For many people, an initial work-related activity might stabilise their home life through their attendance, for instance, at debt management classes or confidence-building sessions.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000065"></a>While these first steps may be crucial in an individual&#146;s return to work path, they would tell us little about what work the claimant would want to do in the future. Without knowing exactly what type of work the claimant would like to do, we would not be able to work out what reasonable adjustments would be appropriate. The right adjustments would be different between different types of job&#151;for example, between an administrative job, a sales job or a manufacturing job. What is reasonable will depend on the employer; for instance, what is reasonable for a huge multinational will be different from what is reasonable for a small business.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000066"></a>The amendment would add extra bureaucracy as it might mean an additional assessment on top of the ones that I have described. It is right that we ask customers to come to a medical assessment and to come to interviews to help them think about ways of getting back to work, but the amendment would add another meeting and another person to speak to. This could be confusing, especially when the assessments and the interviews we are already carrying out perform many of the same functions.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000067"></a>It would add extra costs. Access to work currently reaches around 28,000 people each year and we accept that it should reach more people, a point made very clearly by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, in his opening remarks. This is why we have announced that we are doubling the funding by 2013-14, which the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, acknowledged. However, the additional cost of the amendment would be around three-quarters of a billion pounds and, as discussed earlier, much of it would duplicate existing provision or serve no practical purpose.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000068"></a>We do not think that it is right that the Government should have to fund all the costs of reasonable adjustments. The Disability Discrimination Act enshrined the principle that the employer should bear those costs which are reasonable, and we believe that this remains right. Access to work should pick up the costs that the employer would have difficulty in meeting or which are not reasonable.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000069"></a>As I have said, we believe the amendment is unnecessary and has a cost problem.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000070"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09062557000473"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> We all know the problem is that employers do not want to take on people with mental health problems and will not take them on if the Government are not able to provide the support that an employer would not normally provide for an employee. They want someone to be there when the employee is feeling challenged or stressed; someone who the manager can phone up and say, &#147;Look, we are really having

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000071"></a>The noble Baroness rightly says that employers must take on reasonable responsibilities, but where people have fluctuating mental health problems it is very difficult. We all talk about stigma on the part of employers. I am not sure that I fully accept that. There are real problems that the rest of society must recognise and bear.</p>

The Access to Work scheme is not always well known to employers. Nor are they always aware that there is back-up support, which could obviously colour the way in which they view a potential employee. We are running two pilots in Hammersmith and Islington in conjunction with MIND to determine how we can extend the Access to Work scheme to make it more sensitive to the needs of people with fluctuating conditions, and to ascertain when people need practical support such as an extra support person or other material support. MIND is working with the Government on that. We are not by any means saying that the scheme is a panacea. However, we are saying that it needs to be promoted more widely and that employers need to know more about it. It has been described as the Government&#146;s best kept secret. That is no good. Its funding has been doubled so it needs to be out there, working for people. A number of questions&#151;</p>

However, there is a disconnect between what she has outlined and comments from people on the ground who say that, despite the strong steer from policy and research to set up evidence-based, supported employment services, very few places in the United Kingdom can say with any authority that they are actually doing it, or that it is working. That is coming from people on the ground. As I say, there is a disconnect between what people would like to happen, and like to think is happening, and what is actually happening, and that is what worries us.</p>

The information I have concerns making both customer and employer more aware of the scheme, ensuring that the scheme is promoted and developing partnerships through which it is promoted. That work needs to be more effective. A dialogue is being conducted with UNISON, Remploy and Unite to ascertain how to make their members more aware of Access to Work. We believe that Access to Work is a very good scheme and that it is not being promoted as effectively as we would wish. However, I shall certainly get back to the noble Lord on the point he made.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000082"></a>While I am on my feet, I ask the noble Baroness whether she will arrange for us to have another meeting with Atos to find out exactly what it is up to; we are getting not just one or two but numerous very bad reports about the way in which Atos is treating claimants.</p>

She asked whether that would be in the support group. The work capability assessment assesses function, not diagnosis. It is important that we look at people genuinely as individuals, not simply by diagnosis. Again, that involves talking to every individual and trying to have a tailor-made scheme for them.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000085"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, talked about condition management programmes. They are already available on a national basis to all incapacity benefit and ESA customers. I agree that they are a valuable part of the Pathways to Work programme.</p>

We agree that joining up services and policy is extremely important. We work closely with colleagues in DCSF, the Department of Health, Communities and Local Government and the Treasury, as well as the devolved Administrations. That is our response to the question why there is not more joined-up government.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000089"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, talked about the IPS model. We agree that individual placement and support has the potential to be valuable to people with severe and enduring mental health conditions. The recent review of mental health led by Rachel Perkins, which was announced by the then Secretary of State, has within its remit looking at how models such as IPS can improve our provision. So we are looking at that as a result of the Perkins review.</p>

For me, the amendment gets it the wrong way around. Can my noble friend tell us, or perhaps write, which fund, if any, the personal adviser could use to attach to somebody who is on or has migrated to ESA, so to speak, a dowry that they can take with them into employment situations which can then be drawn down in a particular circumstance?</p>

<a name="90625-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000091"></a>I do not think that the amendment would work. There is no way that you can tell what reasonable adjustment may or may not be needed for somebody who has a physical disability in a particular job, with particular stresses, colleagues and so on. However, if we knew, through their adviser, that that person had a dowry, so to speak, that could be drawn down when the need arose, that would cut the costs down to something more like &#163;100 million rather than the &#163;500 million that my noble friend was talking about. That would be much more flexible and would not require an unsuitable pre-assessment without knowing the conditions of employment.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000095"></a>I was grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, who pointed out that far too few employers understand the needs of people, even when they want minor changes to activities in the workplace. Pace the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, these may be physical changes&#151;a slight adaptation to a piece of machinery, or whatever&#151;or more psychological changes, such as working practices.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000096"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, spoke in particular of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia sufferers. I referred on the first or second day in Committee&#151;my memory fails me&#151;to a correspondent who had a compulsive hand-washing bipolar effect. I am very conscious of that, and I am sure that we will go back to it. Incidentally, I have a feeling that I gave that letter to the Minister, and have not yet had a response to it, but I suppose that it is in the pipeline somewhere. Clearly, the system must help people to find work. That is what the entire Bill is about. In a nutshell, it is about helping people to help themselves to end up in employment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000097"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, an adviser to the Sainsbury group, talked about the opposite of joined-up government, and I could not agree with him more. It just so happens that, as he mentioned, we have three, if not four, Bills going through at the same time. However, it can often be over a matter of several years. Individual noble Lords with particular interests have to look at each particular one to try and get some sort of similarity across the board, which the Government seem totally incapable of doing for themselves. That is a great shame. He was talking about what happened on the ground and joined-up local policies, although he did not quite put it like that. The situations can be quite different. As I am sure he will admit, it is very much a postcode lottery. However, he is right to mention an ideal situation in a particular part of the country. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, made much the same sort of point.</p>
<h5><a name="09062557000431"></a>3 pm</h5>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000098"></a>As I said, the Minister talked about it being a laudable amendment, and then said that everyone should be assessed and that the matter was already covered. Yes, if I had stopped at &#147;assessment&#148; in the fourth line and left out the rest, she would have had no complaint whatsoever. The thing that really worries her is the rear end of subsection (1) in the proposed new clause, which states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09062557000418"></a>&#147;this assessment must be carried out before the claimant may be compelled to undertake any compulsory work-related activity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062557000373"></a>On reflection, she is right; that is not the moment when the assessment is needed. However, an assessment is needed when the individuals we are talking about are close to the workplace, because they do not carry a potential pot of money&#151;the dowry of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis&#151;with them when they apply for jobs. That is the real basis of the amendment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000099"></a>I take the points of all noble Lords who have spoken. I will certainly come back to the matter again in a different formulation once I have taken advice on what it would be. It is clear that there is something rotten in the state of Denmark. With those words, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I mention, simply for the record, that Amendment 96 is purely consequential on Amendment 95. I shall also speak to Amendments 97, 98, 105, 106, 113 and 114, which are in my name. If noble Lords will forgive me, I will address clause stand part before my individual amendments. I am grateful, by the way, to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, DrugScope, Release, the BMA and the National Association of Probation Officers, which have provided valuable briefing for the debate.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000101"></a>I am sure that we all share the same objectives, and the Government, in proposing Clause 9, are no exception. We want a reduction in the number of people whose lives are blighted by their dependence on drugs. We want the system to address any difficulties experienced by that group due to their illiteracy, lack of numeracy, and often non-existent accommodation and fractured relationships. Eventually, efforts directed at those problems will pave the way for people addicted to drugs to find their way into work. There is no short cut. The point that I&#151;and, I believe, others&#151;wish to make is that Clause 9, based as it is on coercion and compulsion, will not work.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000102"></a>Perhaps the best evidence for that assertion is the fact that the Government recently abandoned a similar regime for offenders on community sentences. In pilot areas, claimants face sanctions for failing to comply with a court order under those sentences. The Government have concluded that that approach has been an expensive failure, resulting in only a 1.8 per cent improvement in compliance and costing &#163;5.60 in public funds for every &#163;1 saved. I am sure that those figures are familiar to the Minister. The conclusion is that sanctions could deepen poverty, entrench marginalisation, increase crime and put extra pressure on the finances of families supporting people with drug problems; they have a difficult job on their hands. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on the Government&#146;s experience of the programme that I have referred to.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000103"></a>Another key point is that there is no additional investment proposed for the treatment envisaged by Clause 9. The impact statement for the Bill states that additional costs are likely to be incurred by the Department of Health from the extra places in drug treatment. I understand that the DWP assumes that these resources will become available through what it terms &#147;reprioritisation&#148;. As the chairman of a mental health trust, I suggest that this is more than a little optimistic, particularly in the coming decade when we will all be cutting back on the services that we deliver. Believe me, the primary care trusts do not give any kind of priority to people with drug addictions. We find it very hard to persuade them to give us money to set up even those limited services that we provide.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000104"></a>The probation service probably has a better understanding of this needy group than anyone else. It currently supervises over 240,000 people, at least two-thirds of whom are drug-dependent; 84 per cent of whom have literacy problems and the literacy level of an 11 year-old or lower; and the vast majority of whom are unemployable. NAPO makes the point that many other drug users have escaped the notice of the criminal justice system, meaning that potentially tens of thousands of people could be subject to the sanctions regime. Apart from anything else, there will not be the resources in place to deal with the number of people involved. All these comments apply to drug-dependent people. The number of claimants caught up in the sanctions system could multiply many times over if those with a propensity to drug misuse were to be included.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000105"></a>That brings me to Amendment 95. The point here is that the Government propose to impose requirements on claimants for jobseeker&#146;s allowance not only if they are dependent on a drug, but if they have a propensity to misuse any drug. The second proviso is that the dependency or propensity is a factor affecting their prospects of obtaining or remaining in work. The term &#147;propensity to misuse&#148;, as I understand it, lacks a precise meaning and is amenable to a very wide interpretation. It could, for example, be argued that the use of any illegal drug is a form of misuse, or certainly a propensity to misuse. How is a personal adviser to judge whether a claimant has a propensity to misuse a drug? Even more difficult will be the judgment of whether the propensity is affecting their prospects of getting and holding a job.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000106"></a>Apart from the insurmountable problems for the personal advisers who have to make these judgments, their subjective judgments would leave large numbers of claimants very vulnerable to benefit sanctions and the fear of them. Do the Government really want to do that? When you consider the number of unemployed people who take drugs&#151;mainly cannabis&#151;from time to time, or perhaps quite regularly, the risk of widespread destitution if these sanctions really were followed through could be considerable, particularly while unemployment remains very high. I know and have known people who, if I am perfectly honest, use or have used cannabis, in particular, very regularly, and yet they hold down a perfectly good job. It is not as straightforward as &#147;drugs&#151;cannot work; no drugs&#151;can work&#148;. It is not like that and therefore these judgments will be extremely difficult to make. I do not believe that rational and fair decisions could ever be made on the basis of Clause 9(1) as it stands.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000107"></a>Amendment 97 tackles head-on the fact that drug use is unlawful in this country, as in most others, and yet the DWP in this Bill recognises that people who misuse drugs are not villains for using those drugs and should not be treated as such. This is very interesting to me. If they commit crimes, that is a different matter. Rather, they should be treated as people with a mental health problem, who need medical or psychological treatment. In that respect, I wholeheartedly support the intentions of the DWP in this clause. It is relevant to note that the head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, in his report that came out only yesterday, admitted for the very first time that drug use should be treated more as an illness than a crime. This is of  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC497"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>momentous importance across the world. For years, the UN has demanded criminalisation. Finally, we have a statement that says that it has got it wrong.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000108"></a>Drug users live in a world where they can be charged at any time simply for possessing and using drugs. This is why Amendment 97 is so important. It seeks to ensure that the questioning of jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimants about whether they are dependent on, or have a propensity to misuse, a drug is done in a fair and reasonable way. That does not sound revolutionary. It also requires that such interviews are conducted at a time and place which is appropriate, and seeks to ensure that claimants have the support they are likely to need if they are to disclose the use of drugs. Very importantly, the amendment also seeks to have detailed in regulations the qualifications and competencies of persons who will be able to impose a requirement to answer questions and to conduct interviews.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000109"></a>The Bill does not outline at what point the requirement to answer questions is engaged. It could potentially be imposed on all claimants; in fact, it might be argued that it should. I do not want any of it, but why ask one claimant rather than another? Unlike the other provisions contained within Schedule 3, there is no requirement of reasonable suspicion. Perhaps the Minister can explain why not. A coerced declaration of drug use in these circumstances would constitute a potential breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It will be reliant upon the threat of benefit sanctions and therefore the disclosure would not be freely given.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000110"></a>Given the criminalising context, people with drug problems are understandably fearful of statutory agencies and may feel shame about their drug use and its consequences. Such disclosure requires a level of trust between the worker and the claimant. It would be grossly unfair to impose a benefits sanction on someone for failing to disclose a drug problem in an inappropriate and unsupportive environment. It is essential that such interviews are conducted by staff with the skill and experience to handle disclosures sensitively and that appropriate support is available. I hope the Minister can give the Committee some assurances on these matters.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000111"></a>Amendment 98 seeks to remove from the Bill the power of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to require someone to take part in one or more drug tests for the purposes of ascertaining whether there is, or has been, a drug in the person&#146;s body. Drug testing should not be incorporated into the benefits system. A positive drug test does not distinguish between problematic and recreational use and is a potential breach of Article 8&#151;the right to privacy&#151;of the ECHR. Article 8 provides a right to refuse treatment. Compulsory testing is certainly an infringement of civil liberties and involves important moral and ethical considerations. Further, a test will not help to establish whether any drug use is a factor in gaining work or employment or whether the person will benefit from drug treatment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000112"></a>There are technical arguments, too. Drug testing is not entirely reliable. For example, someone using over-the-counter painkillers containing codeine could test positive for opiates. There are others of which I am sure the Minister is aware.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000113"></a>Finally on Amendment 98, intrusive drug tests without the consent of the claimant will affect the relationship with the treatment service. I have not been able to find out who will undertake the drug testing under the Bill as it stands and I would be grateful if the noble Lord could clarify that point. Who will be undertaking the drug testing? More particularly, does he accept that such testing does not belong in a Welfare Reform Bill?</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000114"></a>Turning briefly to Amendments 105 and 113, as the Bill stands a JSA or ESA claimant must submit to treatment by or under the direction of a person having the necessary qualifications or experience. The BMA is extremely concerned about these clauses. The amendments would require instead that the JSA claimant, under Amendment 105, and the ESA claimant, under Amendment 113, must attend an initial assessment for treatment by or under the direction of a person having the necessary qualifications or experience. Thus treatment itself would not be compulsory if the amendments were accepted by the Government.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000115"></a>I discussed these amendments with Dr Crawford, our leading consultant psychiatrist on substance misuse in the East London NHS Foundation Trust. Her comments are worth quoting. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000400"></a>&#147;Addiction is a disease that is chronic and relapsing; hence there may still be reoffending. But there are many other health and social benefits of a good therapeutic intervention. If someone is not yet able to manage with the demands of the treatment system, often due to their chaotic and abusive past, then removing the low level of benefits income will lead to further community harm. People cannot always stop their substance misuse, even if they want to&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000374"></a>Dr Crawford takes the view, which I share, that linking drug treatment to the maintenance of benefits is unethical. However, she would welcome a boost to the benefits and employment system to engage better with this particularly socially excluded group.</p>
<h5><a name="09062557000432"></a>3.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000116"></a>The requirement to attend an initial assessment for treatment would be ethical, and begins to engage drug users with potentially helpful therapeutic services. They could discover opportunities to tackle their addiction and other problems, of which they may not have been aware. I know that those who do not want Clause 9 at all might challenge even that. I have had discussions with Dr Crawford and I think she feels that real efforts to draw some of these very excluded individuals towards a treatment regime could be very helpful, but she is very worried about the sense of coercion and the fear that these people have in the context of the criminalisation of drug use. That is the big problem with the whole of Clause 9. It is set in a context that is the fault not of the DWP but of the UN, if I may say so, but our Government have pursued the UN line, which simply makes this whole thing completely unacceptable.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000117"></a>I hope the Minister will recognise that the views that are expressed here are rooted in years of direct experience of working with people who misuse drugs. I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that we need to listen to the people who actually work on the ground with these things. We are simply the deliverers of the message. The great challenges are to engage this group of patients and to keep them

Compulsion, and compulsory treatment, has no place in this journey.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000118"></a>Noble Lords will be pleased to hear that I come to my last pair of amendments, Amendments 106 and 114, which can be dealt with together and briefly. They would ensure that no JSA or ESA claimant would be referred for treatment, even on the voluntary basis set out in our previous amendments, unless the appropriate practitioner had determined that the person is susceptible to treatment and consents to it. Amendment 106 refers to JSA claimants, and Amendment 114 refers to ESA claimants.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000119"></a>The arguments of the drugs and human rights organisation Release merit inclusion on the record and deserve the Minister&#146;s serious attention. It rightly argues that forced treatment as a condition of benefit introduces a worrying new aspect to UK law. Once this precedent has been set, it could be extended to claimants needing to lose weight or give up smoking, for example. There are concerns that there has been no assessment of the effectiveness of current regimes. The only study of the effectiveness of drug testing and treatment orders was conducted in 2003 by the Home Office, which found that 80 per cent of offenders who had been subject to a DTO had been reconvicted within two years of the start of the order.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000120"></a>Release points out that no research has been carried out on drug rehabilitation requirements, despite the fact that recent figures showed an investment of &#163;398 million for 2007-08. The application of further compulsion without any evidence that it will be effective gives rise to serious ethical questions. Those with direct clinical experience of these issues say that treatment for problem drug users will work only when it is appropriate and timely for the individual concerned. Even then, relapse is frequent. It is far from clear how the DWP would deal with relapse in this context. Release takes the view, based on its experience of problem drug users, that many would end up simply not engaging with the benefit system at all, living in even greater poverty and exclusion, and increasing criminal activity to make ends meet.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000121"></a>I hope that I have adequately represented the views of the many organisations and individuals who share my concern that the coercive regime for problem drug users that is set out in Clause 9 will be dangerous and counterproductive. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000123"></a>Winston Churchill once said in the House&#151;on 20 July 1910, to be precise&#151;that the way in which it treats its crime and criminals is the true test of the civilisation of any country. I am not sure that this approach to drug users is a very civilised one. It is much more in line with the very unfortunate term used by the previous Prime Minister, who declared war on

The word &#147;war&#148; is totally inappropriate to both those subjects. If you approach this with a war mind, you start turning your head to punitive measures, as opposed to what I understood the purpose of this Bill to be all about.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000124"></a>Again, in that context, it has always concerned me&#151;again, I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I go back to prisons&#151;that one of the curious things about this country is that no one knows the cost of imprisonment. The country knows how much money is given by the Treasury to the Ministry of Justice and by the Ministry of Justice to individual prisons, but it does not know how much it would cost to do all the things that it says it wants to do with and for every prisoner.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000125"></a>The same is absolutely true of probation. The country does not know how much it would cost to do all that it says it wants to do with and for the 250,000 who are under probation supervision. The other day, it was exposed that one young, barely trained probation officer has to look after 127 people. In preparing for the Bill, the Probation Service has briefed people on its fear that a drug user who is denied benefits will turn to crime as his only way of surviving. Is that a sensible way ahead?</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000126"></a>I have to ask, in the context of all that is proposed in the Bill, whether people have worked out how much it will cost to do all the things that the Government say they want to do. I do not deny that some of those things are very good and sensible, and all that, but have the Government costed that? Have they also costed the impact on the other organisations that are involved and made certain that everything is there? Are there enough drug treatment counsellors around the country for all these people to go to? The strict answer is no, they are not there, which is one reason why a lot of people are not going to treatment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000127"></a>You would hope that a prisoner who had been introduced to drug treatment in prison would be picked up by a drug treatment person the moment they left prison and would carry on from the moment they left off so that they do not lose what they have started. That does not happen. People are not there; there are not enough of them. It is therefore illogical to launch something that requires a support agency without making certain that all the support mechanisms are there.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000128"></a>I am very interested in what my noble friend said about the United Nations at last recognising that this is an illness. Of course criminal activities are associated with it, but they are perpetrated by the criminals who are making illegal money out of making the drugs available. The result of their activities is that people become ill. The illness is exactly the same as that of gambling and so on, which must be treated properly otherwise the whole experience will get worse.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000129"></a>I go back to my great concern that we are approaching the whole drug scene in the spirit of declaring war. The orchestrators of the war are newspapers such as the <I>Daily Mirror</I>, which encourage punitive approaches. The punitive approach is a dangerous and wrong way of dealing with this and is totally out of kilter with the aim of the Bill.</p>

I shall not mention alcohol addiction at this stage; we can leave that for another day.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000131"></a>I think it makes good sense to have almost all the amendments to the clause grouped and to have a clause stand part debate, so that we can debate this as a whole at this point. We welcome the noble Lord, Lord Rea, to our deliberations. I shall start by speaking generally and then turn to the first amendment in this group.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000132"></a>We on these Benches support the voluntary approach to those on benefits whose drug habit keeps them away from the labour market, as do many of the groups that advise us and are working in the field. In other words, we believe that drug users should be strongly encouraged, rather than coerced, to undergo treatment. The reason is simply that coercion does not work, as the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, said. If a person in that position knows that they are going to be coerced into treatment, the likelihood is that they will disappear from the radar and will quite possibly end up in the criminal justice system or living on the streets in an effort to feed their habit, a point strongly made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000133"></a>Nor do we believe that there should be compulsory drug testing in the context of the benefit system, which cannot distinguish between recreational use and addictive use, and is a snapshot only. Nor do we believe that there should be extensive information-sharing between Jobcentre Plus and third parties such as the police.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000134"></a>Many powerful voices have been raised against this part, including those of DrugScope, Release and the Joint Committee on Human Rights. One that has probably not been heard loudly enough&#151;this is the third time that I shall cite it today&#151;is that of the Government&#146;s advisers, the Social Security Advisory Committee. They state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000401"></a>&#147;We find the proposals in relation to those citizens who suffer from addiction to crack cocaine and opiates to be unconvincing, simplistic, and to present a number of issues that demand much more thought before they are taken further ... It is our understanding that all the evidence points to drug rehabilitation programmes being most effective when the client actively wishes to engage in treatment. Taken together, coercion and the removing of income have the potential to make a bad situation worse. Even briefly removing some of the income of a family struggling to cope with the consequences of drug use is likely to force the family into deeper poverty and place children at greater risk&#148;.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000135"></a>During the evidence-taking session in another place, my honourable friend Paul Rowen MP asked the then Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, Tony McNulty, whether there had been any evaluation of existing voluntary schemes for drug users before the decision was made to move to compulsion. The answer was that the Government were very aware of the success of the voluntary processes in place and want to move in that direction. Why are they not putting more resources into the voluntary processes? The rest of his answer is less than clear, but I think that he was   


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC502"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC502</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>trying to say that having a sanction available might encourage more drug users to undertake treatment&#151;presumably voluntary at this stage.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000136"></a>My honourable friend then asked how many extra resources would be available for the increased number wanting treatment. There was no direct answer to that, but we learn in the Peers&#146; information pack that this whole part of the Bill is to be piloted. We also learned how dire the situation is for drug treatment in Scotland, with a year-long waiting list, and that the situation in Wales is not good either. Perhaps the Minister will address that issue in his reply.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000137"></a>Many questions need to be asked about this whole policy if it is to go ahead. When my honourable friend Paul Rowen MP asked Sharon White, director of Welfare to Work, whether the DWP had done an audit of the skills of staff at Jobcentre Plus to deal with the whole drugs issue and whether additional training was needed, she said that personal advisers were already pretty good at recognising the signs of those who were drug users. That sounded vague. If there is a suspicion that drug use is the main barrier to work, she said that the adviser would refer that person to a specialised medical officer. She indicated that there would be additional training for Jobcentre Plus staff, but only in the pilot areas, although how long that training would be for was not addressed.</p>
<h5><a name="09062557000433"></a>3.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000138"></a>Sharon White&#146;s replies were less than convincing to the next question, which was about whether compulsory drug treatment, as well as the sharing of information, was consistent with a person&#146;s right to refuse treatment under the NHS Constitution. She said that the DWP was &#147;looking at&#148; what could be mandated in terms of all possible health interventions in the Bill. There we have it&#151;there is no clarity at all about whether drug treatment can be mandated in the Bill. That brings me to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on this section of the Bill, which unequivocally supports the position that I outlined at the beginning&#151;that treatment recommended for drug users should be voluntary, that there should be no compulsory drug testing, and no information-sharing with third parties.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000139"></a>Finally, I turn to the first amendment in the group. &#147;Propensity to misuse&#148; seems a curious phrase to have enshrined in law. It lacks a precise meaning, as the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, said, and is amenable to wide interpretation. It could be taken to apply to someone who might cross the border occasionally between using heroin or crack cocaine in a recreational sense, perhaps taking the odd day or two off work, and somebody who is a regular user of those two dangerous drugs but manages to stay in work. Or does it mean someone who might become addicted and therefore incapable of work if they carry on using a drug on a regular basis? If the words are not clear, they should be left out of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000140"></a>We support the amendment and all the others in the group.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000141"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09062557000493"></a>Baroness Afshar:</b> I add my voice to the views expressed, not least because the ascribed identity that makes criminals out of those who use drugs occasionally has   


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC503"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC503</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>several problems. The first is that, without being slanderous, it would include almost all the students I have ever taught, so it would make the labour market a tight place for anybody to get into. Secondly, once people have admitted to being drug users, they are admitting to being criminals. The moment that those criminals are put into prison, they find a university of drug dealing, because it becomes the only paid employment that they can aspire to. It seems about the worst thing that we can do.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000142"></a>I beg the Committee&#146;s pardon; I must declare an interest as a member of the UK Drug Policy Commission. One finding of the commission was that, once people have been labelled drug users, they are far more difficult to place in employment than even people with mental disability. By ascribing the identity of &#147;criminal&#148; and asking people to declare themselves to be criminal, we are creating potential criminals, because that is the only way out. Also, we are barring their way to employment. Surely that is not the intention of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000143"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062557000494"></a>Lord Rea:</b> My noble friend Lord Dubs has asked me to talk to the stand part debate because he cannot be here this afternoon. It was tabled at the suggestion of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which he is of course a member. The usual reason for tabling a stand part debate in Committee is to be able to cover the topic in general. In fact, those who spoke to the amendments did just that for all the amendments in the group. Everything that I am going to say has probably already been said. When we get to Schedule 3 stand part, practically everything will have been discussed, so that will take very little time at all.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000144"></a>My interest in this part of the Bill comes from my experience of 25 years as a general practitioner in an inner-city practice. Our list included an above-average proportion of problem drug users who we treated in collaboration with the University College Hospital drug clinic. I grew to know and understand a little of the subculture of the drug-abusing community. One relevant feature is that deception is developed to a fine art; users are very parsimonious with the truth. Another feature is that they are deeply suspicious of authority. They tend not to trust establishment institutions and work much better with an informal approach. I am also a vice-chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Drug Misuse and a member of the group on harm reduction, in which drug treatment issues are frequently discussed.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000145"></a>I welcome the benign intention of this legislation to assist drug users on welfare benefits to free themselves from their habit and to return to employment. However, for a number of reasons, some of which have already been put forward by other noble Lords who have spoken, I doubt whether the Bill will have that effect, certainly in its present form. In fact, it is quite likely to be counterproductive. By imposing a requirement to answer questions, the legislation will be seen as authoritative, authoritarian and coercive. As possession and use of controlled drugs is unlawful, users will be required to admit to being offenders. I know that the Bill states that information obtained by the Department for Work and Pensions during an interview cannot be used as evidence in any prosecution, but that is not likely to convince users.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC504"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC504</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000146"></a>We have discussed the ambiguous word &#147;propensity&#148; but, to me, it suggests that, even among non-users, past drug use is also being inquired into. This may mean that, in order to avoid being questioned, users are likely to forego benefits&#151;which they need and to which they are entitled&#151;rather than admit to drug use or past drug use, or else they will lie about their drug use. This has also been covered in outline but it is important to recognise that the average problem drug user&#151;probably the majority&#151;often has a chaotic lifestyle, with serious social and housing problems, poor nutrition and general health, and may be involved in acquisitive crime to sustain his habit. If they receive reduced welfare benefits, all these problems will be exacerbated. Crime, in particular, will obviously increase as they seek to maintain their income.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000147"></a>Another deterrent to users revealing their drug history is the provision in Schedule 3 for regulations authorising the supply of information held by the probation service, police or other such person as may be prescribed. It is an astonishingly wide provision. As has been mentioned, several other amendments address this issue, which we will come to. These provisions would seem to allow information to be shared with or obtained from any person, body or agency, including social and health workers, with whom clients share confidential information. This is of particular concern to a sizeable number of HIV-positive drug users, who have a vital need to keep in touch with treatment services. They justifiably fear that if their drug or HIV status is revealed they will suffer discrimination in employment and the social stigma that is, sadly, still widely prevalent. The fear is that they will drop out of treatment, which will of course have serious public health implications.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000148"></a>The list of organisations that share some or all of these criticisms of the Bill is long and tedious. Some have already been mentioned, including the main drug addiction NGOs, DrugScope and Release, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of Nursing, the BMS, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the National AIDS Trust and Liberty, among others. My noble friend has doubtless seen their extensive briefing on this clause and schedule, in which their critique is more fully developed than I can manage here without taking far too much time. I hope that my noble friend can address their concerns. I suggest that he should agree to amend this clause to remove its coercive nature, while retaining its intention to offer drug users who are on jobseeker&#146;s allowance or ESA confidential and voluntary&#151;I repeat, confidential and voluntary&#151;treatment and rehabilitation programmes. These should include social support and help with housing. This is likely to be much more effective with this difficult group of people than the authoritarian approach of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000149"></a>I hope that I will later have an opportunity to quote from a statement on the Bill from the Royal College of Psychiatrists. I feel that this whole clause, which enables Schedule 3 to take effect, should be taken back and completely redrafted in the way that I have said, to take out the coercive nature and bring forward a way of approaching these people that is more likely to be effective.</p>

I must confess that whenever I am inundated by hundreds of briefing notes, a little bit of me feels that they must be wrong. There is a little corner of me that is deeply sceptical and wants to go back and read the Bill in detail. I have therefore gone back to read Clause 9 and, in particular, Schedule 3. I am deeply shocked at what appear to be profoundly unethical provisions that are, as many noble Lords have said, completely counterproductive. I speak as someone who has managed drug misuse and alcohol services and worked across a whole range of services in this area. Of course, people are sent from the courts, particularly young people, with a condition that they shall attend for treatment or at least an assessment, with the possibility of engaging them in treatment. That happens when they have committed a criminal offence.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000154"></a>We have long recognised that. There used to be provisions in Victorian times for compulsory treatment of drug or alcohol misusers who had no mental disorder as a consequence, but since 1959 we have been absolutely clear, including in the 1983 Act and the 2007 Act, that that cannot be the case because it is a waste of time and counter-productive.</p>

Some forms of coercion are good and collaborative. You can work with somebody, encouraging them with carrots and sticks in a little way, but this sort of stick goes far beyond what is proper and what is likely to produce a beneficial effect.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000156"></a>We know that people who are truly misusing drugs to the point where it interferes with their ability to work&#151;there are many such&#151;will not engage with this.

I know of no other international evidence. If the Minister does, I hope he will tell us.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000157"></a>It seems completely improper to demand that people should go for an assessment, which I assume would have to be a specialist drug-misuse psychologist assessment, with the aim that they should then be coerced into treatment. That they should be forced to give a urine sample when they are not suspected of or arrested for a potential criminal offence again seems extraordinary. This is not a situation where somebody is driving and they kill somebody else and therefore you want to know whether their urine has alcohol in it. It is a completely separate matter. Remember, the urine sample is taken for a drink-driving offence only when you have got to the station, after the breathalyser has already found you wanting. There are very few circumstances in which we would normally coerce people in this fashion. I find this unethical, unworkable and counterproductive. Although I support all the amendments, the only one that I really like is the proposal of the noble Lords, Lord Dubs and Lord Rea, to get shot of Clause 9.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000158"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062557000498"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Where do I go from here? I want the ideas behind Clause 9 to work. I suspect that we all do. The real question is whether this is the right way to get addicts off their drugs. I shall deal with this in a fairly seriatim way. Amendments 95 and 96, which would remove from the Bill the element of propensity to use drugs, raise a pertinent question. Our position on providing benefits to those people who take drugs is clear. They must make an effort to combat their habit or risk the loss of benefit. I go along with the clause that far.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000159"></a>As I have said twice already, it really should not be acceptable for the state to subsidise substance abuse with no questions asked. This is not a Hobson's choice, as some have made it out to be. The aim is not to harry and hound drug addicts off benefits altogether.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000160"></a>We should not treat Clause 9 in isolation. It should be seen in the context of the rest of Part 1. I said at Second Reading that with rights, in this case to JSA, go responsibilities. Indeed, the whole premise of the Bill is based on that precept. For a long time now we have had the responsibility of actively seeking work. Now we move that responsibility on to attend a progress-to-work interview and agree an action plan. For drug users, the action plan is to help them in the long run to kick the habit, and other barriers to work, and to reintegrate them into the workplace. There cannot be any noble Lord in this Committee who seriously thinks otherwise, nor any who would prefer to see drug addicts left to their addiction, with all the catastrophe that that entails, especially if the modern world believes&#151;I very much took to heart this comment from the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher&#151;that to be a drug user is an illness rather than a crime. I agree with her that that is an extremely important development.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000161"></a>Surely the ideal that we are all groping towards is to wean addicts off their drugs and rehabilitate them so that they can participate fully in society and the world of work. Where we differ&#151;the Government clearly

The method that the Government have chosen is to put responsibility into the hands of Jobcentre Plus staff. They will be moved to the front line of rescuing drug addicts from the depredations of dependency and will be responsible for setting them on the path back to work. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, is wrong and that nobody is going to be asked to give a urine sample in a jobcentre. That is for other professionals further down the line.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000162"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09062557000499"></a>Baroness Murphy:</b> If the noble Lord looks carefully at Schedule 3 he will find&#151;I am not sure that I can find it immediately&#151;that it is possible for the jobcentre to direct somebody to provide a urine sample if there is any suspicion that they are taking drugs and not turning up for an assessment. I am desperately trying to find it. No doubt if I am wrong the Minister will put me right, but I believe that that is the case. I read Schedule 3 quite carefully again this morning and it is surprising who is going to be doing this.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000403"></a>&#147;Regulations may make provision for or in connection with imposing on a person who ... is subject to a requirement imposed under paragraph 2, and ... fails to comply with it&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09062557000375"></a>which we all know about&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09062557000420"></a>&#147;without it being shown, within a prescribed period, that the person had good cause for the failure ... a requirement to take part in one or more relevant tests for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is or has been any drug in the person&#146;s body&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062557000376"></a>That does not say that the jobcentre is going to do this, but perhaps this is not the time to go into an argument on a specific. I am sure that the Minister will be able to settle it anyway.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000164"></a>However, the noble Baroness has a point. I was saying that the method that the Government have chosen is to put responsibility into the hands of Jobcentre Plus staff. They will be moved to the front line of rescuing drug addicts from the depredations of dependency and will be responsible for setting them on the path back to work. That sounds like a tall order. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and the rest of the Committee are quite right to raise these concerns with the Minister.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000165"></a>We come back to the vexed question of training. Jobcentre Plus staff are to be expected to recognise symptoms, diagnose addiction and prescribe the right course of action to take. Indeed, they will need to do more than that. They will need to be able to identify a person&#146;s &#147;propensity&#148;, as the Bill says, to misuse drugs. How will they do that?</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000166"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, referred to the suggestion that was provided in another place by Ann McKechin when this clause was debated there. She said that staff will be &#147;provided with guidance&#148;. Wow. Gosh. How impressive. That is very interesting. Perhaps the Minister might be able to expand on what sort of guidance will be offered. Will it be on top of the three days of training provided to staff to equip them for everything else, or will it be written guidance with a

A neo-Atos, perhaps. In either case, or should there be a different suggestion, will that be adequate? That is the basis of the problem that the Committee faces.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000167"></a>I know from my experience as a Minister in Northern Ireland that jobcentre staff are a committed lot and have exposure to and experience of dealing with what one might call the full range of the human condition. I do not doubt that many, if not the majority, have plenty of personal experience of dealing with claimants who have problems with drugs. I am not, therefore, suggesting in my innocence that jobcentre staff do not know what they are doing. However, I fear that too many responsibilities are being placed on the shoulders of too few people. The issue of training is therefore crucial. We have not heard a detailed enough plan from the Government to provide it. I will be very interested in joining in any meeting that members of the Committee have with the Minister and/or officials to discuss exactly what training is being designed and whether it is practical&#151;or perhaps I should say practicable.</p>

I rather doubt it, but we will discover, won&#146;t we?</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000170"></a>The specific matter of propensity raised in these amendments begs the question: what is propensity? The question has already been asked. How can it ever be satisfactorily or consistently determined? Does it include the capacity and willingness to get overly merry at a Wednesday night football match and subsequently turn up a little red-eyed for work or work experience on a Thursday morning? Presumably that could be construed as a factor affecting one&#146;s prospects of obtaining or remaining in work. Should it be? Perhaps it should. I offer no comment, merely the observation that is a wide and potentially unachievable proposal. I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s explanation of &#147;propensity&#148;. Perhaps he might think about the wording of the clause before we consider it again on Report, which from this debate we most assuredly will.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000171"></a>I offer that advice, which I am sure the Minister will welcome, naturally, because I believe that, overall, Clause 9 is important and needs to work. The numbers that have been floated about from the Peers&#146; information pack&#151;I expect that the Minister will provide us with the most up-to-date statistics&#151;suggest that there are around 350,000 drug users on benefits. If the scheme is a triumph and these people are persuaded to try to beat their habit in the way proposed, are the resources

That point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, with which I fully agree. What is the Government's plan for implementation?</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000172"></a>As I said at the beginning, I really do believe that Clause 9 needs to work. That is why training keeps popping up. If the staff are not able to do the work expected of them, the system will never get off the ground, and that would be to everyone&#146;s detriment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000173"></a>In this group there is a series of amendments on data sharing. I would like to comment on that.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000177"></a>I start with the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, who said that we share the same objectives. That is probably the same for every person who has spoken this afternoon. I will try to deal with each question that was posed to me in some detail.

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000178"></a>Before assessing individual amendments I would like to explain the intention behind Clause 9, to reassure noble Lords who wish to oppose its inclusion in the Bill. Clause 9 facilitates the introduction of Schedule 3, which amends the Jobseekers Act 1995 and the Welfare Reform Act 2007. New provisions, which apply to people who are dependent on drugs or have a propensity to misuse them&#151;I will come back that issue, which several noble Lords probed&#151;are inserted into both. The provisions may also be extended to alcohol, which the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, referred to.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000179"></a>The provisions apply to claimants of employment and support allowance&#151;ESA&#151;or jobseeker&#146;s allowance whose drug problem is affecting their ability to find work. The new provisions are broadly the same for both benefits. For JSA, they only apply to claimants who are required to meet the job-seeking conditions. For ESA, they only apply to those who are capable of undertaking work-related activity.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000180"></a>Long-term drug use has a devastating impact on individuals, families and wider society. There are around 400,000 problem drug users in Great Britain, defined as those who are dependent on, or have a propensity to misuse, heroin or crack cocaine. Around 350,000 are on benefit. Many more are in prison because drug use has led them into criminal activity. The crime and health costs of drug use are a huge burden to society: around &#163;18 billion a year for class A drugs alone.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC510"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000181"></a>We know that many problem drug users on benefit are not in treatment. They should not continue to get benefits without being expected to tackle their problems; the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, touched on this issue of rights and responsibilities. Clause 9 and Schedule 3 therefore introduce a new programme of integrated and personalised support which will initially be directed at heroin and crack users. It will aim to help them overcome their problems and get them ready for work.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000182"></a>I thank noble Lords for tabling this large group of amendments. Two of them aim to reduce the scope of the provisions. The remainder deal with the requirements that can be placed on certain claimants under Clause 9 and Schedule 3. Working through them each in turn, Amendments 95 and 96 amend Clause 9 so that the provisions only apply to claimants who have a drug dependency, and not to those who have a &#147;propensity to misuse&#148; drugs. It might be helpful if I give some explanation of what we understand by the term &#147;propensity to misuse&#148;. It is not a clinical diagnostic term. It refers to a person who, although they may not be physically or psychologically dependent on a certain drug, would be showing evidence of a repeated tendency to use it. So we are not talking about a suspicion of drug use, or people who have experimented once or twice. It would be usage that appeared excessive, impaired the person&#146;s functioning and limited their involvement in a range of activities, perhaps including work. I am sure that noble Lords would agree that we should not exclude this group from the new programme of integrated support that Clause 9 and Schedule 3 would introduce.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000183"></a>Other legislation, which also aims to get drug users into treatment and support, covers both those who are drug dependent and those who have a propensity to misuse. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 allows a court to impose a drug rehabilitation requirement where an offender is dependent on, or has a propensity to misuse, drugs. Similarly, the Drugs Act 2005 provides that when a person tests positive for heroin or crack on arrest, or when charged with an offence, they can be required to attend a drugs assessment to determine whether they are drug dependent or have a propensity to misuse. Again, this applies in relation to drug dependency and propensity to misuse. Where it is established that benefit claimants have a propensity to misuse drugs, Schedule 3 will only apply where that propensity is a factor affecting their prospects of getting or holding down a job.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000184"></a>Amendment 97 would amend the provisions that deal with the requirement for a JSA claimant to answer questions about drug use. It is intended to extend powers so that regulations could impose certain requirements on these interviews. The powers in Schedule 3 are already broad enough to enable regulations to include the types of requirements sought by this amendment, and consideration will be given to safeguards that should be included to ensure that interviews are conducted fairly and appropriately.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000185"></a>We are aware that stakeholders are concerned whether Jobcentre Plus staff will ask these questions in a way that is sensitive and supportive, and whether claimants will feel able to discuss such matters in the surroundings of a jobcentre. Stakeholders are also concerned that failure to answer these questions without good cause might lead to a benefit sanction.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC511"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC511</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000186"></a>I reassure noble Lords that the questions will be fair and that staff will be trained to handle interviews with drug users in a sensitive and supportive manner. We want to encourage claimants to disclose their drug problem so that we can provide them with the support and help that they need. The role of the personal adviser will be to ask questions about drug use so that they can judge whether there are reasonable grounds&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, mentioned this&#151;for suspecting that a person is a problem drug user. Where there are such grounds, the claimant will be required to attend a substance-related assessment, but advisers will make no medical judgments; clearly such issues need to be left to drug treatment professionals. The areas covered by the questions will be set out in regulations. The department has already provided noble Lords with the memorandum on extended delegated powers, which sets out what these questions might be.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000187"></a>We should recognise that Jobcentre Plus staff discuss daily with claimants sensitive issues such as finances, housing and medical matters, and although the provisions in the Bill will be new to them, dealing with drug users is not. Many claimants who are drug users struggle to meet the conditions for claiming JSA, such as signing on and searching for jobs. They face sanctions if they do not meet these requirements, and many of them quite voluntarily divulge that they have a drug problem.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000188"></a>I also reassure noble Lords that personal advisers will receive training&#151;a constant theme of our deliberations&#151;to raise awareness of drug misuse and how it affects people. This will be delivered in conjunction with the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse and local drug action teams.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000189"></a>Jobcentre advisers are already building up greater experience of drug issues. Since 27 April, they have been asking claimants about problem drug use with a view to referring them, on a voluntary basis, to a discussion with a local drug treatment provider. They are being supported in this by local drugs co-ordinators who are based in each district. This experience will be invaluable for the pilots set out in the Bill. I stress that we are talking here about piloting these proposals and assessing them afterwards. Sunset provisions are, in effect, in place. We can learn how we can encourage claimants to divulge drug problems, and how we can reassure them that it is safe to disclose drug problems to benefits staff.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000190"></a>Amendments 98 and 107 seek to remove the powers to impose a requirement for certain JSA and ESA claimants to undergo drug tests. Where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a claimant may be dependent on or have a propensity to misuse drugs, and that this is affecting their chances of getting and holding down a job, they may be required to attend a substance-related assessment. As has been noted, this assessment will be undertaken by an approved person, who will be a drug treatment professional. It will consider whether a claimant is dependent on or has a propensity to misuse drugs, and if so whether they require and may be susceptible to treatment. If the assessment identifies a claimant as such a drug user, they will be referred to the new drug and employment support programme: hence the assessment is the gateway to accessing specialised support. It is therefore important  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC512"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC512</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that people who need support are identified and attend. A person who fails without good cause to attend a substance-related assessment may be required to undergo one or more drug tests. We consider this approach to be justified. A claimant can be referred for an assessment only where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they are a problem drug user.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000193"></a>I can reassure noble Lords that a positive test result will not be used in isolation to decide that a claimant is a problem drug user, and it would never on its own lead to a requirement to comply with a rehabilitation plan. If the test result is positive, they will be directed to attend a further appointment for assessment. If a person fails to take part in a drug test without good cause, they may be subject to a benefit sanction, but they will have a right to appeal against that.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000194"></a>The remaining amendments focus on the rehabilitation plan, which is a key component of the new drugs programme. The rehabilitation plan will be a single document which will integrate treatment plans with the other steps that a claimant needs to take to move towards gaining work. It will be drawn up between the employment support provider and the claimant.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000195"></a>Not all drug users will be required to follow a rehabilitation plan. It will apply only where a claimant has a dependency on, or a propensity to misuse drugs; this is a factor affecting their ability to obtain or remain in work; and their condition requires and is susceptible to treatment. However, where those criteria are met they will be required to agree a rehabilitation plan and do their best to make progress against it. If they fail to do so without good cause they may be subject to benefit sanction.</p>

One wishes; I hope. I sent a note on this to the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. I absolutely support what my noble friend is trying to do, which is to use the hook of this to try to turn lives around. We would normally have, for any person with dependants who is exposed to sanctions, a hardship regime, so that they can be sanctioned to only, say, 10 or 20 per cent of their benefit and they continue to get the rest. That is never normally applied to single people, and I suspect that most drug users will be single people&#151;certainly not in sustained relationships.</p>

Can my noble friend help me?

The more I hear what is being said, the more I worry about the average student who leaves university with a great big debt and therefore soon becomes dependent on help from the state. Such students may have a propensity to use drugs and may continue to do so when they cannot find any work. They lead chaotic lives. Much as we try to timetable them, they just do not turn up. Students who are seen as potential employees, and who wish to become employees, suddenly become categorised as drug users because they are dependent on benefit. That will close all doors to them on their path to independence. I hope that the measure can be changed to enable this large category of bright young people to get over a hump and into the labour market.</p>

The measure has three components: drug dependency; propensity to misuse drugs; and the impact of that. Whether someone is susceptible to treatment and whether their dependency impacts on their ability to obtain work is the third leg that would need to be satisfied before these provisions would bite. I doubt whether they would extend to the whole range of students to whom the noble Baroness refers, but there are three components.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000200"></a>I revert to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, on engagement with the medical profession on drug testing. We are discussing with the Department of Health and the Home Office how to establish and conduct the pilots. We would engage with the medical profession through that mechanism. Off the top of my head, I cannot tell the Committee how detailed that engagement has been to date, but I understand the thrust of the noble Baroness&#146;s point.</p>

As I said a moment ago, a positive test would not of itself drive an automatic conclusion that a rehabilitation plan is needed; it would simply be further evidence to support the questions that were raised initially about whether an assessment   


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC514"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be undertaken. But at the end of the day, if an individual will not engage with a drugs test or an assessment, these provisions cannot operate and the individual would remain on whatever benefit they are currently on&#151;employment and support allowance or jobseeker&#146;s allowance. As I said earlier, they could miss out, given the sanctions regime that applies to that course, as there is no strong mechanism to help them engage with the support that is available. The whole thrust of this is to try to get people through the door of treatment establishments. In a moment we shall discuss coercion. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, referred to co-operative coercion. Why is that such a bad thing? Surely we would all wish to offer people the opportunity of treatment. It does not preclude a voluntary approach; there is no reason why that should not sit alongside.</p>

That does not cut right across all the provisions for medical treatment, which must have the consent of the individual. You do not have compulsory treatment; you give consent. If the element of compulsion concerned the assessment, the Government would avoid a lot of the major concerns that I think will arise in the medical profession, certainly judging from the BMA response.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000204"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09062557000514"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Perhaps I can come on to the issue of what is required and compulsory in a moment. I hope that I can provide some reassurance to noble Lords on that.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000205"></a>Amendments 105 and 113 remove the possibility of including in a rehabilitation plan a requirement for a JSA or ESA claimant to attend an institution for treatment. Instead, they allow a rehabilitation plan to require a claimant simply to attend an initial assessment for drug treatment. Removing the ability to require a claimant to attend an institution for treatment and replacing this with a requirement to attend an initial assessment for treatment is a significant change and is intended to soften the edges of a mandatory approach. In practice, though, it would just duplicate the substance-related assessment that a claimant will have already attended under these proposals.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000206"></a>We are aware that some stakeholders have voiced concerns, as we have been told forcefully this afternoon, that we are forcing claimants to undergo medical treatment, and claim that any form of coercion into treatment, such as a benefit sanction, will not work. Let me absolutely clear. We are not forcing people into treatment. It will be possible under paragraphs 6(4) and 6(5) only for a rehabilitation plan to include a requirement that the claimant must attend an institution or treatment centre, as a resident or non-resident, for treatment under the direction of a professional. The nature of that treatment cannot be specified, so there is no requirement for the claimant to submit to any particular type of medical treatment at the institution. If the treatment is residential, the location is entered on the plan. If it is non-residential, the location and intervals are recorded, but that is all.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000207"></a>The employment support provider does not need to know the details of the treatment that the claimant is undergoing. The claimant needs only to agree attendance at a treatment centre. If the claimant fails to attend the centre for treatment, they may face the possibility of a benefit sanction and remaining on mainstream provision. But, as with any form of medical treatment, the patient will have the right to be involved in discussions and decisions about any treatment they receive at the institution, and to agree to or refuse medical treatment that is offered.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000208"></a>As a further safeguard, the Government intend to include in regulations an express provision that a person cannot be required to submit to invasive forms of treatment, such as a course of methadone, unless they have consented. The Government will also make provision in regulations for the content of rehabilitation plans to be agreed with claimants.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000209"></a>In relation to coercion, during the Green Paper consultation many groups told us that most drug users want to get treatment and get off drugs. We are probably agreed on that proposition. Some groups told us that an element of coercion is not a bad thing. For example, Turning Point, while expressing some reservations about some aspects of the scheme, nevertheless said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000404"></a>&#147;Turning Point welcomes any programme which attempts to engage more people in need into the treatment arena. We also recognise that some of those clients may be reached through an element of coercion, and that this may engage some with treatment who would not alone have had the momentum or support to enable them to stabilise their substance misuse&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000378"></a>Some comparison can also be drawn from evidence from a study in the US. I am not sure if that is the same study that the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, referred to; I have some more detail that I will come on to in a moment. It found that making benefit receipt conditional on treatment participation appeared to increase treatment participation rates.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000210"></a>Amendments 106 and 114 seek to ensure that, for treatment to form part of the rehabilitation plan, a drug treatment practitioner must have determined that the person is susceptible to, and consents to, treatment. The amendments are unnecessary. With regard to the susceptibility to treatment, a drug treatment provider, like any other medical practitioner, should not recommend treatment unless it has determined that a person would be susceptible to it. In any case, as I mentioned earlier, the substance-related assessment will have already determined that the person&#146;s drug problem is susceptible to treatment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000211"></a>On the consent point, I have explained that the rehabilitation plan cannot include a requirement for the claimant to submit to any particular type of medical treatment; it can require the claimant to attend a treatment centre for treatment only under the direction of a professional.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000212"></a>Amendments 111 and 112 seek to remove the ability to impose a rehabilitation plan on an ESA claimant, thus making it a voluntary matter rather than a requirement. If a rehabilitation plan were voluntary, as recommended by these amendments, we doubt that many would opt to have one. Inevitably, those who are most in need of support and would gain the most benefit from having a plan would fail to take it up.  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC516"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>A rehabilitation plan is not just about a requirement to submit to treatment; it is the gateway to the new drug and employment programme. Claimants will be provided with other support to overcome barriers to work; the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, probed this question. This will include action to address barriers to work such as housing, debt and employment skills. It will also cover soft skills such as building self-esteem and confidence.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000213"></a>The amendments apply only to the ESA, but if the intention is to apply it to the JSA too, by choosing not to have a rehabilitation plan, the claimant could continue to be subject to the mainstream job-seeking conditions. These are, as I said a moment ago, inappropriate for many problem drug users. Under current rules, many repeatedly fail to meet them by not signing on or by failing to show that they are actively seeking work, and as a result they face regular benefit sanctions. The intention is that when a rehabilitation plan is in place, these conditions will be lifted and replaced with a more appropriate set of conditions for drug users. This is a key benefit which many claimants would lose if they could opt out of a rehabilitation plan.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000214"></a>Any requirements in connection with rehabilitation plans will be introduced by regulations. These regulations will be subject to the affirmative procedure, so before they can come into force they will have to be approved in draft by both Houses and there will be an opportunity to consider and debate them. They will also include safeguards to ensure that the requirements are proportionate to our aims and compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000215"></a>Finally, Amendment 115 seeks to restrict the ability to impose a sanction in the event of a failure by an ESA claimant to comply with a requirement to submit to treatment under a rehabilitation plan. Under powers in paragraph 7 of the two new schedules, regulations may make provision for a benefit sanction to be applied where a person has failed to comply with any of the requirements contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, or 6.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000216"></a>The amendment attempts to restrict the ability to impose a sanction where a claimant has failed to comply with a requirement to submit to treatment as part of a rehabilitation plan. Under the amendment, a sanction could be imposed only where the treatment had been recommended by a person with the necessary qualifications and experience and where the claimant has consented to the treatment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000217"></a>Paragraphs 6(4) and 6(5) already provide that the rehabilitation plan may include a requirement that the claimant must attend an institution or treatment centre, as a resident or non-resident, for treatment,</p>
<ul><a name="09062557000422"></a>&#147;under the direction of a person having the necessary qualifications or experience&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062557000379"></a>so any treatment that is recommended will have been recommended by a qualified person. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, drew a distinction between necessary qualifications and experience. I am not sure that I can draw a clearer picture than that, but the paragraph covers people who are knowledgeable and experienced and have a range of particular qualifications to be able to engage in this exercise. As I said, any treatment that is recommended will have to be recommended by a

<a name="90625-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000218"></a>I have also already explained that there is no requirement for the claimant to submit to any particular type of medical treatment at the institution. It follows that no sanction can be imposed merely as the result of a failure to take up a particular type of medical treatment. Claimants will be expected to turn up to an institution for treatment and to be willing to participate in some form of treatment programme. If the claimant fails to attend the centre for treatment or to agree to any form of treatment at all&#151;for example, if they are unwilling to take up even the offer of counselling&#151;they may face a benefit sanction and remain on mainstream provision.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000219"></a>Sanctions in this area will be a last resort. As always, a claimant will be given an opportunity to show good cause for any failure to attend an institution or treatment centre for treatment, but we do not intend Jobcentre Plus to impose a sanction for missing just the odd treatment appointment. The key thing is that the claimant agrees a rehabilitation plan and does their best to make progress against it.</p>

For any such programme I am sure that my noble friend will have calculated that X per cent will engage. You can then start to work out some of the costs and whether you should put down a form of dowry to get people into the programme and other such matters, but you need the base number.

It would be better for me to write and circulate the reply to every Member of the Committee who has participated today, rather than giving a few figures that have been not quite plucked from the air, but plucked from the Bench behind me.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000226"></a>The welfare state has historically combined rights with responsibilities. In return for benefit payments and extra support, customers who are able to do so should be expected to do their best to find work. Where there is a requirement to carry out a responsibility, there must be a penalty to encourage compliance. As I said previously, the new provisions on drugs will be piloted for two years and subject to evaluation. There are also sunset provisions. Within two and a half years of the regulations coming into force the Secretary of State will be required to report to Parliament on the pilots. A statutory instrument will also be needed to continue the arrangements or repeal them if they are not to continue. This would be done via the affirmative process.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000227"></a>There are several points that I still need to address. The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about drug tests. To be very clear, these will not be carried out in jobcentres. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, used, I think, the phrase, &#147;declaring war on drug users&#148;; I think that was the tenor of his approach. I genuinely will not accept it as a characterisation of our approach. This is about supporting people but recognising a degree of coercion to get to the starting point of a treatment centre. In the context, it is not unreasonable. In relation to the use of benefit sanctions, these are not new. Many drug users and their families are already experiencing them. Their chaotic lives mean that they fail to sign on or show that they are available for and actively seeking work. If, through these provisions, we can get them into a different category or programme, we can, I hope, support them in moving closer to work and away from the dependency that is destroying their lives and those of their families.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000228"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, asked whether Jobcentre Plus staff will identify problem drug users. Let me be very clear: personal advisers will not make assessments of a person&#146;s drug use; they will simply decide who to refer for an assessment. That is all. To do so they will need to be satisfied, as I said earlier, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person is a problem drug user.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000229"></a>The noble Baroness sought to draw a parallel with the community order pilots. I suggest that they are not the same. These pilots use the benefit system to enforce community sentences. We are using the benefit system to enforce decisions made by personal advisers or agreements made with employment providers. It is entirely consistent with what we do within the current benefit system.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000230"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, asked about resources. Certainly, because of record levels of investment in treatment for drug misuse in England, there has been a big expansion in capacity and dramatic reductions in waiting time. I have figures that 93 per cent of drug  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC519"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>users are receiving treatment within three weeks of being assessed. The Department of Health and the DWP have looked closely at the likely numbers being referred to treatment from jobcentres, and we will confirm those broad assumptions in writing.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000231"></a>We do not think that capacity will be an issue. However, we will monitor the situation closely. Local drug jobcentre co-ordinators funded by the Department of Health and in post from this April will be keeping an eye on any potential pinch points and drawing them to the attention of the local drug partnership. The national treatment agency will be monitoring data on waiting times.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000232"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, with his deep experience of what happens in the Prison Service, referred to the drug abuse situation there. Under the Fresh Start initiative, Jobcentre Plus already works with prison services to speed up the receipt of benefit for prison leavers; this really is joined up. Advisers from Jobcentre Plus visit prisons to advise prisoners about benefit claims and finding work. Advisers will encourage those with drug problems to declare drug use so that they benefit from the new programme and, if appropriate, receive a treatment allowance rather than face the full JSA job-seeking conditions. The supply of information about prisoners will additionally help to identify those ex-prisoners who claim benefit and need help and support to overcome their drug problems.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000233"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09062557000521"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that comment. One of the things that has always concerned me about prisoners and benefits is that they receive an allowance when they leave prison. One would have hoped that that was the first payment of their benefit, so that they could carry on from there. I have never understood why they come out of prison with their release allowance and then have to start the process of going to benefits, which inevitably leaves a gap. This is nothing particularly to do with the Bill but, in connection with how they are treated, it really could be investigated with advantage in view of the problems that it creates&#151;particularly for women prisoners. </p>

We will certainly have a look at it. There are provisions in later clauses to do with advance payments of benefit to get out of the cycle where people have to rely on crisis loans until the benefit comes into payment. However, we will take that away and have a look at it.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000235"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, was probing what &#147;propensity&#148; means and the process of trying to identify whether someone was a problem drug user. A drug test will be required only if a person has failed to attend a substance-related assessment. To be referred for an assessment, the personal adviser must already have had reasonable ground to suspect that they are dependent on drugs, or that they have a propensity to misuse them.</p>

As with social security matters, however, there is, of course, a reserve to this Parliament and the legislation extends to the whole of Great Britain. Health matters are devolved to Scotland and Wales and criminal justice matters are devolved to Scotland. We clearly need some joint working on that, and officials are working with both the Welsh and Scottish Governments&#146; officials to establish how the new regime might be piloted in Wales and Scotland, taking into account the availability of drug treatment and other factors.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000237"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas&#151;I think I have covered this point already&#151;asked what types of treatment claimants are being mandated into. I emphasise that claimants are not being mandated into treatment. They may be required to agree to and follow a rehabilitation plan, which may include a requirement that the claimant must attend an institutional treatment centre as a resident or non-resident for treatment by or under the direction of a professional, but they are not being mandated into treatment. That deals also with the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000238"></a>Returning to the evidence around coercion, which the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, pressed me on, the evidence from the USA to which I referred has shown that making benefit receipt conditional on treatment appears to increase treatment participation rates. There is a study entitled &#147;Termination of Supplemental Security Income Benefits for Drug Addiction and Alcoholism&#148; by JA Swartz, A Lurigio and J Baumohl which I am happy to let the noble Baroness and any other noble Lords have if they are interested in a more detailed reference.</p>

There is a phrase in the Mental Health Act, and in other medical Acts, to the effect that medical treatment includes all treatment, habilitation and rehabilitation, and I am surprised that they appear to be separated in this Bill. It seems to imply that rehabilitation is not medical treatment when in fact medical treatment includes rehabilitation.</p>

So far as any treatment issue is concerned, obviously the rehabilitation plan involves only the requirement to attend a particular centre or institution. The other components of the plan would depend upon the individualised or personalised circumstances of the claimant. For example, they may be to do with housing advice, debt counselling and so on, which would not traditionally be recognised as medical services and as coming within the restrictions to which the noble Baroness is referring.

If attending a rehabilitation programme is going to have a different meaning in the Bill, then that should be made very clear.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000244"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0006.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09062557000528"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> We need to get clarity on this issue. I shall make sure it is followed up and write to noble Lords. I understand the point that has been made.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000245"></a>I hope that I have dealt with all of the points raised. I am sorry it has been such an extensive response but, given the nature of the debate, I thought it would be helpful to all if I put as much on the record as I can. I am conscious that the voluntary approach is the way in which the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, would like this to move forward. That view was echoed by every other noble Lord who spoke, with the possible exception of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. The noble Lord, Lord Rea, with his 25 years as a general practitioner, has a great deal of experience and expressed doubts about whether this would have the desired effect or whether it would drive people into poverty. He made an important point about people being suspicious of authority. I acknowledge that, but if we cannot engage as an authority, how are we going to help these people and move them forward in the challenges that they face in their lives?</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000246"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, said that we were creating criminals. With respect, that is not what we are doing with these provisions. If people are users and dependent on drugs, we will recognise that and help them through a process so that they can get treatment and support, and we hope in due course get off that dependency and into employment. The process that we are focusing on here is not about criminalising people. I accept the point that the rest of the criminal justice structure might do that, but that is perhaps a wider issue for a debate outside our deliberations here.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000247"></a>I hope that that has dealt with the point that noble Lords wish to cover; I would be happy to try again if not. Correspondingly, I wonder whether the various noble Lords who tabled the whole raft of amendments might feel able not to press them.</p>

It has been very productive and there is clear consensus of concern about Clause 9 as drafted. I suggest that we have a meeting with the Minister about the training institute, but also about a number of concerns that remain unresolved here. I shall mention just a few of them, so that he can think about them before we meet, if we do.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000249"></a>The Minister did not explain how the personal adviser can measure at all the question of propensity. I think that there will be a major problem with medical staff. I cannot imagine medical staff getting involved in what I think they would see as compulsory treatment, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, made clear. That question remains up in the air. Frankly, compulsory treatment is compulsory treatment even if the specifics of that treatment are not spelt out by the personal adviser. If you have to attend some form of treatment, that is compulsory.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000250"></a>There are human rights issues, there are certainly ethical issues and there are certainly issues cutting across the Mental Health Act. One cannot get away from the fact that compulsory attendance at a residential place of treatment is compulsory treatment of some sort. As I heard it, the Turning Point view appears to go along with the idea of compulsory attendance for an assessment, rather along the lines of one of our amendments. I heard nothing in that quotation about Turning Point supporting compulsory treatment. I cannot believe that it would.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000251"></a>Resources will be an issue. That is another matter that the Minister needs to consider further.</p>

We will liaise on these issues with the Department of Health. Perhaps I can pick that up when we discuss the next amendment, if it has not come through by the time we have concluded this one.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000254"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0006.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="09062557000532"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> To conclude, we would all be interested to see the US evidence, but the consultant psychiatrist in the East London foundation trust agrees that a few people might be drawn in by compulsory treatment. The problem is that the down side, the negative consequences, for the very much larger number completely outweighs the possible benefit to a few. That psychiatrist&#151;she is a very good consultant psychiatrist&#151;said that that would be incredibly unhelpful. She works with drug users all the time, she has given her life to it, and she said, &#147;Please, this is just not going to help us in this very difficult task of drawing these people in and keeping them engaged to a point where perhaps they can resolve their many difficulties and therefore return to work&#148;. I think that one should take the views of a practitioner like that, along with the noble Lord, Lord Rea, very seriously. Those people really understand the incredible difficulties of dealing with these issues.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000255"></a>I am very disappointed by the Minister&#146;s reply. I hoped that he would be willing to take the amendment away and think about redrafting Clause 9 so that it could be a positive rather than, in my view, a very negative contribution.</p>

I am a little sorry that my noble friend has not talked about the right to privacy under Article 8 in the Human Rights Act when requiring people to answer questions about their drug and alcohol use and to undergo tests with police and probation officers. The Government are supposed to put safeguards into place so that this does not affect a person&#146;s private life and contravene Article 8, but perhaps we can go into this later.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC524"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC524</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that enough information is flowing to allow the system to work. Redaction, which is exercising the press and another place at this time, exemplifies that. It is heartening, given the Government&#146;s ambiguous relationship with the sharing of information on citizens, that Schedule 3 does at least acknowledge limitation on the use to which this information may be put.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000265"></a>Schedule 3(4), on page 72, notes that some of the information elicited from participants might well constitute evidence that a criminal offence has been committed. That point was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, a little earlier. She was worried that evidence might be used to lead to a conviction of the drug addicts that we were talking about in the previous amendment. That is unsurprising, as we are talking about people who may be taking illegal drugs, but the Bill, as I understand it, specifically prohibits this. No information can flow from the social security office to any part of the court system, including the police. I hope that I have got that right.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000266"></a>An exploratory interview about their lifestyles, necessary to form an individual action plan, may uncover more. Although I have been taking a harder line on the conditions that should be placed on drug takers than some noble Lords might like, I stand firmly by my position. I too see the logic of the provisions. No one would volunteer to get help with their addiction and get back onto the work programme if there was a risk that they could be prosecuted. It would be quite counterproductive for these purposes. Dogma ought to be set aside in favour of pragmatism. I will probably come back to this point; I reserve the right to do just that. I beg to move.</p>

I will speak to Amendments 99, 103, 104, 109 and 110. Schedule 3 provides for information to be provided by the police, probation service or others. These are all of concern, but I am particularly concerned about the involvement of a doctor. These persons would be required to give information to JSA and ESA officers. These clauses also provide for information obtained by these officers to be passed on to others. These clauses appear to have been written in a vacuum. Again, they take absolutely no account of the fact that drug use is a criminal offence.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000271"></a>The aim of the personal advisers must surely be to develop a rapport and degree of trust with claimants. If claimants find that information has been obtained from the police or their doctor, or that information is passed on, the claimant will inevitably be afraid, will lose any element of trust in those involved, and will simply discontinue their claim. If the aim is indeed to frighten claimants off the benefit count, Clause 9 will  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC525"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC525</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>achieve that result rather well. However, I know that the Minister will want to consider the implications of that: more crime, more destitution and higher prison and other criminal justice costs. I do not believe that the Minister wants to go down that route.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000272"></a>We can also consider Clause 9 from a human rights perspective. The proposals are, I understand, a clear breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and a potential breach of the data protection laws. To argue that the information is being obtained to prevent fraud, and for the prevention and detection of crime, is wrong in law. A fishing exercise is not a targeted approach to preventing or detecting crime.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000273"></a>The Bill makes clear that failure to disclose drug use will be met with benefit sanctions. There is no recognition that the DWP would be seeking evidence of a criminal activity&#151;the use of a drug. You cannot expect claimants to confess a crime to government officials. As we know, other forms of addiction, such as to nicotine and alcohol, are not criminalised. I would not have a problem with the DWP asking questions and seeking corroboration about cigarette use, for example. At least such an information exchange would not raise the serious issues raised by Clause 9.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000274"></a>Until the Home Office catches up with the DWP in regarding drug use as a medical problem, the DWP cannot have information exchange with other agencies at the heart of its benefit sanctions policy. The BMA is concerned that doctors could be required to supply information to the Secretary of State or a person providing services to the Secretary of State. It points out that there is no clarity over whether the information expected from a doctor, as the prescribed person, would be confined to previous episodes of care that are directly relevant to the claimant&#146;s drug or alcohol misuse and treatment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000275"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify for us the terms under which doctors would be required to disclose potentially highly sensitive health data. Under existing law covering the provision of health data, they are supplied to the medical officer of the DWP or an officer acting directly on a doctor&#146;s behalf. The doctor supplying the data therefore knows that they will be held under the protection that the GMC requires, as there is another doctor whose professional reputation and, indeed, registration demand such protection.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000276"></a>The BMA shares my concern about the provision for the onward disclosure of this information. It notes that the proposal seems to authorise the unrestricted further or onward disclosure of highly sensitive and personal information supplied for the purpose of confirming an individual&#146;s misuse of drugs or alcohol. There is no clarity over whether the onward disclosure of information is confined to those directly involved in the claimant&#146;s treatment. Indeed, sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) seem to contradict the Government&#146;s stated policy objective of helping claimants on drugs or alcohol back into the workforce.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000277"></a>Our amendments in this group provide minimum safeguards to prevent the worst consequences of the information exchange provisions of paragraph 9 of Schedule 3. Amendment 99 ensures that for JSA claimants

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000278"></a>Amendment 103, with respect to JSA claimants, and Amendment 109, with respect to ESA claimants, ensure that information supplied under the regulations by the claimant or others could be used only for the purposes of determining the claim. That is the amendment that I would really like to see adopted. It would be proper and appropriate and not a breach of the Human Rights Act and all the rest of it.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000279"></a>Amendment 104, with respect to JSA claimants, and Amendment 110, with respect to ESA claimants, delete the offending sub-paragraphs and thus prevent information obtained by the DWP being used by others&#151;the police or the Home Office, for example&#151;to amend or supplement their information. The approach to the whole business of information is most concerning.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000280"></a>These amendments also prevent such information being used by others outside the DWP for any purpose. In fact, if the other amendments were passed, these sub-paragraphs would become redundant and would need to be deleted. Others will press for Clause 9 not to stand part of the Bill, and I would consider doing that if the Government are not willing to revisit this clause and change much of it to turn it from a very dangerous piece of legislation into something that could be productive and helpful. That is the route that I would prefer. I would welcome it if the Minister would think about how this could be made to work, taking account of the serious points made by all Members of the Committee.</p>

I shall not repeat what I have already said, but it is clear from it that I agree with many of the worries that the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, has just expressed. One comment that I must make about what she has just said is that page 27 of the Peers&#146; information pack clearly states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000407"></a>&#147;All these will be one-way data flows. We do not intend that jobcentre Plus will pass information back to the criminal justice agencies&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000380"></a>Can I take it from that that the noble Baroness is slightly skewed in her thinking and that the information will not come out of the jobcentre in any event but will always go in? That would be an important safeguard. Where does the Bill tell us that? I have not found it and it is clear that the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, has not found it, but the Peer&#146;s information pack clearly has.</p>
<h5><a name="09062557000441"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000282"></a>I am not convinced of the need for Amendment 99, which would restrict the use of this information in civil trials. There may be circumstances&#151;in proceedings for negligence against the jobcentre, for example, although I have not developed my hypothesis with any level of detail&#151;that might require the revelation of some details. In other words, I could see occasions when information might come out in the case of a civil trial, although that would be pretty rare. Perhaps the Minister could help me there.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000283"></a>I note that the amendment qualifies that exclusion with the caveat that the person might consent to the release of the details to a third party. If the permission is on the claimant, that puts a totally different complexion on the whole matter. I have no doubt that concerns will be raised about the provisions that allow for the sharing of data between the jobcentre and various law enforcement agencies, but, as I said, I do not believe that this is a genuine worry. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain why.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000284"></a>Data security is extremely important and something on which I have to say the Government have a less than inspiring record. I expect that we will see this matter raised again at the next stage of the Bill if the Minister does not do quite such a good explanatory job as he did on the previous amendment, which was masterly. I would have thought it would be in his best interests to be as open and explicit as possible about the Government&#146;s intentions here in Committee so that, with a bit of luck, there will be no need to return to this matter on Report. We will just have to see.</p>

Amendment 101 takes out all the provisions that allow the Secretary of State or a person providing services to the Secretary of State&#151;that is, a benefits worker&#151;to ask for drug information on a benefits claimant from the police, the probation service or other such persons as may be prescribed.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000408"></a>&#147;Regulations under this paragraph may, in particular, authorise information supplied to a person under the regulations ... to be used for the purpose of amending or supplementing other information held by that person; and ... if it is so used, to be supplied to any other person, and used for any purpose, to whom and for which that other information could be supplied or used&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000381"></a>That is a little complicated in its wording, but it seems to allow this information to be passed on to quite a wide circle of other people.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000287"></a>Amendment 108 is almost exactly the same, but it applies to the employment and support allowance rather than the jobseeker&#146;s allowance. If the whole paragraph cannot be taken out, Amendment 101 is more limited.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000288"></a>I doubt that Amendment 100 will be accepted. It would merely take out the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09062557000423"></a>&#147;such other person as may be prescribed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062557000382"></a>This could include almost anyone. Liberty commented:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000409"></a>&#147;Such information is highly personal and it is worrying, given this government&#146;s history of data loss, that such information may be provided to an unspecified number of people&#148;.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000289"></a>Amendment 102 is more limited in that it excludes only health and social care workers from the provision that allows them to be approached for information, because they are the people most likely to have been given information by the client in confidence. There are three choices of level, but the people on them are all are highly critical of the blanket provision in the Bill.</p>

It makes us a bit suspicious when the pack says that it will not be passed back to the criminal justice agencies. You think, &#147;Well, why don&#146;t they say they won&#146;t pass information back to anyone?&#148;. Perhaps the Minister can explain that.</p>

Employers are unwilling to go near drug users because of this attribute of criminality and all the rest of it, so this goes against what the Bill wants. It is very important to have an assurance that, if this information is given, it will not go beyond the person to whom it is given.</p>

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, for giving us the chance to debate these amendments.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000293"></a>These provisions are not about frightening people off benefits. That is genuinely not what we are about here. Nothing could be further from the Government&#146;s intention. I set out the policy intention behind the drugs provisions and the reason why Clause 9 should stand part of the Bill in an earlier debate. The new drug and employment support programme will provide integrated and personalised support for problem drug users&#151;those dependent on heroin or crack cocaine.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000294"></a>Schedule 3 inserts a new section and schedule into the Jobseekers Act 1995 and the Welfare Reform Act 2007. The new provisions will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations that relate to people who claim the JSA or the ESA and who are dependent on, or have a propensity to misuse, drugs or alcohol to the extent that it affects their ability to gain and keep employment. Some of those regulations will concern the supply and use of information. Noble Lords have tabled a group of amendments on these issues, as we have heard. I will deal with each of the amendments in turn.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000295"></a>The Bill already ensures that the information covered by Amendment 99 cannot be used to incriminate a claimant who has provided it. It cannot be cited by the prosecution in criminal proceedings unless the defendant, or a person acting on their behalf, chooses to raise the matter. That is very clear. Jobcentre Plus will use information about a claimant&#146;s drug use only to enable the operation of the new drug and employment programme. Information provided by a claimant in answer to a question about their drug use or the result of a drug test might therefore need to be passed on to the drug worker who carries out the substance-related assessment, or to the employment support provider. However, this information will be handled in strict confidence. Jobcentre Plus will not disclose any

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000296"></a>There may be some instances in which information needs to be disclosed because this is in the overriding public interest; for example, where disclosure is necessary to prevent harm to a child. However, any disclosure would have to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998, and be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Information provided by claimants about their drug use would be sensitive personal data, and the processing of the information would be subject to additional requirements under the Data Protection Act. If a member of staff discloses information without lawful authority they would be committing an offence under Section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which is punishable by imprisonment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000297"></a>However, we do not believe it to be appropriate to agree to a provision which routinely prevents the use of this information in connection with civil proceedings. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was right on that. These may include family court hearings where the use of class A drugs by a parent might be a relevant matter when making a decision about the residence of a child. This amendment would also mean that information from the claimant in answer to questions about their drug use, or information disclosed in connection with a substance-related assessment or drug test, could not be referred to in an appeal against a benefit decision. That clearly would not be sensible.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000298"></a>On Amendments 100 and 108, paragraph 5 is intended to help Jobcentre Plus identify problem drug users so that they can be provided with the support that they need to prepare for and find work. We are aware that some problem drug users will not disclose that they have a drug problem due to stigma or embarrassment, or other reasons, but we do not want them to miss out on the support that will be available.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000299"></a>Regulations will allow information to be supplied to Jobcentre Plus by the police, probation service or other person as may be prescribed. It will be used to check and supplement information already held about a claimant&#146;s drug use. The information already held may include the claimant&#146;s answers to questions about their drug use, the results of a substance-related assessment, and, in a minority of cases, the results of drug testing. However, I reassure noble Lords that none of the information supplied under paragraph 5 will contain medical details, and no data will be provided from Jobcentre Plus to the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000300"></a>The probation service will provide details of people who are subject to a drug rehabilitation requirement. These are issued by a court, as part of a community sentence, and require those convicted of a crime to undergo drug treatment. About 16,000 of these are issued each year. Supply of this information will enable them to be included in the programme.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000301"></a>Information will also be supplied about people who fail to attend for a police &#147;required assessment&#148;. This means they tested positive for drug use when arrested or charged with an offence and then they failed to

Details of those individuals, who number around 13,000 a year, will be provided by the drug workers who carry out these assessments. We intend to achieve this using the power to prescribe &#147;other persons&#148; at paragraph 5(1)(c), but these are flows into Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000304"></a>Both amendments would prevent the use I have just described. We also intend to use this power to obtain information about people who have recently left prison from the Prison Service. Many prisoners are treated for drug problems while in prison, and will claim benefit on release.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000305"></a>It is important that we identify them at this point. In future, it may be considered appropriate to authorise other persons or bodies to supply information. Therefore, it is important that we retain flexibility in the powers of paragraph 5(1).</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000306"></a>Regulations authorising the supply of information by prescribed persons will be subject to the affirmative parliamentary procedure, so before they can come into force they will have to be approved in draft by both Houses. Therefore, there will be an opportunity to consider and debate the regulations. Information supplied in paragraph 5 will be treated in strict confidence and will be used only to the extent that it is necessary to check the accuracy of information given by claimants about their drug use, and to enable the operation of the new drug and employment programme. The regulations will include safeguards to ensure that the use and sharing of the information is proportionate to our aims. The processing of the information will have to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

Suppose the claimant had denied drug use and then a submission was made to the police or the probation officer to ask if they had any evidence. You could say that this would be supplementing the information from the claimant. If it became known to claimants that inquiries to the police or the probation service will be made if they claim benefits, I would again assume that claimants will simply run a mile from the benefits system because

If somebody has come into Jobcentre Plus, been asked about drug dependency and has answered that they have none, but the flows of information from the police suggest otherwise, having that information available to Jobcentre Plus is quite important. This is particularly true for the category of people I have just described, who do not turn up for the assessment. It enables the assessment to be undertaken or mandated, and potentially opens up the gateway to the programme of support that is available. That would be the nature of the flow for somebody who has come in and lied about drug dependency. I can understand that people are concerned about it. This would be a supplementary source of information that could identify potential problems.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000309"></a>Shortly I will perhaps have a more precise answer to that and the question of why, if we did not have that gateway, it would preclude the question leading to the assessment. That is the thinking behind those flows. The Bill is quite clear about what that information can be used for. Paragraph 5(3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000410"></a>&#147;Regulations under this paragraph may, in particular, authorise information supplied to a person under the regulations&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062557000411"></a>(a) to be used for the purpose of amending or supplementing or supplementing other information held by that person&#148;.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000310"></a>That is the thrust of that information.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000312"></a>It would be helpful if we could be told exactly what that means because it is the origin of the suspicions around this.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000314"></a>We do not intend to use the power to authorise the supply of information obtained by persons in the course of providing treatment, counselling or care to claimants. For example, the power will not be used to authorise the supply of information held by doctors or the supply of any medical details of the claimant. That is as specific as I can be on that. I hope my noble friend Lord Rea is comforted by it.</p>

Given the discussions we have had today and the range of concerns raised, I shall be pleased to do whatever I can between now and Report to engage on all of these issues. It is important that we do that.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC532"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC532</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000317"></a>On Amendments 103 and 109, which concern the disclosure of information, as the Bill is drafted, paragraph 5(2) will allow regulations to provide that information obtained under paragraph 5(1) from the criminal justice system could be supplied by Jobcentre Plus to other third parties and to impose limits on the circumstances and the extent to which the information could be disclosed. These amendments would remove that ability. Instead, the new sub-paragraph would limit the use of information supplied by a claimant under paragraph 5 so that it can be used only for the purposes of determining the benefit claim. I can reassure the Committee that regulations made under the power in paragraph 5(2) can allow information to be provided to a third party only in relation to ensuring the accuracy of information given by claimants about their drug use, or where it is otherwise needed to operate the new drugs provisions. Paragraph 5(2) enables regulations to impose further limits on the circumstances in and the extent to which this information can be disclosed. The safeguards that I have already outlined will apply here too.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000318"></a>The main purpose for which we need to rely on paragraph 5(2) is to allow information from the police, drug workers or the Probation Service to be passed on to the drug treatment provider who carries out a substance-related assessment. For example, when referring a person to a substance-related assessment it might be appropriate to disclose that they had failed to attend a police-required assessment. Therefore, our intended use of the power at paragraph 5(2) is limited, but it is important that we retain flexibility to authorise the supply of information to other persons involved in operating the drug and employment programme where it is necessary to properly assess a claimant&#146;s drug use and to enable the programme to operate effectively. If the amendment is accepted, the operation of the drug and employment programme could be hampered.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000319"></a>On Amendments 104 and 110, paragraph 5(3) has two functions. Under sub-paragraph (a), a recipient of information that has been provided from the police, Probation Service or other prescribed body can use that information to amend or supplement information already held by the recipient about the claimant&#146;s drug use. The information already held would include the claimant&#146;s answers to questions about their drug use or information obtained through the substance-related assessment or drug testing. For example, under paragraph 5(3)(a), where the claimant&#146;s answers about drug use were inaccurate, the information could be used to amend them. The amendment would prevent this.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000320"></a>Paragraph 5(3)(b), which seems to be a matter of particular contention, provides that when information has been used to amend or supplement information already held about the claimant&#146;s drug use, it can also then be disclosed to others. However, let me be clear, it can be disclosed only to people who would lawfully be allowed to receive and use the original information held about the claimant&#146;s drug use. It can be used only for the same purpose as the original information. So with information supplied by a criminal justice agency that has been used to modify or add to the claimant&#146;s answers about drug use, or the results of a substance-related assessment or drug testing, this provision would   


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC533"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC533</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allow the updated information to be used and shared in the same way as the original information. The amendment would prevent this happening.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000321"></a>A practical example of both of the above might be as follows. A claimant denies that they use drugs, and says that they are not subject to a drug rehabilitation requirement. Information received under paragraph 5 from the Probation Service suggests otherwise. Removing paragraph 5(3) would mean that regulations could not authorise the information from them to be used to correct the claimant&#146;s inaccurate replies. The result of this would be that the information could not form part of any reasonable grounds for suspecting that a claimant has a drug problem. This might mean they could not be referred to a substance-related assessment, even though the evidence suggests they have a drug problem.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000322"></a>These amendments therefore would hamper the ability to use and share the information that may be provided under paragraph 5 in order to assess whether a claimant has a drug problem. We need to use, and in certain circumstances share, information supplied by the criminal justice agencies in order to identify problem drug users, to get them on to the new programme, and to provide them with the support and help that they need to gain employment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000323"></a>We are aware of the need to ensure that any information sharing we provide for in regulations is proportionate to our aims. The affirmative parliamentary procedure will apply to the regulations so, before they come into force, they will have to be approved in draft by both Houses. The regulations will include a range of safeguards to ensure that the requirements are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000324"></a>I hope that those lengthy explanations about our intended use of these powers were helpful and that noble Lords are reassured that the regulations will be proportionate to our aims and compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the department will be subject to significant obligations to safeguard the confidentiality of information supplied under the regulations. Having said that, as I said a moment ago in response to my noble friend&#146;s question, I am very happy to meet with noble Lords between now and Report to go through any of this in more detail if they think that would be helpful. Accordingly, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</p>

<p class="amendment_hs_quote"><a name="09062557000414"></a>(1) Section 73 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (c. 4) (mobility component of disability living allowance) is amended as follows.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000332"></a>There are two components to the DLA: mobility and care. The care component has three levels, but the mobility component has just two: a higher level and a lower level. I think I said that it had three. At present a child must be more than three years old for a claim for the lower rate of mobility allowance to be made, and five years old for the higher rate. Severely disabled children under three who use heavy equipment, for example to help with their breathing, are thus being discriminated against. Vulnerable families are being denied vital support just because their disabled child is under three. If families do not receive any mobility component of the DLA, they are also not eligible for the Motability scheme&#151;again, I declare an interest&#151;which enables disabled people to obtain a car, powered wheelchair or scooter by using their government-funded mobility allowances.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000333"></a>This problem was brought to my attention particularly by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign&#151;I declare an interest as a vice-president&#151;which relates the case of Aaron, a boy from Oldham who is 19 months-old and was born with a debilitating muscle disorder. He cannot walk, sit up straight or breathe unaided, and relies on a special buggy that is equipped with a ventilator to keep him alive. Children with this kind of disorder might live for at least 10 years or more.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000334"></a>Aaron ideally needs a specially adapted vehicle big enough for the buggy to fit into. His parents applied for mobility allowance to help them pay for one but the DWP told them that they were not eligible until he was three. His mother said: &#147;We have a blue badge for him but we aren&#146;t allowed mobility allowance. Without that we can&#146;t afford the &#163;10,000 it would cost for an adapted vehicle. I am my son&#146;s full-time carer. My husband was made redundant last year and is looking for work. As a result Aaron is going to be housebound. We can&#146;t take him shopping or even to the park or to see his granddad who is seriously ill. I can&#146;t understand why they won&#146;t help. They say the law is the law and that children under three can be carried. It&#146;s impossible to carry my son and his equipment. It feels like he&#146;s  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC536"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC536</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>being discriminated against because of his age and disability&#148;. The Minister will say that the Family Fund might help provide this equipment, but why should a family in this situation be forced to rely on a charity, admirable though it is?</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000335"></a>The amendment is necessary because families with disabled children are more likely to live in poverty than families with non-disabled children. It costs three times as much to bring up a disabled child compared with other children, and childcare costs for disabled children are up to five times as much. Families with disabled children are both 50 per cent more likely to be in debt than other families, and 50 per cent less likely to be able to afford essentials such as new clothes or things like school outings.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000336"></a>The campaign to give blind people higher rate mobility DLA was successful&#151;hooray for that. I urge the Government to look favourably on this very small group of severely disabled children and to allow them to have the lower rate of mobility allowance claimed for them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000337"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09062557000568"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My own pathway to work today has been rather lengthy, but I seize it with alacrity. This is the only point at which we will be debating Clause 12, which extends the mobility component to blind people. I notice in the Explanatory Note that it does not change the arrangements for blind/deaf people. I met such a person yesterday at the Lincolnshire Show. He was there as a pillion rider on a trick buggy that was leaping over vans, cars and various other things. That shows the degree of imagination that is needed when dealing with people and the way in which people with even the most substantial handicaps can be helped into occupational employment. I could communicate with this very courageous young person only through his care worker tapping on the palms of his hands. It is very humiliating, as I am sure noble Lords will understand.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000338"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, for raising this topic in her amendment, which seeks to extend the entitlement to receive the mobility component of the DLA to certain categories of children under three. Those categories she has listed expand the existing categories in Section 73 of the 1992 Act, which states in subsection (1) that,</p>
<ul><a name="09062557000426"></a>&#147;a person shall be entitled to the mobility component of a disability living allowance for any period in which he is over the age of 5 and throughout which ... he is suffering from physical disablement such that he is either unable to walk or virtually unable to do so&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062557000383"></a>I would have thought that at least two of the categories at proposed new paragraphs (a) and (b) could be covered by that existing criterion. The noble Baroness clearly believes that very disabled children are currently falling outside the protection of the 1992 Act. I confess that I was not hitherto aware of the problem and so I am not in a position to offer much further comment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000339"></a>However, other noble Lords and I would be in a more informed position if the Minister could provide us with figures on the number of children who might fall into these categories. By setting the age in her amendment at three years-old the noble Baroness has brought into play payments at the higher rate. However, the age level set me wondering and I asked the noble  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC537"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC537</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Baroness to consider whether the criteria in her amendment are realistic. Would a child under three be likely to be using motorised buggies or wheelchairs, for example? I would have thought that unlikely. Severely disabled children would surely be more than usually dependent upon their parents&#146; support. The point she is making is that parents of very disabled children who are not in the categories covered in the 1992 Act might need additional support. This would cost the Government money but, as it would apply to only a small number of children, can the Minister tell us how much?</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000340"></a>If he intends to resist the amendment, I look forward to an explanation. He may say that the amendment is not necessary because this small category of disabled children is already covered under existing legislation, as I have suggested it might be, but, along with other noble Lords, I shall look carefully to see whether that assurance satisfies the noble Baroness, who apparently has identified a hole in the net.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000341"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09062557000569"></a>Baroness Campbell of Surbiton:</b> I support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas. I can assure noble Lords that there are indeed increasing numbers of children with severe impairments who require the use of ventilation and feeding equipment. In fact, I am only four stone but when I bring all my junk with me&#151;my ventilator, my ripple bed, my special chair and my medication&#151;I need a truck to allow me to go on holiday.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000342"></a>Children of two and three with spinal-muscular atrophy and very severe forms of neuro-muscular impairment are now being ventilated from the age of six months. Some types of ventilating equipment are light and others are very heavy; it depends on what you require. Feeding equipment is incredibly heavy to carry around because of the bags that it has to be put in. I support the amendment because we know there are a small but increasing number of very severely impaired children who have the right to go wherever they want and to have the freedom of mobility that their brothers and sisters have. I believe that this is low cost and involves very small numbers.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000343"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0008.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09062557000570"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I find myself in the uncomfortable position of having to resist this amendment, although the Government are not unsympathetic to the arguments put forward. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, referred to Clause 12. I am pleased to see that we were able to make that development in the Commons. In fact, we did it twice and my noble friend will shortly be deleting the second of those.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000344"></a>We understand the situation that the parents of children dependent on therapeutic technologies and equipment can face, especially where the equipment is heavy and difficult to transport. The noble Baronesses, Lady Campbell and Lady Thomas, gave some practical examples of that. I should clarify the intention behind the amendment because, as it is drafted, it has the effect of extending the lower rate mobility component of the DLA to children under the age of three. I understand the intention is to extend the higher rate mobility component and with it access to the Motability scheme to children under the age of three.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC538"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC538</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="09062557000444"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000345"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the higher-rate mobility component of DLA is, quite rightly, assessed by an inability, or virtual inability, to walk when out of doors. When deciding entitlement to the component, decision-makers have to take account of a variety of factors such as the distance someone can walk, the speed of their walking, the manner of their walking, whether walking brings on severe discomfort and whether the very act of walking could be detrimental to their health. These are the statutory requirements intended to inform a reasonable view of someone&#146;s walking ability.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000346"></a>With reference to young children, I think that we can all agree that the great majority of non-disabled children will be walking by their third birthday, and most of them will have been walking much earlier than that. But very few of them will have been walking considerable distances. The majority will have required, and may continue to require, significant help from their parents and a reliance on prams, buggies or other bulky or awkward equipment that parents regularly carry with them.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000347"></a>However, we recognise that therapeutic equipment used to support some disabled children can, in certain instances, prove to be bulky, heavy or awkward to carry or transport. We understand that this can place a great strain on the time, resources and finances of parents and siblings.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000348"></a>It is for these sorts of reasons that we already make sure that financial help is available to parents of children dependent on the equipment referenced in the amendment. For instance, there exists a range of measures, over and above the mobility component of DLA, designed to help families with disabled young children. The disability-related premiums in the income-related benefits and the additional elements for disabled children in tax credits are but two of the statutory provisions.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000349"></a>However, extra statutory schemes such as the Family Fund, to which the noble Baroness anticipated I would make reference, can also provide help for less well-off families with disabled children. The fund can help with travelling costs and can extend to the purchase of vehicles in exceptional cases, although all decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000350"></a>Of course, in this difficult financial climate, we need to consider carefully the potential cost of any such change; the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked me specifically about this. This amendment would, of course, result in additional costs, but these are difficult to estimate. Our broad estimates put the cost at around &#163;15 million per year. This would obviously be a significant increase in what is, unfortunately, a difficult economic situation, and is simply not affordable in the current context. On numbers, our estimates, which were quite difficult to compile, suggest that there could be around 5,000 children under the age of three who could potentially benefit from the impact of the amendment.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000351"></a>In summary, I am not dismissing the broad aim of the amendment. As I said earlier, we are sympathetic to the aim, which we take to be delivering greater help to the parents of severely disabled children who depend on certain therapeutic technologies or equipment to get them around out of doors. But, for the reasons  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC539"></a><b>25 Jun 2009 : Column GC539</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>outlined earlier, we believe that this amendment is not the best way of advancing that aim. With a degree of regret, I therefore ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09062557000352"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0008.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09062557000571"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply, and particularly thank the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, for her speech, which was extremely interesting. It was so detailed, and she knew exactly what I was talking about. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has broken his duck for today, and I am glad to have given him the chance to do so.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000353"></a>I apologise for mixing things up. The Motability scheme would, of course, come into play only when the child is a bit older&#151;I think it is five years old. It would then have high-rate DLA and might be able to have some sort of equipment under the Motability scheme. The lower rate would help a great deal but would not provide any equipment under that scheme.</p>

<a name="90625-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062557000354"></a>I think that the Minister meant &#163;15 million a year. Is that right?</p>

<p><a name="09062557000355"></a><b><a name="90625-gc0008.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09062557000572"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Yes, &#163;15 million a year, but that was on the assumption that the amendment was focused on the higher rate.</p>

It would just be a sum that families could receive as of right if they have a child, in that case. That would be very helpful, because I admit that I did conflate the two. I shall read what the Minister said with interest to see whether to come back at the next stage.</p>

The Committee will also know that the reason for its current inclusion is the exuberance for change in another place. Although I commend their enthusiasm, they have left us with two clauses which to all intents and purposes strive to do the same thing.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09062537000003"></a><I>The following Statement is dated 24 June 2009.</I></p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09062537000004"></a><b><a name="90625-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09062537000071"></a>The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Baroness Royall of Blaisdon):</b> I would like to inform the House of the proposals for the scrutiny of national policy statements, which have been agreed with the usual channels and which I intend to submit to the Procedure Committee for approval.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09062537000005"></a>Under Section 9(2) of the Planning Act 2008, each national policy statement (NPS) must be laid before Parliament. In relation to an NPS, the Secretary of State will specify a relevant period for parliamentary scrutiny. During that period, the Government will offer a debate on an NPS in the Grand Committee, for up to four hours. At the end of the debate, the Minister would respond. In order to facilitate debate, it is envisaged that a list of speakers would be opened for each NPS debate in the Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09062537000006"></a>As was made clear during deliberations on the Planning Act in this House, it is important that Members have the opportunity to scrutinise national policy statements and that the Government respond to Members&#146; views. I hope therefore that the House will welcome these proposals.</p>

The UK was represented by Andy Lebrecht, the UK&#146;s Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09062537000035"></a>As expected, the council discussed and agreed the Commission&#146;s proposal for a revision of the council directive on oil stocking (council document 15910/08). The directive will align the EU to international energy agency regulations and increase the EU&#146;s resilience to disruptions in oil supply.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09062537000036"></a>This was followed by a report from the presidency on progress on the three energy efficiency directives currently being negotiated by the council and Parliament. These are related specifically to labelling (council document 15906/08), tyres (council document 15920/08) and buildings (council document 15929/08).</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09062537000037"></a>Finally, the Commission and presidency presented information on a number of developments in EU external energy relations, including those with Russia, Ukraine, the energy community treaty, OPEC and  the G8.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09062537000038"></a>Over lunch, Ministers had the first opportunity to discuss the potential location of the Agency for the Co-operation of Energy Regulators, which will be established by the third package of legislation on the EU&#146;s internal energy market. Slovakia, Romania and Slovenia have all put themselves forwards as candidates. As all received roughly equal support from member states, further discussions will now take place.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="09062537000039"></a><b><a name="90625-wms0001.htm_spmin6"></a><a name="09062537000077"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Shahid Malik) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09062537000040"></a>I should like to inform the House that, in the light of our review of national procurement in the fire and rescue service (FRS) in England, we propose to make a number of changes affecting Firebuy Ltd, the professional buying organisation for the service.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09062537000041"></a>Firebuy Ltd was established as a non-departmental public body on 30 March 2006 to deliver the 2005-2008 national procurement strategy for the FRS. Within the current arrangements, Firebuy has been effective in establishing national fire-specific procurement for vehicles and equipment and has delivered benefits for the service.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09062537000042"></a>There is a continuing need to drive procurement efficiency at a national level in the FRS, particularly in the light of targets for collaborative procurement set by the Government&#146;s operational efficiency programme and we believe that a national procurement body represents the best way to deliver fire-specific collaborative procurement. This will be reflected in the revised national procurement strategy, which we intend to publish in July, taking account of responses to the consultation last year and the recommendations of the operational efficiency programme.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09062537000043"></a>However, going forward there is a need to consider the future role and structure of the body delivering FRS national procurement, particularly given that the department must also make longer-term provision for managing ongoing FiReControl and Firelink contracts. We propose, therefore, that Firebuy&#146;s functions should in future be carried out within a larger organisation, integrating national procurement with the management of the service contracts for the fire and resilience programme (Firelink, FiReControl and New Dimension). Firebuy already performs this function in respect of New Dimension. More detailed proposals for in-service management of the fire and resilience programme will be set out in a consultation paper, which we will publish shortly.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09062537000044"></a>I am grateful to the current chair and board of Firebuy for the work that they have done and for agreeing to have had their terms of office extended to November 2009 while the review was under way. A new board for the NDPB will be required from that date to reflect the new role of the organisation. Recruitment of the board will commence in the summer of 2009, including representation from the key stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09062537000046"></a>I have today placed in the House Library copies  of an update report detailing the progress that  the Government have made in implementing the recommendations contained in Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s report on the 2007 summer floods. A copy of the report is also on the Defra website at <a href="http://defra.gov.uk/environ/fcd/floods07.htm">http://defra.gov.uk/environ/fcd/floods07.htm</a>.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09062537000047"></a>Significant progress has been made. We have published a draft flood and water management Bill for consultation and will develop firm legislative proposals in the light of comments from Parliament and consultees. However, in advance of the Bill becoming law, we have taken immediate action to help communities at risk of flooding. Since the summer 2007 floods, we have, for example:</p>
increased government funding from &#163;600 million in 2007-08 to a forecast of &#163;780 million for 2010-11, with an additional &#163;20 million brought forward into this year&#146;s budgets to allow an early start to projects that will benefit 27,000 homes when complete;completed 85 flood defence schemes, protecting nearly 58,000 additional homes in England. Operating authorities are currently on course to exceed delivery targets and provide better protection to 160,000 homes over the three years to March 2011;signed up 136,000 additional people to receive flood warnings in England and Wales; set up a &#163;7.7 million flood forecasting centre, jointly run by the Environment Agency and Met Office, which is already providing important services to local authorities and emergency responders, helping them to be better prepared for potential flooding;announced a &#163;5 million grant scheme for householders for property-level flood protection such as air bricks and door boards. I am announcing today the results of the first round of this scheme, which will provide greater flood protection to nearly 600 households in England; announced funding for 27 places for local authority participants in the existing Environment Agency foundation degree programmes and other local flood risk management training. This will help to ensure that local communities have the expertise that they need to help them to protect themselves from flooding;provided the first allocations to six local authorities from the &#163;15 million funding allocated to help the highest priority areas manage surface water flood risk. Progress on implementing the first tranche as well as next steps on the remaining funds will be announced later this summer;announced &#163;1 million funding for three projects to demonstrate how land management change and working with natural processes can help to protect against flooding; published a long-term investment strategy, the Environment Agency&#146;s assessment of the costs and benefits of investment over the next 25 years given the latest projections of climate change. I am keen to encourage a public debate on how future funding needs are best met; and

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09062537000048"></a>The Government have today announced that around 99 per cent of those displaced by the summer 2007 floods are now back in their homes. We sympathise with those who for whatever reason have not yet been able to return and we are committed to ensuring that the remaining families get back into their homes as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09062537000049"></a>The Pitt progress report explains how we will complete implementation of Sir Michael&#146;s recommendations, with target dates. The risk of flooding remains and last week&#146;s publication of the UKCP09 climate projections underlines how it will increase in the future as a result of climate change. The Government remain determined to make this country better able to anticipate and deal with the impacts of flooding. I will continue to keep the House informed of progress through future progress reports, the next of which will be due around the turn of the year.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09062537000057"></a>The report gives the appointed person&#146;s opinion as to the circumstances and manner in which the search powers conferred by the Act are being exercised. I am pleased that the appointed person, Andrew Clarke, has expressed satisfaction with the operation of the search power and has found that there is nothing to suggest that the procedures are not being followed in accordance with the Act.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="09062537000058"></a>From 1 April 2008 to the end of March 2009, over &#163;106 million in cash was seized by law enforcement agencies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland under powers in the Act. The seizures are subject to further investigation and the cash is subject to further judicially approved detention, before forfeiture in the magistrates&#146; court. These powers are a valuable tool in the fight against crime and the report shows that the way in which they are used has been, and will continue to be, closely monitored.</p>

<a name="09062537000060"></a><b><a name="90625-wms0001.htm_spmin10"></a><a name="09062537000081"></a>The Secretary of State for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> I am today announcing that the UK Government are in the course of concluding their negotiations with SNCF and SNCB to incorporate the existing tri-national Eurostar operations into a single company. The UK Government, via London and Continental Railways Ltd, will have a substantial minority shareholding in the new Eurostar company. Subject to further work and final agreement, this shareholding will be in the order of 40 per cent.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09062537000061"></a>Eurostar is the pre-eminent international passenger train operator. This is recognised by the record 9 million passengers who used the service to travel between London and the continent last year, following the opening of the High Speed 1 line from St Pancras International station. Eurostar not only is a very successful service, but has also saved around 40,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions as a result of attracting extra travellers who would otherwise have travelled by plane since the move to High Speed 1.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09062537000062"></a>The Government&#146;s aim, as a shareholder, has always been to provide Eurostar with the stability and sustainability to develop its services on a properly stand-alone commercial basis, operating in a newly competitive market. The proposals under finalisation with SNCF and SNCB are designed to achieve those objectives.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="09062537000063"></a>The principal part of the discussions to be concluded is to convert the present Eurostar operation, which is an unincorporated joint venture operating co-operatively but separately in the three partner countries, into a

As such the UK will contribute to the new venture the assets and interests of Eurostar (UK) Ltd, which is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of London and Continental Railways Ltd.</p>

<a name="90625-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="09062537000064"></a>The company will have a strong board with an independent chairman and independent non-executive representation, as well as UK and other partner shareholder representatives. There will be proper shareholder rights and protections for the UK as a minority shareholder.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="09062537000065"></a>The final terms remain subject to further work being undertaken by the Eurostar management and final commercial agreement between the parties and a confirmation that SNCB will join the new venture. I expect to make a further announcement on these matters later this year.</p>

We are currently working through the formal UK process of ratification, during which we will lay the required Explanatory Memorandum before Parliament to obtain approval for ratification. If Parliament agrees to ratification, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will then commence the formal ratification process with the Council of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="09062538000004"></a>The Government had hoped to complete this process earlier in the year, but due to extended discussions with the devolved Administrations and with legal advisers this has not been possible. We do not believe that further legislation will be necessary before we can proceed. We now hope to complete the parliamentary process before the Summer Recess, and the Council of Europe process within two months of that.</p>
