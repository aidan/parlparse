</P><P>
<CENTER><B>BY THE CLERK OF THE PARLIAMENTS<BR>
</B></CENTER>
</P><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Code of Conduct adopted by the House on 2nd July 2001 establishes
a Register and a Registrar of Lords' Interests. The operation
of the Register is overseen by the Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests,
a sub-committee of the Committee for Privileges. The Registrar,
who is responsible for preparing the Register and advising Members,
consults the Sub-Committee when necessary. The Code itself is
printed below.<BR>

</P><P>
The Code requires that the Register be reprinted
once a year and this new printed edition meets this requirement
and follows an exercise in which all Members of the House were
invited to confirm or amend their entries.<BR>

</P><P>
Between printed editions, the Register is continually
kept up to date in loose-leaf form and may be inspected at the
Table of the House and in the Table Office and the Library. Members
of the public can inspect the Register in the Parliamentary Archives,
and an electronic version, updated every week, is available online
at .www.parliament.uk.
<BR>
<BR>

</P><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Code requires all Members of the House of
Lords in receipt of a Writ of Summons, who are not on Leave of
Absence, to register all relevant interests. The test of relevance
is whether the interest might reasonably be thought by the public
to affect the way in which a Member discharges his or her parliamentary
duties. Relevant interests include both financial and non-financial
interests. Those interests which the Code identifies as &quot;always
relevant&quot; must be registered and are set out in paragraphs
12 (financial) and 15 (non-financial) of the Code; other interests
may be registered &quot;depending on their significance&quot;
and are set out in paragraphs 13 and 16. Members must register
relevant interests within one month of acquiring them.<BR>

</P><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee has recommended that <B>registrations</B>
relating to paragraphs 13 and 16 of the Code (other relevant interests)
be restricted to those interests which might reasonably be thought
by the public to affect in general the way in which Members discharge
their parliamentary duties. A Member may have additional interests,
relevant in particular circumstances, which will then require
<B>declaration</B> in the context of those circumstances (for
example, a debate in the Chamber, or a letter to a Government
Minister or executive agency).<BR>

</P><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who are in doubt as to whether an interest
is relevant for the purposes of the Register should seek the advice
of the Registrar. A Member who acts on the advice of the Registrar
in determining what is a relevant interest satisfies fully the
requirements of the Code of Conduct. In cases of difficulty the
Registrar will consult the Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests.
Members of the House should accept its decision as if it were
that of the House. For further guidance, Members may wish to consult
paragraphs 4.76-4.82 of the Companion to the Standing Orders and
Guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords; the debates and
resolutions of the House of 1st and 7th November 1995 and 2nd
and 24th July 2001; reports of the Committee for Privileges; and
take the advice of the Registrar and other clerks.<BR>

</P><P>
For the avoidance of doubt, visits made by Members
under the auspices of the United Kingdom Government and Parliament,
the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the Inter-Parliamentary
Union and other similar inter-parliamentary bodies are not registered.
 All other expenses-paid visits made by Members are registered,
including those made under the auspices of All-Party Groups and
the Industry and Parliament Trust.<BR>

</P><P>
The Code of Conduct is currently under review by
a Group of Members of the House appointed by the Leader of the
House. The Group is likely to report with recommendations in October
2009. Any changes to the Code resulting from this review would
require the agreement of the House.<BR>

</P><P>
<CENTER><B>CODE OF CONDUCT</B></CENTER>
</P><P>
<CENTER><B>Adopted on Monday 2nd July 2001<BR>
<B>as amended on Tuesday 24th July 2001<BR>
</B></B></CENTER>
</P><P>
<A NAME="a1"><B>Purpose of the Code<BR>
</B><UL>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Code of Conduct is:<BR>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;to provide guidance for Members of the House of Lords
on the standards of conduct expected of them in the discharge
of their parliamentary and public duties;<BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;to provide the openness and accountability necessary to
reinforce public confidence in the way in which Members of the
House of Lords perform their parliamentary and public duties.</UL>
<BR>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Code applies to all Members of the House of Lords
who have not taken leave of absence.</UL>
<A NAME="a2"><B>Public duty<BR>
</B><UL>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of their oath, or affirmation, of allegiance,
Members of the House have a duty to be faithful and bear true
allegiance to Her Majesty The Queen, Her heirs and successors,
according to law.</UL>
<A NAME="a3"><B>Personal conduct<BR>
</B><UL>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House:<BR>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;must comply with the Code of Conduct;<BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;should act always on their personal honour;<BR>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;must never accept any financial inducement as an incentive
or reward for exercising parliamentary influence;<BR>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;must not vote on any bill or motion, or ask any question
in the House or a committee, or promote any matter, in return
for payment or any other material benefit (the &quot;no paid advocacy&quot;
rule).</UL>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House should observe the seven general principles
of conduct identified by the Committee on Standards in Public
Life. The seven principles are:<BR>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selflessness</I>: Holders of public office should
take decisions solely in terms of the public interest They should
not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits
for themselves, their family, or their friends.<BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Integrity</I>: Holders of public office should not
place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside
individuals or organisations that might influence them in the
performance of their official duties.<BR>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Objectivity</I>: In carrying out public business, including
making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending
individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office
should make choices on merit.<BR>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Accountability</I>: Holders of public office are accountable
for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit
themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.
<BR>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Openness</I>: Holders of public office should be as
open as possible about all the decisions and actions that they
take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict
information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.
<BR>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Honesty</I>: Holders of public office have a duty to
declare any private interests relating to their public duties
and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that
protects the public interest<BR>
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Leadership</I>: Holders of public office should promote
and support these principles by leadership and example.</UL></UL>
<BR>
<A NAME="a4"><B>Primacy of the public interest<BR>
</B><UL>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conduct of their parliamentary duties, Members
of the House shall resolve any conflict between their personal
interest and the public interest in favour of the public interest</UL>
<BR>
<A NAME="a5"><B>Register of Interests<BR>
</B><UL>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be established a register of Lords'
interests referred to in this Code. The register shall be maintained
under the authority of the Clerk of the Parliaments by a Registrar
appointed by him.<BR>
<BR>
A Member of the House must register relevant interests before
31st March 2002 and thereafter within one month of acquiring them.
<BR>
<BR>
The register shall be available for public inspection in accordance
with arrangements made by the Registrar.  The register shall be
regularly updated and shall be reprinted annually.  The annual
publication shall include all interests registered since the previous
edition and all continuing interests unless their termination
has been notified to the Registrar.</UL>
<A NAME="a6"><B>Registration and Declaration of Relevant Interests
<BR>
</B><UL>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House <B>must</B>:<BR>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>register</B> in the Register of Lords' Interests
all <I>relevant</I> interests, in order to make clear what are
the interests that might reasonably be thought to influence their
actions;<BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>declare </B>when speaking in the
House, or communicating with ministers, government departments
or executive agencies, any interest which is a relevant interest
in the context of the debate or the matter under discussion. This
is necessary in order that their audience may form a balanced
judgment of their arguments. In cases where Members of the House
vote in a division where they have a relevant interest that they
have not been able to declare, they should register that interest
within 24 hours of the division.</UL></UL>
<BR>
<A NAME="a7"><B>What is a relevant interest?<BR>
</B><UL>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
test of relevant interest is whether the interest might reasonably
be thought by the public to affect the way in which a Member of
the House of Lords discharges his or her parliamentary duties.
<BR>
<BR>
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of relevant interest is therefore not whether
a Member's actions in Parliament <I>will be </I>influenced by
the interest, but whether the public might reasonably think that
this might be the case.<BR>
<BR>
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Relevant interests include both financial and non-financial
interests.</UL>
<A NAME="a8"><B>Relevant financial interests<BR>
</B><UL>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
following financial interests are always relevant and therefore
<B>must be registered</B>:<BR>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;any consultancy agreement under
which Members of the House provide parliamentary advice or services.
A copy of any such agreement, and the remuneration received by
Members for advice in relation to parliamentary matters, must
be deposited with the Registrar of Lords' Interests, so that details
are available for public inspection.<BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;employment or any other financial interest in businesses
involved in parliamentary lobbying on behalf of clients, including
public relations and law firms but Members of the House involved
with organisations that offer commercial lobbying services are
not obliged to refrain from participating in parliamentary business
in connection with <I>all</I> clients of that organisation but
only their personal clients;<BR>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;any remunerated service which Members of the House provide
by virtue of their position as Members of Parliament, and the
clients of any such service;<BR>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;employment as a non-parliamentary consultant;<BR>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;remunerated directorships;<BR>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;regular remunerated employment (excluding occasional income
from speeches, lecturing, broadcasting and journalism);<BR>
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;shareholdings amounting to a controlling interest;<BR>
(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;provision by an outside body of secretarial and research
assistance;<BR>
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;visits with costs paid in the United Kingdom and overseas,
made as a Member of Parliament, except any visits paid for from
public funds.</UL>
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;The list in paragraph 12 above is not exhaustive. For
example, <B>relevant financial interests may also include</B>
(depending on their significance):<BR>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;shareholdings not amounting to a controlling interest;
<BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;landholdings (excluding Members' homes);<BR>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;the financial interests of a spouse or relative or friend;
<BR>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;hospitality or gifts given to a Member which could reasonably
be regarded as an incentive to support a particular cause or interest</UL>
<BR>
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for remuneration received by Members for advice
in relation to parliamentary matters, Members of the House are
not required to disclose how much they earn from the financial
interests set out in paragraphs 12 and 13, but they may do so
if they wish.</UL>
<A NAME="a9"><B>Relevant non-financial interests<BR>
</B><UL>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following non-financial interests are always
relevant and therefore <B>must be registered:<BR>
</B><UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;membership of public bodies such as hospital trusts,
the governing bodies of universities, colleges and schools, and
local authorities;<BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;trusteeships of museums, galleries or similar bodies;
<BR>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;acting as an office-holder or trustee in pressure groups
or trade unions;<BR>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;acting as an office-holder or trustee in voluntary or
not-for-profit organisations.</UL>
16.&nbsp;&nbsp;The list in paragraph 15 above is not exhaustive. For
example, <B>relevant non-financial interests may also include</B>
(depending on their significance):<BR>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;other trusteeships;<BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;unpaid membership of voluntary organisations.</UL>
17.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are not obliged to <I>register</I>
membership of Churches, religious bodies and quasi-religious organisations.
But it may be necessary to <I>declare</I> such interests (see
paragraph 8).</UL>
<A NAME="a10"><B>Advice<BR>
</B><UL>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation of the register shall be overseen
by a Sub-Committee of the Committee for Privileges on Lords' Interests
and the Registrar shall consult the Sub-Committee when necessary.
The Registrar is available to advise Members of the House. A Member
who acts on the advice of the Registrar in determining what is
a relevant interest satisfies fully the requirements of the Code
of Conduct.</UL>
<A NAME="a11"><B>Enforcement of the Code of Conduct<BR>
</B><UL>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations of non-compliance with this Code are
dealt with as follows:<BR>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any allegation should normally be raised first with
the Member complained against. However, there may be circumstances
when it is more appropriate to raise the matter with a party Leader
or Chief Whip, or the Convenor of the Cross Bench Peers.<BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complainant chooses to pursue the matter, he or
she should refer the allegation in private directly to the Sub-Committee
on Lords' Interests, through its chairman.<BR>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee will then examine the allegation and
may decide to investigate it further or to dismiss it.<BR>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the investigation and adjudication of complaints against
them, Members of the House have the right to safeguards as rigorous
as those applied in the courts and professional disciplinary bodies.
<BR>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;If after investigation the Sub-Committee finds the allegation
proved, the Member complained against has a right of appeal to
the Committee for Privileges.<BR>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusions of the Sub-Committee and of the Committee
for Privileges are reported to the House.</UL>
20.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 7 shall have effect forthwith; the remainder
of this Code shall have effect from 31st March 2002; and the resolution
of the House of 7th November 1995 on the practice of the House
in relation to Lords' interests shall cease to have effect on
the same date.</UL>

                  <p>In the interests of transparency I am registering that I 
                    hold the post of President of the EU-Russia Centre, which 
                    is a lobbying and research organisation based in Brussels 
                    and registered under Belgian law as an NGO. The aim of the 
                    Centre is to encourage and facilitate dialogue and policy 
                    development between European governments and politicians and 
                    their opposite numbers in the Russian Federation.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    From time to time the Centre lobbies the UK Government (and 
                    other European Governments) on policy towards Russia.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    I receive occasional remuneration as President, but the fees 
                    received do not relate to lobbying as such, and there is no 
                    commercial lobbying on behalf of a client or clients. The 
                    post in no way arises from my membership of the House. The 
                    post involves regular travel to Brussels paid for by the Centre.

<UL>Following my decision last November to
take leave from the House to compete in the American Le Mans Series
of motor races, I have set up a Limited Liability Partnership,
Drayson Motor Racing LLP (DMR) as the commercial vehicle to run
the race team in a joint venture with Barwell Motorsport Limited;
Drayson-Barwell.   This joint venture has now ceased (February
2009).<BR>
DMR LLP will compete in 2009 in the American, European and Asian
Le Mans Series starting in March under the team name &quot;Drayson
Racing&quot;.   The team's new website is www.draysonracing.com.
<BR>Drayson Racing is an Official Partner Team of Aston Martin
Racing (Prodrive) the organisation that build the Aston Martin
race cars that I will race this year.<BR>
<BR>
My wife and I own DMR 100% and are the only Partners.<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of DMR is to fund the purchase and the development
of the Le Mans race car and to fund the testing and race programme.
  The funding for DMR will be initially from share capital invested
by us.   We will attract sponsors to support the programme who
will provide funding in return for rights to market their brand
names on the car and in team merchandise etc.  The ownership and
purpose of DMR remain unchanged<br>
Drayson Motor Racing LLP announced on 19 August 2009 additional technical partnerships with Lola Cars International Ltd, Engine Developments Ltd (Judd Engines) and Motul Lubricants to pursue an LMP1 race programme in the Le Mans Series for 2009/10. </UL>

Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ).<BR>
Research assistance - CCHQ have applied a donation from Mr. Dolar
Popat to finance my Special Adviser.   This has also been declared
to the Electoral Commission by the Conservative Party.<BR>

assistance.   No specific donor is involved; the funds come from
general provision by the Conservative Party to support my work
as a member of the Shadow Cabinet.<BR>
These arrangements support me in carrying out my specific frontbench
responsibilities as a Shadow Cabinet Minister.   They do not support
me in the performance of any other duties as a member of the House
