<P>
<CENTER><B>CODE OF CONDUCT<BR>
ADOPTED ON MONDAY 2ND JULY 2001<BR>
<I><B>as amended on Tuesday 24th July 2001<BR>
</B></I></B></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="a1"><B>Purpose of the Code</B>
<P>
<UL>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this
Code of Conduct is:
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;to provide guidance
for Members of the House of Lords on the standards of conduct
expected of them in the discharge of their parliamentary and public
duties;
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;to provide the openness and accountability
necessary to reinforce public confidence in the way in which Members
of the House of Lords perform their parliamentary and public duties.</UL>

<P>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Code applies to all Members of the House
of Lords who have not taken leave of absence.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a2"><B>Public duty</B>
<P>
<UL>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of their
oath, or affirmation, of allegiance, Members of the House have
a duty to be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty
The Queen, Her heirs and successors, according to law.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a3"><B>Personal conduct</B>
<P>
<UL>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House:
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;must comply with
the Code of Conduct;
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;should act always on their personal honour;
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;must never accept any financial inducement
as an incentive or reward for exercising parliamentary influence;
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;must not vote on any bill or motion, or ask
any question in the House or a committee, or promote any matter,
in return for payment or any other material benefit (the &quot;no
paid advocacy&quot; rule).</UL>

<P>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House should observe the seven
general principles of conduct identified by the Committee on Standards
in Public Life. The seven principles are:
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selflessness</I>:
Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms
of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain
financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family,
or their friends.
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Integrity</I>: Holders of public office
should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation
to outside individuals or organisations that might influence them
in the performance of their official duties.
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Objectivity</I>: In carrying out public
business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts,
or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders
of public office should make choices on merit.
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Accountability</I>: Holders of public
office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the
public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate
to their office.
<P>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Openness</I>: Holders of public office
should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions
that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and
restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly
demands.
<P>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Honesty</I>: Holders of public office
have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their
public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising
in a way that protects the public interest.
<P>
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Leadership</I>: Holders of public office
should promote and support these principles by leadership and
example.</UL></UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a4"><B>Primacy of the public
interest</B>
<P>
<UL>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conduct of
their parliamentary duties, Members of the House shall resolve
any conflict between their personal interest and the public interest
in favour of the public interest.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a5"><B>Register of Interests</B>
<P>
<UL>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be established
a register of Lords' interests referred to in this Code. The register
shall be maintained under the authority of the Clerk of the Parliaments
by a Registrar appointed by him.<BR>

<P>
<UL>A Member of the House must
register relevant interests before 31st March 2002 and thereafter
within one month of acquiring them.<BR>

<P>
The register shall be available for public inspection
in accordance with arrangements  made by the Registrar.  The register
shall be regularly updated and shall be reprinted annually.  The
annual publication shall include all interests registered since
the previous edition and all continuing interests unless their
termination has been notified to the Registrar.</UL></UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a6"><B>Registration and
Declaration of Relevant Interests</B>
<P>
<UL>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House
<B>must</B>:
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>register</B> in
the Register of Lords' Interests all <I>relevant</I> interests,
in order to make clear what are the interests that might reasonably
be thought to influence their actions;
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>declare </B>when speaking in the House,
or communicating with ministers, government departments or executive
agencies, any interest which is a relevant interest in the context
of the debate or the matter under discussion. This is necessary
in order that their audience may form a balanced judgment of their
arguments. In cases where Members of the House vote in a division
where they have a relevant interest that they have not been able
to declare, they should register that interest within 24 hours
of the division.</UL></UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a7"><B>What is a relevant
interest?</B>
<P>
<UL>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of relevant
interest is whether the interest might reasonably be thought by
the public to affect the way in which a Member of the House of
Lords discharges his or her parliamentary duties.<BR>

<P>
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of relevant interest is therefore
not whether a Member's actions in Parliament <I>will be </I>influenced
by the interest, but whether the public might reasonably think
that this might be the case.<BR>

<P>
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Relevant interests include both financial
and non-financial interests.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a8"><B>Relevant financial
interests</B>
<P>
<UL>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following financial
interests are always relevant and therefore <B>must be registered</B>:
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;any consultancy agreement
under which Members of the House provide parliamentary advice
or services. A copy of any such agreement, and the remuneration
received by Members for advice in relation to parliamentary matters,
must be deposited with the Registrar of Lords' Interests, so that
details are available for public inspection.
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;employment or any other financial interest
in businesses involved in parliamentary lobbying on behalf of
clients, including public relations and law firms but Members
of the House involved with organisations that offer commercial
lobbying services are not obliged to refrain from participating
in parliamentary business in connection with <I>all</I> clients
of that organisation but only their personal clients;
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;any remunerated service which Members of
the House provide by virtue of their position as Members of Parliament,
and the clients of any such service;
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;employment as a non-parliamentary consultant;
<P>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;remunerated directorships;
<P>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;regular remunerated employment (excluding
occasional income from speeches, lecturing, broadcasting and journalism);
<P>
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;shareholdings amounting to a controlling
interest;
<P>
(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;provision by an outside body of secretarial
and research assistance;
<P>
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;visits with costs paid in the United Kingdom
and overseas, made as a Member of Parliament, except any visits
paid for from public funds.</UL>

<P>
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;The list in paragraph 12 above is not exhaustive.
For example, <B>relevant financial interests may also include</B>
(depending on their significance):
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;shareholdings not
amounting to a controlling interest;
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;landholdings (excluding Members' homes);
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;the financial interests of a spouse or relative
or friend;
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;hospitality or gifts given to a Member which
could reasonably be regarded as an incentive to support a particular
cause or interest.</UL>

<P>
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for remuneration received by Members
for advice in relation to parliamentary matters, Members of the
House are not required to disclose how much they earn from the
financial interests set out in paragraphs 12 and 13, but they
may do so if they wish.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a9"><B>Relevant non-financial
interests</B>
<P>
<UL>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following non-financial
interests are always relevant and therefore <B>must be registered:</B>
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;membership of public
bodies such as hospital trusts, the governing bodies of universities,
colleges and schools, and local authorities;
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;trusteeships of museums, galleries or similar
bodies;
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;acting as an office-holder or trustee in
pressure groups or trade unions;
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;acting as an office-holder or trustee in
voluntary or not-for-profit organisations.</UL>

<P>
16.&nbsp;&nbsp;The list in paragraph 15 above is not exhaustive.
For example, <B>relevant non-financial interests may also include</B>
(depending on their significance):
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;other trusteeships;
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;unpaid membership of voluntary organisations.</UL>

<P>
17.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are not obliged to <I>register</I>
membership of Churches, religious bodies and quasi-religious organisations.
But it may be necessary to <I>declare</I> such interests (see
paragraph 8).</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a10"><B>Advice</B>
<P>
<UL>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation of
the register shall be overseen by a Sub-Committee of the Committee
for Privileges on Lords' Interests and the Registrar shall consult
the Sub-Committee when necessary. The Registrar is available to
advise Members of the House. A Member who acts on the advice of
the Registrar in determining what is a relevant interest satisfies
fully the requirements of the Code of Conduct.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a11"><B>Enforcement of the
Code of Conduct</B>
<P>
<UL>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations of non-compliance
with this Code are dealt with as follows:
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any allegation should
normally be raised first with the Member complained against. However,
there may be circumstances when it is more appropriate to raise
the matter with a party Leader or Chief Whip, or the Convenor
of the Cross Bench Peers.
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complainant chooses to pursue the
matter, he or she should refer the allegation in private directly
to the Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests, through its chairman.
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee will then examine the allegation
and may decide to investigate it further or to dismiss it.
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the investigation and adjudication of
complaints against them, Members of the House have the right to
safeguards as rigorous as those applied in the courts and professional
disciplinary bodies.
<P>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;If after investigation the Sub-Committee
finds the allegation proved, the Member complained against has
a right of appeal to the Committee for Privileges.
<P>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusions of the Sub-Committee and
of the Committee for Privileges are reported to the House.</UL>

<P>
20.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 7 shall have effect forthwith;
the remainder of this Code shall have effect from 31st March 2002;
and the resolution of the House of 7th November 1995 on the practice
of the House in relation to Lords' interests shall cease to have
effect on the same date.</UL>

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="a12"><B>Application of the Code
<BR>
Guidance by the Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In all categories Members should indicate the
nature of a body's business where it is not clear from the name:
&quot;BP (oil and energy)&quot; but &quot;Multiple Sclerosis Society&quot;
requires no explanation.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="a13"><B>Financial interests
which are always relevant and must be registered: paragraph 12
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>Consultancy Agreements: paragraph 12(a)</I>
<P>
<UL>It is no longer necessary
for Members with interests in this section to refrain from all
parliamentary activity in relation to that interest. Members should,
however, be especially careful not to act in a manner contrary
to paragraph 4(c) and (d) of the Code. Members must register the
amount earned in respect of any interest in this section (paragraph
14).</UL>

<P>
<I>Parliamentary lobbying: paragraph 12 (b)</I>
<P>
<UL>This section includes public
relations firms and law firms. Members with an interest in this
section should provide the Registrar with a list of those clients
for whom he or she acts personally. A short description of the
nature of the client's business should be included in the list
except in cases where it is clear. Members must register the amount
earned in respect of any interest in this section (paragraph 14).</UL>

<P>
<I>Remunerated Services: paragraph 12(c)</I>
<P>
<UL>Only those services arising
directly from membership of the House should be registered. An
interest arising from a Member's profession, training or particular
expertise should not be registered. Occasional income from speeches,
lecturing, broadcasting and journalism should not be included.
Members must register the amount earned in respect of any interest
in this section (paragraph 14).</UL>

<P>
<I>Non-parliamentary consultant: paragraph 12(d)</I>
<P>
<UL>This section covers all consultancy
arrangements not registered under paragraph 12(a) of the Code.
Copies of these agreements do not need to be deposited with the
Registrar, nor is it necessary to register the amount earned.</UL>

<P>
<I>Remunerated directorships: paragraph 12(e)</I>
<P>
<UL>It is not necessary to disclose
the amounts earned from such directorships. Where not clear, the
nature of the company's business should be indicated.</UL>

<P>
<I>Regular remunerated employment: paragraph 12(f)</I>
<P>
<UL>Where it is not clear from
the entry, Members should indicate the nature of the remunerated
employment. It is not necessary to register the amount earned.</UL>

<P>
<I>Shareholdings: paragraph 12(g)</I>
<P>
<UL>This section applies to shareholdings
in any public or private company. Members entering shareholdings
in this section should indicate the nature of the company's business
where it is not clear.</UL>

<P>
<I>Secretarial research and assistance: paragraph
12(h)</I>
<P>
<UL>An entry in this section
should refer only to such provision of assistance which is of
direct financial benefit to the Member. If assistance is provided
for the purpose of, for example, charity work and there is no
direct financial benefit to the Member, the assistance should
not be registered.</UL>

<P>
<I>Visits: paragraph 12(i)</I>
<P>
<UL>Members may wish to indicate
whether a spouse or partner accompanied them on the visit if their
costs were also so paid. Any visit should be registered within
one month of being undertaken. An entry made in this section will
remain on the Register for a period of three years from the date
on which the visit was made. Visits undertaken as a public duty
should not be registered.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a14"><B>Financial interests
which may be relevant for registration: paragraph 13<BR>
</B>
<P>
NB Registrations relating to this paragraph should
be restricted to those interests which might reasonably be thought
by the public to affect in general the way in which Members of
the House discharge their parliamentary duties. A Member may have
additional interests, relevant in particular circumstances, which
will then require declaration in the context of those circumstances
(for example, a debate).<BR>

<P>
<I>Shareholdings not amounting to a controlling interest:
paragraph 13(a)</I>
<P>
<UL>This section only applies
to shareholdings not registered under paragraph 12(g) of the Code
and which constitute 5% or more of the issued share capital of
the company or body or which hold a nominal value of over &#163;50,000.
Members entering shareholdings in this section should indicate
the nature of a company's business where it is not clear.</UL>

<P>
<I>Landholdings: paragraph 13(b)</I>
<P>
<UL>Entries in this section should
include foreign as well as domestic landholdings. The decision
as to what to register in this section must be one for the Member
of the House and will depend on the significance of the landholding.
Second homes need not be registered unless regularly let at commercial
rents. The nature of the holding and its general location should
be entered, but it is not necessary to include the acreage. The
expression &quot;including residential property&quot; is to be
taken as indicating that there are cottages etc. on the land which
may be let. For example &quot;Farmland in Herefordshire, including
residential properties&quot;.</UL>

<P>
<I>Interests of spouse or relative or friend: paragraph
13(c)</I>
<P>
<UL>This section is not intended
necessarily to include the interest of a spouse etc. which would
have to be registered were that person a Member of the House.
The financial interest of a person other than a Member of the
House will only in very rare circumstances be suitable for inclusion
in the Register, even in cases where a declaration on the floor
of the House would be desirable. An entry in the Register might
be made in a case where an interest was so significant, and held
by a person whose relationship to the Member was so close, that
its existence might reasonably be thought to have a bearing on
his or her action. The advice of the Registrar should be sought
in all such cases.</UL>

<P>
<I>Hospitality or gifts: paragraph 13(d)</I>
<P>
<UL>This section applies only
to gifts or acts of hospitality which might reasonably be thought
to have been given in order to influence a Member's actions. Normally
gifts or hospitality of a value less than &#163;1,000 are unlikely
to be considered significant for the purposes of the Register.
Members may however wish to make a declaration in respect of a
gift or act of hospitality of a lesser value in the context of
a particular debate. Gifts and the acceptance of hospitality should
be registered within one month of receipt and entries will remain
on the Register for a period of 3 years thereafter.</UL>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="a15"><B>Non-financial interests
which are always relevant and must be registered: paragraph 15
<BR>
</B>
<P>
NB Paragraph 17 of the Code states that Members of
the House are not obliged to register membership of Churches,
religious bodies or quasi-religious organisations.<BR>

<P>
<I>Office-holder in voluntary organisations: paragraph
15(d)</I>
<P>
<UL>The post of Patron is not
to be considered an office-holding for the purposes of this section.</UL>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="a16"><B>Non-financial interests
which may be relevant for registration: paragraph 16<BR>
</B>
<P>
NB Registrations relating to this paragraph should
be restricted to those interests which might reasonably be thought
by the public to affect in general the way in which lords discharge
their parliamentary duties. A lord may have additional interests,
relevant in particular circumstances, which will then require
declaration in the context of those circumstances (for example,
a debate).<BR>

<P>
<I>Other trusteeships: paragraph 16(a)</I>
<P>
<UL>The post of Patron is not
to be considered a relevant interest for the purposes of this
section.</UL>

<P>
