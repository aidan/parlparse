<FONT size=+1><B>CODE OF CONDUCT
</B></FONT><BR><BR>

<P>
<CENTER>(agreed to by Resolution of the House of
Lords of 2nd July 2001<BR>
and amended by resolution of the House of 24th July 2001)<BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="a1"><B>Purpose of the Code</B>
<P>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Code of Conduct is: 
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;to provide guidance for
Members of the House of Lords on the standards of conduct expected
of them in the discharge of their parliamentary and public duties;
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;to provide the openness and accountability necessary
to reinforce public confidence in the way in which Members of
the House of Lords perform their parliamentary and public duties.
</UL>

<P>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Code applies to all Members of the House of
Lords who have not taken leave of absence. <BR>
<P>
<A NAME="a2"><B>Public duty</B> 
<P>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of their oath, or affirmation, of allegiance,
Members of the House have a duty to be faithful and bear true
allegiance to Her Majesty The Queen, Her heirs and successors,
according to law. <BR>
<P>
<A NAME="a3"><B>Personal conduct</B> 
<P>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House: 
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;must comply with the Code
of Conduct; 
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;should act always on their personal honour; 
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;must never accept any financial inducement as an
incentive or reward for exercising parliamentary influence; 
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;must not vote on any bill or motion, or ask any
question in the House or a committee, or promote any matter, in
return for payment or any other material benefit (the &quot;no
paid advocacy&quot; rule). </UL>

<P>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House should observe the seven general
principles of conduct identified by the Committee on Standards
in Public Life. The seven principles are: 
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selflessness</I>: Holders
of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the
public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial
or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their
friends. 
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Integrity</I>: Holders of public office should
not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to
outside individuals or organisations that might influence them
in the performance of their official duties. 
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Objectivity</I>: In carrying out public business,
including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending
individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office
should make choices on merit. 
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Accountability</I>: Holders of public office
are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public
and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate
to their office.
<P>
<I>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>
<P>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Openness</I>: Holders of public office should
be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions that
they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict
information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.
<P>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Honesty</I>: Holders of public office have a
duty to declare any private interests relating to their public
duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a
way that protects the public interest. 
<P>
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Leadership</I>: Holders of public office should
promote and support these principles by leadership and example.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a4"><B>Primacy of the public interest</B>
<P>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conduct of their parliamentary duties, Members
of the House shall resolve any conflict between their personal
interest and the public interest in favour of the public interest.
<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="a5"><B>Register of Interests</B>
<P>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be established a register of Lords'
interests referred to in this Code. The register shall be maintained
under the authority of the Clerk of the Parliaments by a Registrar
appointed by him.<BR>
<P>
<UL>A Member of the House must register relevant
interests before 31st March 2002 and thereafter within one month
of acquiring them.<BR>
<P>
The register shall be available for public inspection in accordance
with arrangements  made by the Registrar.  The register shall
be regularly updated and shall be reprinted annually.  The annual
publication shall include all interests registered since the previous
edition and all continuing interests unless their termination
has been notified to the Registrar.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a6"><B>Registration and Declaration
of Relevant Interests </B>
<P>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House <B>must</B>: 
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>register</B> in the
Register of Lords' Interests all <I>relevant</I> interests, in
order to make clear what are the interests that might reasonably
be thought to influence their actions; 
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>declare </B>when speaking in the House, or communicating
with ministers, government departments or executive agencies,
any interest which is a relevant interest in the context of the
debate or the matter under discussion. This is necessary in order
that their audience may form a balanced judgment of their arguments.
In cases where Members of the House vote in a division where they
have a relevant interest that they have not been able to declare,
they should register that interest within 24 hours of the division.</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="a7"><B>What is a relevant interest?</B>
<P>
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of relevant interest is whether the interest
might reasonably be thought by the public to affect the way in
which a Member of the House of Lords discharges his or her parliamentary
duties.
<P>
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of relevant interest is therefore not
whether a Member's actions in Parliament <I>will be </I>influenced
by the interest, but whether the public might reasonably think
that this might be the case.
<P>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P>
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Relevant interests include both financial and non-financial
interests. <BR>
<P>
<A NAME="a8"><B>Relevant financial interests</B>
<P>
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following financial interests are always relevant
and therefore <B>must be registered</B>: 
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;any consultancy agreement
under which Members of the House provide parliamentary advice
or services. A copy of any such agreement, and the remuneration
received by Members for advice in relation to parliamentary matters,
must be deposited with the Registrar of Lords' Interests, so that
details are available for public inspection.
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;employment or any other financial interest in businesses
involved in parliamentary lobbying on behalf of clients, including
public relations and law firms but Members of the House involved
with organisations that offer commercial lobbying services are
not obliged to refrain from participating in parliamentary business
in connection with <I>all</I> clients of that organisation but
only their personal clients; 
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;any remunerated service which Members of the House
provide by virtue of their position as members of Parliament,
and the clients of any such service; 
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;employment as a non-parliamentary consultant; 
<P>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;remunerated directorships; 
<P>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;regular remunerated employment (excluding occasional
income from speeches, lecturing, broadcasting and journalism);
<P>
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;shareholdings amounting to a controlling interest;
<P>
(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;provision by an outside body of secretarial and
research assistance; 
<P>
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;visits with costs paid in the United Kingdom and
overseas, made as a member of Parliament, except any visits paid
for from public funds.</UL>

<P>
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;The list in paragraph 12 above is not exhaustive.
For example, <B>relevant financial interests may also include</B>
(depending on their significance): 
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;shareholdings not amounting
to a controlling interest; 
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;landholdings (excluding Members' homes); 
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;the financial interests of a spouse or relative
or friend; 
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;hospitality or gifts given to a Member which could
reasonably be regarded as an incentive to support a particular
cause or interest. </UL>

<P>
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for remuneration received by Members for
advice in relation to parliamentary matters, Members of the House
are not required to disclose how much they earn from the financial
interests set out in paragraphs 12 and 13, but they may do so
if they wish.<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="a9"><B>Relevant non-financial
interests</B> 
<P>
15.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following non-financial interests are always
relevant and therefore <B>must be registered:</B> 
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;membership of public bodies
such as hospital trusts, the governing bodies of universities,
colleges and schools, and local authorities; 
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;trusteeships of museums, galleries or similar bodies;
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;acting as an office-holder or trustee in pressure
groups or trade unions; 
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;acting as an office-holder or trustee in voluntary
or not-for-profit organisations.</UL>
<P>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P>
16.&nbsp;&nbsp;The list in paragraph 15 above is not exhaustive.
For example, <B>relevant non-financial interests may also include</B>
(depending on their significance): 
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;other trusteeships; 
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;unpaid membership of voluntary organisations.</UL>

<P>
17.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are not obliged to <I>register</I>
membership of Churches, religious bodies and quasi-religious organisations.
But it may be necessary to <I>declare</I> such interests (see
paragraph 8).<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="a10"><B>Advice</B> 
<P>
18.&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation of the register shall be overseen
by a Sub-Committee of the Committee for Privileges on Lords' Interests
and the Registrar shall consult the Sub-Committee when necessary.
The Registrar is available to advise Members of the House. A Member
who acts on the advice of the Registrar in determining what is
a relevant interest satisfies fully the requirements of the Code
of Conduct.<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="a11"><B>Enforcement of the Code
of Conduct</B> 
<P>
19.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations of non-compliance with this Code are
dealt with as follows: 
<P>
<UL>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any allegation should normally
be raised first with the Member complained against. However, there
may be circumstances when it is more appropriate to raise the
matter with a party Leader or Chief Whip, or the Convenor of the
Cross Bench Peers.
<P>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complainant chooses to pursue the matter,
he or she should refer the allegation in private directly to the
Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests, through its chairman.
<P>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee will then examine the allegation
and may decide to investigate it further or to dismiss it.
<P>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the investigation and adjudication of complaints
against them, Members of the House have the right to safeguards
as rigorous as those applied in the courts and professional disciplinary
bodies.
<P>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;If after investigation the Sub-Committee finds
the allegation proved, the Member complained against has a right
of appeal to the Committee for Privileges.
<P>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusions of the Sub-Committee and of the
Committee for Privileges are reported to the House.</UL>

<P>
20.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 7 shall have effect forthwith; the remainder
of this Code shall have effect from 31st March 2002; and the resolution
of the House of 7th November 1995 on the practice of the House
in relation to Lords' interests shall cease to have effect on
the same date.<BR>
