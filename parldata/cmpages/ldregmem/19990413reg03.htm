<FONT size=+1><B> RESOLUTIONS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS
</B></FONT><BR><BR>

<P>
<CENTER>Die Martis 7&#186; Novembris 1995<BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Procedure of the House</B>&#151;Resolved,
That the practice of the House in relation to Lords' interests
should be governed by the following principles:
<P>
<UL>(1) <B>Lords should act always on their
personal honour</B>; and
<P>
(2) <B>Lords should never accept any financial inducement as an
incentive or reward for exercising Parliamentary influence</B>.</UL>

<P>
Thus Lords who accept payment or other incentive or reward for
providing Parliamentary advice or services, or who have any financial
interest in a business involved in Parliamentary lobbying on behalf
of clients, should not speak, vote, lobby or otherwise take advantage
of their position as members of the House on behalf of their clients.
This restriction does not extend to matters relating to Lords'
outside employment or directorships, where the interest does not
arise from membership of the House. Lords should, however, be
especially cautious in deciding whether to speak or vote in relation
to interests that are direct, pecuniary and shared by few others.
<BR>
<P>
In relation to private bills, Lords should not speak or vote on
bills in which they have a direct pecuniary interest.<BR>
<P>
The above guidance cannot cover all eventualities, and therefore
the decision ultimately rests with Lords themselves whether it
is proper to take part in a debate or a vote in which they have
a personal interest.<BR>
<P>
Lords who have a direct financial interest in a subject on which
they speak should declare it, making clear that it is a financial
interest. They should also declare any non-financial interest
of which their audience should be aware in order to form a balanced
judgment of their arguments. Such interests may be indirect or
non-pecuniary, for example the interest of a relation or friend,
hospitality or gifts received, trusteeship, or unpaid membership
of an interested organization, and they may include past and future
interests. This rule also applies where Lords are using their
influence as a member of the House in communication with a Minister,
Government Department, local authority or other public body outside
the House.<BR>
<P>
On certain occasions such as Starred Questions and the various
stages of a bill following Second Reading, it may be for the convenience
of the House that Lords should not take up time by repeating declarations
of interest but Lords should make a declaration whenever they
are in doubt. The nature of the interest should be made clear
notwithstanding that it may be well known to most other Lords
present in the Chamber.<BR>
<P>
Similar principles apply to proceedings in committees off the
floor of the House.<BR>
<P>
The Clerk of the Parliaments is available to advise on the interpretation
of this guidance in a case of uncertainty.<BR>
<P>
<B>Registration of Interests</B>&#151;Resolved, That there shall
be established a register of:
<P>
<UL>(1) consultancies, or any similar arrangements,
whereby members of the House accept payment or other incentive
or reward for providing Parliamentary advice or services;
<P>
(2) any financial interests of members of the House in businesses
involved in Parliamentary lobbying on behalf of clients; and
<P>
(3) any other particulars which members of the House wish to register
relating to matters which they consider may affect the public
perception of the way in which they discharge their Parliamentary
duties.</UL>

<P>
The register shall be maintained under the authority of the Clerk
of the Parliaments by a Registrar appointed by him.<BR>
<P>
Existing arrangements falling within categories (1) and (2) above
shall be registered within one month of the register being established.
Subsequent arrangements falling within those categories shall
be registered within one month of their being made.<BR>
<P>
The register shall be available for public inspection in accordance
with arrangements to be made by the Registrar.  The register shall
also be published annually. The annual edition shall include all
arrangements registered since the previous edition; and all continuing
arrangements unless their termination has been notified to the
Registrar.<BR>
<P>
The operation of the register shall be overseen by the Committee
for Privileges.<BR>
<P>
The Committee for Privileges shall investigate, and report to
the House on, any allegation of failure to register interests
within categories (1) and (2); provided that the Committee shall
first satisfy itself that an allegation has sufficient substance
to warrant investigation.<BR>
<P>
The Committee may remit any or all of the matters covered by this
order to a sub-committee.<BR>
<P>
In considering any allegation of failure to register interests,
the Committee and any sub-committee shall not sit unless three
Lords of Appeal be present.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
