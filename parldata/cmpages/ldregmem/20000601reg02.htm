<FONT size=+1><B>FOREWORD BY THE CLERK OF THE PARLIAMENTS

</B></FONT><BR><BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Register of Lords' Interests was established
by the Resolutions of the House of 7th November 1995 and first
published in February 1996. The Resolutions, which are reprinted
below, set out the categories under which Lords are required or
invited to register interests and the rules which apply to the
various categories. The Resolutions also clarify the general principles
by which Lords should be guided when speaking, voting and acting
in the House in respect of matters in which they may have an interest.
<BR>

<P>
The register is maintained by the Registrar and is
updated between editions on a weekly basis. An up to date version
may be inspected at the Table of the House and in the Minute Room,
Library and Record Office. The up-dated register is also available
on the Internet at www.parliament.uk.<BR>

<P>

In addition to their obligation to observe the "Ministerial Code: a code of conduct and guidance on procedures for Ministers", issued by the Cabinet Office, the Government have decided that it is also appropriate for Ministers to make separate entries in the register. No Minister has an entry in category 1 or 2, but several have chosen to make entries in category 3. In addition to these declarations, it has been agreed that Ministers may write to the Registrar to disclose any other information which they consider to be relevant but which the Registrar does not judge to be of sufficient significance for inclusion in the register. Any such letters may be inspected by peers or members of the public upon application to the Registrar.


<BR>
<P>
As the Clerks and I are frequently asked for guidance
on certain aspects of registration, in particular what interests
might be appropriate for registration in the discretionary category,
it may be helpful to members of the House to indicate some of
the guidelines which have developed in response to the most frequent
queries:<BR>

<P>
<UL><U>Former interests</U>:
it is recommended that interests which are no longer extant should
not be included in the register.<BR>

<P>
<U>Dates on which interests commence</U>:
it is recommended that it is not necessary to include the date
on which an interest began (for instance, appointment to a board
of directors). When, however, a Lord is registering an interest
which is expected to terminate within a year of the publication
of the register it is helpful to indicate the date of termination.
<BR>

<P>
<U>Shareholdings</U>: it is recommended
that shareholdings should not be included in the register. A Lord
may wish, however, to indicate that he has a controlling interest
in a company.<BR>

<P>
<U>Visits</U>: members of the
House frequently undertake sponsored visits so as to improve their
knowledge of matters which are of interest to them in connection
with their parliamentary duties. It is recommended that it is
not necessary to declare such visits to the Registrar although
Lords will of course wish to make an appropriate declaration when
speaking in the House.</UL>

<P>
It must be emphasised that in all these matters the
guidelines set out above are no more than suggestions. In the
end it must be for the judgment of each individual Lord as to
what he considers &quot;may affect the public perception of the
way in which [he discharges his] parliamentary duties&quot;. Similarly,
it should be remembered that declarations in category 3 are entirely
voluntary and are made at the discretion of individual members
of the House. The absence of a declaration does not indicate the
absence of any outside interest. For the same reason, the absence
of an entry for a member with well-known interests is not a &quot;failure
to declare&quot;, but a legitimate choice exercised by that member.
<BR>
