<P>
<CENTER><B>BY THE CLERK OF THE PARLIAMENTS<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Code of Conduct, adopted by the House on 2nd
July 2001, came into force on 1st April 2002. The Code (the text
of which is printed below) makes more extensive provision for
the registration of interests than had been previously required.
<BR>

<P>
The Code requires all Members of the House in receipt of a Writ
of Summons, who are not on Leave of Absence, to register all relevant
interests. The test of relevance is whether the interest might
reasonably be thought by the public to affect the way in which
a Member discharges his or her parliamentary duties.  Relevant
interests include both financial and non-financial interests.
 Interests which are deemed <U>always</U> to be relevant and which
must be declared are set out in paragraphs 12 (financial) and
15 (non-financial) of the Code of Conduct; interests which <U>may</U><B>
</B>be relevant, depending on their significance, are set out
in paragraphs 13 and 16.<BR>
<P>
   The Code of Conduct maintains the &quot;no paid advocacy&quot;
rule.  Thus members &quot;must not vote on any bill or motion,
or ask any question in the House or a committee, or promote any
matter, in return for payment or any other material benefit&quot;
(paragraph 4(d) of the Code). This restriction does not extend
to matters relating to Members' outside employment or directorships,
where the interest does not arise from membership of the House.
Members should, however, be especially cautious in deciding whether
to speak or vote in relation to interests that are direct, pecuniary
and shared by few others.
<P>
It is recommended that registrations relating to
paragraphs 13 and 16 of the Code (&quot;other relevant interests&quot;)
be restricted to those interests which might reasonably be thought
by the public to affect <U>in general</U> the way in which Members
discharge their parliamentary duties. A Member may have additional
interests, relevant in particular circumstances, which will then
require declaration in the context of those circumstances (for
example, a debate).
<P>
In the section covering &quot;shareholdings not amounting
to a controlling interest&quot; the Code requires that only <U>significant</U>
holdings should be registered.   For the purposes of this section
the Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests recommends that, while it
is for each Member to determine what is significant in this context,
ownership of 5% or more of a concern might reasonably be considered
significant.
<P>
Under paragraph 13(c) (the financial interests of
spouse or relative or friend) it is unlikely that an interest
not held by Members of the House themselves will be appropriate
for registration although it may, of course, be necessary to declare
such an interest when speaking in the House. The advice of the
Registrar should be sought whenever there is doubt as to whether
a interest is relevant for the purposes of the register, and in
all cases of difficulty the Registrar will consult the Sub-Committee.
 Members of the House should accept its decision as if it were
that of the House.<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House must register all relevant interests
within one month of acquiring them.  Visits made and gifts received
before 1st March 2002 need not be registered.   Interests which
have lapsed since 31st March when the new Code of Conduct came
into force have not been entered.<BR>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee recommends that &quot;patron&quot;
is not a post which needs to be registered; some members have
nevertheless chosen to include certain patronships in their entries.
<BR>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For further guidance, Members may wish to consult
paragraphs 4.60-4.66 of the <I>Companion to the Standing Orders
and Guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords</I>; the debates
and resolutions of the House of 1st and 7th November 1995 and
2nd and 24th July 2001; and take the advice of the Registrar and
other clerks.<BR>

<P>
