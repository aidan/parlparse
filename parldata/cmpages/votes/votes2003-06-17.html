<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'agrees that the OFT report on the "Control of Entry Regulations and Retail Pharmacy Services in the UK" provides a useful analysis of the market impact of the current control of entry regulations on consumers and competition and highlights the need for the present regime governing pharmacies to be updated; favours change to open up the market and improve quality and access without diminishing the crucial role that community pharmacies play, especially in poorer areas; and supports the need for a balanced package of measures which plays to the strengths of community pharmacies and enhances the role of pharmacists in the modern NHS', instead thereof.-(<i>Ms Secretary Hewitt</i>.)</ul></p>
