<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, at the end, to add the words 'but humbly regret the absence of a Bill to ensure the impartiality of the Civil Service; and further regret the centralising nature of measures on regional and local government, housing and planning; note the absence of measures to end insecurity in old age with no Bill to abolish the annuity rule or tackle the crisis in the pension system; further regret that the Gracious Speech contains no measures to deliver a health service in which no patient is left waiting, but seeks unfairly to charge local authorities for bed-blocking in hospitals, and to grant foundation status only to a small number of hospitals; are concerned at the failure to reduce the burden of regulation on business and to tackle the crisis in the rural economy; welcome the Bill to create a Railway Accident Investigation Branch, along lines recommended by Her Majesty's Official Opposition, but condemn the failure to address the worsening transport crisis or to improve conditions for passengers, motorists and businesses; and further regret the failure to give more control over schools to parents and governors, to restore teacher morale, and to improve confidence in the examination system and universities.'.-(<i>David Davis.</i>)</ul></p>
