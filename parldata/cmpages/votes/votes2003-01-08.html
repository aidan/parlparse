<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition Day [1st allotted day],-It being an allotted day at the disposal of the Leader of the Opposition in pursuance of Standing Order No. 14 (Arrangement of public business), the House proceeded to consider Opposition business.</p>


<p><ul>Foundation Hospitals,-A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That this House welcomes the principle of Foundation Hospitals as a means of improving and enhancing patient care and giving hospitals the opportunity to operate free from political and ministerial interference; regrets the timidity of the Government, which is restricting applications for Foundation status solely to those hospitals enjoying 3-star status; fears that this restriction will create a two-tier health service, to the detriment of patients and staff, and therefore urges the Government to allow all hospitals to bid for Foundation status; calls for clarification of contradictions between ministerial statements and guidance contained in the Department of Health's 'A Guide to NHS Foundation Trusts, December 2002' about how Foundation Hospitals are intended to operate; and further calls on the Government to resolve widely publicised ministerial differences, which are likely to deter hospitals from seeking Foundation status-(<i>Dr Liam Fox</i>);</ul></p>


<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'welcomes the principle of NHS Foundation Trusts as part of the Government's wider programme to improve services for NHS patients; believes that NHS Foundation Trusts must be part of the National Health Service providing care to NHS patients according to NHS principles and subject to NHS standards and inspection; further believes that there should be no arbitrary cap on the numbers of NHS Foundation Trusts and that all NHS hospitals should get the help, support or intervention they need to improve; recognises that extra resources for the health service are delivering improved services for NHS patients and have to be matched with reforms so that standards in the NHS are national but control is local; supports the Government's efforts to devolve power to frontline services and to strengthen accountability to local communities; and rejects any proposal to introduce top-up vouchers for private treatment, tax subsidies for private medical insurance or cuts in public spending of 20 per cent. in view of the inevitable impact that such policies would have on NHS patients including those treated in NHS Foundation Trusts', instead thereof.-(<i>Mr Secretary Milburn</i>.)</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being proposed, That the original words stand part of the Question.</ul></p>


<p><ul>Mr David Maclean rose in his place and claimed to move, That the Question be now put.</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the Question be now put:-It was agreed to.</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being accordingly put;</ul></p>


<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>

<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Mr Jim Murphy, Charlotte Atkins: 381.</ul></ul></p>

<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>
