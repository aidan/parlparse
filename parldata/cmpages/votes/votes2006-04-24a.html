<p><ul>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 5130/06 and ADD 1, Draft Directive on the promotion of clean road vehicles; and endorses the Government's approach in investigating what the costs and impacts of the proposal on the UK would be and in seeking to so amend the proposal that, if implemented, it would result in the best possible balance between environmental and other benefits, and financial and other burdens on both the public and private sectors.</ul></p>

<p><ul>And a Motion being made, and the Question being proposed, That the Bill be now read a second time;</ul></p>
<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, to leave out from the word 'That' to the end of the Question and add the words 'this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Finance (No. 2) Bill because the provisions contained in its two volumes and 475 pages increase complexity and instability in the tax system, discouraging business investment and damaging productivity and penalise hard-working prudent families seeking to provide responsibly for their future; and because the provisions undermine attempts to improve IT skills by abolishing the UK's Home Computer Initiative, damage enterprise by abolishing the 0% rate of corporation tax, leave the UK with an ever-rising tax burden that damages its competitiveness and fail to prepare the country for the challenges and opportunities of the globalised world economy', instead thereof.&#151;(<i>Mrs Theresa Villiers</i>.)</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the Amendment be made;</ul></p>
<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>

<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>

<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Michael Fabricant, Angela Watkinson: 199.</ul></ul></p>
