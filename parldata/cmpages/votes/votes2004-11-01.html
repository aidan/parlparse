Minutes of Proceedings of the Committee to lie upon the Table.
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambling Bill,&#151;The Order of the day being read, for the Second Reading of the Gambling Bill;</p>
And a Motion being made, and the Question being proposed, That the Bill be now read a second time;
An Amendment was proposed to the Question, to leave out from the word 'That' to the end of the Question and add the words 'this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Gambling Bill since it fails to take account of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Draft Bill with regard to regional casinos; consequently fails to impose adequate controls on the number and location of such casinos and on the number and type of gambling machines contained; does not give local authorities sufficient powers to reject specific casino applications; opens the door to an influx of overseas owned super casinos in our towns and cities, close to where people live; and is likely to promote gambling and lead to further diversion of funds from the National Lottery, severe disadvantage to the existing UK gaming industry and a significant increase in problem gambling', instead thereof.&#151;(<i>Mr John Whittingdale</i>.)
And the Question being put, That the Amendment be made;
The House divided.
