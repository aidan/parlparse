<p><ul>And the Question being proposed;</ul></p>
<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, to leave out from the word 'That' to the end of the Question and add the words 'this House declines to give the Constitutional Reform Bill a second reading because it creates a costly and unnecessary Supreme Court exercising the same functions as the current Law Lords; is based on the false premise that the separation of powers between the judiciary and legislature requires the physical removal of the Law Lords from Parliament; fails to demonstrate how the proposed Supreme Court would exercise its functions with any greater degree of impartiality, independence and integrity than the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords; will deny Parliament the experience and expertise that the Law Lords bring to debates and legislation; and notwithstanding the benefits of a Judicial Appointments Commission, offers no convincing justification for replacing a system that works well.', instead thereof.&#151;(<i>Mr Dominic Grieve</i>.)</ul></p>
