<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition Day [2nd allotted day],&#151;It being an allotted day at the disposal of the Leader of the Opposition in pursuance of Standing Order No. 14 (Arrangement of public business), the House proceeded to consider Opposition business.</p>
<p><ul>Value for Taxpayers' Money,&#151;A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That this House notes that the Government has increased taxes 66 times and has failed to give value for taxpayers' money; is concerned that independent commentators believe that taxes will have to be increased under the Government's spending plans; and calls for a change of direction away from the path of more waste and higher taxes to a path of value for money and lower taxes.&#151;(<i>Mr George Osborne</i>);</ul></p>
<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'believes that economic stability is the foundation for continued investment in public services; welcomes therefore the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest interest rates for 40 years and the longest period of economic growth for 200 years; further welcomes this Government's record investment in public services; believes that it is important to ensure taxpayer value for money and therefore welcomes the fact that the Government is making efficiency savings to release resources into frontline services; further welcomes the fact that Sir Peter Gershon has identified over £20 billion efficiency savings across the public sector and notes that he said that to go further than the efficiencies he identified would put at risk the delivery of frontline public services; and further believes that any proposal to make cuts in public spending would not only damage frontline public services but the economy as a whole.', instead thereof.&#151;(<i>Mr Paul Boateng</i>.)</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the original words stand part of the Question;</ul></p>
<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, Gregory Barker, Mr Peter Atkinson: 147.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Bridget Prentice, Mr Jim Murphy: 358.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul>So the Question was negatived.</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question, That the proposed words be there added, being put forthwith, pursuant to Standing Order No. 31 (Questions on amendments):&#151;It was agreed to.</ul></p>
<p><ul>The Deputy Speaker forthwith declared the Main Question, as amended, to be agreed to.</ul></p>
<p><ul><i>Resolved</i>, That this House believes that economic stability is the foundation for continued investment in public services; welcomes therefore the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest interest rates for 40 years and the longest period of economic growth for 200 years; further welcomes this Government's record investment in public services; believes that it is important to ensure taxpayer value for money and therefore welcomes the fact that the Government is making efficiency savings to release resources into frontline services; further welcomes the fact that Sir Peter Gershon has identified over £20 billion efficiency savings across the public sector and notes that he said that to go further than the efficiencies he identified would put at risk the delivery of frontline public services; and further believes that any proposal to make cuts in public spending would not only damage frontline public services but the economy as a whole.</ul></p>
<p><ul>Needs of farming and rural communities,&#151;A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That this House regrets that self sufficiency in indigenous food and drink products has fallen significantly since 1997; supports the principle in CAP reform of decoupling support from production but believes that the Government has failed to consider the implications for the countryside and food security of its inept implementation of this reform by creating a complex system of entitlements and cross compliance wholly contrary to the objective of simplification whilst failing to reduce the current burden of regulation or to enable farmers to compete with imported food not produced to British standards; laments the fact that there are now more officials in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs than there are dairy farmers in Britain, and that the workforce in agriculture has fallen by 15 per cent; recognises that many landscape features of the English countryside were created by historic farming practices and believes that the promotion of biodiversity and care of the countryside is best achieved by a profitable agricultural industry; and considers that the continued attacks on the countryside through unacceptable levels of development, an obsession with wind farms and the closure of rural services are the actions of a Government with no instinctive understanding of the needs of farming and rural communities&#151;(<i>Mr James Paice</i>);</ul></p>
<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'welcomes the Government's commitment to farming and rural communities set out in the Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food and Rural Strategy 2004; applauds the Government's commitment to invest more than £500 million over three years in sustainable food and farming; commends the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy secured by the Government in June 2003, which will be implemented at the earliest possible opportunity in 2005; congratulates the Government's record on public service delivery in rural areas; further commends the £239 million allocated over six years to 2003-04 through the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant for new and improved rural transport services; further applauds the increase in the resources available for regional development agencies to regenerate the rural economy; further welcomes schemes in place to provide affordable housing in rural areas; praises the efforts to retain the rural post office network; further congratulates the Government's action to protect and enhance the rural environment; and calls upon the Government to continue pursuing a strategy based on long term policies to regenerate British agriculture, improve rural services and revitalise the rural economy as a whole.', instead thereof.&#151;(<i>Alun Michael</i>.)</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question being proposed, That the original words stand part of the Question;</ul></p>
<p><ul>David Maclean rose in his place and claimed to move, That the Question be now put.</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the Question be now put:&#151;It was agreed to.</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question being accordingly put;</ul></p>
<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, Gregory Barker, Mr Peter Atkinson: 189.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Mr Nick Ainger, Mr Vernon Coaker: 322.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul>So the Question was negatived.</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question, That the proposed words be there added, being put forthwith, pursuant to Standing Order No. 31 (Questions on amendments);</ul></p>
<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>

<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Mr Peter Atkinson, Gregory Barker: 182.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul>So the Question was agreed to.</ul></p>
<p><ul>The Deputy Speaker forthwith declared the Main Question, as amended, to be agreed to.</ul></p>
<p><ul><i>Resolved</i>, That this House welcomes the Government's commitment to farming and rural communities set out in the Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food and Rural Strategy 2004; applauds the Government's commitment to invest more than £500 million over three years in sustainable food and farming; commends the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy secured by the Government in June 2003, which will be implemented at the earliest possible opportunity in 2005; congratulates the Government's record on public service delivery in rural areas; further commends the £239 million allocated over six years to 2003-04 through the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant for new and improved rural transport services; further applauds the increase in the resources available for regional development agencies to regenerate the rural economy; further welcomes schemes in place to provide affordable housing in rural areas; praises the efforts to retain the rural post office network; further congratulates the Government's action to protect and enhance the rural environment; and calls upon the Government to continue pursuing a strategy based on long term policies to regenerate British agriculture, improve rural services and revitalise the rural economy as a whole.</ul></p>
