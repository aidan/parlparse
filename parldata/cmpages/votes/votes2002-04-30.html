<p>The House met at Ten o'clock, pursuant to Resolution [24th April].</p>

<p>PRAYERS.</p>

<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Address to Her Majesty (Golden Jubilee),-The Speaker and the House proceeded to Westminster Hall to attend Her Majesty with an Address.</p>


<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker resumed the Chair at half-past Two o'clock, and reported that the House had this day attended Her Majesty in Westminster Hall with an Address, in reply to which Her Majesty had been pleased to make a Most Gracious Speech; and he directed that his own words in presenting the Address and Her Majesty's Speech in reply be entered in the Journal.</p>


<p><ul>The Speaker presented the Address to Her Majesty in the following words:</ul></p>


<p><ul>Your Majesty: we, your faithful Commons, offer our heartfelt congratulations on the completion of fifty years of your reign.  We wish to assure you of our loyal devotion and to express our profound gratitude for the unstinting service which you have given to the Nation and to the people we have the privilege to represent in Parliament.</ul></p>


<p><ul>Your long and distinguished reign has seen extraordinary changes at home and in the wider world.  The United Kingdom of 1952 would be unrecognisable today.  A society where the scars of war had not yet healed has given way to equality of opportunity, to social and geographic mobility and to levels of prosperity and health which that generation could only have dreamed of.  The nature of society too has changed dramatically, as today we celebrate the diversity of race, culture and faith that makes this country a vibrant and exciting place to live.</ul></p>


<p><ul>New democracies have emerged across the world which this Parliament is proud to nourish and support.  The Cold War has given way to new partnerships, new challenges and new opportunities.  The United Kingdom continues to exercise important influence in the counsels of the world and we make a major contribution to securing the peace.  Fifty years ago this Parliament was at the heart of an Empire.  Today we are one of 54 independent members of the Commonwealth, of which you are Head.  Your personal contribution to the development of this unique organisation has been of great significance and millions of people are grateful for it.</ul></p>


<p><ul>During your reign, Madam, this Parliament too has changed.  We have chosen to share our sovereignty with our European partners and to delegate powers to the devolved Parliaments and assemblies of Scotland and Wales as well as Northern Ireland.  The House of Commons today looks rather different from 1952.  We have six times as many women Members and it is also a younger House-nearly half our Members have known no other Monarch.  You have been served by ten Prime Ministers and I have the honour to be the eighth Speaker of your reign.</ul></p>


<p><ul>Amidst this sea of change the monarchy has acted as a beacon of stability and a unifying influence for our people.  But it is not simply the throne that we honour today-it is your personal contribution that we have reason to give thanks for.  By your sense of service and your devotion to duty, by your consistent display of dedication and commitment, by your wisdom and grace, you have demonstrated for all to see the value of a constitutional monarchy in securing the liberties of our citizens and the fundamental unity of this Kingdom and the Commonwealth.  In 1952, in a motion moved by Winston Churchill, the House of Commons expressed their complete conviction that you would throughout your reign work to uphold the liberties and promote the happiness of all your peoples.  That confidence has been amply justified over the last 50 years.</ul></p>


<p><ul>Few monarchs in the history of these islands can match your contribution.  We are supremely grateful to you and to His Royal Highness Prince Philip, whose support for you has been so manifest and whose personal commitment to the Nation has been of such value to us.</ul></p>


<p><ul>In this historic Hall at the heart of the Palace of Westminster, the scene of so much royal, political and parliamentary history, Parliament salutes its Sovereign.  We offer you our respect, our affection and our prayers.</ul></p>


<p><ul>May God save Your Majesty and give you His blessing, both now and for many years to come.</ul></p>


<p><ul>Her Majesty's Most Gracious Reply was as follows:</ul></p>


<p><ul>My Lords and Members of the House of Commons:</ul></p>


<p><ul>You do Prince Philip and me a great honour in inviting us here today.  I am most grateful to have this opportunity to reply to your Loyal Addresses and I thank you both, Lord Chancellor and Mr Speaker, for your generous words.</ul></p>


<p><ul>It is right that the first major event to mark my Golden Jubilee this summer is here in the Palace of Westminster.  I would like to pay tribute to the work you do in this, the Mother of Parliaments-where you, like so many famous predecessors before you, have assembled to confront the issues of the day, to challenge each other and address differences through debate and discussion, and to play your essential part in guiding this Kingdom through the changing times of the past fifty years.</ul></p>


<p><ul>For if a Jubilee becomes a moment to define an age, then for me we must speak of change-its breadth and accelerating pace over these years.  Since 1952 I have witnessed the transformation of the international landscape through which this country must chart its course, the emergence of the Commonwealth, the growth of the European Union, the end of the Cold War, and now the dark threat of international terrorism.  This has been matched by no less rapid developments at home, in the devolved shape of our nation, in the structure of society, in technology and communications, in our work and in the way we live.  Change has become a constant; managing it has become an expanding discipline.  The way we embrace it defines our future.</ul></p>


<p><ul>It seems to me that this country has advantages to exploit in this exciting challenge.  We in these islands have the benefit of a long and proud history.  This not only gives us a trusted framework of stability and continuity to ease the process of change, but it also tells us what is of lasting value.  Only the passage of time can filter out the ephemeral from the enduring.  And what endure are the characteristics that mark our identity as a nation and the timeless values that guide us.  These values find expression in our national institutions-including the Monarchy and Parliament-institutions which in turn must continue to evolve if they are to provide effective beacons of trust and unity to succeeding generations.</ul></p>


<p><ul>I believe that many of the traditional values etched across our history equip us well for this age of change.  We are a moderate, pragmatic people, more comfortable with practice than theory.  With an off-shore, seafaring tradition we are outward-looking and open-minded, well suited by temperament-and language-to our shrinking world.  We are inventive and creative-think of the record of British inventions over the past fifty years or our present thriving arts scene.  We also take pride in our tradition of fairness and tolerance-the consolidation of our richly multicultural and multifaith society, a major development since 1952, is being achieved remarkably peacefully and with much goodwill.</ul></p>




<p><ul>But there is another tradition in this country which gives me confidence for the future.  That is the tradition of service.  The willingness to 'honour one another and seek the common good' transcends social change.  Over these fifty years on visits up and down this country I have seen at first hand and met so many people who are dedicating themselves quietly and selflessly to the service of others.</ul></p>


<p><ul>I would particularly pay tribute to the young men and women of our armed forces who give such professional service to this country, often in the most demanding and dangerous circumstances.  They have my respect and admiration.  I also wish to express my gratitude for the work of those in the public service more widely-here in Westminster or the corridors of Whitehall and town halls, as well as in our hospitals and schools, in the police and emergency services.  But I would especially like to thank those very many people who give their time voluntarily to help others.  I am pleased that the Jubilee is to be marked by the introduction of The Queen's Golden Jubilee Award, a new annual award for voluntary service by groups in the community.  I hope this will give added recognition to those whose generosity of time and energy in the service of others is such a remarkable tradition in our society.</ul></p>


<p><ul>These enduring British traditions and values-moderation, openness, tolerance, service-have stood the test of time, and I am convinced they will stand us in good stead in the future.  I hope that the Golden Jubilee will be an opportunity to recognise these values and to celebrate all we have achieved as a nation since 1952.  For my part, as I travel the length and breadth of these islands over the coming weeks, I would like to thank people everywhere for the loyalty, support, and inspiration you have given me over these fifty unforgettable years.  I would like to express my pride in our past and my confidence in our future.  I would like above all to declare my resolve to continue, with the support of my family, to serve the people of this great nation of ours to the best of my ability through the changing times ahead.</ul></p>
