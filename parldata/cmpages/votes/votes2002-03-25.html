<P>PRAYERS.</FONT></P>

<P>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill [<EM>Lords</EM>],--<EM>Ordered</EM>, That the Explanatory Notes
relating to the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill [<EM>Lords</EM>] be printed [Bill 112-EN].</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Pension Credit Bill [<EM>Lords</EM>],--The Order of the day being read, for the Second Reading
of the State Pension Credit Bill [<EM>Lords</EM>];</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=3><ul>And a Motion being made, and the Question being proposed, That the Bill be now read
a second time;</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, to leave out from the word 'That' to the end of the Question and add the words 'this House declines to give a Second Reading to the State Pension Credit Bill [<EM>Lords</EM>] because it involves a further move towards the mass means-testing of the pensioner population; believes that it will greatly increase the complexity of the pension system both for today's pensioners and for future generations,
will result in many pensioners missing out on their entitlements, and will serve to erode
incentives to save; and believes that the additional expenditure would have been better
directed towards the basic state pension, particularly for older pensioners', instead
thereof.--(<EM>Mr David Willetts</EM>.)</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=3>And the Question being put, That the Amendment be made;</FONT></P>
