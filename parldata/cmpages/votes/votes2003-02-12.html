<p><ul>Government's Record on the Economy and Public Services,-A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That this House acknowledges the serious concern about the current state of the UK economy, including economic imbalances, the failure of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to meet his economic forecasts, the ever higher taxes, the disproportionate fall in the UK stock market, the decline in productivity growth, and the crisis in funded pensions; recognises the harm done to business and the enterprise culture as a result of increases in red tape and business tax since 1997, now estimated to cost up to £15 billion a year; is shocked by the Chancellor of the Exchequer's complacency on these matters; is concerned that the forthcoming rise in National Insurance contributions will have further adverse effects on jobs, incomes and economic confidence; notes that tax revenues have already risen by £36 a week for every man, woman and child since 1997; deplores the fact that, despite substantial increases in taxes and Government expenditure, the lack of real reform means that the promised improvements in public services have not materialized, with a recent rise of 22 per cent. in NHS funding leading to a rise of just 1.6 per cent. in the number of patients treated, with one in four children leaving primary school unable to read, write and count properly, with a crumbling transport system, and with only one crime in every 40 resulting in a conviction; and calls on the Government to end its cycle of tax and spend and fail-(<i>Mr Michael Howard</i>);</ul></p>


<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'notes that as a result of this Government's economic management, even in times of global economic uncertainty when the world economy is experiencing the first simultaneous downturn for nearly thirty years and twenty of the world's biggest economies including the United States, Japan, Asia, much of Latin America and Europe have been or are in recession, the UK economy continues to grow with low levels of inflation and low interest rates; welcomes the 1.5 million extra jobs created since 1997 and resists any attempts to abolish the New Deal and the tax credits that make work pay; further welcomes the cuts in the rates of corporation tax, capital gains tax and small business corporation tax since 1997 and the introduction of the R&D tax credit; and believes that after years of neglect between 1979 and 1997 it is even more important to invest in public services and to support the Government's record extra investment in Britain's health, education and other public services combined with reform to build high quality public services for all and its resistance to any attempt at this time of global uncertainty to cut public spending', instead thereof.-(<i>Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer</i>.)</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being proposed, That the original words stand part of the Question;</ul></p>


<p><ul>David Maclean rose in his place and claimed to move, That the Question be now put.</ul></p>

<p><ul>So the Question was agreed to.</ul></p>


<p><ul>The Deputy Speaker forthwith declared the Main Question, as amended, to be agreed to.</ul></p>


<p><ul><i>Resolved</i>, That notes that as a result of this Government's economic management, even in times of global economic uncertainty when the world economy is experiencing the first simultaneous downturn for nearly thirty years and twenty of the world's biggest economies including the United States, Japan, Asia, much of Latin America and Europe have been or are in recession, the UK economy continues to grow with low levels of inflation and low interest rates; welcomes the 1.5 million extra jobs created since 1997 and resists any attempts to abolish the New Deal and the tax credits that make work pay; further welcomes the cuts in the rates of corporation tax, capital gains tax and small business corporation tax since 1997 and the introduction of the R&D tax credit; and believes that after years of neglect between 1979 and 1997 it is even more important to invest in public services and to support the Government's record extra investment in Britain's health, education and other public services combined with reform to build high quality public services for all and its resistance to any attempt at this time of global uncertainty to cut public spending.</ul></p>

<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 6, to leave out from the word 'Policy' to the end of the Question and add the words 'recognises the need for a substantial recovery in farm incomes from the present low base to a level at which UK farmers are earning sustainable and competitive returns; supports the objective of achieving prosperous rural areas, an enhanced natural environment and provision of high-quality, safe food and high animal welfare standards; welcomes the European Commission's appreciation of the need to reform the Common Agricultural Policy, which absorbs half the EU budget, and recalls Government failures in this regard; further welcomes the proposals to decouple payments from production, and for further market reform; but has deep reservations about the effects of the current proposals on UK agriculture and recognises that the British people are increasingly hostile to a system that penalises both UK taxpayers and farmers; believes that dairy regime reform should provide greater opportunity for the UK dairy sector to add value to their product through producer-based processing; notes that the Commission proposals involve a potentially unfair mechanism for transferring funds towards agri-environmental and rural development measures; and urges the Government to use all the means at its disposal to ensure that these proposals are redrafted in the interests of UK farmers and consumers', instead thereof.-(<i>Mr John Hayes</i>.)</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being proposed, That the Amendment be made;</ul></p>


<p><ul>And it being one and a half hours after the commencement of proceedings on the Motion, the Deputy Speaker put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 16 (Proceedings under an Act or on European Union documents).</ul></p>


<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>

<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>
