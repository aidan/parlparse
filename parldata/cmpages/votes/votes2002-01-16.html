<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Standing Committee A,-Mr Bill O'Brien reported from European Standing Committee A the following Resolution:</p>


<p><ul>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 5771/01, a Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Sixth Environmental Action Programme of the European Community: 'Europe 2010: Our future, Our choice', and a Proposal for a draft Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Community Environmental Action Programme 2001-2010; considers that co-ordinated action at a Community level is the most effective way of addressing the main environmental objectives of the programme; welcomes the strategic approach; agrees with the objectives, particularly the identification of the four priority areas; endorses the emphasis on climate change as an outstanding challenge of the next 10 years and beyond; supports the Government's efforts to ensure that policy is developed on the basis of full analysis of the issues with consideration of the full range of instruments; endorses the Government's position that the programme should be ambitious yet achievable, and that where analysis has not yet been completed detailed targets should be set out in thematic strategies to be developed later; and supports the Government's aim that the programme should give a clear steer on improved and consistent implementation and enforcement.</ul></p>

<p><ul>State of the Railways,-A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That this House notes the failure of the Government to tackle adequately the growing crisis on British railways; and believes that the salary of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions should be reduced by 1.8 per cent. and that payment of a further 22 per cent. be withheld until 31st March 2003-(<i>Mr Don Foster</i>);</ul></p>


<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'believes that the railway infrastructure was badly damaged by decades of underinvestment and a flawed privatisation; recognises that the Government made tough decisions in the first two years of the last Parliament to deliver the economic stability that means it can put record levels of investment into the railways; notes that annual average total investment in rail over the 10 year plan will be £4.3 billion, compared to £1.4 billion for the period 1989/90-1996/97; congratulates the Government on its decisive action over Railtrack, so undoing a failed Conservative privatisation; welcomes the SRA's Strategic Plan that sets out an effective agenda for the railways; calls for the resolution of the present industrial disputes through negotiation not strike action; and believes that the steps taken have laid the groundwork for a railway system that will be fit for the 21st century', instead thereof.-(<i>Mr Secretary Byers</i>.)</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the original words stand part of the Question;</ul></p>


<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, Bob Russell, Annette Brooke: 207.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Mr Phil Woolas, Mr Graham Stringer: 339.</ul></ul></p>

<p><ul>The Deputy Speaker forthwith declared the Main Question, as amended, to be agreed to.</ul></p>


<p><ul><i>Resolved</i>, That this House believes that the railway infrastructure was badly damaged by decades of underinvestment and a flawed privatisation; recognises that the Government made tough decisions in the first two years of the last Parliament to deliver the economic stability that means it can put record levels of investment into the railways; notes that annual average total investment in rail over the 10 year plan will be £4.3 billion, compared to £1.4 billion for the period 1989/90-1996/97; congratulates the Government on its decisive action over Railtrack, so undoing a failed Conservative privatisation; welcomes the SRA's Strategic Plan that sets out an effective agenda for the railways; calls for the resolution of the present industrial disputes through negotiation not strike action; and believes that the steps taken have laid the groundwork for a railway system that will be fit for the 21st century.</ul></p>


<p><ul>State of the Care System,-A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That this House believes that the underfunding of social care by successive Governments had led to bottlenecks and delays in the NHS, reducing health care capacity and increasing waiting times; further believes that it is the most vulnerable elderly who suffer the consequences of inadequate care; regrets that the piecemeal approach of the Government to hospital delayed discharge simply shifts the pressures from one part of the care system to another; condemns the Government for its mishandling and misunderstanding of the care home sector and the consequent loss of homes and beds; regrets that the failure to adequately fund social care has produced serious staff shortages and reduced choice and quality for those in need of care; and calls on the Government to undertake a whole system review of funding for social care to tackle staff shortages, increase capacity, promote choice and ensure that people get the right care at the right time-(<i>Mr Paul Burstow</i>);</ul></p>


<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'welcomes the Government's strategy for modernising social care services through unprecedented real terms increases in resources, which enables and promotes better joint working between the NHS, social services, and the independent care sectors, develops a national framework for standards and quality and ensures a greater emphasis on users and patients in the design and delivery of services; notes that this has led to more independence for older people, fairer funding of long term care, reduced levels of delayed discharge and greater choice for users; and condemns the Liberal Democrats for their obsession with producer interests over those of users and patients and their failure to recognise that investment must be matched by reform', instead thereof.-(<i>Jacqui Smith</i>.)</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the original words stand part of the Question;</ul></p>


<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, John Thurso, Annette Brooke: 60.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Mr Tony McNulty, Mr John Heppell: 314.</ul></ul></p>

<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>

<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, John Thurso, Annette Brooke: 60.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul>So the Question was agreed to.</ul></p>

<p><ul><i>Resolved</i>, That this House welcomes the Government's strategy for modernising social care services through unprecedented real terms increases in resources, which enables and promotes better joint working between the NHS, social services, and the independent care sectors, develops a national framework for standards and quality and ensures a greater emphasis on users and patients in the design and delivery of services; notes that this has led to more independence for older people, fairer funding of long term care, reduced levels of delayed discharge and greater choice for users; and condemns the Liberal Democrats for their obsession with producer interests over those of users and patients and their failure to recognise that investment must be matched by reform.</ul></p>
