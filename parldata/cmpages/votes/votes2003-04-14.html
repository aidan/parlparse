<p><ul><ul><i>Nature of supply</i></ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>2 The issue of a face-value voucher, or any subsequent supply of it, is a supply of services for the purposes of this Act.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul><i>Treatment of credit vouchers</i></ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>3 (1) This paragraph applies to a face-value voucher issued by a person who-</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(a) is not a person from whom goods or services may be obtained by the use of the voucher, and</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(b) undertakes to give complete or partial reimbursement to any such person from whom goods or services are so obtained.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>Such a voucher is referred to in this Schedule as a "credit voucher".</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(2) The consideration for any supply of a credit voucher shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act except to the extent (if any) that it exceeds the face value of the voucher.</ul></ul></p>

<p><ul><ul>Such a voucher is referred to in this Schedule as a "retailer voucher".</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(2) The consideration for the issue of a retailer voucher shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act except to the extent (if any) that it exceeds the face value of the voucher.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(3) Sub-paragraph (2) above does not apply if-</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(a) the voucher is used to obtain goods or services from a person other than the issuer, and</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(b) that person fails to account for any of the VAT due on the supply of those goods or services to the person using the voucher to obtain them.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(4) Any supply of a retailer voucher subsequent to the issue of it shall be treated in the same way as the supply of a voucher to which paragraph 6 applies.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul><i>Treatment of postage stamps</i></ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>5 The consideration for the supply of a face-value voucher that is a postage stamp shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act except to the extent (if any) that it exceeds the face value of the stamp.</ul></ul></p>

<p><ul><ul>6 (1) This paragraph applies to a face-value voucher that is not a credit voucher, a retailer voucher or a postage stamp.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(2) A supply of such a voucher is chargeable at the rate in force under section 2(1) (standard rate) except where sub-paragraph (3), (4) or (5) below applies.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(3) Where the voucher is one that can only be used to obtain goods or services in one particular non-standard rate category, the supply of the voucher falls in that category.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(4) Where the voucher is used to obtain goods or services all of which fall in one particular non-standard rate category, the supply of the voucher falls in that category.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(5) Where the voucher is used to obtain goods or services in a number of different rate categories-</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(a) the supply of the voucher shall be treated as that many different supplies, each falling in the category in question, and</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(b) the value of each of those supplies shall be determined on a just and reasonable basis.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul><i>Vouchers supplied free with other goods or services</i></ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>7 Where-</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(a) a face-value voucher (other than a postage stamp) and other goods or services are supplied to the same person in a composite transaction, and</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>(b) the total consideration for the supplies is no different, or not significantly different, from what it would be if the voucher were not supplied,</ul></ul></p>
