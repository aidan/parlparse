<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen's Speech (Motion for an Address),-The Order of the day being read, for resuming the adjourned Debate on the Question proposed on 26th November, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, as follows:</p>


<p><ul>Most Gracious Sovereign,</ul></p>


<p><ul>We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Majesty for the Gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament;</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being again proposed:-The House resumed the adjourned Debate.</ul></p>


<p><ul>Another Amendment was proposed to the Question, at the end, to add the words 'But regret that the Gracious Speech contains no measures to provide fundamental reform of public services or to reduce the level of waste in government; condemn the absence of proposals to restore the incentive to save, which has been eroded by the vast growth in means testing; deplore the absence of sufficient measures to avert the pensions crisis; further regret that the Gracious Speech makes no reference to the need to establish a more transparent and coherent fiscal structure; further condemn the absence of measures to fulfil the Government's pledge to improve the competitiveness of the British economy and the rate of productivity growth; note that rail delays have doubled and traffic congestion has increased under this Government, and that there are no measures in the Gracious Speech adequately to address the Government's failure to tackle these problems, which are damaging competitiveness and leading to reduced choice for the travelling public; further condemn the failure of a draft Bill to indicate what the powers of any regional assembly would be, even though proposals for local government reorganisation have been published; and believe that the Government's proposals to restrict the right to buy will frustrate the legitimate aspirations of tenants to own their homes.'.-(<i>Mr Oliver Letwin</i>.)</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the Amendment be made;</ul></p>


<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>

<p><ul>So the Question was negatived.</ul></p>


<p><ul>Another Amendment was proposed to the Question, at the end, to add the words 'But humbly regret that the Gracious Speech distracts from sound policies which deal with crime and its causes; further regret the intention to introduce top-up fees for universities; further regret the lack of provision for free personal care for the elderly and disabled people and the failure to tackle the pension crisis; further regret the decision to proceed with an ill-thought through and expensive identity cards scheme; further regret that the Government has chosen to undermine further the rights of people fleeing persecution to seek asylum in this country; note that the Government has failed to put environment at the heart of its legislative agenda and address the crisis in the transport system; regret the failure to introduce single transferable vote as the voting system for the Scottish Parliament; and further regret the absence of measures to tackle the steep inequalities which continue to afflict the most disadvantaged members of society.'.-(<i>Mr Andrew Stunell</i>.)</ul></p>
