<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, to leave out from the word 'That' to the end of the Question and add the words 'this House declines to give the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill a Second Reading because the Bill focuses predominantly on urban issues while neglecting rural areas, creates another unnecessary quango and brings local authorities into conflict with police and other authorities which currently exercise powers in relation to abandoned vehicles and stray dogs; because the Bill introduces provisions, such as clearing up chewing gum as extensively and frequently as litter, which will be prohibitively expensive yet fail to take account of producer responsibility; and because the Bill contains many unnecessary provisions which would not be needed if existing legislation were properly enforced', instead thereof.&#151;(<i>Mr Tim Yeo</i>.)</ul></p>
