<p align=center>The House met at half-past Eleven o'clock.</p>

PRAYERS.
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Standing Committee C,&#151;Mr Jonathan Sayeed reported from European Standing Committee C the following Resolution:</p>
<p><ul>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents No. 9824/03, Commission Green Paper on Services of General Interest, No. 7549/04, Commission Staff Working Paper: Report on Public Consultation on the Green Paper on Services of General Interest, and No. 9643/04, Commission Communication, White Paper on Services of General Interest; welcomes the debate on Services of General Interest and supports the Government's view that, at a European Union level, sector-specific regulation continues to provide a more satisfactory approach than a horizontal framework directive on Services of General Interest.</ul></p>
<p><ul>Report, together with Resolution, to lie upon the Table.</ul></p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen's Speech (Motion for an Address),&#151;The Order of the day being read, for resuming the adjourned Debate on the Question proposed on 23rd November, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, as follows:</p>
<p><ul>Most Gracious Sovereign,</ul></p>
<p><ul>We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Majesty for the Gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament;</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question being again proposed:&#151;The House resumed the adjourned Debate.</ul></p>
<p><ul>Another Amendment was proposed to the Question, at the end, to add the words 'but regret that the Gracious Speech contains nothing that will reduce regulation, cut excessive bureaucracy or give the taxpayer value for money; condemn the Treasury for sponsoring 70 new regulations per working day, for blocking real reform of public services and for the consequent failure to deliver cleaner hospitals, school discipline, controlled immigration, more police on the streets and a lower tax economy; further regret that the Gracious Speech contains no measures to reverse the Chancellor's punitive taxation of pension funds and reductions in tax incentives to save which have contributed to cutting the savings ratio by one third whilst household debt now exceeds one trillion pounds; are disturbed that more pensioners are means tested than ever before whilst 2 million pensioners live in poverty; note that the Treasury's failure to provide taxpayer value and the waste of billions of pounds on unnecessary expenditure means that another round of stealth tax rises is inevitable under this Government; and further deplore the fact that there are no measures in the Gracious Speech to reverse the Government's policy of high levels of regulation and taxation which have resulted in the UK slipping from fourth to eleventh in the international competitiveness league and having a lower GDP per head than Ireland.'.&#151;(<i>Mr Oliver Letwin</i>.)</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the Amendment be made;</ul></p>
<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, Mr Crispin Blunt, Mr Peter Atkinson: 149.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Mr Nick Ainger, Margaret Moran: 380.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul>So the Question was negatived.</ul></p>
<p><ul>Another Amendment was proposed to the Question, at the end, to add the words 'but regret that the Gracious Speech contains no commitment to introduce legislation to clarify the responsibility of the Prime Minister to Parliament, particularly in relation to the prerogative powers and the role of Parliament in matters of war and peace; and call for a special Select Committee of the House to consider these matters.'.&#151;(<i>Mr Andrew Stunell</i>.)</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Question being put forthwith, pursuant to Standing Order No. 33 (Calling of amendments at end of debate), That the Amendment be made;</ul></p>
<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, Richard Younger-Ross, Mr Alan Reid: 68.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Margaret Moran, Mr Nick Ainger: 443.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul>So the Question was negatived.</ul></p>
<p><ul>And the Main Question being put;</ul></p>
<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, Mr Nick Ainger, Margaret Moran: 295.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Mr Peter Atkinson, Mr Crispin Blunt: 200.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul>So the Question was agreed to.</ul></p>
<p><ul><i>Resolved</i>, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, as follows:</ul></p>
<p><ul>Most Gracious Sovereign,</ul></p>
<p><ul>We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Majesty for the Gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament.</ul></p>
