<p><ul>Accuracy of NHS Performance Indicators,-A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That this House calls for an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the decision in July 2002 to upgrade the star rating of the South Durham Health Care Trust from two stars to three following the involvement of the private office of the then Secretary of State for Health and with the knowledge of 10 Downing Street; further calls for greater transparency in the calculation and publication of performance indicators throughout the NHS; and is concerned that excessive reliance on such indicators inhibits the independence of professionals and managers and leads to distortions in the allocation of resources-(<i>Mr Tim Yeo</i>);</ul></p>


<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'notes that record investment in the NHS has to be linked to reform, and that this investment and the devolution of power to the front line require greater accountability; congratulates the Government on its record of making the NHS more transparent through the development of performance indicators; welcomes the Government's development of such indicators in consultation with patients and staff; congratulates the Government on giving responsibility for NHS performance monitoring to the independent Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI), which reports direct to Parliament; and welcomes CHAI's commitment to developing new and more reflective indicators in partnership with representative bodies and the NHS itself', instead thereof.-(<i>Mr Secretary Reid</i>.)</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the original words stand part of the Question;</ul></p>


<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, Gregory Barker, Mr Peter Atkinson: 204.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Mr Fraser Kemp, Gillian Merron: 338.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul>So the Question was negatived.</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question, That the proposed words be there added, being put forthwith, pursuant to Standing Order No. 31 (Questions on amendments):-It was agreed to.</ul></p>


<p><ul>The Deputy Speaker forthwith declared the Main Question, as amended, to be agreed to.</ul></p>


<p><ul><i>Resolved</i>, That this House notes that record investment in the NHS has to be linked to reform, and that this investment and the devolution of power to the front line require greater accountability; congratulates the Government on its record of making the NHS more transparent through the development of performance indicators; welcomes the Government's development of such indicators in consultation with patients and staff; congratulates the Government on giving responsibility for NHS performance monitoring to the independent Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI), which reports direct to Parliament; and welcomes CHAI's commitment to developing new and more reflective indicators in partnership with representative bodies and the NHS itself.</ul></p>


<p><ul>Long Term Care for Elderly People,-A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That this House expresses its profound concern at the continuing crisis in care for elderly people; deplores the Government's over-prescriptive, expensive and bureaucratic regulation of the care home sector, which has greatly exacerbated the crisis in care and has led to many care home closures; condemns the loss of over 70,000 long term care places since 1997 and is gravely concerned that the number of people receiving domiciliary care has fallen by 100,000 since 1997; is further concerned that the implementation of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Act 2003 will merely place an unfair financial burden on Social Services departments, and could lead to patients being discharged prematurely from hospital into inappropriate care, resulting in an increase in emergency readmissions; and calls on the Government to recognise the crisis in the provision of long term care for elderly people, to take action to reduce the current rate of care home closures and to combat the decline in the availability of domiciliary care, rather than simply disregard the crisis-(<i>Mr Simon Burns</i>);</ul></p>


<p><ul>An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'welcomes the real terms increase in social services funding of 20 per cent. between 1997 and 2003, and the commitment to continue these increases by an annual 6 per cent. in real terms from this financial year to 2005-06; notes that councils are able to use these resources to increase fees they pay to care homes where they think necessary, with 2002-03 figures showing 56 per cent. of local councils in England and Wales increasing the fees they pay by at least 5 per cent; notes that the Laing & Buisson Care of Elderly People Market Survey published in July 2003 puts bed capacity in care homes from all sectors at 470,000 with demand estimated to be around 460,000; further notes that over 80 per cent. of older people say they want to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible; supports the Government's policy of improving choice by providing alternatives to residential care with 20,900 more households since 1998 receiving intensive home care packages, 143,200 additional people receiving intermediate care services since 1999, and a cash injection of £87 million to be spent on creating 1,500 new extra care housing places by 2006; and further supports the Government's policy of driving up care standards where the care is delivered and ensuring that older people are not held unnecessarily in acute hospital beds when their care needs can be better met elsewhere', instead thereof.-(<i>Dr Stephen Ladyman</i>.)</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being proposed, That the original words stand part of the Question;</ul></p>


<p><ul>Mr Patrick McLoughlin rose in his place and claimed to move, That the Question be now put.</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being put, That the Question be now put:-It was agreed to.</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question being accordingly put;</ul></p>


<p><ul>The House divided.</ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, Mr David Wilshire, Mr Hugo Swire: 200.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Paul Clark, Mr Vernon Coaker: 334.</ul></ul></p>


<p><ul>So the Question was negatived.</ul></p>


<p><ul>And the Question, That the proposed words be there added, being put forthwith, pursuant to Standing Order No. 31 (Questions on amendments):-It was agreed to.</ul></p>


<p><ul>The Deputy Speaker forthwith declared the Main Question, as amended, to be agreed to.</ul></p>


<p><ul><i>Resolved</i>, That this House welcomes the real terms increase in social services funding of 20 per cent. between 1997 and 2003, and the commitment to continue these increases by an annual 6 per cent. in real terms from this financial year to 2005-06; notes that councils are able to use these resources to increase fees they pay to care homes where they think necessary, with 2002-03 figures showing 56 per cent. of local councils in England and Wales increasing the fees they pay by at least 5 per cent; notes that the Laing & Buisson Care of Elderly People Market Survey published in July 2003 puts bed capacity in care homes from all sectors at 470,000 with demand estimated to be around 460,000; further notes that over 80 per cent. of older people say they want to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible; supports the Government's policy of improving choice by providing alternatives to residential care with 20,900 more households since 1998 receiving intensive home care packages, 143,200 additional people receiving intermediate care services since 1999, and a cash injection of £87 million to be spent on creating 1,500 new extra care housing places by 2006; and further supports the Government's policy of driving up care standards where the care is delivered and ensuring that older people are not held unnecessarily in acute hospital beds when their care needs can be better met elsewhere.</ul></p>
