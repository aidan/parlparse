<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message from the Lords,&#151;A Message was brought from the Lords, as follows:</p>
The Lords have agreed, without Amendment, to the Amendments made by this House to the Children Bill [<i>Lords</i>].
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Doctor Services,&#151;A Motion was made, and the Question being proposed, That this House places the highest importance on the role of general medical practitioners, working with allied healthcare professionals, constituting a family doctor service; regards this service as the lynch-pin of NHS primary care services and central to public health promotion; appreciates that general practitioners are best placed to provide care for patients, to facilitate their access to NHS services and to manage care of those suffering from chronic diseases and co-morbidities; is concerned by the continuing level of general practitioner vacancies and workload pressures; regrets the Government's devaluation of the family doctor's role in favour of an emphasis on diverse means of access to the NHS; deplores the failure to maintain the out-of-hours service as a general practitioner-led service and the loss of Saturday morning surgeries; calls on the Government to ensure that the NHS Programme for information technology delivers the choice of suppliers and functionality which general practitioners need; further regards the Government's abandonment of general practitioner fundholding and commissioning as a severe misjudgement and urges the reintroduction of the benefits of fundholding through the adoption of practice-led commissioning; and believes that the development of family doctor-led commissioning, alongside increasing patient choice, offers the best means of delivering an effective NHS which is responsive to patients' needs and wishes&#151;(<i>Mr Andrew Lansley</i>);</p>
An Amendment was proposed to the Question, in line 2, to leave out from the word 'House' to the end of the Question and add the words 'welcomes the increase in general practitioner numbers; supports the expansion of primary care provision through walk-in centres and NHS Direct to meet the needs of patients; welcomes the new arrrangements for the National Health Service out-of-hours services that provide an opportunity to integrate primary, secondary and social care, whilst guaranteeing high quality urgent care across the country including Saturday mornings and improving the quality of life for general practitioners; acknowledges the progress made on the NHS Programme for information technology; supports the introduction of practice-based commissioning which fosters clinical engagement whilst mitigating the worst excesses of general practitioner fundholding; and believes that the general development of practice-based commissioning will deliver improved patient care', instead thereof.&#151;(<i>Mr John Hutton</i>.)
And the Question being put, That the original words stand part of the Question, pursuant to Order [4th November] and Standing Order No. 31 (Questions on amendments);
The House divided.
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Ayes, Mr Hugo Swire, Andrew Selous: 118.</ul></ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Jim Fitzpatrick, Gillian Merron: 286.</ul></ul></p>

The House divided.

<p><ul><ul>Tellers for the Noes, Mr John Randall, Mr Hugo Swire: 149.</ul></ul></p>
So the Question was agreed to.
The Deputy Speaker forthwith declared the Main Question, as amended, to be agreed to.
<i>Resolved</i>, That this House welcomes the increase in general practitioner numbers; supports the expansion of primary care provision through walk-in centres and NHS Direct to meet the needs of patients; welcomes the new arrrangements for the National Health Service out-of-hours services that provide an opportunity to integrate primary, secondary and social care, whilst guaranteeing high quality urgent care across the country including Saturday mornings and improving the quality of life for general practitioners; acknowledges the progress made on the NHS Programme for information technology; supports the introduction of practice-based commissioning which fosters clinical engagement whilst mitigating the worst excesses of general practitioner fundholding; and believes that the general development of practice-based commissioning will deliver improved patient care.
