 (LD): Whether he plans to bring forward legislation on pension reform in this Parliament.  [22501]
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51031-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr.   David Blunkett): </b> 
 As the hon. Lady will know, the Turner commission will report on 30 November. Ministers will then have the chance to respond and to continue the dialogue that is taking place across the country to gain a consensus&#151;between political parties, I hope, as well as across the nation&#151;on the way forward. The Prime Minister indicated at the beginning of October that we would make decisions during the   next 12 months about the progression of the Government from that point, and at that stage we will of course make a statement to the House.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51031-01_spnew0"><b> Lynne Featherstone: </b> 
 Given that the Minister&#039;s judgment has been so publicly brought into question in recent times, does he believe that he remains in a position to secure the consensus that he mentioned in a   divided Cabinet over the urgent need radically to reform the pensions system?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51031-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 All new Members can be forgiven for misunderstanding what Question Time is about. The reception that my Ministers and I&#151;I am sure that this is also true of the main Opposition party&#151;have received when we have gone round the country discussing pensions is very simple. People want us to take the matter seriously and to have stable and secure solutions for the future. Above all, they do not want a party political knockabout. If the hon. Lady learns that lesson, she will have learned something worth while for the future.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51031-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): My right hon. Friend will know that some of us are very grateful to the Government for the financial assistance scheme, which is the responsibility of his Department and the Department of Trade and Industry. I am grateful for the   help that has been given in my constituency to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 610</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>people with the Lister Petter pension scheme. However, we now need to look forward in order to assist those who are not in line for the immediate first tranche of help. About 20 people have been helped already, but hundreds more need to know that the Government are committed to bringing forward proper procedures to help them, as it is through no fault of their own that their company pension schemes have been liquidated. Can my right hon. Friend give an opinion on that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51031-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 I appreciate the nature of the question. It is a terrible thing for those who have been so badly affected by the collapse of these schemes. We now have the operation up and running. The unit has received the   necessary material from 17 of the schemes, and we   sincerely hope that we will be able to make the first   payments before Christmas. However, there is also a long-term issue. My Ministers and I have been receiving representations from Members and from those representing previous work forces across the country. We are deeply sympathetic to trying to find a way forward in future.

</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51031-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has been chairing the tripartite forum to endeavour to find a solution that meets the statutory requirements to balance the books and deals with the separate issue of how this equates to public service pensions more generally, which is being dealt with by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. It is important that people have choices about their retirement. It is also important that they are aware of the consequences of the particular age at which they retire and the longevity that they can expect. All of us, whether in the public or private sector, have to take that on board personally.

Friend ensure that there is a detailed programme of education and information so that members of the public can make the informed choices that he mentioned, and especially so that young people can plan for their future and decide which of the many different savings vehicles and pension plans is the right one for them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51031-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 I am absolutely certain that the Pensions Commission will have a lot to say about the   nature of such information and the education programme that goes with it. One thing that is clearly shining through&#151;I think that Members will have felt it themselves&#151;is that if we can make the system as simple and understandable as possible, so that people are not faced with impossible choices, we might be able to connect young people with what appears to be a very distant future, and the fact that they may spend nearly as long in retirement as in work.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51031-01_spnew8"><b> Sir Malcolm Rifkind  (Kensington and Chelsea)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions was speaking yesterday of the benefit of hindsight. With the benefit of hindsight, does he agree that the Prime Minister made a very foolish mistake in asking the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and not the   Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, to negotiate the question of pension reform with the public sector unions? Does he agree that that is an example of the crumbling confidence that the Prime Minister appears to have in his efforts? Will he endorse the outcome of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&#039;s discussions, which have ensured that for millions of people in the public sector it will be 40 years before their 60-year retirement age ends, while people in the private sector are being told that they may have to work for years longer than 65? Will those discussions help him to achieve consensus on pension reform?
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51031-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 That is a very good try. The confidence that the shadow Secretary of State appeared to have in   me crumbled within 10 seconds. The decision was taken on who should continue to handle public sector pensions, namely the Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, on 6 May, and I do not think that I had taken office when that decision was taken, so nothing has crumbled. I can tell the right hon. and learned Gentleman that 85 per cent. of the due costs will be met by turnover in the public service pension programme, which was announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Negotiations are continuing within the framework that has been laid down and within the particular sectors affected.
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51031-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Denis MacShane  (Rotherham)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend is a very youthful, energetic, virile kind of chap with many years of service on the Front Bench. Will he welcome the German Government&#039;s decision to move the retirement age in Germany from 65 to 67? Bismarck chose a retirement age of 65 at a time when the   average life expectancy of a German worker was 49,   which resulted in a wonderful pension scheme&#151;everybody paid in, and, if they lived, they waited until they were 65 to draw out. We live in a different world, and I urge my right hon. Friend to get away from 60,   65 and any other arbitrary age limit and to bury the idea that there is a time when people must retire or when he must leave the Front Bench.
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51031-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 I plead guilty to being energetic&#151;my virility has been over-exaggerated. Bismarck had the foresight&#151;which is a great asset for a politician as well as hindsight&#151;to see how the world was moving. If we have the foresight to see what the 21st century holds, we   will get it right not only on the public sector, but for the nation as a whole.

 (LD): On pensions reform, will the Secretary of State assure us that nothing will distract him from pursuing that vital agenda?

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 612</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>who have not even joined the public sector yet will be allowed to retire at 60 in 2048? Is that really consistent with what Lord Turner is looking at?
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51031-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 On the first, rather pathetic point, the answer is no. On the second point, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has announced that from next year people joining the schemes will have a retirement age of 65. The hon. Gentleman should consider what has been said, rather than the mythology that he has peddled this afternoon.

 (Lab): With the repeated failures and what now looks like the lingering death of private pension provision, will my right hon. Friend accept that to ensure secure pensions in future we must re-examine the state and start where Barbara Castle left off with the state earnings-related pension scheme?
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51031-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 We should look to the state, to the individual and their responsibility and to employers. If we can get a tripartite approach that balances those different elements, we will have a pension scheme that is viable for the future and that provides people with the   necessary retirement income to see them through the extra nine-to-12 years that they now live compared with 40 years ago, when Barbara Castle dealt with the issue very well. If we had only been able to see then the   longevity that exists now, we might have been able to put a more secure and stable scheme in place.

</p>


<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51031-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mr.   David Blunkett): </b> 
 In April, we appointed a new chief executive for the Child Support Agency. When I   took office on 6 May, I asked him to undertake a root and branch review of both operation and service delivery, and that report will be available within a matter of weeks. We intend to place the report before the   House, to place ourselves in front of the Select Committee and to negotiate with the House authorities on obtaining a proper debate on the report, which will open up the issues and ensure that we get it right for the future at last.
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51031-02_spnew0"><b> Andrew Selous: </b> 
 May I recommend that the Secretary of State takes a plane trip to Australia, where he will find   a child support agency that gets more money than   our CSA to parents caring for children? The Australian CSA helps to look after the emotional needs of non-resident parents, rather than just extracting money from them, and it is about to help families to stay together in the first place through a network of family relationship centres. Those lessons are valuable. What reassurance can the Secretary of State give us that he will learn from them?
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51031-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 The first part of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question constituted the best offer that I have had for several days, and I shall certainly take him up on it. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 613</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I   take the second part very seriously, however. We must take every possible step to avoid breakdown. We need, and have discussed, a gateway or ameliorative process to ensure that when relationships do break down, no bureaucratic machinery is involved in dealing with the consequences, but above all to remind people that the   CSA was established&#151;by a Conservative Government&#151;because individuals were not prepared to take responsibility for their actions. We are trying to   remedy a breakdown in civil society, not just a breakdown of the bureaucratic processes.

 (Lab): A constituent of mine should be paying &#163;264 a month, but is paying &#163;483 for one child under the old scheme. He is paying &#163;220 a month too much, and is understandably angry and bitter about the unfairness of the scheme. He has been waiting for two years for the old scheme to be merged with the new one.
</p>

<a name="51031-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Secretary of State suggested earlier that papers would be produced, and that a debate would take place. Is he telling us that there will be no early move to transfer old cases to the new scheme? If so, that is very bad news for thousands of people.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51031-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 A quarter of a million cases have been moved to the new system, but the conflict within the families concerned&#151;for every gainer there is a loser, such as my hon. Friend&#039;s constituent: a gain means a   loss for the recipient&#151;means that there is an unwillingness to transfer voluntarily to the new scheme. In such circumstances, we must get the information technology right. One reason why the process has taken so long, and why I am determined to be absolutely transparent and honest about the difficulties when we produce the report, is that misleading people into believing that something can be done and then creating bureaucratic administrative chaos leaves those who are most in need at the receiving end of the failure. I am determined that, following all the effort invested by my predecessors, we will get it right this time.

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51031-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 In fact, we have increased the number of staff substantially over the last three months. Yes, those involved in direct enforcement are front-line staff, which is why we have been transferring back-office activity to the front line, using the product of information technology. I believe that we now have 2,000 staff on the enforcement programme. Obviously, clear signals and messages must be sent if people are to be compelled to pay.

Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)? Is it not a fact that the addresses of many of those 100,000 people are unknown to the CSA? Other countries that have experienced the same problem have devised a &quot;bounty hunter&quot; system, under which officers are paid only if they find those who refuse to pay maintenance. If we had such a system in this country, would not many more children receive maintenance, and would not taxpayers face smaller bills?

The Health and Safety Commission chairman was concerned that some local authorities were perhaps being over-zealous in their interpretation of the guidelines. I note that he wrote to local authorities. There have been significant difficulties in trying to form a consensus on what needs to be done, not least because of the spectrum of organisations, ranging from large local authorities to small churchyards, that manage burial grounds.

 Latest figures show that claimant unemployment stands at 875,500. Despite recent rises in the claimant count, it remains historically low.

It would not be right for me to give an assurance about the position a year from now. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall make every endeavour to ensure that we maintain the strong figures on employment, which is up by more than 100,000 in the last quarter, more than 300,000 in the past year and more than 2.3 million since we have been in government.

 I would have hoped that a Front-Bench spokesman for Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition would look at the figures in the round. If we do so, we can see that there is plenty of good news. The employment rate is now higher than it has been for decades, with more than 2.3 million more people working today than in 1997. Most importantly, we are beginning to tackle the inactivity in employment that was a feature of Britain for generations, and which the Conservatives never attempted to tackle. We now have more than 1 million lone parents in work, and for the first time in decades the number of people on incapacity benefit is beginning to decrease. That is a record of which we are proud. Having said that, as I said in answer to a previous question, we are not complacent about the small rise in the claimant count, which is not because of more people coming on to jobseeker&#039;s allowance but because they are staying on it for a little bit longer. I am considering the reasons for that trend, so that I can take appropriate action to reverse it. We have an economy and labour market that are second to none and unparalleled in the world.

</p>


<p><a name="st_42"><a name="51031-03_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Pensions Reform  (Mr. Stephen Timms): </b> 
 The Pension Protection Fund opened its doors on 6 April. It compensates members of eligible defined benefit pension schemes if the employer becomes insolvent and the scheme is underfunded so that it cannot pay benefits at least equal to PPF levels of compensation. I discussed the operation of the fund with the new trustee panel last week, and with the chairman of Nestl&#233; UK earlier this month.
</p>





<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51031-03_spnew0"><b> Mike Penning: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that answer. I   am sure that the Pension Protection Fund will help people who pay into pensions in future if they have their pensions stolen, as has happened to former Dexion workers in my constituency. The PPF will not help them today, however, and I hope that the financial assistance scheme will be rolled out by Christmas. When the Secretary of State meets my constituents in the next couple of weeks, will he give them a firm date as to when they are likely to get the compensation that they deserve? Will he not rule out getting funding from sources other than the pension fund that already exists?
</p>





<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51031-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the benefits of the PPF in protecting schemes when employers hit problems in future. As he rightly says, however, that is not the case with the Dexion scheme, the wind-up of which commenced before April 2005. The financial assistance scheme is therefore likely to be helpful. I know that Dexion 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 618</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is   being considered for entry to FAS at the moment, and I think that the FAS unit has asked for some further information from the Dexion trustees in order to finalise the decision. I know that the hon. Gentleman is meeting my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State shortly, and my right hon. Friend will certainly want to bring him up to date with the latest developments.
</p>





<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51031-03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Stewart Jackson: </b> 
 The Minister will know that the PPF will this year receive some &#163;300 million through a levy. Is he concerned that the independent consultants Hymans Robertson have estimated that as much as &#163;1.5 billion will be needed next year? Do the Government agree with that estimate, and what impact would that have in future years on the risk-based levy?
</p>





<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51031-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I have seen that figure and several other large-sounding figures being quoted. The PPF is consulting at the moment on the basis for calculating the levy, and will publish its proposals at the end of November. The initial estimate was based on circumstances in December 2003, and changes since then, for example, on interest rates, will no doubt have some impact. The PPF understands extremely well the need to keep the burden manageable for the funds that are paying the levy. I caution the hon. Gentleman against placing too much credence on some of the figures quoted, such as that to which he refers. The fund will publish the outcome of its consultation exercise at the end of next month.
</p>





<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51031-03_spnew4"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis  (New Forest, East)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister will recall his previous meeting on the question of APW Electronics based in Eastleigh. At least four of my constituents and many more in Eastleigh and Southampton lost 80 per cent. of their pensions when their trustees were forced by a foreign-based arm of the firm to accept a deal that cost them that on pain of the   company otherwise going into liquidation. Throughout the country, only about half a dozen companies are in that situation, and they are not covered by the protection scheme that has been set up or the financial assistance scheme. Can he do something to restore the stolen pensions of my constituents and the constituents of others?
</p>





<p><a name="st_48"><a name="51031-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I do recall the discussion that we had. As I said to the hon. Gentleman on that occasion, it is our view that, where there is still a solvent employer, as there is in that case, that employer has a duty to ensure that the obligations that it has entered into are honoured. Therefore, he needs to look to the employer to put things right.
</p>





<p><a name="st_49"><a name="51031-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Pat McFadden  (Wolverhampton, South-East)</b> 
 (Lab): The PPF and the financial assistance scheme are welcome new measures of protection, but does the Minister agree that there is still a need for advice about   how the schemes will operate? For example, in   my constituency, many former employees of UPF Thompson Chassis do not know what pension they will be entitled to. Some do not know whether they will be entitled to a pension at all. What steps is the Department taking to communicate with workers in that position to tell them of their rights under the new schemes?

That company was 49 per cent. owned by ICI, and 51 per cent. owned by the Irish Government. As well as providing assistance from other sources, can the Minister, in his discussions with the Irish Government, put some pressure on them at least to fulfil their morale obligations to the workers of that company and to provide them with a decent pension for the future?
</p>

 I caution the hon.

It is broadly accepted that it is in the interests of schemes and of their members that there be support from the PPF. The principle was well established and well accepted across the House. I hope that, when he sees the final conclusion of the work that the PPF is doing, he will agree that it is a good deal for schemes and their members.

 There we have it. The Government have been in power for eight years and it is still taking at least six weeks to process a child support application. It is totally unacceptable. The assessments are often completely inaccurate. I do not know whether the Minister is aware how much distress that is causing, which is illustrated by the number of people coming into our surgeries.

<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51031-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 I am perfectly aware of the distress that is caused to constituents when cases do not go well, because they come to my surgery, too. That is exactly the reason why, as my right hon.

 Until recently, pensioners in my constituency had an extremely good Pension Service office in King&#039;s Lynn, which was moved to Norwich and now to Burnley.

 Although we have made a lot of progress in reducing fraud, we accept that the levels of error remain unacceptably high. We have a duty as a Department to ensure that we administer our benefits as correctly as possible and that our customers are aware of the need to provide necessary information to support their claims and report changes in circumstances quickly. We are also taking steps to increase the accuracy of staff and to encourage our customers to do more to keep their claims correct.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51031-04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mackay: </b> 
 My constituents will think that reply hopelessly complacent. A growing number of them tell me of errors in their benefits claims, which is harmful in many ways.

 First, at least this Government measure the level of fraud and error, something the previous Government did not get around to until 1995. I regret that the right hon. Gentleman said that my answer was complacent, because I admitted that error was a cause for concern. We are putting in place the support mechanisms that are necessary to ensure that our staff realise that error, such as the right hon. Gentleman identifies, is not acceptable. There are two issues to error. One is a process issue, in terms of ensuring that the information is entered and followed through properly; the other is ensuring that customers realise that they have a responsibility to keep the information up to date. If we bring those two things together, we will continue to tackle the error in the system. I leave the right hon.

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="51031-05_spnew5"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman is anxious that we should increase the number of people working in the health service, because all too often Opposition Members attack us for the expenditure on it and the growth in employment in it. I   recognise the issue that he raises, and we need to introduce more flexible working and other attractive measures to bring back into the health service some of   the people who may have left to care for their children or others in the home. We have introduced many measures already and a Bill will be introduced this Session to provide greater flexibility for people working throughout the economy, including the right to ask for flexible working when their children are older and if they are carers. I hope that that will assist with the problem the hon. Gentleman mentions.

 (Lab): Aberdeen is booming at present, thanks to high oil prices. I   appreciate that not all hon. Members think that that is a good thing, but it certainly is in the north-east of Scotland. As a result, unemployment is low and there are real labour shortages, especially in the construction industry. One of the local charities, Aberdeen Foyer, has been successfully delivering the build and train new deal, but the Government will withdraw the funding for that next year. I know that my right hon. Friend has already agreed to meet people from the Foyer to discuss the matter, but I hope that the Government will consider the   importance of some of those new deals that deal with the most marginal young people and get those whom the previous Government had written off successfully back to work, as well as plugging some of   the gaps in the labour shortage.

 My hon. Friend has spoken to me about the ambitions project in her constituency, of which the Foyer is part. Some areas of the country have had successful pilots on which we want to build and from which we want to learn lessons. The trick that we pulled, which we must spread more widely, was linking the skills needs of employers to the state in its various guises, whether it be the Department for Education and Skills or my Department, to get individuals with the relevant competencies but who are outside the labour market or unemployed to fill the jobs. If those three parts work together&#151;the individual, the state and the employer&#151;we have a route to filling some of the skills

There is still a gap with the national employment rate of just under 4 per cent., but we are narrowing it. Our very successful new deal for 50-plus has brought back into work more than 150,000 older workers. We want to go further and build on that successful strategy.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Before I turn to the Bill itself, I should like to draw the attention of the House to a statement issued last night in the name of the Loyalist Volunteer Force indicating that what they describe as their &quot;military units&quot; have been ordered to stand down. As the House will know, over the summer the LVF and the Ulster Volunteer Force have been engaged in a grisly feud, which has cost four lives. I welcome any move that brings such murderous violence to an end.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The statement is, therefore, a step forward which I   hope will give encouragement to those who are working to establish the primacy of politics in their communities. Of course, words must also be matched by deeds from all loyalist groups. What we need to see is the full decommissioning of all paramilitary arsenals and a complete and permanent end to all paramilitary and criminal activity from all paramilitary groups. In welcoming the statement, I can also say that hearing the president of Sinn Fein use the words &quot;the war is over&quot;&#151;words that we have wanted to hear for such a long time&#151;is a further sign that we are continuing to move in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">We are all haunted by what has occurred in Northern Ireland during the troubles. Members of the House and the other place have been personally affected. Others will have vivid memories of scenes of terrorist atrocities reported in the media.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">During the loyalist and republican terrorist campaigns more than 3,000 people lost their lives, families have been torn apart and victims left bereft. In 1972 alone, the worst year of violence, 497 people were killed and nearly 5,000 were injured. So far this year, there have been just five fatal attacks. Those are, of course, five deaths too many, but nevertheless the situation has changed dramatically from the dark days of the 1970s and 1980s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The legislative response to terrorism has also changed over the last 30 years as the counter-capability responds to the level of threat. In particular, special provision has been required to counter terrorism and for the use of the armed forces in support of the police. Those provisions have evolved over time in response to changing terrorist tactics to ensure that the agencies can respond effectively to terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 was the first piece of legislation to focus on tackling the threat of terrorism in Northern Ireland. It provided non-jury Diplock courts to overcome problems of juror intimidation by paramilitaries and gave special powers to the police and armed forces in Northern Ireland to stop, to search and to enter premises. It applied only in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Following attacks by the IRA in Birmingham in 1974,   Parliament passed the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974, which gave additional

<br>&nbsp;<br>powers of arrest and detention to police and applied throughout the United Kingdom. Those Acts were extended and renewed a number of times in subsequent years. The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 was passed as a response to the Omagh bombing of 15 August 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">All of that legislation was re-enacted and extended, culminating in the Terrorism Act 2000, which was intended to combat all forms of terrorism, not just terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland. The 2000 Act placed anti-terrorism laws largely on a permanent footing in the United Kingdom, in line with the recommendations made by Lord Lloyd of Berwick&#039;s &quot;Inquiry into legislation against terrorism&quot; and the proposals in the Home Office consultation document, &quot;Legislation against Terrorism&quot;. However, the 2000 Act continued to contain temporary provision that was designed to tackle the specific threat of terrorism in Northern Ireland and that applies only there. Those temporary provisions are contained in part VII of that Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Since the 2000 Act was passed, there have been further changes to the permanent law on terrorism. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the   Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 further refined and extended the range of options available to deal with   the terrorist threat. The Home Secretary has now   brought further measures before Parliament to strengthen our capacity to tackle the latest threats from terrorism.

<a name="stpa_13">Each year Parliament has approved the continued use of the provisions and agreed that they are an appropriate response to the threat. Earlier this year we identified several provisions relating to bail and the treatment of juveniles that were no longer needed and took them out of force. Last year, we lapsed a provision on port and border controls with no ill effect. All that has happened because the security situation in Northern Ireland has improved and other structural and legislative developments have meant that some of the provisions are no longer necessary.

<br>&nbsp;<br>it will be quick. He really needs to clarify the inconsistency of his approach in recent weeks. We are being asked to approve terrorism legislation that will extend part VII for at least two years, and perhaps another year on top of that, on the basis that the security situation, as determined at the present time, makes the provisions &quot;necessary&quot;. How can he reconcile a Bill that we are being asked to pass on that assessment with the facts that he has already indicated that Sinn Fein&#039;s allowances will be returned in the Assembly, that he will recommend in a few weeks that Sinn Fein Members&#039; allowances in this House should be returned, and that Royal Irish Regiment home battalions should be disbanded? Before we go any further, will he reconcile the two irreconcilable points of view that are coming out of the Northern Ireland Office?
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51031-07_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Lady&#039;s points, which she makes with her normal courtesy and force. However, it is clear that we are trying to progress the politics and ensure that we get a permanent end to   violence&#151;including that from the IRA, in relation to her point about allowances. At the same time, to ensure that the safety and security of each individual citizen in Northern Ireland is not jeopardised in any way by any retrograde action, we are putting in place necessary provisions through the Bill. It is consistent to move forward the politics while adopting the prudent approach of safeguarding the position if there were a terrorist outbreak by perhaps dissident republicans, or the remaining active loyalist groups that have not done what the Loyalist Volunteer Force announced overnight.

 Does not what the Secretary of State has said this afternoon, and indeed his reply to the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon), underline the wisdom of him giving the House the opportunity for pre-legislative scrutiny of the on-the-runs legislation with which we are threatened?
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51031-07_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman knows, I dealt with   that matter last week when I gave evidence to his   Committee and he questioned me closely on it. The on-the-runs legislation is of course entirely separate from the Bill.

 Will the right hon. Gentleman take it from me that many people in Northern Ireland think that this &quot;progress&quot; is capitulation and is not going to help? There is the view that many things are moving the situation in one way&#151;especially in favour of the IRA&#151;and we also have this legislation. Surely there is a contradiction. It is not possible to have it both ways. Either things are not good in Northern Ireland or else things are good in Northern Ireland. Those of us who live there know exactly what the answer to that is.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51031-07_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b>

As the normalisation measures are taken forward in terms of reducing the number of armed forces and so, I am sure that every citizen in Northern Ireland will be reassured that we have, as a fall-back, legislation that has been necessary in recent years.

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51031-07_spnew8"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 May I sum up the message coming from the Secretary of State? We are taking the Bill through the House because he believes that we are still under threat from dissident republicans and perhaps loyalist paramilitaries, but that we are under no threat from the Provisional IRA.

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51031-07_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The Bill creates an enabling environment. That is why the time frame is put in the way that it is.   As   regards the promises that the IRA made on 28   July and the decommissioning of its arsenal, which   General John de Chastelain announced on 26   September, and the consequences that that will have for activity on the ground, which the hon.

<a name="stpa_14">While the security situation is far from perfect&#151;the violent events at Whiterock last month are evidence of that&#151;no one could deny that the security situation has changed fundamentally as a result of the events of the past couple of months. On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA made an historic statement, announcing an end to the armed conflict and ordering all members to dump arms. In response, I announced on 1 August 2005 the triggering of a programme of security normalisation measures. That sees a gradual reduction in the security infrastructure in Northern Ireland and a reduction in troop numbers to garrison level, and culminates in the repeal of counter-terrorism legislation particular to Northern Ireland.

The January report of the IMC will help us to make that assessment.

 I can confirm that the pro-agreement parties were consulted and gave their general endorsement to the joint declaration in 2003. That was the statement that pre-announced all the matters about which I reminded everyone in early August. I know that the hon. Gentleman and his constituents have many deep concerns about the pace of those normalisation procedures. We are having a separate discussion about the position of the Royal Irish Regiment home battalions, and the Democratic Unionist party has put some very good points to me about how that should be handled, particularly the levels of redundancy, about which there is much concern in many of the communities where soldiers and their families have made tremendous sacrifices over the years, sometimes with their lives. The points made by the hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev.   Ian Paisley) and other DUP Members are well taken. I have had recent discussions with the Chief of the Defence Staff on the matter, and he is seized of the importance that I attach to proper provision and is well aware of the concerns that exist, particularly in those Unionist communities that have suffered so much over the last years.

In the end it is not a matter for me, but if it is possible to obtain a decision before Christmas, that would be very desirable, and I have made that clear.

 I understand the point that that hon. Lady is making in defence of the Ulster Unionist party, which has played an honourable role in bringing forward the peace process. I doubt whether we would have been where we are today in terms of the statements of 28 July and 26 September on an end to the IRA&#039;s armed campaign and the decommissioning of its arsenal had it not been for the courage shown by the then leader of the UUP.

<a name="stpa_17">When I published the normalisation programme on 1 August, I made it clear that my priority is the safety and security of the people of Northern Ireland. That is   the first duty that I have as Secretary of State. Nothing will be done to jeopardise that. The completion of the normalisation programme must be subject to an enabling environment being sustained. That is why I am bringing legislation before the House today instead of letting the provisions expire next February. The Bill provides that the part VII provisions will continue in force until 31 July 2007. Because I will not take chances with the safety and security of the people of Northern Ireland, the Bill also contains the option to extend the provisions for up to one year thereafter until July 2008.

 Is the Secretary of State aware that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has called for the repeal of part VII and schedule 9 of the Terrorism Act 2000, relating to the working of the Diplock courts? Obviously, it is very important that in times gone by families and jurors were protected by having a single judge making decisions in that way. However, it has been suggested that one step towards normalisation might be to have one judge instead of three judges, so that confidence in the judicial system could be greatly enhanced among people on all sides.

 I am sure that Members who represent constituencies in Northern Ireland will agree that there is now confidence in the legal system right across the communities. Of course I take account of the statement that the Human Rights Commission made earlier this year, but I take particular account of the advice from Lord Carlile, the independent assessor who has considered these matters in great detail. We want to look very carefully at what happens in future in every respect and monitor the progress that has occurred over recent years. The number of Diplock trials is now so small that some of the hon. Lady&#039;s concerns no longer apply.

Why cannot the statement made by General John de Chastelain and the two witnesses be made more transparent not only to the people of Northern Ireland but to the people of this country, who believe that Sinn Fein-IRA may be merely playing a waiting game to see whether it can gain more of what it wants by doing what it has done, but that that was not a complete decommissioning of its arsenal?

 The Secretary of State must clarify the issue, which is crucial and impinges on other provisions in the Bill. I am sorry if Democratic Unionist party Members are exasperated, but the matter requires clarification. Under the Bill, breaches of control orders, which have been available in Northern Ireland since spring this year, will be regarded as scheduled offences and will be tried by Diplock courts. Control orders have   recently been introduced throughout the United Kingdom to deal with international terrorists and, presumably, domestic terrorism, too.

But normalisation can only occur if the conditions are right, and we will not take chances with the safety of the people of Northern Ireland or the effective operation of the justice system.

In addition, earlier this year, we had that appalling murder in the centre of Belfast, in which it seems that the forensic clean-up operation was carried out by people who had knowledge of what needed to be done to stop the police having any clues as to the perpetrators. Certainly, a great deal of comment has come from people living in that area to the effect that known members of the Provisional IRA were behind that clean-up operation. Of course, people in that republican bar who witnessed the murder have been very reluctant to come forward, and I have yet to hear the leaders of provisional Sinn Fein urge their supporters who have information about murder or other serious crime to come forward with that to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or the courts so that people can be brought to justice.

He has known for a long time, as did his predecessor, that part VII would have to be replaced by February 2006, so I suspect that a review of some sort must have taken place in the Northern Ireland Office. I wonder whether, sitting in a pending tray at Hillsborough, there are revised proposals that are ready to be made if and when that proves necessary, or do the Government have in mind relying on powers incorporated into United

For example, does the Secretary of State expect the powers in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 that allow for non-jury trials in cases of possible jury tampering to be applied after 2007 or 2008 to Northern Ireland for the sort of cases that we have been debating?

<p><a name="st_58"><a name="51031-10_spnew4"><b> Lady Hermon </b> 
: Since the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party has shown a notable reluctance in the House to support any Government legislation that removes juries from trials, can he confirm for the record that, if the Secretary of State were to opt for that, he and his colleagues would fully support the use of non-jury trials in Northern Ireland under the procedures already available in Northern Ireland&#151;they came into force last year&#151;under the Criminal Justice Act 2003?
</p>





<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51031-10_spnew5"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 I see no problem in principle with that. The position of my party has always been that we regard jury trial in all parts of the United Kingdom as an important liberty that we would wish to see suspended only in the most exceptional circumstances, which was why, throughout the duration of emergency powers legislation, those powers were subject to regular renewal by Parliament. We have taken issue with the Government over recent counter-terrorist legislation that proposed removing the right of trial by jury not for fear that the jury would be tampered with or subject to intimidation, but for other reasons that they gave to   justify that.

</p>





<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51031-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 We should extend the powers if that is   necessary to provide the protection that is needed by the people of Northern Ireland against intimidation and   violence. I endorse completely the Secretary of State&#039;s comments that defending the right of the people of Northern Ireland to live secure lives, free from threat, should be the first priority of any Government and   any   legislation. The combination of time limits, the requirement for regular parliamentary renewal of powers and the certificating-out procedure has provided flexibility in the application of these powers to particular cases. The Secretary of State said that we have seen a steady reduction in the number of cases in which it was considered necessary and appropriate to have the case tried before a judge sitting alone.

<a name="stpa_48">Lord Carlile expressed concern about delays in the processing of scheduled offences. In his last report he said that that was taking longer in 2004 than in 2000, even though there were significantly fewer such cases to be processed. I hope that the Minister will be able to say whether the situation has now improved and, if not, whether the Government are considering the use of powers under sections 72 and 73 of part VII to make statutory regulations to impose time limits on those cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_49">I have a question about the private security industry. In England and Wales, the system relies on enhanced criminal records checks, which include not just information about convictions but details of police intelligence about the individuals concerned. The reason for the different approach in Northern Ireland, and as seen in the Bill, is that successive Governments have worried about the prospect of people from a paramilitary background being in receipt of evidence about police intelligence held against them, including, obviously, details of the informer who may have provided the police with that intelligence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_50">Do the Government think it likely, or even possible, that in the foreseeable future we will be in a position where we could allow the disclosure of police intelligence to people being vetted for a post in the private security industry in Northern Ireland? Does not that again suggest that some type of arrangement unique to Northern Ireland will continue to be needed after 2008?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-10_para12">
<a name="stpa_51">Do we need the powers brought in after the Omagh   bombing under which the opinion of a senior police officer is admissible as evidence in respect of   membership of a specified organisation? My understanding is that, in practice, this power has never been used. As the Secretary of State knows, my party has always been uneasy about the idea of specification, whereby we have two categories of illegal terrorist organisations. In one category, specified organisations, the word of the police counts as evidence of membership. In the other category, non-specified but proscribed organisations, police evidence does not count in the same way. I hope that the Minister will say a word or two about that.

 It is more than two years since I was given the opportunity to speak on Northern Ireland matters before the House.

I pay tribute to the excellent job that he did and to the commitment that he brought to all his ministerial posts. I also pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). He was an excellent Secretary of State who was respected by Members in all parts of this House, and by all parties involved in Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_55">This could well be an historic moment. I say that   cautiously, because historic moments in Northern Ireland history often turn out to be no more than a footnote. In this regard, I think of the great example of the Sunningdale agreement; none the less, this could prove to be such a moment. The measures contained in the Bill and in part VII of the Terrorism Act 2000 have been renewed annually since the early 1970s, and today

<br>&nbsp;<br>could be the very last time that we renew such powers in a debate on the Floor of the House. If so, everyone involved in Northern Ireland matters, and everyone in Northern Ireland, should celebrate. Of course, it remains to be seen whether primary legislation will have to be introduced in 2008 to enact further measures. I   share the Government&#039;s hope that that will not be necessary.

<p>
<a name="51031-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_56">I hope that the IRA statement of 28 July announcing the end of its armed campaign will turn out to be an historic moment rather than a footnote. I fully understand why the Unionist parties and their supporters are cynical and sceptical about such announcements, but if in 1995 the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) had foreseen that the IRA would make such an announcement, with an international body overseeing and verifying that decommissioning had taken place, I cannot believe that   his reaction would have been anything other than euphoric. Some suspicion arises from the fact that the 1998 Belfast agreement committed the IRA to decommissioning entirely by May 2000. If what has taken place over the summer and in the past month had happened in April and May 2000, a great deal of the understandable cynicism and suspicion in the Unionist community would have been prevented. We all expected and hoped that the IRA would decommission to the extent that it seems to have now&#151;unfortunately, five years too late.

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51031-11_spnew5"><b> Lady Hermon </b> 
: May I firmly but gently remind the hon. Gentleman that great offence was caused by the long-awaited statement on 28 July, in which the IRA claimed that its campaign was legitimate? There was no word of apology at all, which caused great offence not just across the Unionist Protestant community but among all families, whether Catholic or of no faith at all, whose relatives had been murdered by members of the IRA. There was not a word of regret, so if the hon. Gentleman thought that we would all jump up and down on 28 July we certainly did not.

<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51031-11_spnew6"><b> Mr. Harris: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is quite correct. She has been present in the House when I have said on more than one occasion that the decommissioning of weapons should not be regarded as a concession but as a basic minimum requirement of any party that hopes to be taken seriously in the democratic process. I agree with what she said.

<a name="51031-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_57">Throughout the debate, especially since 1997 to 1998, there has been an almost unspoken threat or intimidation when dealing with paramilitaries on both sides. The suggestion was that we ought to make political progress because if we did not X, Y and Z might   return to violence. I do not accept that any of the so-called concessions by the Government are based on that threat but, nevertheless, the debate on Northern Ireland has been conducted under a thinly veiled threat of a return to violence by the main paramilitaries. If that is indeed the case, it must end now. There is no longer any excuse for suggesting that political progress must be achieved at the end of a barrel. The hon.

 I am certainly not suggesting that the IRA, with its current structure, could be maintained in a democratic Northern Ireland. I know that it has been mooted that it could become some kind of veterans&#039; society or similar social organisation.

One cannot be in government as a law maker and not support those who are tasked with upholding the law. That is the crucial issue, because if Sinn Fein do that, what need has the IRA to exist?

That is the minimum that should be expected and anything that   gets in the way of that and acts as a buffer between the nationalist community and the police must not be tolerated. I am on the record as saying that I hope that   the IRA disbands, but I hope&#151;no, I demand&#151;that whatever form it takes in the future it must not in any way interfere with the rule of law, as represented by the PSNI.

I remind the hon. Lady that throughout the whole period from 1999 when Sinn Fein Members of the   Northern Ireland Assembly were receiving their allowances, section 7 powers were in force. There is thus no contradiction in the Government&#039;s policy to give back those allowances to Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland.

Last December, there was a serious bank robbery and two families were held under threat of violence. On the back of an IMC report and its recommendation to the Government, which the Government upheld, the financial penalty to Sinn Fein was to last 12 months.

I am frustrated when debates are defined by language that, whether deliberately intended to or not, causes anxiety in a particular part of the community. For instance, why must every advance be described as a concession or a surrender? Progress in Northern Ireland cannot and should not be measured by assuming that every development of the peace process can be described as a concession, a snub or a gain in a column headed Unionist or nationalist.

At the time, I   welcomed the fact that those measures were to be in place for only five years and subject to renewal by Parliament by statutory instrument every 12 months. I   have served on every committee that debated the annual review of those sections of the Act. That review was important because Parliament had to have the ability to consider the provisions regularly and to make its own judgment of the situation in Northern Ireland and of whether those provisions remained necessary.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Indeed, in my judgment his work has underpinned much of the guidance that the Government have used to make their decisions subsequently. His work has been invaluable&#151;not just because he happens to be the former Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire. Unfortunately, given the time frame needed to place the Bill on to the statute book before the provisions run out in February, we are not able to see his deliberations on the operation of part VII of the 2000 Act in the current year, but I shall look very closely at his latest report when it is published. In that sense, it was very important that we had access to the letter that has subsequently been shared with those hon. Members who are in the Chamber today.

As we have already discussed, there is provision in the Bill for the sections that are then in force to continue, but no later than 1 August 2008&#151;again, with specific parliamentary approval by statutory instrument. I understand that that can be achieved only by positive affirmation in the Commons and in another place, and I see the Minister nodding on that score. Lord Carlile welcomes that check, and I think that it is important, too, because Parliament simply must be able to look regularly and closely at whether such measures are indeed necessary in Northern Ireland.

<a name="stpa_65">Of course I had hoped, as probably everyone had hoped in 2000, that we would have made sufficient progress in the long march towards peace and the   normalisation of the Province to make part VII irrelevant at some point during the five-year lifetime that was placed on it. Although some progress has been made in recent weeks particularly, there has been such turmoil in the intervening years that the provisions of part VII are evidently still necessary. Although the IRA statement in July and the subsequent decommissioning of IRA weapons were significant events, they took a long time to happen. It is five and a half years after all paramilitary activities were meant to have come to an end, and seven and a half years since the signing of the Good Friday agreement. In fact, that very delay has meant that we find ourselves debating part VII again.

The signs from the latest IMC report are encouraging and I look forward to its next report in January, but I feel that the jury is still out on the long term. Until recently, similar progress has not been made in relation to loyalist violence or dissident republicans. The violence that we saw over the summer was truly horrific, and the loyalist paramilitaries demonstrated in no uncertain terms why it is necessary for part VII of the 2000 Act to remain in force.

 The hon. Gentleman is completely right    to put that on record. People who live on the mainland of the United Kingdom sometimes do not recognise that an underlying level of violence continues   in republican and loyalist communities. Normalisation in the Province cannot simply be achieved by violence disappearing from news reports. Violence must disappear on the ground in the Province and true lawful behaviour must be introduced.

<a name="stpa_69">I am especially pleased that the Government do not wish to resurrect sections 70 and 71 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which were repealed earlier this year. Those provisions allowed the Secretary of State to make directions for young persons charged with a scheduled offence to be held in adult prisons while on remand. The powers come from a time when young persons were held in remand homes. Those homes were insecure and serious problems were presented in the management of some of their remand population. Thankfully, there have been great advances in the youth justice system in Northern Ireland over recent years and Hydebank young offenders centre and the juvenile justice centre are now able to provide the security required. Those developments are welcome and the Government are right to ensure that those sections do not return to the statute book.

That section makes provisions on evidence that may lead a court to conclude that a section 11 offence&#151;membership of a proscribed organisation&#151;has been committed. Subsections (2) and (3) of section 108 render admissible under a section 11 charge hearsay evidence that would not otherwise be admissible. The evidence must be given orally by a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent. If it is the opinion of that officer that the accused belongs to an organisation that is specified, the statement &quot;shall be admissible&quot; as evidence of the matter stated.

 If I were a parliamentary representative in the south of Ireland, I would be making exactly the   same point. The provision simply does not stand up   to scrutiny both of its practical benefit, on which Lord Carlile has commented, and of its principle of diluting the burden of proof when someone is charged with such a serious offence. How can the soon-to-be right hon. Gentleman and the Minister justify keeping the section in force when Lord Carlile of Berriew, who has been listened to in almost every other respect and has successfully advised the Government, has said that it should be repealed? As we do not have Lord Carlile&#039;s assessment of the use of the section in full during the course of the year, will the Minister tell us of any instances when it has been used in the past 12 months, because I have yet to hear that evidence?

<a name="stpa_73">In February&#039;s debate to renew part VII provisions, my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) raised concerns about section 75, which provides for non-jury trial in Northern Ireland&#151;a Diplock trial. Although it is fair to recognise Lord   Carlile&#039;s assessment that Northern Ireland judges apply rigorous standards to the quality of evidence in non-jury trials, he recommended in his last report that   the Government should consider moving from employing one judge in non-jury trials to a three-judge court. He states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;A three judge court would command greater confidence in one part of the community, without diminishing confidence rationally elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_74">As part of the normalisation process in Northern Ireland, we have to move in that direction. We would all prefer it if the circumstances allowed us to return to full jury trials in Northern Ireland, but without pre-empting what might be in my noble Friend&#039;s report in the coming   months, I suspect that we are not there yet. A three-judge court would demonstrate that we are moving towards the restoration of a normal judicial process in Northern Ireland. What discussions have taken place since February to move the situation on? Are the Government considering how we can make progress on that crucial issue?

<a name="51031-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_75">The Secretary of State made encouraging noises about considering the issue, at least in the broader context.

<a name="stpa_77">Despite concerns about specific sections, it is important to ensure that part VII provisions remain in force for the time being. However, I shall study with the greatest interest and in detail the next IMC report and Lord Carlile&#039;s report.

<p>
<a name="51031-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_78">There is one irony that cannot go unmentioned, however. The Bill is in large part based on the historical and political experience of the Province and is thus in keeping with a mature understanding of the motivations of the terrorists, as well as the reality of terrorist acts. Let us remember the reason for the Bill. The 2000 Act tidied up and extended previous counter-terrorism legislation and put counter-terrorism laws on a permanent footing. It was intended to combat all forms of terrorism, not just terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland. It provides a range of measures designed to prevent terrorism, supports the investigation of terrorist crime and extends UK-wide.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_79">Why have the Government failed to understand the contradiction between the judgments they make about Northern Ireland, which can lead to informed and consensual solutions, such as this Bill, and the unjoined-up approach that they take to international terrorism as a whole? Why is it that the very things that bring us together on this Bill should not have counted one jot in the many terrorist debates and Bills that have been thrown at us in recent weeks in the international context? Why is it that right hon. and hon. Members can talk rationally about these things in the Members&#039; Tea Room and agree that there is an inconsistency between how we deal with Northern Ireland terrorism and international terrorism, and yet we are presented with a malignant, aggressive and unlistening Government when it comes to tackling terrorism in the rest of the UK?

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="51031-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Tom Harris: </b> 
 Rubbish.

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="51031-13_spnew3"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 In that case, will the hon. Gentleman explain why so many hon. Members in these debates feel that the Government somehow differentiate good and sane terrorists in Northern Ireland, but bad and insane terrorists from elsewhere? How can it be consistent to deal with the Northern Ireland terrorist while simply seeking to oppress the opportunities to terrorise everywhere else? I must ask why the Government are obsessed with negotiating on problems in Northern Ireland&#151;on many occasions I agree with them&#151;but simply seek to incarcerate suspected terrorists on the mainland using some of the very worst historical methods, such as internment, perhaps only by another name?
</p>





<p><a name="st_91"><a name="51031-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Harris: </b> 
 I had not intended to intervene and I shall try not to stray too much from the purpose of the debate, but the hon. Gentleman has been present at enough of these debates to understand the valid argument that, as far as republican terrorism is concerned, there was always a way to negotiate, in that they held various political views, which even if one did not agree with them, one could negotiate on; whereas 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 652</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with other types of terrorism, such as Islamism, there is no negotiation, since the death of innocent people is the end aim of those terrorists, and therefore there is no point in negotiating.
</p>





<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51031-13_spnew5"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments simply serve to underline the frustration that many of us feel about the Government&#039;s approach towards the issue: the schizophrenic assumption that the terrorists of Northern Ireland are in some way different from the terrorists from elsewhere. In essence, if what the hon.   Gentleman says is correct, we must draw the conclusion that he believes that the terrorists in Northern Ireland were in some way motivated, while the terrorists who perpetrate their international war of terror, to use the Government&#039;s own phrase, have no motive. What frustrates those of us who have sought to participate proactively in both those debates is the fact that there can be no such rational distinction. Our frustration has been compounded by the fact that on occasion the Government have sought to make unilateral deals with Sinn Fein and, indirectly, with the IRA, while those people who have been supportive of the peace process have been virtually ignored. The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) made that point very well, and it is a matter of great annoyance to those of us who have sought the peaceful and democratic route that those who have not been peaceful have been treated in a different way.
</p>





<p><a name="st_93"><a name="51031-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a prime example of this differentiation that the Government make is the anticipated legislation on &quot;on   the runs&quot;, when the Government propose to give a de facto amnesty to terrorists, some of whom have committed the most atrocious crimes in Northern Ireland, and that it is very difficult for the layman to understand how one can make that distinction, no matter how nuanced the arguments may be?
</p>





<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51031-13_spnew7"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman gives one example of many that at times serve to undermine our confidence that the Government have a joined-up understanding of the problems of terrorism. I happen to believe that terrorists are on the whole motivated, and that it is the failure of politicians to understand those motivations that causes such a disparity of behaviour in what we have seen in Northern Ireland and what we have seen elsewhere. The suffering of the Province is a record of what results from the ignorance of prejudice and the consequence when politics fails to listen to the causes. At a time when we seem at last to have learned the lessons from that lethal tragedy in one place, how depressing it is to see the very same calamity repeated in our treatment of the very same set of affairs in regard to the terrorist threat from abroad.

<a name="stpa_80">As the Minister said earlier, the powers in the Bill are exceptional and time limited. In Northern Ireland it   took 30 years&#151;some would say hundreds of years&#151;for us to find the courage to attend to the underlying   motivations of the terrorists that now lead us to time-limit regulations and legislation that is hopefully now at the tail end of the troubles that have bedevilled the Province. How many more years will it take for us and the Government to learn the same lessons for the rest of the world? Why is it so hard to see

 Answering that in detail would take us way beyond the remit of the Bill. The hon.

She is using the same terminology as we used in the years when the Government said that the terrorists of Northern Ireland simply could not be negotiated with&#151;that they were mindless psychopaths and barbarians. I am happy to discuss the question with her if she is asking it seriously, but we would be best advised to do so outside the Chamber.

<a name="stpa_81">This Bill is helpful in the narrow context of Northern Ireland.

However, I quibble with his saying that the joint declaration was generally endorsed by all the pro-agreement parties. Although there was general endorsement of some aspects of it, some of us had specific criticisms of other aspects. Some of us never went along with the pretence about having three annexes and two other documents that happened to coincide with them&#151;one about on-the-runs and the other about sanctions that would be attached to the   Independent Monitoring Commission. We never went along with the pretence that those documents were not annexes. In the all the talks before, during and since the Hillsborough talks on the joint declaration, including the talks in Leeds castle to which the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev.

Some people make a big deal about calling on others to go to the police or the police ombudsman with statements, but such statements say little and many are not signed. The real issue in Northern Ireland with the administration of justice is not the difference between a Diplock court and a jury court but whether the evidence exists to take cases forward and whether people engage in conspiracies to deny, destroy and prevent evidence.

We cannot debate the question of Diplock courts versus jury trial without taking account of that unfortunate reality.

I have no objection to the woman who has been appointed as victims commissioner, but I remind the Government that a proposal stands in the joint declaration for a forum for victims and survivors. That could give comfort to all victims and survivors and, indeed, the whole community. It could work well with the new office of a victims commissioner and I am sure that the victims commissioner would work well with such a forum.

 The hon. Gentleman can hardly blame Unionists for seeking to extract from the Government movement on key issues such as the victims commissioner. He will understand how we have felt for years when we stood on the sidelines and watched his party go not to the British Government but the Irish Government and, through them, extract concession after concession to fulfil their political agenda. We therefore take with a pinch of salt his comments about the victims commissioner. Everyone is at it in Northern Ireland, so why should not the Unionists?

 Not everyone in Northern Ireland is at it. Some of us have said all along that the process should always be undertaken inclusively and that, as far as possible, all parties should hear the same thing at the same time in the same terms. That would reduce an awful lot of resentment and suspicion. The hon. Gentleman gave the game away, because he said that he is now happy to play the politics of concession of the week. The DUP is happy to claim its concession of the   victims commissioner from last week, so we do handstands about that, but there will be head staggers next week when the on-the-runs legislation appears. That is no way to run a peace process or build confidence.

 I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s references to inclusivity. He claims that everyone should   hear the same thing at the same time. Yet when   President Bush visited Northern Ireland, the hon. Gentleman and his party colleagues argued vociferously that the only party to be excluded from the talks should be the DUP, even though we represented the majority of Unionism. He supported and argued for that. Why, therefore, does he argue for inclusivity today?

 The hon. Gentleman is wrong: I   supported no such thing. The American consulate and others will confirm what my advice was. My first advice was that President Bush would be better off not coming and that we would be better off if he did not come. President Bush was fair enough to acknowledge that that advice was honest and straight. My advice was also that every party should be invited to see him. I did not see why the Democratic Unionist party should be given the dubious privilege of not having to make a decision at such an uncomfortable time&#151;

<p><a name="st_116"><a name="51031-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. Christopher Fraser  (South-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
 I rise to speak after some first-class contributions by people who know far more about this subject than I do. My hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), my colleague on the Select Committee, has articulated the way forward given the issues facing us in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_130">For the past 30 years, the situation in Northern Ireland has rightly evoked strong emotions among all the parties involved, but we have now reached an important turning point, and we should do all that we can to encourage the process to achieve a peaceful resolution. Over the past decade, the threat of terrorism has greatly diminished. I, too, welcome the IRA statement of July and the report by the Independent Monitoring Commission in October that showed that   progress had been made. A &quot;permanent and irreversible&quot; shift away from violence by paramilitary organisations is the only way in which we can create the &quot;enabling environment&quot; needed for sustainable peace. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr.   Lidington) said, the IRA must cease to engage in all forms of organised crime and other criminal activity. It must also accept the legitimacy of the police and the criminal justice systems in the north and the south, and encourage full co-operation with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_131">The measures in the Bill, while enforcing the provisions of part VII of the Terrorism Act 2000, pave the way for &quot;normalisation&quot;, as many right hon. and hon. Members have pointed out. However, we must not allow that process to begin while paramilitary groups such as the IRA maintain a blatant disrespect for law   and order. It is important that we do not rush into the process without careful consideration of the consequences should the IRA go back on its word. Decisions such as dismantling security installations and watchtowers, dismantling the service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and reducing the permanent garrison in the Province by half to 5,000 should be reviewed after a period of time. The IMC concluded that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;clearly we are looking for cumulative indications of changes in behaviour over a more sustained period of time&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_132">Can the Secretary of State tell us what a &quot;sustained period of time&quot; is? We must take into account the fact that the troubles in Northern Ireland have been going 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 666</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on for over 30 years. As much as we want to accelerate the peace process, perhaps we should adopt a patient approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_133">It is important to address the issue of loyalist paramilitaries. Much has been made of IRA decommissioning and yet, as the IMC confirmed, the threat from loyalist paramilitary organisations remains serious. If we can take anything from the events of   recent years it is that we cannot be complacent about   any threat of terrorism from any quarter. Like   many others, I watched with disgust the recent violence and   disruption on the streets of Belfast following the re-routing of a contentious Orange Order march. It was not, as one would presume, violence instigated by republican organisations. Instead, loyalist paramilitaries attacked our country&#039;s police and Army. That is not to be tolerated, especially as it is perpetrated by people who claim to be loyal to the United Kingdom. Loyalist organisations are responsible for more violent attacks than republican organisations, and over the past six months the margin of difference has grown even wider. I call upon the Government urgently to address the current Unionist disaffection with the process. It is imperative that everyone is included and works together. 
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_134">I am gravely concerned about the fact that there has been little constructive discussion of the process beyond the two-year normalisation period. I hope that the Secretary of State has taken on board hon. Members&#039; concerns about the transition from Diplock courts to trial by jury, and that he will consider that carefully. A clear timetable of action communicated to the parties involved would ensure that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_135">It cannot be denied that the Bill is an essential part of the final &quot;enabling environment&quot;, and I support its measures. It would be irresponsible to allow the provisions in part VII of the Terrorism Act 2000 to lapse without sufficient safeguards in their place and the Bill will continue to make such provision. The additional powers for the Attorney General of Northern Ireland are important in helping us to distinguish between offences under criminal law and offences under terrorism laws, which may prove significant in measuring the success of the IRA statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_136">Finally, will the Secretary of State consider carefully the points that we have made this evening? I am sure that Members on both sides of the House will show their support for the Bill and for any sensible measures that will finally allow the people of Northern Ireland to live in a country that is no longer threatened by terrorism or violence.

<p><a name="st_117"><a name="51031-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Nigel Dodds  (Belfast, North) (DUP):</b> 
 May I begin by referring to terrorist and paramilitary developments in Northern Ireland in recent days, following statements by a number of churchmen and others about the loyalist feud and by the Loyalist Volunteer Force about its position? As hon. Members have said, those statements have been welcomed, not least in my north Belfast constituency and in the constituencies of my hon. Friends, which have borne the brunt of a vicious campaign both over the summer and previously. Internecine violence has not just inflicted pain, injury, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 667</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hurt and death on the individuals concerned, but has caused widespread community dislocation and the removal of families from homes and society. Progress to end such violence with statements from paramilitary organisations such as the one by the LVF at the weekend is therefore welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_137">I want to put on record my gratitude to everyone involved in that difficult and challenging behind-the-scenes work. Just as we have made it clear in relation to the IRA that action is what counts, not words, so it is in relation to the LVF and the loyalist paramilitaries. My hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) referred to Brid Rodgers from Upper Bann, who said that people had many concerns about the LVF statement. Unionists have expressed the same concerns and doubts about IRA statements on behalf of the people whom we represent, but we are often castigated and derided for doing so. We have been told that we should take the IRA at its word, but the former Member for Upper Bann, Mr. David Trimble, took the IRA at its word&#151;he was urged by both sides of the House to do so&#151;and we know where that got us. Three times IRA-Sinn Fein were admitted into government, but on each occasion they exposed their true nature.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_138">We hope that the LVF means what it says. We do not equivocate about loyalist paramilitaries: we want to see them disband and disappear in the same way as republican paramilitaries should disband and disappear. People in all our communities should be   allowed to get on with their lives without paramilitarism&#039;s coercive effects. We have seen the dreadful effects of paramilitarism in the areas that we represent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_139">We will support the Government in terms of the Bill, because it is a sensible approach. Unfortunately, we cannot often say that about the Government&#039;s approach to issues affecting Northern Ireland, especially in the past few months. The watchword for this debate is caution, and several hon. Members have stressed the importance of caution as we move forward, especially in relation to the criminal justice system. They have rightly stressed the need to be very careful before we remove from the statute book important legislative provisions to combat terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_140">In his opening remarks, the Secretary of State said that it was vital to have a prudent safety mechanism in place, that we needed a measured approach and that we must not take chances with the safety and security of the people of Northern Ireland. Those are indeed correct sentiments to express when dealing with important issues affecting the safety and security of the people of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_141">I hope that the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) will not press the matter to a Division. He indicated reservations about the Bill, but I do not know whether he intends to try to divide the House. I noted what he said about sentencing and the concerns about some of the sentences handed down by judges. I have to say that similar concerns have been expressed about several cases in which people have felt that their families have not received the justice that they should have   received, because offenders have not received appropriate sentences. I remind the hon. Gentleman that it does not matter whether sentence is passed by a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 668</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Diplock court or a non-Diplock court, because sentencing is entirely a matter for the judge in either case. Whether a jury is involved in the determination of guilt or not, the issue of sentencing is for the judge only. The argument on sentencing does not therefore rule out support for the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_142">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the concern that evidence was prevented from coming before the courts, be they Diplock or non-Diplock, and he mentioned the   murder of Robert McCartney. We have seen the campaign on that case, which has resulted in the   McCartney relatives having to leave the Short Strand area without&#151;I am sad to say&#151;any real prospect of justice being done. That sort of conspiracy, which is sometimes covert and sometimes much more overt, is one of the reasons why it is still important to have the Diplock court mechanism in place. The sort of people who have carried out the campaign against the McCartney family could easily mount a similar campaign against potential jurors. That should cause hon. Members to support the Bill tonight, not to oppose it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_143">The requirement for caution to be our watchword stands in direct contrast to the headlong rush by the Government on other matters. How can it be right to say that we cannot take risks with the safety and security of the people of Northern Ireland when the Government have rushed to degrade the security along the land frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic, despite the continuing menace and threat from mainstream and dissident republicans? How can it be right to decide to disband the home battalions of the   Royal Irish regiment? I might point out that the members of that battalion heard the news through the   news media, instead of being told in an appropriate and proper fashion. How can it be right to proceed with legislation to provide what is in effect an amnesty for people guilty of some of the most heinous crimes in Northern Ireland? Some of that has been done purely on the basis of IRA words, not actions, and despite the fact that the Government told us that they would judge the IRA&#039;s statement over time, in terms of its actions and not its words. The Government&#039;s actions stand in stark contrast to the pledge given to the people of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_144">Let us consider the Government&#039;s actions in relation to Sean Kelly, a child murderer and a mass murderer who belongs to the Provisional IRA-Sinn Fein movement. When he was first arrested, we were told by the Secretary of State that it was vital that he should be arrested, because of his involvement in terrorism and the danger that he posed to the community at large. Sean Kelly was released on the eve of the IRA statement at the end of July, purely because the Government were told by the IRA-Sinn Fein leadership that it was vital to the IRA making its statement. Such an approach to the people of Northern Ireland by the Government has bred deep cynicism and a total lack of confidence in their willingness to stand by their pledges, to do the proper thing, and to judge the IRA by its actions, not its words.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para15">
<a name="stpa_145">The way in which the Government have behaved has contributed significantly to the lack of confidence in the unionist community and the feeling of one-sidedness to   which the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir   Patrick Cormack) referred. It is intolerable that the Government should rush headlong to make concessions 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 669</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to IRA-Sinn Fein at a time when it is far from being proved that the IRA is committed, permanently and irreversibly, to exclusively peaceful and democratic means.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para16">
<a name="stpa_146">The hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris) asked earlier why unionists talk about concessions, but what else are we to call the blatant release of a mass murderer on to the streets so that the IRA would make its statement the next day? How else can the people we represent see it but as a concession to Sinn Fein-IRA? Sadly, there has been too much of that in recent days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para17">
<a name="stpa_147">It is right to be cautious. The IMC has made it clear that criminality continues on the part of both the IRA and loyalists; there is no indication that it has been brought to an end. It is deeply ingrained in those organisations. An assistant chief constable of the PSNI told me only the other day that criminality was institutionalised in each paramilitary organisation. It is madness to suggest that within a few months Unionists should be asked simply to turn a blind eye to all that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-17_para18">
<a name="stpa_148">In a debate last week, my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) pointed out that the retention of illegally gotten criminal assets and gains from bank robberies and other activities is still a criminal offence and the Minister responding to the debate agreed. There can be no suggestion that everything that happened should be put into the past and that we should turn a blind eye and move forward as if all those things had no impact on people&#039;s confidence and their view of the reality of the situation on the ground in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p><a name="st_118"><a name="51031-18_spnew0"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is unrealistic to think that if organisations, whether the IRA or other paramilitary bodies, remain in being, they will remove themselves from some paramilitary and a lot of criminal activity? The only way for the community to be absolutely certain that it is all over is for those organisations not simply to stand down but to disband.
</p>





<p><a name="st_119"><a name="51031-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Dodds: </b> 
 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, who makes an extremely important point, which was the subject of some exchanges earlier when the hon. Member for Glasgow, South was speaking. He said that we should not get hung up on the issue of disbandment, but some of us made the point that both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Irish Republic and the former leader of the SDLP, John Hume, were seeking disbandment and the dismantling of the criminal structures of the IRA. It is right and proper that that should happen. There has never been any justification for the retention of terrorist structures, so what possible justification can there be for the retention of terrorist structures and for the retention of the IRA as an organisation if, as we are told by Gerry Adams and his friends, the war is over and Unionists have nothing to worry about? That is not a small matter; it is not a matter of semantics. My hon. Friend is right to point out that it is important, so in January and in the weeks and months thereafter, Unionists in Northern Ireland, and indeed the entire community in Northern Ireland&#151;not just Unionists&#151;must make that clear.

<br>&nbsp;<br>sake, don&#039;t let these people who have murdered and tortured us for years and who have been parasites on our communities get away with it. They are transforming themselves from overt terrorists and calling themselves by another name so that they can enforce justice in our community.&quot; For that reason, I entirely agree with the approach taken by the hon. Member for Foyle in his comments on community restorative justice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_150">There is deep concern throughout communities in Belfast, North and other parts of Belfast, and indeed throughout the entire Province, about the notion that although terrorists may not get their hands on the levers of power through Sinn Fein Members becoming Ministers or joint Ministers at Stormont, they may be able to get their hands on the levers of policing and justice locally through community restorative justice programmes and projects. Certainly in republican areas such programmes are being seen as, used as and advertised as an alternative to the normal, regular policing system. There is deep concern, and the Minister must realise that it will cause enormous anger and anguish if there is any suggestion that there would be funding or official sanction or approval for those community restorative justice programmes if they do not fully operate within the normal policing and criminal justice structures, with full co-operation with the police and referrals by statutory agencies and the police, as happens in other civilised countries. To suggest that the sort of programmes that Sinn Fein-IRA are running could be legitimised would cause enormous offence, and would be rejected by the decent people of Northern Ireland, just as the obnoxious proposal for an amnesty for on-the-runs is rejected by decent people across the board.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_151">I again use the mantra of caution to which so many Members have referred. Why do the Government feel   compelled to deliver on that pledge made to Sinn Fein-IRA as part of the joint declaration? The DUP was certainly not party to it. The Government should recognise that circumstances have changed and that parties which, in the words of the Secretary of State, endorsed the joint declaration&#151;the pro-agreement parties&#151;no longer speak for the majority, certainly on the Unionist side. They speak only for a small minority of Unionists in Northern Ireland and the Government should recognise that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_152">I regret the fact that the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) has left the Chamber and is not making a contribution to the debate. She tried to defend her party&#039;s role in the joint declaration, and suggested that there was a difference between being consulted and   what the Secretary of State referred to as the pro-agreement endorsement of the terms of the joint declaration. Even at the time, Ministers described the joint declaration, which includes disbandment of the   home battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment, the run-down in security and the so-called normalisation process and, as an annexe, provisions for an amnesty for on-the-runs, as a shared understanding among the parties. The Government said again today that the   parties endorsed it, but we certainly did not; we opposed it and we continue to do so. We shall not take lectures from the Ulster Unionist party, which has connived with the Government over the years to allow Sinn Fein-IRA into government on so many occasions

The magnificent view from Stormont looking over the city of Belfast will live with me for a long time. It was my first visit to Northern Ireland, despite having a grandmother from there.
</p>

<a name="51031-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_155">My generation grew up thinking that Northern Ireland was somewhere that people would go only if they needed to, so it was wonderful to see now a thriving, vibrant European city that reminded me of my home city&#151;Leeds&#151;and of Manchester, near where I   was born, and of Glasgow, where I spent two happy years. I agree with the conclusion of my hon. Friend who said that we would very much like to take our spouses and families on our next visit. But I also saw first hand for the first time the roads and areas that are known the world over and I found that experience more startling and more revealing than I could have imagined.

<a name="stpa_156">It was not the murals, the bunting, the memorials or even the peace walls, which I was sad to hear are still getting ever higher and longer, that left the most impression on me, but the comments of the helpful official from the Northern Ireland Office. As we turned a corner, he said, &quot;These people are all Catholics.&quot; We turned another corner, he said, &quot;The people at that bus stop are all Protestants.&quot; Indeed, when we turned another corner, we saw a Tesco supermarket, and I   asked, &quot;Are you telling me that only one side of the community goes to that supermarket?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, that is a Protestant Tesco.&quot; Many of us who live on the British mainland have grown up with false assumptions and misunderstandings, and from my own experience, I   know that people need to see some of those things to try even to start to understand them.

<a name="stpa_159">In last week&#039;s debate on the Terrorism Bill&#151;a debate in which I was very pleased to take part&#151;there was much discussion about striking a balance and which liberties we must sacrifice to gain greater protection from terrorism. Although I acknowledge that the balance in the Bill is nearly right, I argue that it is not   quite right. From my limited experience&#151;I acknowledge that it is very limited in Northern Ireland matters&#151;surely balance is everything.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_160">The balance in the Bill is not quite right for two reasons: first, because of what is still there and, secondly, because of what is not there. On what is still there, why has there been no move even to consider the recommendation in the 2004 Carlile report to use three judges in Diplock courts? Surely that would be an important step towards the eventual re-establishment of trial by jury. We fully accept that that is something for the future and that it will be implemented when it can be realistically restored. On what is not in the Bill, section 108 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows the oral evidence of senior police officers to be admissible as evidence about people&#039;s membership of specific organisations. I   concur with Lord Carlile&#039;s conclusion in the 2004 report, which says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;It is a provision that lies uncomfortably in the broader context of normalisation and the Good Friday Agreement.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>without exception, the Government have been very anxious immediately to rush to the fences and say, &quot;This   is a wonderful step&quot;&#151;whether it was an early announcement of semi-permanent ceasefires, the LVF&#039;s initial decommissioning incident, subsequent acts of decommissioning by republican paramilitaries or statements by loyalist paramilitaries. Almost without exception, there has been an immediate, positive response from the Government. For that reason, we should all proceed with caution.

<a name="51031-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_164">The LVF carried out an act of decommissioning some years ago and subsequently carried out many further acts of terrorism and intimidation. All those who greeted the LVF&#039;s initial act of decommissioning with tremendous hope and expectation should have been more cautious when the IRA indicated its intention to   decommission, and whatever acts transpire subsequently&#151;we know not as yet the entirety of them&#151;one would have thought that caution would be the watchword and that people should not rush to acclaim yet another such action.

<a name="stpa_165">I want to refer to the physical manifestations of a readiness to accept the words of paramilitary groups. That is where I take exception and differ with the Government about how they should deal with the words of the terrorist groups. For example, in relation to the Bill, if the Government are saying, &quot;Yes, we should be cautious; yes, we should renew the legislation&quot;, why did they not equally say, when the IRA made its statement on 28 July, &quot;We will wait and see before we remove the watchtowers on the border. We will proceed cautiously. We will go gently. We will go slowly.&quot; But, no, they hastened to remove the watchtowers. They hastened to announce the effective disbandment of the Royal Irish Regiment home service battalions. They hastened on a whole host of other issues in response to an IRA statement, but caution should have been the order of the day for physical manifestations, as it should be with legislation.

<a name="stpa_166">There could be those&#151;I hope that there are not&#151; who say that, because of the statements and decommissioning, we should effectively do away with the legislation in place because the Government could reintroduce measures in future. My response would be that the Government could more easily do that than they could re-erect the border checkpoints, which would take many weeks and months of physical work. However, things that would require more time to put back in place were removed more quickly than the legislation that we are discussing.

<a name="stpa_167">There was much talk over the weekend about the president of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, who made a declaration on television on Friday evening in which he said that he believed that the war was over. He said that he had not said that before. Many Unionists over the past 11 years erroneously called for Gerry Adams to say   that the war was over. I am interested not in what Gerry Adams says, but in what the IRA does. What it   says is of almost no consequence. When it has disappeared and left the stage, with all its arms&#151;both ancient and modern&#151;gone, dismantled and never to return, that will be the point at which the Unionist and the nationalist communities will know that the war is indeed over, not when we hear honeyed words from Gerry Adams.

If the Government are expecting that to happen, I am afraid that they are in for yet more disillusionment and disappointment. Do they think that in 11 weeks the Unionist community will pass judgment despite what it has seen during the failure of the past 11 years? It will take much more time than that. The Government have talked about a working assumption that the IRA has indeed left the stage. It will take more than a working assumption in the next 11 weeks to show that the IRA has indeed vanished.

However, it should not go without comment that, when last year&#039;s allowances were disclosed last week, we saw that Sinn Fein Members claimed &#163;80,000 for their additional costs allowance.

It would be simply intolerable if a victim could have coming to his or her door someone who was involved with the paramilitary group that caused the problem that made her go to the police in the first instance. I hope that the Minister will yet again rule that out entirely and say that it will not be possible, under any circumstances, for the IRA or any paramilitary group&#151;loyalist or republican&#151;to be involved in policing.

Nor do they deserve any thanks because they say, &quot;We are not going to continue our terrorist campaign at this moment. We are no longer going to destroy the lives and scatter the bodies of little children across society, the hills, the streets or the roads of Ulster.&quot; That is the sickening position that we are in&#151;that somehow we are to praise them, to crawl to them and to make them acceptable in our society.

It did not want photographs of that. It was not so sensitive when it allowed the cameras in for other reasons. The Government were happy that the cameras were present when they demolished the watchtowers. They were not as sensitive whenever the troops were taken out and were photographed getting on to the plane. The IRA was not as sensitive about the cameras outside the gates of the prison whenever the IRA terrorists got out as part of the Belfast agreement. It was, however, sensitive when it came to having independent witnesses endorsed by the community and having photographic evidence of the destruction of terrorist weaponry. That is why society in general in Northern Ireland is not jumping up and down but is cynical about what has happened with the IRA.

There is concern that the police do not have sufficient resources and have been denied access to vital intelligence-gathering techniques in bringing successful prosecutions against terrorists in Northern Ireland. We saw a clear example in the robbery of the Northern bank, which was mentioned by   my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Dr.   McCrea). There was a lack of intelligence coming through to the police in advance of that robbery, which has secured a place in history as the largest bank heist ever to take place in the United Kingdom. I am afraid that that lack of intelligence is a direct consequence of some of the changes in policing. It is not that we do not want a normal police service&#151;of course we do&#151;but at times the speed of normalisation runs ahead of the reality on the ground as regards ongoing terrorist activity.

As I said in an intervention on the Secretary of State, the mishandling of the announcement is being compounded by the fact that the soldiers are being kept in the dark about their future and are now being told that it could be January next year before they know what is going to happen in relation to redundancy packages and their options in   terms of remaining in the Army and serving in Northern Ireland. That is unacceptable. I have urged the Secretary of State to see what he can do, and for our part we will see what we can do, to persuade the Secretary of State for Defence to move with more haste on this matter, while ensuring that the right package is offered to the soldiers.

<a name="stpa_189">Policing, which my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) also mentioned, is a crucial issue in Northern Ireland. It would be entirely unacceptable to have in the Government of Northern Ireland a party that still refuses to support the police. I   noted that in a recent interview Martin McGuinness said that it could not be a precondition of restoring the political institutions that Sinn Fein supports the police. Let me make it clear that for us it is a precondition of democracy that it is unacceptable for a party that is in government and is tasked with the responsibility of making and upholding the law to fail to support the forces of law and order. The Government must press home that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_190">I say to the Minister that we do not want to hear about more concessions being made to Sinn Fein on policing. I agree with the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark   Durkan) and his party about the restorative justice scheme that Sinn Fein is pushing. That rings alarm bells right across the community in Northern Ireland, and the Government need to be very careful about how they proceed. If they are going to take the approach of making concessions to Sinn Fein on restorative justice or policing, they need not take it for granted that my party will continue to give support to such changes and sit by on the sidelines doing nothing. If the Government try to buy Sinn Fein&#039;s support for policing through such concessions, they need not assume that my party will continue to participate in policing institutions such as the Policing Board given that policing might be corrupted.

<a name="51031-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_191">The need for this legislation remains because of the ongoing activities of various paramilitary organisations. We do not yet know whether the statement made by the Provisional IRA at the end of July and the subsequent act of decommissioning, whatever that may have been, represent a complete end to the IRA&#039;s violence and criminality. We have rightly approached this issue with caution and scepticism given the manner in which the IRA has acted in the past when it has said one thing and   contradicted its words with actions that are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 682</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>contrary to   the rule of law. That applies, of course, to all paramilitary organisations. We urge all such organisations to move swiftly to declare an end to their violence and criminal activity and to accept that the only way forward in Northern Ireland is the path of peace and democracy. That is our consistent position, and we will continue to urge it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_192">On the restoration of the political institutions, and in particular the Assembly, the Government must understand that we will not be prematurely pushed into government unless we are convinced that everyone involved is committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means, which involves not only our being convinced, but the community that we represent being convinced. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), who will soon be my right hon. Friend, has consistently said&#151;the Prime Minister also said this at the Dispatch Box on an earlier occasion in reply to my hon. Friend&#151;everyone must be satisfied that this time the restoration of the political institutions is for real. That includes the community, who must have sufficient confidence in the process. I regret that the IRA did not go further in its act of decommissioning and go the extra mile by creating transparency, which would have allowed people to see more clearly exactly what happened and how it happened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_193">I agree with the former moderator of the Presbyterian Church, Dr. David McGaughey, about the role of the so-called independent witnesses, the two churchmen, whom he described as &quot;observers&quot; rather than &quot;witnesses&quot;. Whether they are in a court of law or whether they are a character in a television programme, a witness normally provides testimony about what they have seen, but the two churchmen cannot do that, because their agreement with the IRA means that they cannot speak in detail. As Dr. McGaughey said, they   acted as observers rather than witnesses, which we regret. If the IRA had gone further, it would have had a more positive impact on public confidence.

<a name="51031-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_194">I join other hon. Members in welcoming the appointment of Mrs. Bertha Mcdougall as the interim victims commissioner in Northern Ireland. I have known Mrs. Mcdougall for a number of years and worked with her when she chaired the Forgotten Families group, which represents pre-1982 RUC widows. I watched as she campaigned vigorously on behalf of those widows, and she is a good appointment and the right person to fulfil that difficult and challenging role. She will bring personal compassion and understanding to the job, because her husband, who was a RUC reservist, was murdered in Belfast by the Irish National Liberation Army. All hon. Members should welcome her appointment, and we wish her well in her difficult and challenging role. The task will not be easy, and she will undoubtedly have her critics, because it is difficult to deal with a large group of people with different perspectives, many of whom have different views of victimhood.

Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) and I are responsible for liaising with victims groups, which I   have met on a number of occasions.

A victim does not go out in the name of a paramilitary organisation and seek to take

It would be totally unacceptable if the definition of &quot;victimhood&quot; were extended to embrace those who, whichever organisation they were associated with, were engaged in bringing hurt, pain and destruction to lives and property in Northern Ireland. The victims groups have made themselves clear on that point, and I know that they will put that view across to the Government and the new victims commissioner.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_196">I must make another point on behalf of victims in Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State has told us on many occasions that some aspects of the process are at times unpalatable, but that we must accept them because of the direction in which we are moving. The victims have had to accept a lot, and I know that the   Secretary of State visited Lisburn in my constituency last week, where he met members of Families Achieving Change Together and the new victims commissioner. I know that the victims told him about their deep hurt and sense of injustice at things such as the release of the prisoners, the removal of the name, &quot;Royal Ulster Constabulary&quot; and other hurtful concessions. He should not underestimate victims&#039; deep sense of injustice at the proposal that legislation should be introduced to provide terrorists who are on the run with something akin to an amnesty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_197">The proposal to extend concessions to terrorists, whether or not they are IRA terrorists, who have fled the jurisdiction and who are fugitives from justice to allow them to come forward and confess to crime goes against the whole basis of justice. If the Government proceed down that line, they will besmirch justice and democracy in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. They must think carefully about the issue, which is very sensitive and has the potential to create a lot more hurt and pain for those who have suffered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_198">It is one thing to lose one&#039;s loved one and live with years of hurt, pain and grief, but the Government will significantly compound that hurt if they proceed with a proposition that was not part of the Belfast agreement, that has never been voted for or endorsed by anyone in   Northern Ireland and that does not, so far as I   understand it, have the support of any of the democratic parties in Northern Ireland&#151;the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) will correct me if I am wrong. Even the Alliance party opposes that proposition, along with most of civil society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_199">The Government must think carefully. If they believe that the IRA&#039;s campaign of violence and act of decommissioning is over, why are we making this biggest-of-all concessions? The Secretary of State must re-examine the issue, because it will set back political progress in Northern Ireland and damage community confidence. As I have said, this party&#039;s position is that unless people have confidence in the political process, we will not act prematurely and join a Government that does not have the confidence of the people whom we represent. The issue is important, and it has the potential to set back the day when the political institutions are restored, which I regret, because I want to see properly functioning, local, democratic government restored to Northern Ireland, but it will not be at the price of justice for the victims of terrorism. We will vigorously oppose legislation to help terrorists who are on the run, and

We genuinely want to see that happen, but we will not turn a blind eye to the reality that it has not happened on the ground and that it is still some way off. Instead of going down the road of further concessions to try to win the peace, which has not worked in the past, the Government must uphold the principles of democracy and justice in Northern Ireland and make it clear to the terrorists that their violence has no part in Northern Ireland&#039;s future and that the Government will not be tempted to seek to buy off those who have engaged in such violence. Every time they do that, it undermines the role of the democratic parties in Northern Ireland. It undermines the role of the hon.

He   rightly said that there could be no justification for   acts of terrorism on either side of the divide. In a wide-ranging speech, the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) said that members of all political parties who seek to take their seats in government should support the police. It is nonsensical to think that a constitutional party can exist without supporting the police, who are there to enforce the laws that that party will pass.

<a name="51031-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_207">As I have said, it is unfortunate that we need the Bill, but we do need it. People in Northern Ireland want many things, but most of them want to be treated normally. When I last visited Northern Ireland, only last week, I saw the need to go beyond having meetings with the police and political parties, important though that is. I took myself to a hospital, a school and one or two other places, and saw excellent work being carried out. The school system, which for some reason the Government seem intent on dismantling, is achieving very good results&#151;the best in the United Kingdom, I   believe&#151;through grammar schools, and Northern Ireland education in general. Those facts are lost, however, when all we and the media talk about is security. It is important to look beyond that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_208">That said, we must recognise that the security situation in Northern Ireland is still very difficult. According to recent reports, dissident republicans tried to attract disgruntled members of the Provisional IRA following the IRA statement. The Continuity IRA remains

We condemn that violence; indeed, we condemn violence on both sides of the divide. It cannot continue. While it does continue, however, we need the Bill.

It does not mean that we have arrived at security normalisation, but it is necessary to prepare for such a day.

The United Kingdom has some of the strongest and most effective counter-terrorist legislation in the world. We are satisfied that, after the part VII provisions have been repealed, the permanent counter-terrorism powers that apply throughout the UK will be sufficient to deal with any residual threat. However, as my right hon.

<br>&nbsp;<br>comments about the need for even-handedness. We shall endeavour to ensure that all our work reflects that approach. We are grateful for his characteristic and energetic start as Chairman.

<p>
<a name="51031-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_227">The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr.   Fraser), who is a member of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs, raised several issues and we look forward to working with him. We are taking all the steps that we can on normalisation. We take full advice on security matters from the Chief Constable and the General Officer Commanding.
</p>





<p><a name="st_147"><a name="51031-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 The Minister referred a moment ago to the need for even-handedness and sensitivity. He might not be aware that, tomorrow evening in New York, the National Committee on American Foreign Policy is hosting a dinner at which it plans to give a peace award to Gerry Adams for his work with the IRA. Will the Minister assure me that no representative of Her Majesty&#039;s Government will attend that event? Were they to do so, it would demonstrate insensitivity and a lack of even-handedness.
</p>





<p><a name="st_148"><a name="51031-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 I was unaware of the dinner tomorrow night. I believe that such an issue would be a matter for Capitol Hill and not for this Government. However, if I can ascertain anything more for the hon. Gentleman in the next 24 hours, I will.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_228">I would like to thank the hon. Member for Belfast, North for his support for the Bill, which he described as &quot;sensible&quot;. He rightly spoke of the need for caution, as   did other Members, including the hon. Member for East Londonderry. We share that need for caution; we do not want to go ahead in a headlong rush. The hon. Member for Belfast, North and I disagree about the interpretation of the speed of the process. However, we do not disagree about the desire to secure peace in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_229">The hon. Member for East Londonderry raised a number of other issues, including policing in Northern Ireland. He was right to say that policing was central to the future there. Huge progress has been made, and there is more to be made. I agree with him that there is absolutely no place for paramilitaries to take up a place in the PSNI. That position was also firmly set out by Chris Patten in his report a few years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_230">The hon. Member for South Antrim raised a number of issues, and I listened carefully to his impassioned speech. I respect him deeply, and I respect his sincerely held views, although I do not agree with his every interpretation. However, I certainly share his admiration and concern for the McCartney family. Let us be clear that intimidation and the crimes associated with it have no place in the future of Northern Ireland. That is the case irrespective of the quarter from which the intimidation comes, be it dissident republicans or the criminal behaviour of a small but significant number of so-called loyalists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_231">The hon. Member for Lagan Valley made a deeply important speech, particularly referring to the Royal Irish Regiment. We should all recognise that the settlement that I believe and hope we shall be able to announce in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence in the months to come will owe a great deal to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s relentless work on the regiment&#039;s behalf.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_232">A number of issues have been raised in this debate.   One that I have not yet referred to concerns the on-the-runs legislation that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will bring to the House at a later stage. On that, let me say simply one thing. A number of hon. Members have suggested that it might be a form of amnesty. That legislation will in no shape or form be an amnesty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_233">We have to look ahead. The Government are mindful of their responsibilities for the future, but also for the present. The UK has some of the strongest and most effective counter-terrorism legislation in the world. That permanent framework protects the public against all forms of terrorism. It applies, and will continue to apply, equally to Northern Ireland and to the rest of the UK. In contrast, the part VII provisions remain a necessary and proportionate response to the particular security situation that has existed in Northern Ireland for more than 30 years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_234">As the Secretary of State made clear when he opened this debate, there have been significant and historic developments in the past few months. These give rise to a realistic expectation that, within two years, a return to   a normalised security environment might be achieved. At such a stage, the rationale for special security provisions for Northern Ireland would disappear. The Bill enables them to be repealed. However, we are not yet at that point. The initial signs are promising, but the Government will not take risks with the safety of the people of Northern Ireland. It is therefore prudent to retain the part VII provisions until security normalisation has been realised. The Bill allows for that, and I commend it to the House.

<a name="51031-24_time1"><h5>8.7 pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="st_162"><a name="51031-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Henry Bellingham  (North-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
 I thank Mr. Speaker for allowing me this Adjournment debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_236">I want to focus on the Queen Elizabeth hospital in my constituency, and on the West Norfolk primary care trust, and to examine the underfunding of the PCT and the accumulated debt of the hospital, which currently stands at &#163;11 million. I shall also consider the penal usage charge that is being applied to the deficit, which is no more than a fine or penalty. Last July, the chairman and the chief executive of the Queen Elizabeth hospital trust resigned because of the funding problems the trust was facing. That led to what can only be described as a very serious situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_237">I shall start by outlining the wider background to this case. As I have time to do so, I shall go into a little more detail than I would otherwise have done. I returned to the House in 2001 and one of my immediate observations was that I was getting many more letters about the NHS than I did when I was an MP in a previous incarnation up to 1997. That was partly because the expectations of my constituents have been raised, especially by the Government going on and on about all the extra money that is going into the NHS. People are more demanding now and expect higher standards. The majority of the complaints are not against staff but against the system and the administration of the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_238">All MPs have heard their fair share of local NHS stories, but nothing gives rise to greater anger than cancelled operations. I have here a letter from a constituent and I am afraid that it is by no means unique. This constituent was diagnosed with kidney stones on his right and left sides on 20 February 2004. He had to wait until 10 May for a hospital appointment with a consultant. He then had an operation planned for 24 May 2005, nearly a year later. That operation was cancelled and postponed until 27 May, then cancelled and postponed until 3 June, then cancelled and postponed until 23 June, and then cancelled again. There are many reasons why those operations were cancelled, but my constituent&#039;s sense of anger and betrayal must be seen to be believed. To understand it properly, one must examine the correspondence. I am afraid that that case, which I mention because it is probably the worst of the pile of local NHS cases that I   currently have, is by no means unique. There have been many other similar ones. It is not necessarily the fault of the staff but of the system breaking down.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_239">What is happening? The money that the Government are putting into the local NHS is simply not getting   through to patient care. I had a long talk with a well-known local consultant earlier today. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;There are now endless layers of management, monitoring our activities and then counting this activity against Government targets. All the time the clinical coalface is being squeezed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_240">He went on to say that if the extra money going into the NHS actually got through to patient care, we really would have a first-class local NHS. As the Minister will 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 694</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be aware, that is borne out by the recent National Audit Office report, which concluded that productivity in the NHS across the country
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;has declined by 1 per cent. every year since 1997.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_241">It continued:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;managers have been recruited at three times the rate of clinical staff&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_242">That is staggering. According to a recent article in <i>The   Daily Telegraph</i> that I dug out, the increase in salaries for bureaucrats in the NHS equals the sum of NHS deficits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_243">Another cause of some of the problems in my local health service is the primary care trust structure, which does not help at all. As my hon. Friends who represent Norfolk know, we had a Norfolk health authority until about eight years ago, which has been replaced by a large number of local PCTs that are inherently bureaucratic and top-heavy on management, hugely duplicate management layers and are expensive. To the Government&#039;s credit, they have belatedly seen the light and are effectively going back to the old system, with one PCT for Norfolk. Let us consider the waste and accumulated extra costs of those eight years and the inevitable destruction as the PCT system is overhauled, streamlined and reformed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_244">I want to consider the historic underfunding of the health service in west Norfolk. The Queen Elizabeth hospital has fallen behind the other Norfolk hospital trusts. Over the past four years, the average annual compound growth rate for the Norfolk and Norwich university hospital has been 13.2 per cent., that for James Paget, a similarly sized hospital trust covering the eastern end of the county, has been 10.7 per cent., and that for the Queen Elizabeth hospital has been 7.4 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_245">There is no question but that the pressures in west Norfolk have been exacerbated by a big increase in the population of over-65s&#151;a 23 per cent. increase over the   past eight years&#151;who, of course, have more complex medical conditions. There is also a growing population in west Norfolk. In 1997, the population of west Norfolk, which covers the whole of my constituency and a lot of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser), as defined by the NHS guidelines, was 205,000. In 2005, that had increased to 222,000. Furthermore, in 1997, emergency admissions to the Queen Elizabeth hospital were 3,700, whereas in 2005, that figure is predicted to be 8,700. Of course, there are more cars on the roads and more accidents as a consequence. There is also a failure of primary care, with many of my constituents gong to accident and emergency rather than having their problems sorted out in a local surgery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_246">The Queen Elizabeth hospital, however, is doing what it does best: treating patients, many more of them, and providing high standards of health care. But because it is treating more patients and achieving better throughput than ever before, it has a debt of &#163;11 million, the consequences of which I will consider in more detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_247">The West Norfolk primary care trust has been seriously   underfunded for a number of years. This year, it is receiving &#163;15 million less than the target set by the   Department of Health&#039;s Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation. Even though the Minister, Lord   Warner, has promised in a letter that future 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 695</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>increases will be above the national norm, that will still leave the PCT with a deficit of &#163;7.3 million for 2008. I ask the Minister to comment on what his ministerial colleague, Lord Warner, has said, as he will have plenty of time to do so in his wind-up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_248">Let us examine the consequences of that deficit. First, we had the resignations of the chairman and chief executive of the trust in July. I do not know whether having the two key guys resigning is unique, but they were under real pressure, felt completely boxed in by the funding crisis and believed that they had to stand down. It was highly regrettable that they did, because in some ways it made matters worse On the other hand, we now have a clean slate to move forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_249">There have been ward closures. As the Minister will know, because, obviously, he has done his homework, the Elm and Denver wards&#151;both surgery wards&#151;have been amalgamated, and the West Dereham and West Newton wards, both of which were involved with the care of the elderly, have been merged. We have lost 57 beds, and the Queen Elizabeth hospital&#039;s beds per thousand of population ratio was already one of the lowest in the region. There have been no redundancies, but there will be a freeze on recruitment, and there is bound to be an effect on patient care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_250">I am sure that the management of the hospital, to whom I spoke this morning, and the Minister will say that the impact on patient care will be minimal. Closing 57 beds, however, is not good news. The consultants to whom I have spoken are very concerned. They tell me that it will inevitably mean shorter stays, more pressure on patients and staff, a possible dilution of nursing care, and possibly even an impact on waiting lists. In addition, the Arthur Levin day surgery unit will be forced to close for six weeks, adding to pressure on patients. The funding of replacement equipment and repairs to equipment will also be on a very tight budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_251">How do the Government react to all that? A number of letters have come through to me, including one from Lord Warner, who explained in some detail about what was going on and the PCT allocations. He admits that the Department of Health&#039;s Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation predicts that the West Norfolk PCT will still be 3.5 per cent., or more than &#163;7 million under target by 2007&#150;08, but what impact will the reorganisation of the PCTs have on that prediction? The   noble Lord went on to say that all is under control, because more is going into the health service. It is the usual story&#151;more and more money is going in, so we should not be complaining and there should not be problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_252">I wrote to the Prime Minister. He does not always reply to Back Benchers who are not Privy Councillors. He does not necessarily always reply to people who have had a spat with him at Prime Minister&#039;s questions, as I   have, but to be fair to him he wrote me a very nice letter, which began &quot;Dear Henry&quot; and ended &quot;yours, Tony&quot; and which I appreciated. Again, I had the standard line about how much more money is going into the health service and how the position overall is very bright. He also said that the changes taking place locally
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;will mean that the management will need to make tough decisions but, I am sure you will agree, the provision of high-quality healthcare, which meets the needs of local population, will at no stage be compromised.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para18">
<a name="stpa_253">That could be wishful thinking if one looks at what the consultants are saying. Exactly the same tone of letter came from the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton).
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para19">
<a name="stpa_254">Of course I am grateful to Ministers for coming back to me and telling me what is going on. I appreciate that no Minister wants dissatisfied MPs on their own Benches or on the Opposition Benches. Ministers want to do their level best to get all this right. However, the Minister who will reply to the debate must appreciate that we must do our best for our constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para20">
<a name="stpa_255">One reaction from this Government has upset me deeply. Far from writing off the debt, which, as I have illustrated, is no fault of the hospital or its staff, the Government have imposed the usage charge. I am concerned about that. The Government have said that, by March next year, the deficit of the hospital will be &#163;11 million. They are imposing a usage fee on that of 10 per cent., making a total of &#163;1.1 million. They are adding another &#163;500,000, so the total amount is &#163;1.6 million. The hospital will also have to pay 10 per cent. interest if it borrows any money. That seems completely ridiculous. It is unfair. In fact, it is penal.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_256">If the hospital went to a high street bank as a thoroughly reputable, solid organisation, it would surely secure a commercial lending rate of perhaps 1 or 2 per cent. over base. It could go into the eurobond market and borrow at under 4 per cent. but the Government say that, if it borrows money from HMG, it has to pay 10 per cent. interest and it cannot borrow from anyone else. Furthermore, if it has a deficit, it has to pay the 10 per cent. usage charge.

<a name="51031-24_para22">
<a name="stpa_257">Is there a hidden agenda to penalise some NHS unit and trusts? Is there a hidden agenda even to make some of them fail completely? Surely that is the logical conclusion of that system. I hope that the Minister will answer those points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-24_para23">
<a name="stpa_258">As for morale at the hospital, the situation is altogether different. Although precarious, the situation is looking more robust than might otherwise be expected. The staff at the hospital are working very hard in extremely difficult circumstances. I praise them for all they have done to keep everything going and to keep the whole system moving forward. I also praise their professionalism. The hospital has met its access targets, particularly on A and E and outpatients. It has a recovery plan in place, which I am sure the Minister will tell us about, up to March 2008, but there is a feeling of uncertainty. Every successful organisation needs to recruit new people. It needs a flow of new ideas. One of   my concerns with the freeze on recruitment that I   mentioned is on the nursing front.

A lot is happening on the diabetic and community nurses link, on the haematology front and with the new critical care system, which won a national award. A lot is happening on the digital radiology front. I could go on.

 First, I   congratulate the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) on securing this debate and thank him for inviting other Norfolk hon. Members to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 698</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>contribute to it. The debate has more force if the message comes from across the parties and I welcome the approach that he has taken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_268">I endorse all that the hon. Gentleman said about the importance of tackling this problem head on. He has done a lot of work in representing the interests of users of the hospital and I pay tribute to him for that. He spoke about staff morale and it is worth making the point that in an organisation faced with large deficits and change at the top&#151;with the chairman and chief executive leaving in June this year&#151;it is difficult for staff to keep their morale up and to maintain standards of professionalism. Clearly, they have done that and they need to be applauded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_269">Despite the difficult circumstances, they have managed to achieve their out-patient waiting time target three months ahead of schedule and they are either at or close to hitting accident and emergency waiting time targets and should be congratulated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_270">The hon. Gentleman talked about the loss of 57 beds, which is bound to have an impact on patient care. One can look in cold terms at the average stay at the hospital and compare it with others around the country. But if, on an emergency basis, we attempt to cut the number of beds as quickly as the hospital has to do, there is bound to be an impact. The Minister would be wise to acknowledge that that adverse impact is likely to occur. If we lose beds at the current rate, the inevitable consequence, described by the hon. Gentleman, is the cancellation of operations, resulting in a lot of personal anguish for the patient and their family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_271">There is also a wider impact. The hon. Gentleman and I have campaigned on behalf of Wells hospital, which is in the west of my constituency, close to the border with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency. This small cottage hospital closed temporarily in December last year. It is still closed, at least in part because both the local primary care trusts, which both contributed financially to the operation of the hospital, are financially strapped. Inevitably, in trying to get their recovery plans delivered, they face an impossible task when the demand of the local community, rightly, is that that hospital be reopened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_272">The loss of those intermediate beds has an impact in my area and that of the hon. Gentleman. When combined with the loss of 57 beds, including beds for the elderly at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, the overall impact is severe. Wells hospital covers a rural area that is not well served by public transport. It primarily serves an elderly population and patients and relatives will now have to travel much longer distances without the benefit of good public transport. The local community is working towards establishing a charitable trust to reopen and run the hospital. I have spoken to Lord Warner about this proposal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_273">I urge the Minister to do whatever he can to facilitate the much-needed reopening of Wells hospital. Over the years, it has benefited enormously from a very strong local commitment. Inevitably, local people are prepared to raise funds for a small local hospital, and as a result of such efforts, extra money goes into the local health service. When such a hospital is closed down, that local contribution to health services comes to an end. We do not always think about such consequences of the loss of local hospitals, and the Government should take them 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 699</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>seriously into account. Wells is a much-loved hospital and we need it back again. Anything that the Minister can do to facilitate that would be enormously appreciated by the local community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_274">I want to say a word or two about the reorganisation of PCTs, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The Minister himself is not to blame because he was not in post at the time, but anyone looking in from the outside and watching a Government establish PCTs, only to abolish them two years later and set up a new structure, would think that the whole system had gone completely crazy. One can only imagine the amount of money involved in two successive reorganisations. It is acknowledged that the Government have pumped a lot of extra money into the health service, but when people ask, &quot;Where has all the money gone?&quot;, it should be pointed out that reorganisations take their share. Effectively, that is money down the drain. The sooner that we can achieve a stable and permanent structure without further reorganisations, the better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_275">I turn to the usage charge, to which the hon. Gentleman also referred. I entirely understand the importance of financial discipline. A system has to be put in place to ensure that those running local hospital trusts understand that spending beyond their means has consequences. We have new management in place and a recovery plan that has been agreed with the Government, but the Government have imposed an extra fine. On top of what is already a desperate situation, it is ludicrous to have to cope with an extra &#163;1.6 million in loss of funds. I urge the Minister genuinely to look again at the usage charge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_276">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: the deficit faced is bad enough. He and I know from representing our communities that our part of the country, which has a low-wage economy and is very rural, has received less than its fair share of health service funding. Insufficient account has been taken of the ageing population in our county. My constituency has one of the oldest age profiles in the country, and providing health services to such a population is expensive. One cannot simply point the finger of blame at local management and say, &quot;It&#039;s your fault.&quot; We need to look at why the deficit has grown to the extent that it has. Once an historical deficit has been acquired, it is impossible to clear it without impacting on patient services. It is incumbent on the Government to look again at this issue genuinely and sincerely, because the impact on the people whom we collectively serve could be very serious.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_277">I again congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing what is a very important debate. I hope that the Minister will listen and respond constructively, so that we can get through this very difficult situation and give our constituents quality health services with stable funding.

 May I too, compliment my hon. Friend and neighbour the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) on securing this debate? It comes at a time when health care provision in Norfolk is in crisis. We cannot forget that when constituents contact us about such issues, they are doing so in their hour of need. On those

</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_278">May I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to my recent correspondence with the well-respected Swaffham and district pensioners association, which is concerned about the inevitable pressure on beds at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, which serves my constituency? As the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) said, we should not view such problems in isolation, because hospitals and health services in the area serve a large rural community. People are not well off and they suffer in many ways. How do they travel to the hospital or the doctors, and how do they secure the service that they want? We have drawn that issue to the Government&#039;s attention in the past. When people arrive at hospital, they should be confident that it is well funded and well maintained. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk said, people who work in the health service in Norfolk are unsung heroes who work jolly hard in difficult circumstances. It is our duty as their parliamentary representatives to make that point, because when times are hard the tough get going, even though that is not always acknowledged by the   press and the media. I therefore hope that the Government will take my hon. Friend&#039;s observations into account.

<a name="stpa_280">I hope that the Minister can alleviate their concerns. May I also draw his attention to the problem of cutbacks in hospitals in my constituency? At Thetford cottage hospital some clinical services have been withdrawn, and five wards are currently closed. Local people and staff are concerned about the prospect of further cuts, so I hope that the Minister can provide an assurance that they will not be made. There is a great deal of concern about the availability of beds for the long-term elderly sick at Swaffham community hospital. It was full in July, which does not bode well for availability in the winter months when demand could reach a peak. The weather is not as bad as it could be at this time year, but a harsh winter is predicted. Many elderly and vulnerable people in my constituency are worried about the provision of health care, and it is in their hour of need that we ask for an assurance so that everyone in Norfolk who is entitled to use the services that my colleagues and I have raised can go to bed comforted in the knowledge that the Government will ensure that there is a proper provision and financing of health care in Norfolk now and in future.

<p><a name="st_165"><a name="51031-26_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Mr. Liam Byrne): </b> 
 May I congratulate the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) on securing this Adjournment debate on health services in and around his constituency? He takes a keen interest in health matters in Norfolk, and has recently raised health   services in his constituency in parliamentary correspondence, to which the Minister of State, my hon.   Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 701</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>(Ms   Winterton), has already replied. He raised the issue with the Prime Minister, and we debated the financial deficit at the Queen Elizabeth hospital at Health questions last Tuesday. I welcome his balanced view of progress and matters that need to be addressed, and I   hope that I can address almost all his concerns this evening along with those expressed by the hon. Members for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser). If I fail to do so adequately, I hope that they will allow me to write to them to fill in the gaps.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_281">I very much welcome the credit that the hon. Gentlemen gave front-line national health service staff who work in and around their constituencies. They are right that they make the world of difference for many people. Indeed, in some cases, it is literally the difference between life and death. Before I turn to the crucial matters raised this evening, I should be grateful if the House permitted me to set the scene.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_282">The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said that the Government bang on about the additional resources that have gone into the NHS, but we do so because we are very proud of them and the scale of the increase bears a little repetition. Funding of the NHS has increased from &#163;35 billion in 1997&#150;98 to nearly &#163;70 billion in 2004&#150;05, and is set to increase to &#163;92 billion. That is an increase of enormous magnitude. Indeed, if the NHS were a national economy, it would be the 33rd largest in the world and about the size of Portugal. The extra money has brought extra staff, shorter waiting times and enormous advances against big killer diseases. The number of consultants is up by nearly 9,500. The number of registrar group doctors is up by 2,200 on last year alone. The number of GPs has increased by more than 4,000 since 1997. There are more qualified nurses working in the NHS than ever before&#151;an increase of nearly 80,000 since 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_283">As a result, NHS waiting times have fallen massively. The number of people waiting more than 13 weeks for an out-patient appointment has fallen from an enormous and scandalous 340,000 in 1997 to just 35,000 in June last year. In-patient waiting times are also showing enormous improvements. The number of people receiving treatment in hospital has increased by 750,000 to more than 5.5 million and the total number of people waiting has fallen by a quarter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_284">The result is that lives have been saved. The cancer mortality rate in England has fallen by some 12 per cent. since 1995&#150;97. Mortality for circulatory disease in England has fallen by a massive 27 per cent. But this debate is about the future, not the past. Our stance on health care in Norfolk is shaped by our ambition to cut the waiting times from the scandal of a year and a half that we inherited in 1997 to eighteen weeks. That is no empty promise, because it is backed by resources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_285">Hon. Members talked about funding and the distance from target in their constituencies. In 1997, there were enormous gaps between actual funding and the correct level. In February this year, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did an enormous amount to correct that. For the latest allocations round for PCTs, covering the next two years to 2007&#150;08, we have decided to move PCTs more quickly towards their fair share of funds. In 2003&#150;04, some PCTs were as much as 22 per cent. under target. By more aggressively accelerating the funding of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 702</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>those furthest away from target, we will change that over the next few years. In fact, by 2007&#150;08, no PCT will be more than 3.5 per cent. below its fair share.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_286">Hon. Members will, I am sure, admit that such increases have significant effects for Norfolk. For example, North Norfolk PCT will receive an allocation of &#163;143 million&#151;a cash increase of nearly &#163;25 million or 20 per cent. over the next two years. West Norfolk PCT will receive substantial additional funding, representing cash increases of nearly &#163;44 million or more than 25 per cent. over the next two years. That will leave the West Norfolk PCT about 3.5 per cent. under target, but that is a substantial correction to the wild extremes of 1997.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_287">The increases will mean big changes on the ground in Norfolk. The PCTs recently approved the outline case for Cromer hospital, which will see it become the best equipped local hospital serving a rural area. Intermediate care strategies will mean that care is provided closer to home.
</p>





<p><a name="st_166"><a name="51031-26_spnew0"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 The Minister rightly points to the approval in principle at strategic health authority level for Cromer hospital. That is extremely good news. However, there is a concern that because the strategic health authority contributes more than its fair share to the total deficit of the NHS, the whole project could be threatened by the financial situation. Will the Minister give an assurance that that will not happen? As he says, it is an exciting project and it must proceed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_167"><a name="51031-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I hope that I can give the hon. Gentleman an even better reassurance. Funding for his local SHA will rise by about &#163;700 million over the next two or three years, so in the context of a clear manifesto ambition to deliver services that are much more in line with local community needs, taking local community views much more closely into account and, above all, cutting waiting times to just 18 weeks, ambition and money together are the best assurance I can give.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_288">The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk mentioned many unacceptable cases of poor NHS treatment for his constituents. I hope that he would agree that they are, by and large, the exception. The latest figures show that death rates from coronary heart disease and cancer in north Norfolk have fallen by about 20 per cent. and just over 3 per cent. respectively since 1997. That is in no small part due to the extra 5,000 nurses, 827 doctors and 256 GPs across the SHA area. Investment is being made to develop local health services and build new facilities where they are needed. Those initiatives are already delivering real benefits to patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_289">The hon. Gentleman mentioned red tape, but I am sure that he would accept that management costs are lower as a percentage of NHS spending than in 1997. Managers are needed in the health service. The NHS treats 1 million people every 36 hours and is required to prepare for every contingency, from the possibility of pandemic flu to the London bombings in July, so it needs good planners and good managers. Sometimes, we do not give them the credit they deserve.
</p>





<p><a name="st_168"><a name="51031-26_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 I do not want to get into a long debate about management and bureaucracy, but as there is to be a reorganisation of PCTs in Norfolk does 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>31 Oct 2005 : Column 703</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Minister accept that there is significant duplication of management in PCTs that cover quite small areas?   For example, in my area there are finance managers, communications directors and other people doing management jobs, while just over the border in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk there is duplication of many of those aspects of management. That must be improved, but what will be the impact of that reorganisation on the funding targets that the Minister has just set out?
</p>





<p><a name="st_169"><a name="51031-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely important point. Our manifesto was clear not just about the need to keep a tight handle on bureaucratic costs; we set a clear target of cutting &#163;250 million-worth of administrative costs to put back into front-line care. The more important issue is how we ensure that local PCTs are the strongest possible commissioners of health services on behalf of their local communities. We will   not be a country where waiting times for medical treatment are only 18 weeks unless there is strong local commissioning. I think that the hon. Gentleman was involved in consultation about the proposed reorganisation of his local PCT. I understand that proposals are now with the Department and I hope that he will stay involved in the debate as it unfolds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_290">The hon. Member for North Norfolk talked of the need for a stable structure. I second that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_291">It is against the background that I have set out that we must view the situation at Queen Elizabeth hospital, with which I want to deal in a little more detail. As hon. Members know, the reported deficit was &#163;3.1 million in 2004&#150;05 and it is forecast to rise to &#163;11 million at the end of the current financial year. That deficit exists not because the Government have under-invested in health care services, but because each year for several years the trust has reported a small overspend yet failed to tackle the issue head-on. The broader strategic point I want to make to the House is that as we are about to pump another &#163;22 billion into the NHS we must have health managers who are able to balance the books.
</p>





<p><a name="st_170"><a name="51031-26_spnew4"><b> Norman Lamb: </b> 
 Is there not something of a contradiction in what the Minister says? He has already conceded that the area has not had its fair share of funding and that the Government intend to bridge that gap, yet he is now saying that that deficit is not the Government&#039;s fault. Surely there is a connection between the two.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention because we must separate two points: the total money available in the local health economy and the efficacy of the management of local hospital organisations. Sometimes, those two things are not exactly the same, as I hope to underline in the following remarks.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_292">A range of measures show that it is possible to pay back the deficit without having an impact on quality care. In passing, I would tell Swaffham and district pensioners association that plans are in place to ensure that quality care not only continues at its current level but continues to improve.

<a name="stpa_293">Queen Elizabeth hospital management have now introduced a number of commonsense measures to meet their financial targets for this year. The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk mentioned changes to some of the wards. Patients discharged from Dereham ward, as part of a service reconfiguration, are now successfully cared for by far closer partnership working with other agencies, such as social services. There have been no readmissions of those patients, who are now cared for in a far more appropriate way. The hospital has achieved more than &#163;2 million in savings this year from initiatives such as better bed management and discharge processes that lead to a reduction in the number of bed days. It has opened a new operations room to monitor bed management and emergency care that is linked to other rehabilitation and community beds and the East Anglian ambulance trust network, so patients receive far more appropriate care and the discharge process is much faster.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_294">The whole discharge process has been reviewed. Significant work has been undertaken, with the aim of taking inefficiencies out of the current process and reducing the lengths of stay where it is safe to do so. The hon. Members who have taken part in the debate will know that, when compared with other hospitals in the region, elective lengths of stay are about half a day longer and that non-elective stays are about one and a half to two days longer. Of course that will be influenced by the higher than national average proportion of older people in their constituencies, but the number of bed days is greater none the less. In fact, a detailed investigation across all specialities has been produced recently that identifies a number of initiatives that can safely reduce the number of bed days required to almost 20,000 per annum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_295">On further reducing the rate of sickness, last year sickness cost the trust about &#163;4.5 million, and there is a   continuation of existing initiatives to reduce that. Out-patient follow-ups still require attention. Changing practices surrounding follow-ups to reduce out-patient attendances is important because rates of follow-ups for new appointments are higher than average. The introduction of digital imaging will help to save money. At the moment, the trust spends almost &#163;250,000 on film for X-rays. Distributing X-rays electronically will save money. Savings are possible in respect of operations on acute wards because lengths of stay will reduce as a result of more appropriate discharge activities. Finally&#151;although this is not the entire list&#151;payment by results, which is an important reform designed to build on the changes already in place, will help Queen Elizabeth hospital because its reference costs are good.

<a name="51031-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_296">The hon. Member for North Norfolk mentioned Wells hospital and intermediate beds. If he will permit me, I will look into that because I do not have chapter and verse in front of me. In the meantime, I can tell him that the forthcoming White Paper on primary care will put a much stronger emphasis on care closer to home and very much recognise that such things are often important sources of local pride.

<a name="stpa_297">Before I conclude my remarks, I want to deal head-on with the charge that has been levied. Gone are the days when we can simply write off debt. The Department of Health has ensured that there is a great deal of time to allow the trust&#151;in conjunction with the NHS bank and, ultimately, with the Department&#151;to agree a plan to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>manage the cash position for the remainder of the year. The fact is that similar agreements must be reached with other parts of the NHS because solutions to cash problems in local trusts can be managed only by securing cash underspends in other organisations. Overspending must be matched by underspends elsewhere in the NHS. The arrangements we are discussing are intended to provide a strong incentive for the NHS to avoid deficits. The rules have been in place for several years and NHS trusts are well aware of the consequences of running up a deficit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51031-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_298">The administrative device in question is called the surplus incentive scheme. It was introduced in September 2005 and is managed by the NHS bank. Arrangements with NHS trusts or primary care trusts are for individual strategic health authorities to manage. The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk was an adviser to business in a former life, so he understands the concept of the cost of capital well and will, I suspect, have advised people on it. I disagree with his analysis that the rate charged is penal. He will know that the cost of lending reflects the cost of capital, and in this case the charge reflects the cost of capital from within the system. A new management team can rarely quite wipe a slate clean and nor should it be allowed to wipe a balance sheet. A team should be given time to make good a situation that it has been hired to fix, which is why the trust has been given until 2007 to repay the specific part of the deficit.

 Will the Minister indicate whether the rate of charge is the same in all such circumstances, or whether there is discretion? In other words, would it

 The hon. Gentleman raises an extremely important point. If I may, I will look into it to ensure that he gets a full reply. I understand that his question is significant locally.

<a name="stpa_299">The Government believe that with the level of investment going into the national health service, all NHS bodies should be able to plan for and achieve financial balance each and every year. The NHS is a big organisation and although it has been said that bringing its budget in on balance is the equivalent of landing a jumbo jet on a postage stamp, three quarters of trusts are able to do so, and we expect all trusts to be able to do so.

<p><a name="st_174"><a name="51031-27_spnew3"><b> Mr. Fraser: </b> 
 Will the Minister address directly the issues that I raised regarding Thetford cottage hospital and Swaffham community hospital by way of communication to me after the debate?

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of those points. I will indeed write to him   about both matters, which are important locally. I   understand that a community facility recently opened in Swaffham, so I realise that he asks an important question at a time when investment is going into the front line.
