<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41118-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley): </b> 
 As you know, Mr. Speaker, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is unable to attend questions this morning, because she is attending the Anglo-French summit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Subject to the necessary parliamentary procedures, the local flood defence committees in England will be revoked from 1 April 2005.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41118-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his reply, but is he aware that in Essex we have a perfectly good local flood defence committee that is not broken and does not need fixing? Given that recent events in the north-east clearly demonstrate that amorphous regional bodies are unloved and have little popular support, will he review his decision to merge us with Norfolk and Suffolk, and instead allow the Essex local flood defence committee to continue in the foreseeable future?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41118-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I have thought carefully about the changes to the regional flood defence committees. Without doubt, there is general support for moving to a single-tier flood defence committee, and the argument concerns the most appropriate regional scale. Regional structures are, indeed, the most efficient. I know the Essex local flood defence committee very well. The hon. Gentleman brought a delegation to see me, and I have had many connections with its members over the years. I went to Essex and talked to them, so I am familiar with the interest that elected Members in Essex take in their work. I very much hope that that expertise will continue under the new structure. A powerful argument was made to have a single flood defence committee for the Anglian region as a whole. I accept in part the validity 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1450</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument. The region is the only area to be divided into three regional flood defence committees, thus reflecting the point that he made.
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41118-01_spnew2"><b> Hugh Bayley  (City of York)</b> 
 (Lab): May I remind my hon. Friend that after the devastating floods in York in November 2000, the Government came up with substantial additional funding for flood defence? Because of the separate small committees around Yorkshire, however, counterpart funding from the local authorities did not materialise, as some areas did not think that they were at risk of flooding and did not want to contribute. I warmly welcome the steps that the Government have taken to ensure that all areas contribute equally to flood defences. Flood defences serve upland areas, because the water drains away from them through areas that are at risk of flooding.
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41118-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I understand the point that my hon. Friend is making. Indeed, he made it powerfully in the debate about adequate resources for the Yorkshire regional flood defence committee. The changes that we have implemented, including the block grant to the Environment Agency, will address many of the concerns that he has so ably expressed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41118-01_spnew4"><b> Bob Spink  (Castle Point)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Minister pay tribute to Councillor Ray Howard, who is a major player in the Essex flood defence committee? What is his assessment of the effect on flood defences in Castle Point of the additional 4,000 houses that the Government are forcing the town to build?
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41118-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I am more than happy to pay tribute to Ray, whom I have met on a number of occasions. He has enormous experience in flood defence matters and I hope that he continues to make a contribution. As for proposed developments, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware, we have revised planning policy guidance 25, which requires careful assessment of new developments in relation to flood risk. The condition of flood walls, continued investment and potential risks to life and property will feature very strongly in any future planning proposals in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area.

 (Lab): What assistance can my hon. Friend&#039;s Department give with the better co-ordination of activities of highways authorities and water companies in tackling the growing problem, particularly in urban areas, of flash flooding?
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="41118-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Yes, it is a major problem. In the floods of 2000, 40 per cent. of the flooding was from non-river sources and was caused, for example, by blocked drains on highways. The issue is being addressed by the Environment Agency, as well as by the regulator in the periodic review, PR 04. Matters such as sewer flooding are a major concern for many hon. Members on both sides of the House, but I hope that my hon. Friend will take that work into account.

 The annual report of the global atmosphere research programme for 2002&#150;03 outlines research activities on the impacts of climate change. The report is available on the Department&#039;s website, but I will arrange for a copy to be placed in the Library for the benefit of hon. Members.
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41118-01_spnew8"><b> Richard Ottaway: </b> 
 The Government are rightly making climate change a priority of their G8 presidency next year, if they win the election. Given that we are missing our targets on renewables, combined heat and power output is down, the energy efficiency commitment has been downgraded and, worst of all, carbon emissions are rising, should the Minister not put his own house in order before he starts to lecture the rest of the world? Does he think that he will hit his 2010 target for CO <sub>2</sub> emissions and, if so, will he set out very clearly how he expects to achieve that?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41118-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 We have set out precisely how we intend to meet the climate change programme. While I do not dispute that there are challenges, this country&#039;s record on climate change is the best of any of the G8 nations. The UK is rightly seen as a leader on this issue. We are expanding the percentage of energy from renewables, and we are making progress on the introduction of carbon trading, which we pioneered. I believe that the 2010 target is achievable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41118-01_spnew10"><b> Ms Julia Drown  (South Swindon)</b> 
 (Lab): To do more on the renewable energy part of the agenda, can my hon. Friend give some help to one of the farmers whose land partly covers my constituency and who has been growing renewable crops for 10 years, but has not sold a single twig? He has been given almost &#163;1 million of potential grant from the Government, which shows their commitment to the issue, but he is having serious problems getting his business off the ground. Will my hon. Friend talk with his colleagues in the DTI to get this farmer the help that he needs?
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41118-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 As my hon. Friend rightly recognises, considerable funds are available for bio-energy and biomass energy. That includes giving support to the installation of equipment&#151;generators, combined heat and power systems and central heating systems&#151; that can use bio-energy. One significant development that has considerable potential is the co-firing of biofuel by coal-burning power stations such as Drax. That could present a long-term opportunity for farmers and a way of reducing carbon dioxide from coal-burning power stations.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41118-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Tim Yeo  (South Suffolk)</b> 
 (Con): As it is universally accepted that there can be no effective solution to the problem of climate change without the wholehearted participation of the United States, why has the Prime Minister made so little effort to use his unique relationship to persuade the Americans to sign the Kyoto treaty?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41118-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 That is not the case. At the recent meeting that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister had with President Bush&#151;he was the first leader to meet the newly elected President&#151;climate change was one of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1452</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the issues on the agenda. However, I do not think that people should delude themselves that the Americans&#151;the President and Congress&#151;have set their face against ratifying the Kyoto agreement. That does not mean that achievements cannot be made by reducing domestic emissions and investing in new technologies. Several US states are interested in introducing carbon trading. California and the north-west states are members of a group known as the climate group, which was launched by my right hon. Friend. We have a great deal of connection with those elements in the US who want to go further than the current Administration, and we should encourage them to do so.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="41118-01_spnew14"><b> Llew Smith  (Blaenau Gwent)</b> 
 (Lab): My hon. Friend the Minister will be aware of the recent flood maps produced by the Environment Agency, which predicts as a flood threat the river Calder, which runs through the Sellafield nuclear plant. Does he agree that it would be foolish to back nuclear power as the saviour technology in combating climate change if one of its main sites, and the site where any new nuclear reactor is likely to be built, is under water?
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="41118-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 It certainly would not benefit anyone to build nuclear power stations in areas that are a major flood risk. That is taken into account at existing sites. The issue of nuclear power is being addressed in our energy White Paper. We have no current plans for nuclear power. We believe that there is considerable potential for renewables and new technologies, and that those will probably bring a better return than the huge investment that would inevitably be required for a nuclear power programme.
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41118-01_spnew16"><b> Norman Baker  (Lewes)</b> 
 (LD): The Minister&#039;s Department is doing its best to make climate change a priority, both internationally and within the Government, but does the Minister not feel a little unhappy when the rug is pulled from underneath him by the Prime Minister, who last month overruled the Department by sanctioning an increase of almost 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to be emitted under the EU emissions trading scheme? How can that be described by the Secretary of State in her press release as good news for the environment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="41118-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Prime Minister&#039;s opinions should not be presented in such a simplistic way. The DTI has carried out detailed modelling of emissions by UK industry. That modelling did not exist before and is quite complex and sophisticated, but the final figure is a 5.2 per cent. decrease on business as usual, which is one of the biggest decreases in the whole of the European Union and takes us way beyond our Kyoto target&#151;the only EU country to achieve that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="41118-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford)</b> 
 (Lab): In our response to climate change, the Department&#039;s recent consultation, &quot;Making Space for Water&quot;, emphasises two separate challenges: one is preserving a finite and valuable resource; the other is protecting people from unexpected flooding. Can my hon. Friend confirm that land management practices in the future will be a vital way of meeting both those challenges?


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="41118-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Yes, I can confirm that. A range of management practices have to be put in place. They include developing whole river basin catchment plans, so that we have a much better understanding of the issue and a more integrated and holistic approach to water management.

</p>



<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41118-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality  (Alun Michael): </b> 
 In the past three months my noble Friend Lord Whitty, who leads on these matters, has had discussions with the president of the National Farmers Union, Tim Bennett. He has also had discussions with Tate and Lyle and with representatives of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries that are affected by the present regime. There are no immediate plans for local NFU representative meetings.
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="41118-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 Is the Minister aware that for every job that sugar beet supports on farms, there are probably six or seven more jobs in servicing and in the beet factories? That is a lot of jobs in a county such as Norfolk, which grows half the country&#039;s beet. Much of that beet is grown not on large farms, but on small farms and county council smallholdings. Given that the UK is a net importer of sugar, surely any cut in its beet quota, which would devastate small farms, would be grossly unfair?
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="41118-02_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I hope the hon. Gentleman accepts that the current situation is unacceptable and that doing nothing is not an option. The EU price is three times the world level for sugar, and that is not sustainable. It is therefore important that we move as quickly as possible to the reforms that are needed, in order that everybody knows what they are doing and can plan their future business.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41118-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): If my right hon. Friend meets the farmers of Norfolk or any NFU representatives, will he politely suggest to them that there is a bigger agenda out there, which must include fairness to the developing world? Of all commodities, sugar is the biggest scandal. The way in which we treat the cane-producing countries is outrageous. Some of us met farmers from the third world this week, and they told us clearly what reforms they need and must have.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41118-02_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Yes, I too have met representatives of countries affected in that way. I have also met farmers in the course of visits, which makes me aware of the problems of adjustment facing farmers in this country. The starting point for reform must clearly be the approach agreed by the European Council in June 2003. The findings of the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs were very similar to those of the Council, so we know the basis of the way forward, and change is vital.

<p><a name="st_34"><a name="41118-02_spmin2"><b>The Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley): </b> 
 Energy from waste cannot contribute towards waste reduction, but does contribute towards more sustainable waste management and the UK&#039;s landfill directive targets. Energy from waste is a viable waste management option, as demonstrated by its position in the waste hierarchy&#151;below minimisation, re-use, recycling and composting, but above disposal and landfill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_35"><a name="41118-02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Amess: </b> 
 If incinerators are to be built, what is the Minister doing to encourage the construction of combined heat and power plants, which have the advantage of offering cheap power and heat to local communities, and the added advantage of reducing the amount of waste to be taken to landfill?
</p>








<p><a name="st_36"><a name="41118-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I accept that if there is to be an energy-from-waste plant, for which a number of designs exist, combined heat and power is to be encouraged, and the Government have programmes and procedures for doing that. Through the waste and resources action programme we have supported new technologies as thermal treatments, such as pyrolisis, which also gasify waste, capture the energy and often produce residue that can also be refuse-derived waste. We are interested in all forms of waste treatments and it is up to local authorities to choose the system that they think is most appropriate.

 (Lab/Co-op): Does my hon. Friend agree that although the Government have done a great deal to stimulate energy-from-waste projects, it often becomes a matter of planning permission? Whether it is an incinerator or pyrolisis, or a different method of mechanical or biological treatments, so often a nimbyish attitude towards such a project prevents us from moving in a positive direction and the contribution that such technology could make is stilted.
</p>








<p><a name="st_38"><a name="41118-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and on many occasions substantial investment in waste treatment facilities, which are not always thermal treatments or incineratory&#151;it can be a range of facilities&#151;is significantly delayed. Planning policy guidance 10 is under review, with consideration being given to waste disposal infrastructure, and we are keen to encourage a regional strategic approach. We do not want to ignore people&#039;s legitimate concerns, but nor do we want undue delays in terms of major investment, which is essential to a move towards sustainable waste management.

 Yes, I can. It is a perfectly reasonable point to make that in relation to incineration capacity there should be regular monitoring of outputs. However, there is a huge difference between modern incinerators and some of the older ones in relation to their outputs and dioxin levels. The hon. Lady will also be aware that the Government have commissioned detailed research into the health effects of all methods of waste disposal, which also helps to inform this debate and the kind of choices that local authorities may want to make.

Does the Minister agree that that is an acceptable use, and will he visit the Orchard school in Castle Donington with me to have a look at its new boiler system, one of several in the county, which I switched on just weeks ago?

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="41118-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Yes, I agree. I know very well the problems that the hon. Gentleman describes in his constituency, having visited the Shetland islands myself in the summer. He is right that it is important that we work closely with the industry, as we are doing not only through the new regional advisory councils, but through the science fisheries partnership, investing &#163;1 million every year in collaborative work to try to bring science and the fishing industry closer together. That collaborative work is important. It is not always the case that we can do what the fishing industry wants, but it is still very important that we work together closely to get the best deal for the UK.

 (Lab): Will my hon. Friend bend his efforts to ensure that the Commission&#039;s proposals are based on accurate up-to-date stock figures that take into account the effects of decommissioning and the conservation measures taken so far, rather than the worst-case scenario of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which the Commission seems to prefer? Secondly, the industry would want to him to recognise that, while the British industry has taken the biggest hit on decommissioning and reduction of the white fish effort, other fishing nations are still building up their white fish effort. That is totally unacceptable to the British industry.
</p>








<p><a name="st_49"><a name="41118-03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I certainly accept that we have to take account of the most up-to-date figures. My hon. Friend is right that, because of the decline of the cod stocks, it is the UK white fish fleet, which has traditionally relied on cod and has the biggest quota of cod, that has suffered the most. I suspect that at the forthcoming December Council, there will be some difficult decisions for the Spanish and others about hake, but we will certainly make it plain to the Commission, as we did at the launch of the regional advisory council, that it is important that it takes into account the decommissioning that has been so painful for his fleets and so many others in the rest of the UK.

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="41118-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman may well be aware, if he has studied the history of the grand banks of Canada, of the scientific consensus that the reason cod stocks have not recovered is that the decision to close the fishery was made too late. If cod stocks are depleted to that extent, they often do not recover. Instead, there has been a growth in prawn stocks, which the fishing industry has been able to exploit.

As he knows, however, we are one month away from making momentous decisions once again on the future of the fishing industry, and the European Commission has still not published stock assessment or effort control proposals. Is not leaving the opportunity for proper consultation and discussion with the industry until that late hour in December a recipe for the kind of mistakes that the December Council has made all too often?
</p>








<p><a name="st_55"><a name="41118-03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point to some extent. One of the reasons for our attempt to achieve multi-annual recovery plans was not having to go through that annual process, but ICES reports in October, which gives both us and the Commission a fairly tight time frame. That does not mean that we cannot have discussions with the industry based on our best guesstimate of what the Commission will recommend as a result of scientific advice, and we have had such discussions both before and since ICES reported.

 A river catchment area is not a political or regional boundary, and the argument for a regional approach is strong and practical.

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="41118-05_spmin2"><b>The Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley): </b> 
 Sewerage undertakers are under a statutory duty under section 94 of the Water Industry Act 1991&#151;enforceable by the Secretary of State or the director general of water services&#151;to provide, improve and extend public sewers and to maintain those sewers to ensure the effectual drainage of their area.
</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="41118-05_spnew6"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 Some progress is being made on odour pollution from sewage works following court action and an odour abatement notice being made in south-west London in respect of Thames Water and the Mogden plant. Will the Minister acknowledge that, for the court action to be effective, the Government will have to specify the standards that must be met and the water regulator will have to approve the necessary capital investment? Will he take action on those points?
</p>








<p><a name="st_93"><a name="41118-05_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that action is being taken on that and he will be aware that my noble Friend Lord Whitty paid a visit to his local sewage works to consider some of the odour problems. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1466</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Enforcement action was taken in November. We are in the process of producing a code of practice that lays out those standards, which the hon. Gentleman has asked for. That will be a useful framework for the sewerage industry to work within as regards the standards that we want to be applied to odour control.
</p>








<p><a name="st_94"><a name="41118-05_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ian Cawsey  (Brigg and Goole)</b> 
 (Lab): My hon. Friend has already claimed the title of King Drain this morning, so I wonder whether he can do a similar job on sewers. Many Members will think that unadopted sewers, and the role of water utilities in them, are the biggest issue. In Dragonby in my constituency, which used to be in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, the sewers that are part of the former steel houses, which are now privately owned, cause regular blockages and problems. When does he expect to do something about that, with the water utilities, so that the blight on many of my constituents, and other hon. Members&#039; constituents, can be ended?
</p>








<p><a name="st_95"><a name="41118-05_spnew9"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. As he rightly says, I know the situation in Dragonby, although it appears that the sewers have got worse since my hon. Friend inherited the village. The whole issue of private sewers is very complicated. We want to address it, and we have made clear in relation to the report that we commissioned the options that we can consider. That report showed that up to 50 per cent. of the population are connected directly or indirectly to private sewers, so it is a major issue. I will attend the all-party sewers and sewerage group meeting on 2 December, at which I hope to outline the steps that we can take, the kind of problems faced and some of the solutions that we can consider.

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="41118-05_spnew10"><b> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire)</b> 
 (LD): Is it right that, in 2004, many residents still suffer internal sewerage flooding in their homes and gardens? What power has the Minister to ensure that water utility companies put repairs in process immediately?
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="41118-05_spnew11"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Yes, sewer flooding is an appalling experience for people, particularly for those who suffer it repeatedly. There has been some recent case law on the responsibility of sewer companies in relation to repeat sewer flooding, and I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman on that, as it might be of use to him in relation to his constituency case. More generally, sewer flooding was a feature of the ministerial guidance to the regulator in relation to his current job of setting the prices for the next five-year period. I am confident that the regulator, who is well aware of these issues and has received direct representations from Members of the House, will bear that in mind in approving companies&#039; business plans for that period.

 The Minister will be aware that fruit farmers are feeling the squeeze at the moment.

 It has been the view of successive Ministers and Departments that the Agricultural Wages Board should continue. There are many differences between agriculture and horticulture.

<a name="41118-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that in the last oral questions to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on 21 October, the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), said, in reference to the foot and mouth video of Burnside farm,

<a name="stpa_2">Yesterday, Lord Whitty, another DEFRA Minister, wrote to my noble Friend Baroness Byford and made statements that contradict the Under-Secretary of State. First, he stated:

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1470</b>

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="41118-08_spnew0"><b> Mr. Paul Tyler  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The Leader of the House is in his place. Has he given you any indication that he intends to make a statement on what has obviously gone wrong today? Does he accept that this is no way to run a national Parliament, let alone a ping-pong tournament?
</p>








<p><a name="st_50"><a name="41118-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Nothing has gone wrong&#151;absolutely nothing. I am running the proceedings in the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_51"><a name="41118-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Pike  (Burnley) (Lab):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your guidance. A paper is going around that I have not had the opportunity to see, but if any amendment to the Bill is carried today and if the two Houses cannot reach agreement on the Bill at the end of the day, will you be able to invoke the Parliament Act?
</p>








<p><a name="st_52"><a name="41118-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that point of order. The Parliament Act is applicable if agreement on the Bill as a whole is not achieved. That will not be affected if the House agrees to either of the two motions that are being proposed today. Beyond that, I do not want to be drawn into ruling on hypothetical situations, because it might be thought that I was trying to influence the debate. It is up to the Minister to explain the effect of the motion that he is bringing before the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_53"><a name="41118-08_spnew4"><b> Kate Hoey  (Vauxhall) (Lab):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Will you clarify whether, if you chose to use the Parliament Act and it was used under your guidance&#151;you have to follow the rules&#151;you could be swayed at all by a vote in this House? Do you agree that the only way in which you can be prevented from using the Parliament Act is by a vote in this Parliament telling you not to use it, and can we have that vote?
</p>








<p><a name="st_54"><a name="41118-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is correct; that is the case.
</p>

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="41118-08_spnew6"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I inform the House that privilege is involved in Lords amendments Nos. 10C, 12C and 52C. If the House agrees to the amendments, I will arrange for the necessary entries to be made in the <i>Journal</i>. I inform the House that I have selected the amendment to the Minister&#039;s amendment in the name of Opposition Members.

Members complete certainty about the impact of what we are asking the House to agree to today. I am advised that passing either motion on commencement would not in any way affect the application of the Parliament Act. We would be passing not an amendment to the Bill, but a motion to propose an amendment in lieu. In other words, we would send the Bill to the other place as previously passed by this House in its Parliament Actable form. Alongside it, if passed, would be the motion making the proposal that the other place amend the Bill in order to delay commencement of the ban. From that point on, the only question is whether the Bill becomes law with the agreement of the other place or via application of the Parliament Act, with or without the proposed change in the date of commencement.

In our original discussions with organisations that have been involved in this debate for many years, including the Countryside Alliance, those organisations&#151;including the Countryside Alliance&#151;accepted that the issue was cruelty. That is the subject that has dictated the debate about legislation on hunting. Let me also tell the hon.

<a name="stpa_10">This House voted on Tuesday to insist on the Bill in the form in which we sent it to the Lords in September&#151;that is, what is generally called the banning Bill. The Lords have now insisted on their feeble version of the registration scheme, so it is the Lords who have chosen confrontation, and I regret that. At this stage, I sense no appetite among supporters of a ban in this House for any change in the House&#039;s well-established position. It is the will of this House of Commons to have this Bill. I should make clear that it is not this House that is insisting; it will be the House of Lords, if it does not accept what we are saying today, that will have provoked the application of the Parliament Act.

<a name="stpa_11">There remains the question of when the Bill is to come into force. As it stands, it will come into force in three months, on 18 February 2005. That three-month period applied to the original Bill, involving a tribunal system which I sought to persuade colleagues to support and which would have come into force three months after the Bill. This House has reasonably proposed a delay of about 18 months, until 31 July 2006, for the start of the ban on hunting&#151;but not on hare coursing events, which would be banned three months after implementation in any case.
</p>

<a name="stpa_12">In their amendments the Lords suggested a three-year delay for all hunting, including hare coursing events, until 1 December 2007 or even later; but that would be for their registration Bill. At the same time, they voted against our suggested amendment proposing commencement on 31 July 2006. In doing so, they have in effect voted for a ban that will come into force in February next year. All the Lords&#039; decisions on the Bill have been, in my view, irrational. With this one, they have behaved like turkeys voting for Christmas. I cannot believe that they meant it, although my noble Friend Lord Whitty made the position absolutely clear to them.

 When the Bill came before the House last year and it became clear that it could be reintroduced and have the Parliament Act applied to it, I thought that common sense would prevail and that people involved with hunting would say, &quot;Well, if the elected House of Commons in the Parliament of this country is intent on taking that decision, we had better start thinking about it.&quot; However, those who oppose a ban on hunting have encouraged their followers to believe that legislation will not be introduced. Ordinary people, who have perhaps been misled by their leadership, should be given time in order to prepare for a ban, deal with animal welfare considerations and change the activities and businesses in which they are involved. That is the common-sense and generous way in which to approach the Bill, without changing the nature of the legislation, on which this House has agreed on more than one occasion.

 If my right hon. Friend had listened to my response to my hon.

I want law-abiding people to obey the law, and I hope that they will do so. The change in the implementation date will make it more possible for them to obey the law, without giving rise to employment problems or animal welfare difficulties, concerning, for instance, the disposal of packs of dogs. That is a perfectly reasonable way in which to proceed. I say to my right hon. Friend that being reasonable, which is all that I seek, cannot bring this House into disrepute.

 My instinct is to say that anyone who votes for an amendment that fundamentally changes the Bill thereby votes against the measure. If the proposal of the hon.

 My hon. Friend mentioned a potential challenge. The Joint Committee suggested that a three-month ban was unreasonable and potentially open to challenge under the Human Rights Act 1998.

 My hon. Friend makes a good point about the Joint Committee, which has tentatively concluded that a measure that included a three-month ban would not comply with the Human Rights Act 1998. That will be tested in the courts. He also makes a good point about hare coursing, which is, bizarrely, singled out for an immediate ban. Hare coursing kills fewer hares than shooting or hare hunting, which would be allowed. It would be delayed for three years if the Minister&#039;s amendment were passed. However, hare coursing, which aims not to kill hares, would be banned in three months.

 In terms of legal challenge, does the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) accept that the biggest problem is the way in which the Bill is constructed? For example, if a member of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals found a dead mouse in someone&#039;s back yard and reported them to the police, it would have to be proved that the cat had killed the mouse, because if the dog was found guilty that person could go to prison.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good but abstruse point. Perhaps we should move on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_25">I want to focus particularly on the question of when and why the Bill should be implemented&#151;either immediately, or effectively immediately, within three months; within 18 months, as the Minister&#039;s Parliamentary Private Secretary, the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley), has suggested; or within two and three quarter years, which the Minister himself seems to be suggesting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_26">I believe that when the Government originally proposed 18 months it was not for animal welfare reasons; it had about it the stench of political expediency. They wanted to allow the ban to come into force after the general election and for hunting not to become an issue in that general election. In that context, Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you that a number of my right hon. and hon. Friends, and indeed people in the countryside, are, for that very reason, perfectly content with an immediate ban.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_27">A significant number of people who believe in hunting want an immediate ban so as to focus attention on opposition to the Government in the run-up to the general election. I have not gone along with that view, as it seems to me that there are some extraordinarily important animal welfare reasons for seeking to delay the Bill&#039;s implementation. This is all to do with animal welfare; it should not be to do with the election, political expediency or arguments. It should be to do with the best way of implementing what is to Conservative Members an obnoxious move.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">That is why we are quite content to accept what the Lords propose&#151;namely, a three-year delay. If we were given the opportunity to vote on it, we would doubtless at least consider what the Minister proposes, which is a delay of two and three quarter years. That is reasonably sensible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_29">It might be worth touching on why I believe that to be the case, why I believe that 18 months is no good at all and why three months is even less good. First, the Minister has said that the reason for the delay is to assist with re-homing hounds, as he calls it. The notion of re-homing hounds is absurd. Anyone who has ever been to a hunt kennels knows that the notion of removing any one of 100 dogs, some of which are as large as this Table and which have been living together for years&#151;indeed, they may have been bred for generations for the purpose of hunting&#151;and re-homing it in the front room of someone&#039;s bungalow is a great deal less&#151;

 May I offer clarification to the House? The report that the hon.

We did not agree with the idea of dogs being re-homed abroad&#151;we had grave reservations about it. We simply said that when a ban was put in place in Scotland that is what some hunts did.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;Horses bred mainly or solely for hunting are not pets&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. By temperament and conformation, these are strong and vigorous animals&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To expect these hunting horses to thrive in roles for which they are not suited by breeding would be as unrealistic as to expect trained sheepdogs to thrive as family pets&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a sudden influx into the market of thousands of redundant hunters would be beyond the capacity of equine welfare organisations to manage.

I appeal to the supporters of hunting and of freedom to remain within the law at all times, to abhor violence or intimidation of any kind, and to seek to avoid inconveniencing the general public, most of whom support our cry for freedom. They should focus their efforts on those people who are responsible for this illiberal law&#151;namely, Labour Ministers and MPs, especially in the run-up to the general election. A Conservative Government will introduce an early Bill to repeal this ban, which makes our task at the general election clearer than ever, both nationally and in Labour and Liberal marginal seats, whose Members should watch out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_38">If the House decides to use the Parliament Act to force through this disgraceful and illiberal Bill, especially if we decide that it should commence in three months&#039; time, we will send a clear message to lovers of hunting, lovers of shooting and fishing&#151;which, without doubt, will be next&#151;lovers of the countryside, and perhaps above all, lovers of our ancient freedoms that we care more about prejudiced and ignorant political correctness than about animal welfare. There will also be a hidden message to the countryside, which reads: &quot;Cry havoc, and let loose the dogs of war.&quot;

<p><a name="st_154"><a name="41118-13_spnew17"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 This is an amendment to a motion, and it is perfectly in order. The right hon. Gentleman can take my word for it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_155"><a name="41118-13_spnew18"><b> Peter Bradley: </b> 
 With respect to you, Mr. Speaker, I should point out that it is a Wrekin amendment and not a wrecking amendment. It is characteristic of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality that he should want to go the extra mile, or, in this case, an extra year. He knows that I, as his Parliamentary Private Secretary, am always right behind him, even if I will not go the extra mile myself this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_39">My right hon. Friend has sought to identify common ground with the hunting fraternity and the House of Lords. It is doubtful, however, whether there is a piece of common ground big enough on which to pitch a tent that accommodates all of us. That is why he says that while one amendment before the House is reasonable, the other is more reasonable. It is up to the House, I suggest, to decide which is the more reasonable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_156"><a name="41118-13_spnew19"><b> Mr. Beith: </b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The amendment to which the hon. Gentleman has referred can only be voted on if it is moved by a Minister of the Crown. He has now moved it, so it cannot be moved by a Minister of the Crown.
</p>








<p><a name="st_157"><a name="41118-13_spnew20"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. For the sake of clarity, the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley) is actually speaking to his amendment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. Many are the times that I have heard hon. Members say that they are moving an amendment when they are not doing so. What a Member says and what he gets are two different things. I am trying to tell the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) that although the hon. Member for The Wrekin may have said that he was moving his amendment, he is speaking to it. The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s latter point is correct; at the end, when the shutter comes down, only a Minister can move such an amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_158"><a name="41118-13_spnew21"><b> Mr. Beith: </b> 
 I distinctly heard the hon. Gentleman move the amendment, and I am sure that the record will show that&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_159"><a name="41118-13_spnew22"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. I have distinctly heard other hon. Gentlemen say that they are moving an amendment when they are not really doing so; they are merely debating it. I will clarify the matter if it keeps the right hon. Gentleman happy; the hon. Gentleman is not moving his amendment, but speaking to it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_160"><a name="41118-13_spnew23"><b> Peter Bradley: </b> 
 As the House can tell, I am not moving, but I am speaking. <i>[Laughter.]</i> I am doing so because I want the House to have the opportunity to choose which of the motions on the Order Paper is the most reasonable. I believe that delay until 2006 is reasonable and sensible because it gives hunts the opportunity to adopt drag hunting to save the jobs, the dogs&#151;and the fox for that matter&#151;the fallen stock collection service to farmers and the way of life in which they believe, and will provide opportunities for riders who currently would like to ride across the country but who will not chase a fox.

 Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_162"><a name="41118-14_spnew1"><b> Peter Bradley: </b> 
 In a moment. The delay gives hunters the opportunity to make this an election issue&#151;none of us should be frightened of that&#151;and deprives them of any vestige of an excuse to shoot their dogs or hounds or to support unlawful protest in the countryside.
</p>








<p><a name="st_163"><a name="41118-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Foster: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for speaking so clearly to the amendment. I intend to vote against amendment a, which is in the Minister&#039;s name, and for his amendment b. Does he believe that the vast majority of people in this country will understand the reasonableness of our actions when following his lead on this matter?
</p>








<p><a name="st_164"><a name="41118-14_spnew3"><b> Peter Bradley: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, whose support is valuable given his reputation on this issue. He is absolutely right; there can be no reason for anyone in the country to believe that the House is acting unreasonably if we provide an 18-month delay to allow hunts to make their arrangements and to change to drag hunting if that is what they choose. What would be unreasonable is for the House of Lords to reject the motion. It would be perverse indeed if those who claimed to support hunting were those who put the last nail in its coffin.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_40">Not many Members have remarked on it but, last Tuesday, those Opposition Members who support hunting voted for a Bill that they voted against on Second Reading just a couple of years ago. I suggest that the confusion is theirs, not ours. We want a ban, but we want it introduced in an orderly fashion and in a reasonable way. I therefore hope that colleagues on both sides of the House will support the motion to bring in a ban on 31 July 2006.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. A number of hon. Members are confused about the first vote. What would happen if the amendment in the name of the Opposition spokesman, on which we are now voting, gains a majority? Would there be a further vote, or would the other amendments fall?

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Can you confirm my understanding that an amended Bill can have the Parliament Act applied to it only if the amendment in question is agreed by both Houses of Parliament, and that those who wish to ban hunting must therefore vote, in respect of the next amendment, for the original Bill and for an immediate ban?

 I answered a similar point of order earlier, and to summarise what I said, I will not be drawn into that one. I did invite hon. Members to clarify the matter with the Minister, and the hon. Gentleman had the opportunity to do so. It would be wrong of me to be drawn into such issues while voting is taking place.

<p><a name="st_181"><a name="41118-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Under the Order of the House of 17 November, any message from the Lords relating to the Civil Contingencies Bill must be considered forthwith, without any Question put. I have to acquaint the House with the fact that a message has been received from the Lords as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;The Lords agree without amendment the amendments proposed by the Commons in lieu of certain Lords amendments to the Civil Contingencies Bill to which the Commons have disagreed. They do not insist on certain of their amendments to which the Commons have disagreed, but do propose amendments in lieu thereof, to which amendments they desire the agreement of the Commons. They do not insist on their remaining amendments to which the Commons have disagreed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>








<p><a name="st_182"><i>Lords amendments considered.</i>


</p>








<p><a name="st_183"><i>Lords amendment:</i> No. 49B



<a name="time_9">
<a name="41118-17_time0"><h5>3.31 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_184"><a name="41118-17_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Cabinet Office  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 I beg to move, That this House disagrees with the Lords in the said amendment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_185"><a name="41118-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 With this we may consider Lords amendment No. 50B.
</p>








<p><a name="st_186"><a name="41118-17_spnew2"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Following the concerns voiced both in this House and the other place, we have reconsidered the issues of sunsetting and reporting on the use of part 2 of the Bill. The Government remain convinced&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_187"><a name="41118-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. We must have order in the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_188"><a name="41118-17_spnew4"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Government remain convinced that sunsetting the Act itself is not appropriate in this case. The need to be able to respond to the most serious emergencies will not disappear after a given period, and revocation of the legislation would simply necessitate replacing it with something very similar.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_43">As I made clear in Commons consideration of Lords amendments, any use of the powers under part 2 will be subject to detailed and rigorous parliamentary scrutiny and will be limited by the restrictions and safeguards set out in the Bill. Any regulations made under the Bill will be subject to sunsetting after a maximum of 30 days. This is one of the most aggressive sunsetting clauses to be found anywhere on the statute book.
</p>








<p><a name="st_189"><a name="41118-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 I am sure that the Minister has had the opportunity since yesterday to speak to her advisers about the test of reasonableness. The plain fact is that the Bill does not contain an express reasonableness test with regard to the use of emergency regulations. In the light of the debate yesterday, will she explain to the House why that is not in the Bill?
</p>








<p><a name="st_190"><a name="41118-17_spnew6"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I explained in terms to the hon. Gentleman yesterday that it was not necessary to have express provision for a test of reasonableness in the Bill. I also explained why that was the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_44">The Government remain convinced that the sunsetting of regulations, and the need for them to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1509</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>receive the assent of Parliament, is the right way to ensure that the powers cannot be misused and that effective scrutiny takes place. Indeed, we have amended the Bill to specify that regulations must contain provision to ensure that parliamentary scrutiny can take place where this is effected by the emergency in question, or by response efforts.
</p>








<p><a name="st_191"><a name="41118-17_spnew7"><b> Mr. Cash </b> 
 <i> rose&#151;</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_192"><a name="41118-17_spnew8"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman one more time.
</p>








<p><a name="st_193"><a name="41118-17_spnew9"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 The Minister may recall that the Minister in the Lords continually referred to the use of the powers as a temporary arrangement, yet it is clear from the wording of the Bill as it now is that the powers are not temporary but permanent. Will the Minister explain that as well?
</p>








<p><a name="st_194"><a name="41118-17_spnew10"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 As I explained yesterday to this House, and as has been explained in the other place, the regulations and the exercise of the powers under the Bill are temporary and subject to an aggressive sunsetting clause, in that they fall after 30 days unless Parliament confirms that they should continue and the orders are relaid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_45">There is no doubt that, given the scale of the emergencies that we are talking about, the Government&#039;s handling of such an emergency will be subject to intense scrutiny both inside and outside Parliament after the event. I need only refer to inquiries and reports published after the foot and mouth outbreak&#151;in that case, emergency powers were not necessary&#151;to highlight the fact that post-event scrutiny and review are, and will remain, defining features of the most serious emergencies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_46">However, in the light of the concerns that have been expressed, the Government are minded to give a firmer assurance to both Houses about the way in which we will ensure that the Bill operates correctly. In the event of the use of emergency powers, the Government would put in place formal arrangements to review the way in which the Bill and its mechanisms, including the safeguards, had worked in practice. To that end, within one year of the end of the point at which the emergency regulations fall, a senior Privy Councillor, appointed by the Government, would carry out a review of the operation of the Bill. The process would be repeated for each emergency for which the Bill is used. That review would be published, and thus be available to Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_47">The findings will provide a useful tool for the Government, who would aim to learn lessons from any emergency and improve processes wherever necessary. They will be conscious of the need to justify their decision to use the powers and their handling of the emergency in the cold light of day, both before they use the powers and throughout their exercise.
</p>








<p><a name="st_195"><a name="41118-17_spnew11"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Minister believe that the appointment of a Privy Councillor by the Government is a broad enough base to secure a properly independent view? Would it not be appropriate for Parliament, with Members from all political parties, to agree the appointment of the Privy Councillor?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1510</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_196"><a name="41118-17_spnew12"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s approach is consistent with the long-standing convention that, following major emergencies, Governments appoint senior independent figures to review events. The Anderson inquiry into foot and mouth is a good example. There are also strong parallels with the practice used under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.

 I would certainly expect it to be debated.

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="41118-18_spnew0"><b> Mr. Heald </b> 
: I agree with the point on which the Minister ended. The Bill has been fully considered. It started with pre-legislative scrutiny and it was fully considered in Committee. The pity of it is that when it came to Report, which is an important stage of any Bill, such a draconian guillotine was imposed that hon. Members who had taken an interest in the Bill over some time were unable to discuss large parts of part 2. With that caveat, I thank the Minister and her predecessor for the consensual nature of the discussions that we have had on the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_50">I made my remarks yesterday about sunsetting. It is a good thing to have sunset provisions for draconian powers. Having said that, today in the other place my noble Friend Baroness Buscombe tabled amendments to make the sunset provision take effect a year after any occasion on which the powers in part 2 were used. The purpose of that is to provide an opportunity to reflect on the power itself in the light of the way in which it had been used. None of us knows what circumstances will arise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_51">I accept that the Minister&#039;s commitment today to a report from a Privy Councillor every time that the part 2 provisions are used, followed by an opportunity to debate that report, is a substantial commitment and meets the case. I would like to press the Minister a little on one thing. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) intervened in the Minister&#039;s speech to make the point that the person who did the report should be a respected independent figure. Will she say a little more about the independence of the person chosen to produce such a report?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_52">We feel that we have achieved something. I would like to think of it as perhaps not a full loaf but certainly a half.

<p><a name="st_204"><a name="41118-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Richard Allan  (Sheffield, Hallam) (LD):</b> 
 I am pleased that we are able to finish the proceedings on the Bill on a consensual note. It has perhaps a more select audience than the previous Bill that we were debating, but in many senses it is a more significant measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_53">The Minister has set out a procedure for reviewing the use of the emergency powers that fits in with what we argued for in the House of Lords and in this House yesterday. Lord Carlile is independent, but I would not say that he is non-political. He is still a political Member of the House of Lords. He reviews procedures used under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. That was precisely what we were looking for in the context of this legislation. We have set certain thresholds for Ministers to invoke the powers; as we discussed yesterday, those thresholds remain subjective. A review of the operation of those subjective tests is all-important. The Minister helpfully set out yesterday the way in which the thresholds worked&#151;the difference between the Minister &quot;thinking&quot; and being &quot;satisfied&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_54">I now have that difference straight in my head with the illustration of the Prime Minister&#039;s argument that he did not think that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but he was satisfied that it had. There is something there that can be tested. Similarly, in the context of a flu outbreak, a Minister might be satisfied that an outbreak was deadly and justified all kinds of emergency 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1512</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>provisions being brought into place. That is a testable set of criteria; it is not the Minister simply thinking that a deadly flu outbreak is taking place and that things need to be done. Those are judgments that we believe Ministers are entitled to make, but Parliament is entitled to go over them again to see whether the facts justified the conclusion that was reached.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_55">We think that the procedure that the Minister has set out today will meet our requirements. We are content not to oppose what the Minister suggests as a substitute for the set of arrangements sent to us by the House of Lords. I reiterate the comments that the Minister and the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) made about the conduct of proceedings on the Bill. This is the last opportunity that we will have to debate it in this place, but we have a different piece of legislation now from the one with which we started some time ago.
</p>








<p><a name="st_205"><a name="41118-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is important that the person should be an independent figure? Does he also agree that the one thing that scarred the progress of the Bill was the very stiff programme motion introduced on Report, which meant that we were not able to discuss a large portion of the Bill at that important stage?

<a name="time_10">
<a name="41118-18_time0"><h5>3.45 pm</h5>

</p>








<p><a name="st_206"><a name="41118-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 I am able to close on a consensual note by agreeing with the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. The way in which the Report stage was handled was disgraceful. Part 2 of the Bill is far more significant than part 1 in terms of civil liberties and its constitutional implications, yet we ended up spending more time on part 1 than on part 2. We certainly did not have enough time to go through all the aspects of part 2 that we wanted to consider. That was reflected in the number of amendments from the Lords to part 2, which showed that there was still plenty of work to be done. I do not want the House of Lords to be used as a Committee stage for the more significant parts of the Bill, while the House of Commons gets to debate just the froth around the edges. The way in which part 2 and the Report stage were handled was disappointing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_56">I return to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about the independence of the person who carries out the review. Many of the concerns expressed yesterday from the Opposition Benches were about the fact that when there is an emergency, the requirement for the Government to get a majority in Parliament is not a sufficient safeguard. Under those circumstances, Governments can whip their Back Benchers&#151;by definition, they have a majority of them&#151;behind them, so that is not an adequate safeguard. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the key test is whether the person who conducts the review will stand outside the normal political melee and be able to reach an independent judgment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_57">For that to happen, two criteria must be fulfilled. One is that the person makes that judgment at a distance, as the Minister set out today, not in the debate about the emergency regulations themselves. That would be in the heat of the moment, and we want the judgment made at a cool reflective distance. The second criterion is that the person should be outside the normal political arena, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1513</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>so I understand why a Privy Councillor would be appropriate, assuming they were acting as an independent Privy Councillor with the nation&#039;s interests at heart, rather than with a party political interest at heart. Having listened to the contributions from right hon. Members in all parts of the House, including the Conservative Benches, I have confidence in the majority of the Privy Councillors present putting the nation&#039;s interests ahead of party interests and being very interested in the constitutional implications of the emergency powers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_58">If that can be achieved, we will have reached a reasonable compromise. I am grateful to the Minister for acceding to our arguments, whereas yesterday she had to argue that the Government did not consider that necessary. I thought we were persuasive and I am glad that she was persuaded to move in this direction.


</p>








<p><a name="st_207"><a name="41118-18_spnew4"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 I rise to follow up briefly the point that I raised in an earlier intervention, which was supported by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald), the shadow Leader of the House, relating to the appointment of an independent Privy Councillor to review the powers contained in the Bill. As my hon. Friend said, those powers are draconian and if they are to be reviewed, the person reviewing them should be genuinely independent. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), speaking for the Liberal Democrats, highlighted that. He also expressed confidence that a majority of Privy Councillors can display proper and appropriate independence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_59">I shall press the Minister, however. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam emphasised that on Report inadequate time was provided for large sections of part 2, which is the most important part of the Bill, to be debated. I hope the Minister, for whom I have considerable affection and regard for her abilities, will take a message back to her party that it is inappropriate that on Report, which is the only stage at which Back Benchers can fully participate in the consideration of legislation, they did not have an opportunity to contribute because of the limitations imposed by the programme motion. Therefore, many of us choose Lords amendments as an opportunity to participate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_60">Will there be any discussion between the Opposition parties and the Government before a Privy Councillor is appointed, so that there is confidence across the House that the individual who is appointed to undertake this important task is genuinely independent? This legislation is critical. As several of my Opposition colleagues have highlighted during the debate, the powers that are granted to the Government under the legislation are draconian&#151;probably the greatest powers in any legislation to have been vested in Government in the 34 years that my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) has been in the House. Therefore, I seek an assurance that the independence of the Privy Councillor is verifiable and that there is genuine consultation across the political parties prior to this person being appointed to undertake this important job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-18_para11">

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="41118-19_spnew0"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 I am here at the bitter end because I remain deeply concerned about the potential impact of the way in which these powers could be used in terms of the liberty of the subject&#151;not an expression that should be used lightly. But in this particular context, and in view of the rejection of the inclusion in the list beyond the Human Rights Act 1998 of habeas corpus and the duration of Parliament, to give but two particularly important provisions, I remain deeply concerned about the way in which these powers could be misused. In particular, as I have already said, there is no express test of reasonableness, and impermanence is imported into the arrangements, which is unsatisfactory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_62">With regard to the nature of the decisions that could be taken, even Law Lords have recently, in relation, I think, to the Rehman case, said that political decisions in matters of this kind would be best taken by Ministers rather than by the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary where there are extremely delicate questions about the liberty of the subject in relation to issues of national security. That is where the interface comes between emergency powers on the one hand and questions of national security on the other, because the two are likely to interlock. I simply make the point that the Human Rights Act in itself, irrespective of what the noble Lord Lester of Herne Hill said a few days ago, is inadequate to cover the various difficulties and dangers to the liberty of the subject that I believe are inherent in the proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_63">It is a step in the right direction to have a review by a senior Privy Councillor, but I repeat what I said in an intervention, that under no circumstances whatever should that person come from a political background. I say that because, having regard to the case law that has developed in relation to decisions of the most sensitive nature that I have just described, the view is taken that these are and should be political decisions and that that question has been adjudicated by the courts themselves. In this particular context, there would be a greater degree of independence if no person who held the job came from a political background.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_64">I appreciate that my Front-Bench colleagues and the Liberal Democrats have now concluded that exchanges between the two Houses have reached their final stage. Nevertheless, I fear that the powers could be misused, and I think that the fact that the Government&#039;s programme motion impinged on Report, which is in many respects the most important stage in any Bill&#039;s consideration&#151;it is particularly important in dealing with a Bill such as this one&#151;was disgraceful.

<p><a name="st_209"><a name="41118-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 Will my hon. Friend remind the House of the distinction that he made between the need for political decision making in the sense of the Minister making a decision and the need for non-party political independence in terms of the Privy Councillor?
</p>








<p><a name="st_210"><a name="41118-19_spnew2"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 Absolutely. My right hon. Friend puts it extremely well. On emergency powers and national security, the decision to invoke the powers is bound to be political at that point. Any question of review would need to be balanced with a degree of independence that

<b>18 Nov 2004 : Column 1515</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would be guaranteed only by ensuring that any subsequent decision on the review was taken by a person without a political background.

I also thank the hon. Members for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) and for Stone (Mr. Cash) for recognising that the Government have gone at least some way towards meeting their concerns, even if they have not been met in full.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41118-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_66">I understand that there is some natural concern about how the review will be carried out and who will be appointed to lead it. The intention is that a single Privy Councillor will lead the review, but they will of course be assisted by a review team in carrying it out. The review will be independent, and the United Kingdom has a strong track record of appointing independent senior figures to carry out inquiries. In any event, to maximise the lessons learned, the Government would want to appoint someone who could step back from the situation. The report would be published and there would be a debate, and one of the issues debated would surely be the nature of the review itself.
</p>








<p><a name="st_212"><a name="41118-19_spnew4"><b> Mr. Paul Tyler  (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> 
 I accept what the Minister is saying, but will she draw a distinction between what has been described as a political background, which is not the critical issue, and mindset, context and the way in which the process will be achieved, which will be much more important? Somebody&#039;s background will perhaps be irrelevant, as somebody who is not of a political background can have very strong political views. The critical issue is the context and process, not the background.
</p>








<p><a name="st_213"><a name="41118-19_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I completely agree. As I have set out, it would be extremely important for the Government to appoint someone who could step back from the situation. Of course, that ability comes from the personal specifications of the person who is carrying out the review and their willingness and freedom from political influence. It is such concerns that would inform the Government in their choice of Privy Councillor. The Government would of course discuss on Privy Council terms and consult the principal parties, thereby meeting the concerns of the hon. Member for Macclesfield. I hope that those assurances will satisfy nearly, if not all, Members.
