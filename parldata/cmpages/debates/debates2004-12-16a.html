<p><a name="qn_0">1. <a name="41216-01_wqn0"><b> Mr. Kelvin Hopkins  (Luton, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Whether he has made an assessment of the implications of the depreciation of the US dollar for the British economy; and if he will make a statement.  [205210]
</p>



<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41216-01_spmin0"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 In the last six months, the dollar has fallen by 6&nbsp;per cent. against the pound. At the same time, the euro rose by 5&nbsp;per cent. against the pound. Our objective throughout is stability and the maintenance of economic growth. During our presidency of the G7&nbsp;and G8&nbsp;next year, our objective will be that each continent make its contribution to the sustained growth of the world economy.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41216-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hopkins: </b> 
 Is it not now clear that the Americans are using the dollar exchange rate as an explicit instrument of macro-economic policy? Given that Britain, too, has a substantial and increasing trade deficit, largely with the rest of the European Union, is it not only a matter of time before our Government must adopt an active exchange-rate policy as well?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41216-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I thought that my hon. Friend was opposed to a fixed exchange rate, especially given his views on the euro. Exchange rates will, over time, reflect the fundamentals of the economy. Given the volatility that there has been, I think it most important for each continent to consider over the next few months what contribution it can make to sustained growth in the world economy. I shall be meeting the American Administration over the next few days and will urge them to set a clear path showing that the current account and budget deficits can be dealt with. Equally, the European economy must contribute to growth in the world economy as it has not done in recent years. The same applies to the Japanese economy, which must continue its programme of financial sector reform. Given the present condition of the world economy, in which world trade is increasing, we need to see each continent contributing to both stability and growth.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41216-01_spnew2"><b> Richard Ottaway  (Croydon, South)</b> 
 (Con): I am encouraged by that last reply. Is not the real implication of the devalued dollar&#151;given that the foreign debts of many countries around the world are in dollars&#151;the devaluation of those debts, which will have a profound impact on the world economy? Will the Chancellor address that when he talks to his colleagues in the United States?
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41216-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I will certainly mention it when I talk to Mr. Snow, the Treasury Secretary, and Dr. Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. As policy makers, however, we must decide on the best way forward for the world economy. If we are to maintain the levels of growth achieved this year and see the world economy on a sustained path of growth over the next few years, it is clear to me that the European economy must grow faster. It is also clear to me that the current account and fiscal deficits in the United States must be seen to be addressed, and that in Asia, especially Japan, financial sector reform must be there to show that Japan is on a path towards growth as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I do not think that in February we shall return to the sort of discussions we had at Louvre and Plaza in the 1970s. We shall be discussing how greater flexibility and stability in the world economy can make for greater growth.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41216-01_spnew4"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): In the mid-1980s, closing the twin fiscal and current account gaps in the United States, which at that stage were running at about 3&nbsp;per cent. of gross domestic product, was associated with a 30&nbsp;per cent. fall in the dollar when measured on a trade-weighted basis. Does my right hon. Friend agree that with those two deficits now running at about 5&nbsp;per cent., the chief economist at the Bank of England was right to flag up further sizeable falls in the dollar recently? What will my right hon. Friend do about that prospect when he talks to the American Administration?
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41216-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 There is another factor to be taken into account. The European economy has been growing at half the rate of the American economy for about 10&nbsp;years. If we are to have balance in the world economy, we shall need more growth out of Europe. Whether in terms of interest rates or of structural reform, the whole European area economy will have to grow faster. We are not in the position in which we found ourselves in the mid and late 1980s. We have low inflation both in Britain and in the world economy and we will not make the mistakes made by the last Conservative Government.
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41216-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Oliver Letwin  (West Dorset)</b> 
 (Con): The Chancellor is obviously right to favour floating exchange rates&#151;I think that there is agreement on that throughout the House&#151;but one point was not made clear in his reply to the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins). Does he think that the depreciation of the dollar has been a major factor in the record trade deficits that the United Kingdom now has?
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="41216-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 Of course the depreciation of the dollar is a factor affecting not just the British economy but economies around the world, but policy makers must 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Dec 2004 : Column 1775</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>deal with the real world as we find it. What we must think about over the next few months is how we can sustain the stability of the world economy and at the same time have the fastest growth possible, so that instead of the downturn of the past few years we enjoy a period of sustained growth. I am suggesting that each continent must recognise its responsibilities. Rather than looking at some academic analysis of what might have happened, we must look at what can happen. Each continent must say, &quot;Here are the contributions that we can make to the continuing growth of the world economy.&quot; I should have thought there was common ground between us on that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41216-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 I still did not hear the right hon. Gentleman explain the reason for the UK&#039;s record trade deficit. What about foreign direct investment in this country? Does he think that the depreciation of the dollar is mainly responsible for foreign direct investment dropping to a quarter of its level five years ago?
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41216-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman wishes again to talk down the British economy, but he should recognise that we are the premier country in Europe benefiting from foreign direct investment, particularly from Asia. The pre-Budget report shows not only that exports have grown substantially this year, but that they will continue to grow next year at a fast rate, and we are in a position to benefit from the rise in world trade. Regardless of the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s speculation about the impact of the dollar, trade from Britain to the rest of the world is rising, exports are rising and they ought to continue to rise. I want Britain to benefit from increased world trade. Again, I would have expected that to be common ground between us.
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41216-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 The Chancellor does not need to worry about speculation. In 1999, foreign direct investment into this country was &#163;54&nbsp;billion; last year, it was &#163;12&nbsp;billion, which is about a quarter of the former figure. He surely has to recognise that the depreciation of the dollar or any other external factor is not the main reason for our record trade deficit, or for the fact that foreign direct investment has dropped to a quarter of its earlier level. The main reason is the excessive regulation that he has been imposing and the tax that he has been levying to pay for his wasteful spending.
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41216-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I do not think that the shadow Chancellor lives in the real world. There has been a world downturn, every country in the advanced industrialised world has suffered a loss of foreign direct investment, and the huge pressures of globalisation are hitting every economy as more and more manufacturing work is done in the far east. These are factors common to every industrial economy. The question then is: how well is Britain doing? The answer is that Britain is growing, Britain is creating jobs, Britain has low inflation and Britain has low interest rates. We do not want to go back to the situation described by the shadow deregulation Minister:

<p><a name="qn_1">2. <a name="41216-02_wqn0"><b> Mr. Andrew Rosindell  (Romford)</b> 
 (Con): What estimate he has made of the cost of his new proposals for supporting family child care costs.  [205211]
</p>



<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41216-02_spmin0"><b>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury  (Mr. Paul Boateng): </b> 
 The proposals set out in the pre-Budget report for supporting family child care costs will cost an additional &#163;400&nbsp;million in 2006&#150;07. The total additional cost from 2007&#150;08&nbsp;will be &#163;600&nbsp;million.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41216-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his response, but may I move from costs to benefits and ask him what advantage people earning up to &#163;50,000&nbsp;a year will receive from his new &#163;50&nbsp;employer voucher? This appears to be a case of one arm of the Treasury not talking to the other. Is it not true that people will lose out on tax credits and receive little or no benefit, or even be worse off?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41216-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 The benefits are real and practical across the income range, not least because of the &#163;125&nbsp;million transformation fund, which is designed to support capacity in the child care market. On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency in particular, under Labour the Clockhouse lane early years centre stands to become a children&#039;s centre; under the Tories, were they ever to achieve office, it would be lost. That is the choice&#151;between child care with Labour, or no child care with the Tories.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="41216-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Pike  (Burnley)</b> 
 (Lab): Is it not wrong to look at this issue as simply one of cost? As a result of this positive policy, are there not benefits not only to families, but to the nation? Is it not negative to look at this issue in the manner adopted in the question?
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="41216-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 Having recently visited Burnley, I know that my hon. Friend takes a real interest in this issue, and he is absolutely right. This is not just about benefiting families and enabling them to choose how they balance work-life responsibilities; it is also about a flexible labour market and the benefits to the economy that come when all those who have the potential to contribute to it are involved in it. Child care should support that; under the Tories, it detracted from it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41216-02_spnew4"><b> Miss Julie Kirkbride  (Bromsgrove)</b> 
 (Con): What plans does the Minister have to make his Government&#039;s child care plans more flexible for working mothers? While many mothers are happy to take their children to school early or leave them there late or with a child minder in another house, many other mothers will, because of their working pattern, want them looked after in their own homes. What is the Minister going to do to make the Government&#039;s plans more flexible?
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="41216-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 The plans are flexible and have been recognised as such by all the charities working in this sector. What has really introduced flexibility to the market&#151;the facts speak for themselves&#151;is that 525,000&nbsp;child care places have been created as a result of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Dec 2004 : Column 1777</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>this Government&#039;s policy since we came to office. The real flexibility is provided by having a child care policy. The Tories never had one and the result was an inflexible and rigid labour market and a lack of choice for hard-pressed, hard-working parents.

 (Lab): What assessment he has made of the economic impact of the Government&#039;s planned investment in children&#039;s services and nursery education.  [205212]
</p>



<p><a name="st_20"><a name="41216-02_spmin1"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer  (Mr. Gordon Brown): </b> 
 As a result of the pre-Budget report, investment in child care and nursery education, including Sure Start, will rise from &#163;1.2&nbsp;billion in 1997&nbsp;to &#163;4.5&nbsp;billion in 2008, as we invest in the potential of every child to the long-term benefit of the whole economy.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="41216-02_spnew6"><b> Linda Perham: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer and I look forward to having a Sure Start scheme in my constituency. I recently attended the launch, under the neighbourhood nursery initiative, of a new learning centre in Hainault in my constituency. Such a provision, which opens between 8&nbsp;am and 6&nbsp;pm, is particularly helpful to lone parents. Can the Chancellor explain how the investment that the Government are planning in under-fives services will impact on the participation of lone parents in the labour market and on Government targets for reducing child poverty?
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41216-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 The number of lone parents who are employed has risen from 45&nbsp;to 55&nbsp;per cent. or so over the last few years. We believe that there is considerable scope for that to continue to rise if adequate child care places as well as training are made available. That is why we made an offer in the pre-Budget report to 250,000&nbsp;lone parents. If they take up the offer of jobs, they will receive an additional &#163;40&nbsp;a week allowance for a year&#151;a &#163;2,000&nbsp;a year bonus for taking on a job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_2">The combination of the measures in the pre- Budget report, the additional help on maternity pay, the increased number of hours in nursery education, the growth of children centres&#151;they should average about five per constituency by the time our programme is finished in 2010&#151;as well as the wraparound school care that my hon. Friend talks about, under which schools are open from 8&nbsp;am to 6&nbsp;pm, all mean that the choices available to parents are immeasurably enhanced from where they were in 1997. At the same time, our children&#039;s benefits are attacking child poverty. I shall give my hon. Friend one more figure. In 1997, the child care tax credit went to 45,000&nbsp;people; it now goes to almost 300,000. That shows how many more mothers have got more effective choices as a result of our policies.

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="41216-02_spnew8"><b> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham)</b> 
 (LD): I warmly welcome the increased investments in children&#039;s services and nursery education&#151;so much so, that on these Benches we believe that it would be a far better use of taxpayers&#039; money to spend &#163;250&nbsp;million on early-years provision, rather than on the Government&#039;s baby bond to provide cash for 18-year-olds to pay their student tuition fees. After yesterday, does the Chancellor accept that it is not just the Liberal Democrats who have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Dec 2004 : Column 1778</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>doubts about the child trust fund? The City does, too, as the leading retail provider has now withdrawn all support for the fund. Is it not now inevitable that the Government will have to exercise their expensive default option?
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="41216-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 It is a very weak-minded Liberal party that is put off the child trust fund just because one of many providers says that it will not be involved. Retail stores, assurance societies, insurance societies and friendly societies are all involved in the child trust fund. I just hope for the sake of children and the future of our country that the Liberal party reconsiders its ridiculous policy. According to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws), who I see in his place next to the Liberal shadow Chancellor,


</p>

<a name="41216-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_3">This is a measure to encourage savings by all&#151;it gives every child some assets and it ensures that we have a wealth-owning democracy as well as rising incomes for families. I just wish that the Liberal party would, at some point, support a sensible policy. The fact is that, because of the success of our economic policies, we can both expand child care and have a child trust fund, whereas the Opposition would cut public spending by &#163;35&nbsp;billion.

 (Lab): May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his concentration on child care as a way of providing opportunity for people? I welcome the opening of a Sure Start centre in the Seacombe ward in my constituency, which, even as we speak, is providing extremely effective help to 480&nbsp;families. I look forward to another pioneering children&#039;s centre opening in Leasowe. Those two centres are transforming the lives and opportunities of many of my constituents. I, for one, welcome that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41216-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 I have visited many of the Sure Start centres around the country. What is really encouraging is not only the benefit provided for children, but the fact that parents who might feel isolated otherwise can meet at these centres. That benefits the children and the whole family life of the community. Increasingly, Sure Start centres are at the heart of every community. If we can have 3,500&nbsp;of them by 2010&#151;at an average of five per constituency&#151;there will be a very great benefit to family life. However, it would be disastrous if we took the advice of the Liberal party to scrap the child trust fund, or of the Conservative party to scrap the Sure Start children&#039;s centres. What future do the Conservatives offer children in this country? None.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend who, like many hon. Members, is working with the Churches and faith groups to push for debt relief for the poorest countries in the world. In the 1999&#150;2000&nbsp;period, we persuaded countries to write off 100&nbsp;per cent. of bilateral debt relief, but we still have to complete the process. That involves writing off the debt owed to the World Bank, the IMF and the African Development Bank. Until now, I had hoped for all-party support in this. Unfortunately, I find that the Conservative party&#039;s proposals to cut &#163;35&nbsp;billion from public expenditure would mean a massive cut in overseas development aid. Again, what sort of Christmas present is that for the third world? The Opposition would cut the Sure Start children&#039;s centres, and now we know that they would also cut the overseas development aid.

I believe that there is increasing support for that from the international community and from the managing director of the IMF. On debts owed to the World Bank, when we tried to act previously we raised a trust fund of something in the order of $3&nbsp;billion. We have offered to pay off our share&#151;10&nbsp;per cent.&#151;of the debts owed to the World Bank. I would like other countries to follow. I believe that the different members of the G7&nbsp;recognise that that has to be done. I am glad that the hon.

 My right hon. Friend has played a prominent part in pushing to ensure that resources are there for the economic development of countries in Africa that have been denied opportunities for too long. That demands a good solution to the trade talks. It also demands that resources be available for education, health and economic development. In the example of Ethiopia, which was the starting country for the Live Aid action 20&nbsp;years ago, one reason why it has not been able to move forward, and why it has, for example, only 2,000&nbsp;doctors for 70&nbsp;million people&#151;a pathetic situation for a country with so many people&#151;is that much of its debt is still owed to the World Bank and the IMF. It is therefore necessary for us to complete the process of debt relief to enable some countries to make the decisions that are right for them.

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="41216-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 It is true that the euro area has higher inflation and higher unemployment with lower growth than we do. The issue arising is whether the stability and growth pact gives a degree of co-ordination that is necessary with the monetary authority of the European Central Bank to enable Europe to continue to grow at a rate that would bring down unemployment. We have three specific proposals. First, just like our fiscal rules, Europe should take into account the economic cycle. Secondly, those countries with low levels of debt should be allowed to borrow. That would be positive for growth. Thirdly, they should recognise the important role of public investment, as we do in setting our fiscal rules, to enable countries with low debt to be able to borrow to make the necessary public investment to build up their infrastructure and to secure economic growth for the future. I believe that the main economies of Europe are moving towards the views that we have expressed for seven years on the stability and growth pact. I hope that during the Luxemburg presidency many of the rules that underlie the implementation of the stability and growth pact will be rewritten.

 It is not usual to refer to Members in another place. I must correct the hon. Gentleman&#151;the deficit this year is 2.9&nbsp;per cent., not 3&nbsp;per cent.

In Japan&#039;s case it is nearer 6&nbsp;per cent. now. So our record is a good one and he should congratulate us on our management of public finances. Unfortunately, the only contribution that the Conservatives could make to public finances would be to cut &#163;35&nbsp;billion of public spending. Even if they sacked every civil servant in the country, they could raise only &#163;15&nbsp;billion, so they would have to find a further &#163;20&nbsp;billion from massive cuts in our public services.

 It is clear that the pact will be reformed and that all countries now recognise that the existing implementation rules cannot be sustained.

<p><a name="qn_5">6. <a name="41216-04_wqn0"><b> Mr. Michael Fallon  (Sevenoaks)</b> 
 (Con): How much is expected to be paid in national insurance contributions in 2004&#150;05; and how much was paid in 1996&#150;97.  [205215]
</p>



<p><a name="st_47"><a name="41216-04_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 Since 1997, average earnings have grown by over 25&nbsp;per cent. and there are now an extra 1.8&nbsp;million people in work. Receipts of national insurance contributions reflect this economic success and increased national prosperity. The Government Actuary estimates that in 2004&#150;05, &#163;80,962&nbsp;million will be paid in national insurance contributions. The amount paid in 1996&#150;97&nbsp;was &#163;47,627&nbsp;million.


</p>








<p><a name="st_48"><a name="41216-04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Fallon: </b> 
 Is not the reason why Ministers refuse to rule out an increase in national insurance contributions, as they have ruled out increases in VAT on food and children&#039;s clothing, that if one votes Labour at the next election, national insurance is the tax most likely to be increased in the next Parliament, just as the Government increased it in this Parliament?
</p>








<p><a name="st_49"><a name="41216-04_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 No. As the hon. Gentleman knows, all the Government&#039;s spending plans are affordable. The party that makes promises before an election and breaks them directly afterwards is the Conservative party, as it did in 1992, when it promised not to raise VAT and then did.
</p>








<p><a name="st_50"><a name="41216-04_spnew2"><b> Kevin Brennan  (Cardiff, West)</b> 
 (Lab): Is it not the case that the discretionary part of the increase in national insurance of 1&nbsp;per cent. was supported strongly by the British people as necessary in order to put right the mess that had been made in the NHS over many years by the Conservatives, and that the automatic increase is a result of the success of the Government&#039;s management of the economy? Rather than the boom and bust approach of the Conservatives, we now have sustained investment and growth.
</p>








<p><a name="st_51"><a name="41216-04_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is correct. Some &#163;7.8&nbsp;billion was raised to pay directly to the NHS&#151;to fund the investment necessary after it was starved of resources for a sustained period by the Conservatives&#151;and that was widely supported by all our communities. The question is whether the Opposition would remove that investment and cancel the 1&nbsp;per cent. increase.
</p>








<p><a name="st_52"><a name="41216-04_spnew4"><b> Mr. George Osborne  (Tatton)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Paymaster General remember that before the last election the Prime Minister said that people &quot;shouldn&#039;t suppose&quot; that national insurance would go up if Labour were elected. Of course, it went up in the next Budget. Given her refusal to rule out increases in national insurances in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), should not people suppose that after the election national insurance will go up if Labour wins?

 Would not it help the Government&#039;s credibility if they would accept it when mistakes are made?

Does not he accept that it was also an error to instruct the Bank to put 40&nbsp;per cent. of the proceeds into the dollar just before it had an appalling fall? Does he accept that a mistake was made? While we accept that many things have gone right, would not it be helpful if the Government would accept it when something has gone wrong?

<p><a name="st_58"><a name="41216-04_spnew9"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 Almost all the major economies, including France and Switzerland, which are gold holders, have been selling gold recently, with the exception of the US and Germany. The mistake that we made as a country was not rebalancing our reserves earlier, in the 1980s and 1990s. When we came to power, we made a decision to do what it had been advised we should do for a long time. We made the right decision to have the right balance of reserves, including holding dollars, euros and yen. The hon.

 I thank the Minister for that answer.

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="41216-04_spnew13"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 It would clearly be inappropriate for me to comment on an individual taxpayer, due to taxpayer confidentiality&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> It is a simple fact: I am unable to do that. The sports council raised three issues on taxation, one of which was about corporation tax. The fact of the matter is that most international sports federations pay little or no corporation tax&#151;an absolutely negligible amount. They are based here for a wide range of other reasons. An exemption from corporation tax would allow those federations to develop a wide range of commercial activities, free of tax considerations, and that would run counter to the policy not only of this Government but also of the previous Government, which strictly observes that commercial activities should maintain a level playing field to avoid potential unfair tax competition and state-aid issues. The other issues raised by the sports council were on VAT and the national insurance contributions of their employees and it has received a response from the Government on both.
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="41216-04_spnew14"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): I understand the complexities of the situation, which also pertain to a large number of other national governing bodies, especially with regard to corporation tax. I hear what my right hon. Friend says, but is she aware, for example, that rugby football union paid &#163;3&nbsp;million in corporation tax last year on a loss? Will she look again at the VAT question right across the board, so that we can have a whole-sport approach? A number of governing bodies, including athletics, say that some of the impacts have complications regionally. Could we have a national approach to work with sport, to build on the fantastic success of community and amateur sports clubs and the rate relief that we have given to sports clubs up and down the country? There is some concern 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Dec 2004 : Column 1786</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>at national governing level, and we need to work together to create&#151;I am afraid to use this phrase&#151;a level playing field.
</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="41216-04_spnew15"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Because of my hon. Friend&#039;s involvement in the subject, I know that he is very aware that the Government have been committed to improving sport right across the country, including investing in schools, communities and elite sports in a way that has never been done before. He will recall that the 2004&nbsp;spending review announced that the Government would pledge another &#163;431&nbsp;million for sport in the period 2005&#150;08, which represents a rise of 31&nbsp;per cent. in the amount that we are investing. It is simply not possible to bend tax rules for some. It is quite straightforward: corporation tax is levied except in circumstances where there is an exemption&#151;for instance, a charity&#151;and all the sports councils pay barely any corporation tax. The amount is negligible, so there cannot be the massive effect that is being claimed with regard to their future locations.

We announced changes to the child care element of working tax credit, which will benefit London families with high child care costs, and a pilot with the Greater London Authority to examine improving the affordability of child care in London.

<p><a name="st_77"><a name="41216-05_spnew8"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that access to, and the affordability of, child care in London is a specific problem that has been a barrier to parents who seek to go to work. I warmly welcome not only the investment in Sure Start, children&#039;s centres and the neighbourhood nurseries initiative, but the increased generosity of the tax credits for child care announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in the pre-Budget report, which will disproportionately benefit London families. However, will my hon. Friend investigate the behaviour of London local authorities, such as the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Liberal boroughs such as Southwark and Islington, which take Government money for investment in child care, yet cut their own contributions for child care,

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend&#039;s work as a consistent champion of improving child care in London. I am grateful for her recognition of the progress that we made in the pre-Budget report towards the aim that every child should have the best start and that parents should have more choice when balancing work and family life. She is right about the increase in the cost limit from &#163;200&nbsp;to &#163;300&nbsp;a week for two or more children. I also agree that it is essential for all those involved to play their part in bringing about the improvements that we need in London and elsewhere, so Conservative and Liberal Democrat London councils have a lot to answer for. She is right that we need to examine what is happening.

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="41216-05_spnew11"><b> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster)</b> 
 (Con): I welcome several of the Minister&#039;s initiatives, and I shall put to one side the party political banter that has gone on with my next door neighbour, the hon. Member for Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck). However, as a London Member, the Minister will be fully aware that the cost of living in London is fast rising, as was reported only yesterday in the <i>Evening Standard.</i> The effective rate of inflation in London is some 7&nbsp;per cent. Does he appreciate that there is a need for tax breaks and imaginative tax treatment for child care for parents in London, because the earnings of many of them may be considerably higher than average, yet they none the less find themselves in grave difficulty meeting those child care costs? I will be interested to hear what the Minister says about ensuring that child care benefits go beyond only the poorest and most vulnerable in our society.
</p>








<p><a name="st_81"><a name="41216-05_spnew12"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I think that the hon. Gentleman will particularly welcome the announcements in the report published at the time of the PBR. I have mentioned the increase in the limits for help with child care costs in the child care element of tax credit from &#163;200&nbsp;to &#163;300&nbsp;a week, which is particularly beneficial in London, where costs are indeed higher. The hon. Gentleman will also welcome the increase in the proportion of costs for which a claim can be made from 70&nbsp;per cent. to 80&nbsp;per cent. The document includes the example of a family household earning &#163;34,000&nbsp;a year, who will enjoy a benefit of &#163;700&nbsp;a year. All those benefits will be particularly helpful in London because, as he rightly said, costs there are higher, and that is reflected in our proposals.

 Saving is important to provide people with opportunity and independence throughout their life, the flexibility to deal with unforeseen circumstances 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Dec 2004 : Column 1790</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and, of course, financial security in retirement. The Government therefore back a wide range of tax-favoured savings and investment, including the individual savings account and other forms of personal saving, amounting to about &#163;2&nbsp;billion a year of tax support. We also provide tax relief for pension saving worth more than &#163;11&nbsp;billion a year.
</p>








<p><a name="st_83"><a name="41216-06_spnew0"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his reply, but one of the Government&#039;s biggest economic failures is the reduction of the savings ratio by more than a third. It is hardly surprising that we now have the highest rate of tax for 26&nbsp;years. For example, &#163;27&nbsp;billion has been taken out of pensions, and one of the Government&#039;s worst tax failures has been to ruin personal equity plans and tax-exempt special savings accounts. Their replacement, individual savings accounts, are now being cut as well. That is a mean measure for small savers, so what will the Government do to restore the savings ratio?
</p>








<p><a name="st_84"><a name="41216-06_spnew1"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 More people who are saving through ISAs than did so through PEPs and TESSAs. When the economy is stable, people tend to feel more confident and are less inclined to need the cushion of savings. The hon. Gentleman invited me to make comparisons with the previous Government, but it is not an achievement to scare people into saving, as they did. People were worried by the stop-go economy. They were scared of losing their job, as 3&nbsp;million people were unemployed, and they struggled to cope with inflation at 10&nbsp;per cent.

</p>








<p><a name="st_86"><a name="41216-06_spnew3"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 My hon. Friend takes a close interest in this in his constituency, and he is quite right about the importance of such savings arrangements. While we need and want to encourage a stronger savings culture across the country, we have a particular concern for the poorest communities and families. He will be aware of our savings gateway pilot, in which the Government match the savings that the poorest are prepared to put aside. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report that we would back that scheme with another &#163;15&nbsp;million, and roll it out further to test its impact.

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="41216-06_spnew4"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 The Minister will be aware that the most significant strength of EU regional aid is that it gives clear geographical focus to distinct economic regions such as Cornwall and Scilly, which have an average gross domestic product lower than many regions in EU accession states.

What reassurance can he give me that in the future round, beyond 2007, the Government will ensure that places such as Cornwall maintain that geographical focus and have a guaranteed seven-year package of funding?

 Like the hon. Gentleman, I represent a constituency in an objective 1&nbsp;area, so I recognise the role that that form of funding, alongside massively increased investment from the Government, plays in the economic regeneration of such regions. As part of our plans and negotiations on the reform of structural funds, the UK Government have made a unique commitment that we will increase domestic spending so that the UK nations and regions do not lose out as a result of those reforms in Europe.

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="41216-06_spnew7"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that such spending has a role and that Europe should contribute. We consider that reforms should be put in place from 2007&nbsp;onwards. EU spending should be focused where it is needed most in poorer member states, which have a weaker financial and institutional capacity to deliver regional policy. He is right about the important role of regional funding, and his constituents will be alarmed by the &#163;35&nbsp;billion cuts planned by the Conservative party. The shadow deregulation Minister, the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), has said that we should discontinue regional and other industrial support, which runs at &#163;1.9&nbsp;billion.

I accused him on that occasion of referring to the four deaths as suicides. Having studied the official record, I can see that I was wrong to do so. He made no reference to the events at Deepcut in that context.

One of the purposes of the negotiation is to provide objective guarantees that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme can be used only for peaceful purposes. That is the reality of EU common foreign policy, not the fantastical accusations that we so often hear from the Opposition.

<a name="41216-09_para9">
<a name="stpa_21">Those negotiations are bound to take some years, but Turkish membership of the EU would bring major benefits to Britain and to Europe as a whole. Turkey has long been a strong partner in NATO, occupying as it does a strategic position between the middle east, central Asia and the Balkans. The presence of a European Turkey in that crucial region would be of enormous further benefit. One half of Turkey&#039;s trade is already with the EU, most of it under the customs union which has been in force since 1996. EU membership for Turkey would increase that further. It offers the prospect of significant benefits for British firms, who are already Turkey&#039;s fifth most important suppliers of imports.

In fact, many&#151;if not most&#151;European countries, including this one, have a strong religious tradition intertwined with their secular society, some European countries, including England, have state Churches and, in many parts of continental Europe, there are Christian Democratic political parties. Thirdly and most importantly, that view of a clash of civilisations ignores the enormous contribution that people of the Muslim faith&#151;including the 25,000-plus in my constituency&#151;make to Britain and to many other European countries today, and that they have made down the centuries.

But as proud, sovereign and independent nations such as Turkey queue up to join the European Union and as many others&#151;Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states&#151;see their hard-won membership as affirmation of their freedom and their independence, the Conservative party has gone rather quiet. Perhaps it is because it is difficult for it to explain why a country such as Turkey, with its distinctive traditions and its commitment to being a strong and powerful nation, is so keen to join an organisation that the Conservatives now say represents, with the new constitution, the end of 1,000&nbsp;years of national history. It is another example of Conservative myths coming face to face with reality, and as ever, the Conservative party losing out.

I have always found that particular dog a somewhat welcoming mutt, as it nearly always signals that the Foreign Secretary has nothing positive to say about Europe.

<a name="41216-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_49">Fathoming the Foreign Secretary&#039;s position is not much easier. He exhibits schizophrenia on the question of a referendum. One moment he is aggressively against a referendum and the next he is passionately in favour. That is surely not just because the Minister for Europe, as we heard, swore at him. This is the same Foreign Secretary who blithely assured the House in the autumn of 2003&nbsp;that EU enlargement would not create undue or unsupportable migration to the UK from the accession countries. He will remember the debate in question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_50">We now learn from Stephen Pollard&#039;s new biography that, according to the Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary flew into an hysterical panic over migration when the EU was enlarged. I am very grateful to the Government Chief Whip. She kindly handed back the copy of the biography that my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition tried to give to the Prime Minister as a Christmas present, so that I could better use it, having been unable to get a copy myself. I have had a moment or two to glance at it and it is worth reading the following quote into the record. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;&#039;Jack Straw and the Foreign Office just completely flipped on the position they had held before. Jack went into hysterical mode about what he now saw as the impending consequences of accession. He started making dramatic predictions of what would happen&#151;completely the opposite of what he had wanted about five minutes earlier.&#039; For months, Straw had been &#039;the man who said everybody was welcome to come and draw benefits&#039;, as Blunkett puts it. Come the moment of accession, however, Straw &#039;suddenly decides he&#039;s in a terrible panic and he doesn&#039;t want anybody here at all. And so we&#039;re going round in circles.&#039;&quot;</p>

</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="41216-11_spnew10"><b> Tony Baldry: </b> 
 Does that not illustrate why having just two days a year to debate European policy is wholly inadequate? Every so often, we ought to have the opportunity to debate European trade policy and migration policy, because only then will we be able to flush out of the Foreign Secretary what the

<a name="stpa_51">A far more important question is, what is the Government&#039;s position on Europe today? For all the Prime Minister&#039;s talk about being at the centre of Europe, the Government have never really had a policy on Europe, except to adopt the course of least resistance. They are always the poodle, never the bulldog, hence last year&#039;s surrender over the separate European military planning capability&#151;there can be no other explanation&#151;and the current apparent readiness to go along with the EU&#039;s proposed lifting of the embargo on arms sales to China, in the full knowledge that it will cause a deep breach with the United States. In terms of military equipment, that could be very damaging to our national interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_52">The Foreign Secretary tried to make light of this issue yesterday by suggesting that the embargo has &quot;no legal force&quot;, but that we now have a legally enforceable EU code of conduct. That seems strange, given Amnesty International&#039;s criticism of that code of conduct as &quot;not legally binding&quot;. The EU embargo, however, applies as a Council decision. If the Foreign Secretary is right, why is China&#151;backed by French commercial interests&#151;so keen for the embargo to be lifted, and the US so adamantly opposed?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_53">Two months ago, the Prime Minister signed the treaty establishing a European constitution, even though it contains many elements that he had assured us would not be in it. First, there is the constitution itself, which he told us in October 2000&nbsp;was not necessary. Secondly, reference is made to EU control of justice and home affairs, matters which we were told would be dealt with through co-operation between nation states. Thirdly, the EU is given a single legal personality, a proposal which the Prime Minister once described as &quot;potentially damaging&quot;. Fourthly, reference is made to a legally binding charter of fundamental rights, even though we were promised that such a charter would not be legally binding and would have no more legal force than the <i>Beano</i>. Fifthly, the promised vetoes in respect of social security and criminal law have been watered down into so-called &quot;emergency brakes&quot;. The Government&#039;s firm opposition to a European public prosecutor has been

</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_54">Why did the Prime Minister sign up to a constitution that flies in the face of his Government&#039;s promises? As I have said, the answer is that this Government have no policy on Europe other than to adopt the course of least resistance. Still they tell us that this constitution is nothing more than a rule book to run the enlarged EU. What sort of mugs do they take the British people for? That is not what the EU is telling the wider world. When in Israel last week, I asked a senior Minister about his views on the EU&#039;s relationship with the peace process. He said that the EU was being very pushy about playing the lead role and that EU representatives were now telling him that Europe was more powerful and influential than the US. They said that it had more people and that, under the constitution, it would soon have its own president, foreign minister and diplomatic service, complete with ambassadors. They also said that it would have its own foreign policy and currency, and eventually its own military forces&#151;and the clout, therefore, to deliver in the middle east.

<a name="41216-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_55">Once again, we see the use of the forked tongue. The Government are minimalists at home to allay public suspicions, but enthusiastic integrators abroad. That is not a clear picture; it is more of a tangled web. By way of contrast&#151;

We oppose the constitution in principle because we believe it is a gateway to a country called Europe to which we do not want to go. We also oppose it in detail, because it erodes our essential rights in respect of self-determination.

We will reverse the conveyor belt that for too long has transferred powers only one way&#151;from national Parliaments to Brussels.

We should let those countries that want to integrate further do so, but other countries should not be compelled to join them.

 I cannot begin without expressing my profound disappointment that the Government have neither published nor introduced to Parliament the Bill designed to facilitate the ratification of the treaty, establishing a single constitutional document for Europe. It has been reported that the Government Chief Whip believes that it would be difficult to put such a Bill on the statute book before the election. If that report is true, it conveys two pieces of information: first, that the likely date of the election is almost certainly 5&nbsp;May&#151;probably the worst kept political secret in Westminster&#151;and secondly, the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Government to put such a measure through Parliament.

It now appears from what the Minister for Europe has told the people of Durham that I was responsible for persuading the Foreign Secretary of the virtues of the referendum, so I count it as a personal failure that I have not been able to persuade him of the virtues of early legislation on this matter.

<a name="stpa_75">Enlargement will undoubtedly be a significant issue for discussion this weekend. Not much reference has been made to Bulgaria, but I understand that that country has now pretty well closed all her chapters and will, in that sense, be eligible for membership. I hope that that membership proceeds smoothly and expeditiously.
</p>

<a name="41216-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_76">In the matter of Romania, to which some reference has been made, the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) was right that considerable doubts remain about corruption, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, but we are entitled to derive some encouragement from the election of Mr. Basescu, who was elected expressly on an anti-corruption ticket. As the Foreign Secretary was willing to agree a few moments ago, that is a clear indication of how the prospect of European Union membership&#151;and, indeed, its requirements&#151;may have considerable influence on electorates, who are aware that without substantial change and their support for suitable political candidates, their aspirations for membership may not be able to be realised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_77">It is inevitable that the principal focus will be on Turkey. One national newspaper this week rather portentously said that &quot;Turkey&#039;s moment has arrived&quot;. The admission of Turkey will be a strategic decision of historic importance. The Foreign Secretary himself spoke of Turkey forming a bridge between Islam and the west. There is reason to believe that Turkey&#039;s ultimate entry may not be for some years&#151;10&nbsp;years in some estimates. In the meantime, there is an opportunity for inward investment and modernisation to take place. Just as the whole House supports Turkey&#039;s accession to the EU in principle, so it will also support the view that Turkey must implement all necessary reforms in full. There is a sense in which Turkey and the Turks must prove themselves, but it is important that they do so according to the same conditions as apply to everyone else, and that the bar is not set higher for Turkey than for any other applicant country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_89"><a name="41216-13_spnew1"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that it is not a question merely of the European Council agreeing that negotiations should start? A recent opinion poll in France reported that 70&nbsp;per cent. of people there were against Turkey&#039;s membership. Does he welcome President Chirac&#039;s decision to go on television tonight to argue Turkey&#039;s case and to say that EU member states have a responsibility to sell Turkey&#039;s membership directly to their people, rather than waiting until the end of the negotiations?
</p>








<p><a name="st_90"><a name="41216-13_spnew2"><b> Sir Menzies Campbell: </b> 
 Indeed, and opinion polls suggest that persuading public opinion in France or Germany, for example, will be something of a task. It is to be welcomed that President Chirac will go on television this evening to make the case that the hon. Gentleman has outlined, but the notion that privileged partnership can be an alternative to membership needs to be killed now. One commentator this week said that it was of &quot;dubious legality&quot; and &quot;transparent bad faith&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para4">

</p>








<p><a name="st_91"><a name="41216-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 Has the right hon. and learned Gentleman seen the opinion poll that came out about two weeks ago which showed that 58&nbsp;per cent. of all people in the UK&#151;and 68&nbsp;per cent. of people aged between 18&nbsp;and 24, and 65&nbsp;per cent. of people in Scotland&#151;wanted the existing European treaties to be reduced to trade and association agreements? Does he agree that adopting that as a policy&#151;which I would certainly advocate&#151;would also help in the context of Turkey? It would demonstrate that we could work together without giving way to the primacy of the European constitution.
</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="41216-13_spnew4"><b> Sir Menzies Campbell: </b> 
 I did not see that poll, but if it is as pessimistic about Scotland as the hon. Gentleman suggests, it fills me with a certain anxiety. However, I have never regarded the EU&#151;or the Coal and Steel Community, or the European Community that developed from that&#151;as being solely about trade. I consider it to be about the rule of law and human rights as well. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s question seems to imply that the arrangements between the European countries should be modified to provide only for trade and economic co-operation. Were that to happen, I believe that we would be giving up something that I consider to be of enormous importance and significance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_79">That is how it was regarded in the immediate post-war period, when the impetus to find mechanisms to ensure that France and Germany were not at each other&#039;s throats&#151;as they had been three times in the preceding 80&nbsp;years&#151;was at its highest. I should be very reluctant to see an association emerge that was more akin to the European Free Trade Area, for example, in which the fundamental issues of human rights and the rule of law were put to one side. That might help a lot of countries to join the EU, but I am not sure that it would necessarily be in the UK&#039;s interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_80">The opening of accession negotiations with Turkey is the surest way to maintain the momentum already evident in that country towards reform, securing respect for freedom and human rights and promoting a stable and prosperous future. However, those objectives must be achieved in substance and not merely in form. That is why accession provides Turkey with a great opportunity and also a considerable obligation. Persuading public opinion in the EU and Turkey of the merits of Turkish accession remains a considerable task.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_81">I turn now to the question of the EU budget. It is inevitable when budget considerations are under discussion that there should be a very sharp focus on the UK rebate&#151;or abatement, as it is more properly described. I have no doubt that the view that it continues to be justified remains correct. Even with the abatement, between 1995&nbsp;and 2002&nbsp;the UK paid into the EU two and a half times more than either France or Italy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_82">The European Commission appears to have some general proposals for a rebate mechanism applicable to all net contributors. So far, there is not sufficient detail about the proposals to make clear exactly how they will work, and what the consequences would be for

<b>16 Dec 2004 : Column 1692</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the UK. Important, significant and justified though the abatement may be, however, the long-term question must concern the level of Britain&#039;s net contribution. If a more acceptable and sensible method of financing that had the effect of reducing in the long term Britain&#039;s net contribution could be achieved, then I shall continue the animal metaphors that have characterised today&#039;s debate by saying that it would be a rather dog-in-the-manger attitude not to include the abatement in the discussion. The abatement is significant more for its consequence than for any intrinsic merit.

 Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that the problem is the CAP, without which there would be no budget problem? Is it not right for Britain to make a net contribution to the EU budget so that poorer states and new members can benefit?
</p>








<p><a name="st_94"><a name="41216-13_spnew6"><b> Sir Menzies Campbell: </b> 
 In general, I agree with the hon. Gentleman on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_83">In addition, I should need a great deal of persuading before I could accept the Commission&#039;s proposals for substantial increases in EU funding. There are continuing allegations of corruption, and the auditors have still not signed off the accounts. As a result, this is no time to ask for more money and to do so would display a certain amount of insensitivity in political terms. In that regard, I support the British&#039;s Government&#039;s position, which is buttressed by France, Germany, Sweden, Holland and, I understand, Austria. The aim is to stabilise current expenditure and to limit the budget to 1&nbsp;per cent. of gross national income. Given the present rate of current economic growth in the EU, increased spending at this time would be both unwise and even unsustainable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_84">On the CAP, the priority for budget savings must not be the abandonment or destruction of the CAP. People who believe that it can be simply wished away or destroyed have a rather optimistic view of such matters. What is essential is reform. The CAP&#039;s failings are self-evident. They include excessive production, unsustainable farming practices, the penalising of both taxpayers and consumers, and an impact on the developing world that we may sometimes forget in our discussions but which matters a great deal when it comes to issues of universal free trade. No doubt that is an issue to which the newly appointed British Commissioner will give his considerable attention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_85">Moreover, implementation of the reforms to meet the Lisbon targets has been very slow. Growth in the EU is slow and intermittent, and that is of some concern. Unemployment in France, Germany and Italy is now on the order of 10&nbsp;per cent. That is a clear indication of the need for economic reform.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_86">Another issue is the dependency ratio&#151;the ratio of non-workers to workers&#151;which is rapidly increasing in the EU. We have an ageing society with a high proportion of non-workers. Coupled with low growth and high public spending, that will inevitably be unsustainable in the long term.

<a name="stpa_87">It is clear that a large part of the discussions this weekend will concern external relations. Before I address the situations in Iran, Ukraine and the middle east, I wonder whether hon. Members shared my distaste at the reports that the telephone conversations of Dr. el-Baradei may have been the subject of electronic eavesdropping by our American friends? We have had reports in the past of the telephone conversations of the Secretary-General of the United Nations being subject to the same intrusion, and it seems to me that the confidence that we are entitled to have in international institutions&#151;both the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations&#151;is not served by such actions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_88">We should welcome the agreement, to which the Foreign Secretary was party, by which Iran has undertaken to suspend its enrichment and reprocessing activities. But it is also clear, as the Foreign Secretary will acknowledge, that some long-term agreement is required to cover not only nuclear matters, but economic, security and technical issues. The overwhelming priority must be to achieve a permanent end to uranium enrichment and the production of plutonium. Those are legitimate under the non-proliferation treaty as part of a civil energy programme, but&#151;as everyone knows&#151;it is a short step from that level of expertise to the production of nuclear weapons. There is much to be said for the view that Iran has come close to mastering nuclear technology. That is of consequence not just in the context of Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_89">Hon. Members will be aware that next year we are to have another review of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. If those with long memories cast their mind back to 2000, they will recall that success was achieved at the review conference only by virtue of the declared nuclear powers entering a separate agreement committing themselves to nuclear disarmament and to practical steps to achieve and implement it. At the NPT conference next year, the declared nuclear powers may be asked to account for their obligations under that agreement. No doubt the EU will have a view on the conference, but I suspect that it will be a difficult occasion, with several countries being forceful about what they regard as the obligations undertaken by the declared powers and the extent to which they have been implemented.

<a name="stpa_90">If there is to be some long-term agreement with Iran, it should of course cover more than nuclear or security issues.

<p>
<a name="41216-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_91">The EU response to the situation in Ukraine has been both well judged and effective and we should take some pride in and confidence from that. The Foreign Secretary will be aware that reports this week suggested that a member of the Commission said no unequivocally to the notion of membership of the EU for Ukraine. The Prime Minister of Luxembourg recently said something similar. In the same reports, it was said that the UK Government were non-committal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_92">I do not disguise the fact that Ukrainian membership would present difficulties. The Ukrainian economy, for example, is by no means compatible with that of the European Union. The gross domestic product per capita in 2003&nbsp;was &#163;2,800. In the EU in the same period, the average was &#163;14,900&#151;a substantial disparity. Then there are the problems of governance in Ukraine, which recent events have thrown into sharp relief, and the historical relationship with Russia, which the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes mentioned. However, it appears to me that something is going on in eastern Europe, especially in Romania and in Ukraine. It might not be as dramatic as events in 1989, when the Berlin wall came down, with all the consequences that followed. I have the sense that some movement is taking place in countries that previously were thought to be impervious to arguments about the rule of law, an independent judiciary and control of the military. If that is so, we have an overwhelming responsibility&#151;and it would be in our interests&#151;to be responsive to such movement. That is why we should never say never about Ukrainian membership. We should be willing to say that there may be circumstances in which Ukraine&#039;s membership becomes both feasible and desirable. The Government have not said anything on the record about that, but I hope that some consideration will be given to it. In particular, the Government should ensure that no communiqu&#233; is issued this weekend that appears to bar for ever any application by Ukraine.

<a name="41216-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_93">I am in no doubt that in the circumstances presented after the death of President Arafat collective engagement by the EU in the situation in the middle east is essential. We&#151;by which I mean the EU&#151;have, after all, been the largest supporter financially of the Palestinian National Authority, although much of what has been built with the money that we have supplied has been destroyed.

He was right to say that we need a joint approach, but the evidence on which he sought to rely to suggest that some kind of competition is taking place could fairly be described as hearsay evidence, not evidence that one would wish to stand in the way of a joint approach. The EU may be very persuasive, but no one will be more persuasive in Israel than the US. If we are still talking about a two-state solution&#151;as we must do&#151;it will require the full effort of the whole Quartet.

The constitution is a sensible balance&#151;it enshrines properly, once and for all, in one document rather than several, the relationships that are at the heart of the European Union. In the course of this weekend, I doubt that the constitution will come under much discussion. In the UK, discussion about Europe may never be brought to a conclusion, but it will certainly not be brought to a proper state of consideration unless and until we have the opportunity provided by the referendum to which the Government are committed.

The latest opinion polls suggest that 70&nbsp;per cent. of people in France oppose the entry of Turkey, so I am glad that President Chirac will be appearing on national television in France tonight to argue the case for Turkey. It is extremely important that Governments begin to talk about the enlargement process at an early stage. We did so only at the last moment in respect of the enlargement of 1&nbsp;May.

In fact, enlargement has gone extremely well. The people who have come over have taken part in the registration scheme; they are contributing to our economy, although of course they send remittances to their countries of origin, and are strengthening it by their presence. We should welcome that. I think the same will happen when Turkey joins&#151;whenever that is.

I argued very much against the need for registration and I think that view has proved correct. Let us get things right now.

Obviously, there are no European agencies in the new member states and no plans to hold European summit meetings in any of them because of the deal struck in Nice, which was, as I recall, undertaken to make the Belgians feel a little happier. That is why so many European Council meetings take place in Brussels. Now would be a good opportunity to move one of the agencies from the old 15&nbsp;to the new 10. Perhaps one of them could be in Prague, Warsaw, Cracow or one of the other new EU countries. It is essential to show that the enlargement process did not end on 1&nbsp;May. If those countries are to be full and true members of the EU, we should be willing to hold more summits in them and move more of the agencies to them. The new members would feel reassured by that.

<a name="stpa_105">The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes mentioned the Lisbon agenda, which will, I am sure, be discussed at the Council this weekend. He was wrong to say that the Lisbon agenda was a failure; it was not. The difference between what happened at Lisbon and at other EU summits was that for the first time economic reform was benchmarked. It was part of that process to review the Lisbon agenda after five years to see how well the European countries had done. In fact, the Kok report, published a few weeks ago, makes it clear that Britain has done well, as opposed to some other EU countries. We have not done as well as the Scandinavian countries&#151;we would expect to see Sweden, Finland and Denmark right at the top, partly due to their population size&#151;but the economic reform agenda that our country is pursuing was praised in the Kok report. The House will know that the 112&nbsp;indices have been reduced to 14&nbsp;core indices, but we are in the top tier in a number of cases. So it is wrong to say that we have not done well out of Lisbon. Of course we can do better, but the Kok report is very clear. I am sure that the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), will have read that report. He will know that we have actually had a good report, but we need to do better.

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Kok report was about Europe as a whole; it was not with regard to the United Kingdom? Does he also accept, as one who has studied the Kok report in detail, that there is no doubt that Mr. Kok did severely criticise the failures of the European Union within the eurozone? Does he further accept that the consequence of that is that the only reason why the United Kingdom is seen to be doing comparatively better is despite, not because of, its policies, for example, on economic and monetary union? In the past, Labour would have supported, and did support, our engagement with the exchange rate mechanism, which the Prime Minister constantly throws at us but actually was supported by the then Labour party in opposition, so we should point that out, too.

<br>&nbsp;<br>because of the policies pursued by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He is right also to say that the Kok report does outline a number of serious criticisms. The point of having a report of this sort is that when we look at Lisbon, five years on, as we shall do in the spring Council next year under the Luxembourg presidency, we shall at least have the basis for ensuring that there are action plans. The hon. Gentleman will know, because he has read this report, that what is being suggested is that each member state produces an action plan between 2005&nbsp;and 2006, so that when we get to the spring Council in 2006&nbsp;each EU country will have an action plan detailing what they will do as a result of the Kok report.

<a name="stpa_106">I am very pleased that only yesterday, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills appointed Will Hutton a member of the Kok team, to lead for us in conducting the gap analysis that is being sought to see why we have fallen short of the criteria that have been set out. A gap analysis in the area of learning and skills and education is very important. I know from my time as Minister for Europe that these reports are wonderful, summits are all wonderful, and everything is always such a success in the European Union, but as we have this detailed report we need to act on it, and yesterday a domestic Department has decided to become the first of our Departments of State to ask a person&#151;Will Hutton, an excellent choice as he served on the Kok committee&#151;to produce a gap analysis so that we know where we are going wrong. I want to see other domestic Departments doing the same thing. The predictions of the hon. Member for Stone would be correct if a similar approach is not taken by the Department of Trade and Industry and other Departments that are affected by economic policy. So, we have to take those criticisms; we have to accept that we need to do better.

Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), will take a note of this so that he can pass it on to the Minister for Europe&#151;and that issue is reform. On 25&nbsp;February 2002, our Prime Minister, Mr. Aznar and Gerhard Schr&#246;der wrote a joint letter on reform to the then European President. The point that we raised then was that there were key areas that needed to be looked at, and I raise it again because I hope that we shall have some answers at the end of the debate. How many of those points mentioned in that letter of 25&nbsp;February 2002&nbsp;have actually been realised? How many boxes can we tick? When I last raised this, we did not have an answer, but I am giving notice because I hope that information will be passed to the Front Bench by the time of the winding-up speeches.

They went out and tried to discuss these issues, and I have received many invitations to events all over the country where they have been speaking on them. That is exactly what we should be doing.

<p>
<a name="41216-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_109">The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes, instead of knocking the EU all the time, should be supporting what Britain is doing. We know where he really stands on this issue. We know that he has to adopt a hard-line approach because he speaks for the Conservative party, but we know where his heart really lies on Europe. Unlike others in his party, he wants to stay in the European Union. I will not mislead people by saying that that is not what he wants to do. If that is what he believes, he should be spending his time supporting what Britain is doing, as we spent our time supporting what Government Ministers did before 1997.

 My hon. Friend talks about people learning to love Europe. Is not the problem that people are supportive of Europe but they want a different Europe?

That is what they are not getting from Europe and that is why they are so sceptical.

 I know that I cannot convince my hon.

If we have failed to explain that to people it is our fault&#151;Europe can deliver these benefits, but we have not explained them to people in places like Luton, Leicester and Manchester, and that is our failure.

 My hon. Friend is right. She has great knowledge of these issues, and my experience and her experience, having sat on the Convention, are similar.

<a name="stpa_110">I want to end by briefly talking about the EU presidency, which will come to us in July next year. We are already starting to work on the presidency agenda, and this European Council gives us the opportunity to take forward a number of themes. Obviously, the enlargement theme can be taken forward, as will the Lisbon agenda, but I hope that we can develop the theme of Europe being more than just the original countries that joined or the 15, because we are now a Europe of 25&#151;a Europe of many cultures. We should be proud of the differences in Europe and celebrate them, rather than seeking to find excuses about why Europe does not work.

<a name="stpa_111">The Dutch have done extremely well in holding together this presidency. I recently visited Holland to look at the aftermath of what has been happening there. They have had some awful problems&#151;not just the assignation of political figures, but at least 17&nbsp;mosques have been subject to arson attacks. They are going through their own identity crisis and they have held together the presidency so well. We should learn from what has happened in Holland this year and we should ensure that we push forward the idea of not just an economically prosperous Europe that is able to compete with the United States, producing the jobs that we have not had in the past 10&nbsp;years, but in the words of my hon.

 In listening to the debate, I feel that I am now taking part in the affairs of a very distinguished but small dining club that meets every six months or so to discuss European affairs comprised of people who are Ministers for Europe, who have been Ministers for Europe or who aspire to be Ministers for Europe, among whom I certainly do not count myself. It is a very distinguished group, in which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) asks pertinent questions and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) gives a tour d&#039;horizon of world affairs, which he did very well, rightly pointing to reasons for optimism in the affairs of eastern Europe, particularly Romania and Ukraine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_113">It is evidently the Foreign Secretary&#039;s job in that club is to assure us that there is no need for concern, that it is fairly much business as usual and that the European 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>16 Dec 2004 : Column 1701</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Council is coming up, at which the matters for discussion are enlargement of the EU, the treaty that is on the table and perhaps the defence of the British rebate&#151;all from the point of view of a Government who are more pro-European than the public as a whole. That could have been said more or less of any European Council during the past 10&nbsp;years, under the last Government as well as under the current Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_114">One might easily get the impression if one had just nipped into the debate that nothing had really changed much in recent years. My concern is that that is not the true background to European affairs. Immense forces are at work in the world far beyond the boundaries of Europe, and in 10&nbsp;or 20&nbsp;years&#039; time European Affairs debates in the House will be set against a much darker background than today. The loss of public confidence in the EU&#039;s institutions in this country is becoming greater with each month that goes by, and that will have a dramatic outcome in the months and years ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_115">Of course, all that might, to some extent, come to a crunch in the coming referendum on the European constitution, which evidently will be held whoever wins the general election, although the Government seem most anxious, despite the fact that they think it is vital to the future of Europe, to ensure that the constitution and the preparations for its ratification are not debated in the House this side of the general election. Those who advocate a yes vote in the referendum will find their job dramatically harder than those who advocated one in 1975.

<a name="41216-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_116">The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife looked forward a few moments ago to being there with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and perhaps the Foreign Secretary, and they will paint themselves as the moderate and informed opinion of the nation, against the rather extremist forces that might try to persuade people to vote no. That was the successful approach of the pro-EU side&#151;pro-EEC, as it then was&#151;in 1975, but hon. Members of all points of view recognise that that will be much harder in the coming referendum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_117">It will be a much harder referendum for the yes side to win for several reasons. First, those who are old enough to remember the 1975&nbsp;referendum feel that they were misled at that time because they were not told of the political as well as the economic consequences that would follow from a yes vote. Secondly, those who are not old enough to remember 1975&nbsp;have grown up in an entirely different world, in which they have benefited from many aspects of the EU.

<a name="41216-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_118">The framework for co-operation that it has created, the reinforcement of the rule of law and the encouragement of democracy in certain countries and making war unthinkable between most of the countries of Europe are all real achievements, on account of which I am not in favour of a withdrawal from the EU. I believe that we must strive to make our membership of the EU a success, but the idea of ever-closer political integration of countries&#039; institutions and the EU now seems out of date. Ever-closer political integration is an idea whose obsolescence has already come for a younger generation, who are entirely different from the young people of the 1970s and have a different outlook on world affairs. Part of the reason is also economic. We need not belabour the point today about the differences in gross domestic product and employment growth&#151;

What has changed is that that topic&#151;the euro&#151;has become unsaleable to the people of this country, and it has become unjustifiable on the basis of economics. One has only to look at how the eurozone struggles with inflation, which is gathering in some of the eurozone countries, whereas there is economic stagnation in others&#151;the first threat of stagflation, which we last saw in the 1970s&#151;to see how gravely the economic case has been weakened, and he knows that there is no longer any substantial body of opinion in British industry, finance or commerce in favour of joining the euro.

 The hon. Gentleman did have a roadshow, but it went on a pretty short road and did not get round most of the country.

The assessments of both the Prime Minister and I of the chances of Britain joining the euro at the time of the last election were wrong. I thought that there was a serious possibility that Britain would join the euro in this Parliament if the Labour party was re-elected, and I think that the Prime Minister did, too. Our assessments were both wrong, but that was why I talked about it during the last election and he did not.

<a name="stpa_126">The public&#039;s sentiment about European institutions and what has happened regarding the case for the euro are signs that greater forces are at work that will affect European affairs in the years to come. It is always instructive to talk to Chinese leaders. I have been in favour of listening to them ever since they turned up at the bicentenary of the French revolution. When one was asked whether the French revolution had been a good thing in the history of the world, he said, &quot;It is too early to tell.&quot; Chinese leaders are always good at putting things in perspective. I had the pleasure of meeting them when I was Leader of the Opposition, and when I talked to Jiang Zemin about education in England, he said, &quot;Ah, there are more people studying English in China than there are English people in England&quot;, which put things in perspective.

<a name="stpa_127">It is now commonplace to observe what is happening in the Chinese and Indian economies and the importance of the economic change that that is bringing to the world. However, it is less commonplace to understand the speed and scale with which that is happening. Eurozone managers want 2&nbsp;per cent. economic growth a year, but China has 9&nbsp;per cent. growth a year. As many forecasters say, there is every prospect that in 20&nbsp;years, both the Chinese and Indian economies will be larger than the European economy.

Later this century, steep falls in the populations of Germany, Italy, Hungary and several other countries are in prospect. On top of the unfunded pensions and expensive welfare systems that many countries face, we do not know what such population trends will do to societies. We know that they will create more difficulties with pension funds and that businesses should sell zimmer frames rather than baby-care products, but we do not know what they will do to a society&#039;s optimism and ability to innovate.

There will be immense political, economic and social strains on the European Union and its citizens, with perhaps the greatest loss of influence, relative prosperity and future potential experienced by any group of countries in peacetime in the modern world.

Although several have been adopted, such as the recently agreed merger directive, they represent only a small advance. The directive is not so much a concrete measure as a piece of mud. It retains co-determination within companies and means that if companies merge and more than one third of the work force are from Germany, the new company must adopt the German rules. That will not promote a market for corporate control in Europe that will discipline management and improve competitiveness. While the world changes, the EU is still concerned with an integrationist agenda that is reducing the confidence of the people of this country in most of its branches&#151;governmental institutions, the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Court of Justice.

On tax, for instance, we see judgments of the European Court of Justice increasingly intruding into national decision making, which was not meant to happen. It has not been commonly understood that that is happening. The Prime Minister often stands at the Dispatch Box and says that our veto on tax is safe, yet now there are judgments of the European Court of Justice about foreign subsidiaries of companies and cross-border transactions, such as dividend payments within the EU, that affect tens of billions of pounds of revenue, which the Treasury is struggling with and fears.

It ought to have the same effect, of course. What is a constitution? It is a set of laws that are a framework for government passed by the country concerned. She raises an important and legitimate point. I favour alternative solutions, such as the European Court of Justice not pushing forward the boundaries of European competence, but she raises an entirely fair point.

<a name="stpa_156">The European Union is built on a structure that has always given disproportionate rights to small countries.

In respect of the constitution as it stands, the institutional agreement limits the size of the European Parliament to 750&nbsp;Members, but it also gives a minimum of six seats to every country. Expansion towards 35&nbsp;member states therefore squeezes the countries in the middle.

If we really want to look ahead over the next 15&nbsp;or 20&nbsp;years and to have a European Union that can expand and develop, is the constitutional treaty as it stands a vehicle that allows us to do so?

<a name="stpa_159">I also wonder&#151;this is a technical point&#151;whether, between now and any ratification, there is still a mechanism to clarify some points in the constitution and to make them legally clearer. The issue arises out of something that I came across in close reading about the presidents of the Council and the Commission. I remember the debate on this issue in the Convention. The original draft made it clear that the President of the Commission and the President of the Council could not be the same person. There was a specific line to exclude that possibility, but it was removed, and we now have a statement that the office holder may not also hold a national mandate. There is also an argument that, in the treaty as it stands, as a commissioner may not hold any other office, that means by implication that they should not hold any other European office.

Furthermore, Dutch legal services clearly stated in evidence to the Dutch Parliament that they thought that the correct legal interpretation was that it would be possible for the offices of President of the Commission and President of the Council to be held by one person. Of course, as the treaty stands, both those people will be appointed by qualified majority voting. As I understand it, the British Government are clear that they want those positions to be held by separate people, and I wonder whether it is possible clearly to state some basic understandings of the facts.

I recall extensive discussions with a former commissioner, Henning Christophersen, who was also a member of the praesidium of the Convention. If we examine the rebate in closer detail, it is not worth as much as it seems, because we do not get certain other payments because of it. The removal of the rebate and the CAP would result in long-term gain for both the UK and for the long-term sustainability of the European Union. Between now and the referendum, I hope that both sides occasionally generate a debate informed by facts rather than misunderstandings. One of the great virtues of the referendum is that people will make up their minds on what they want to see in the future.

European Union countries have done that because the military has learned from experience and convinced their politicians to change the political framework. In a sense, that is how the European Union must proceed. It must respond to what people want it to do and not hope that a framework imposed from the top will deliver the goods.

 Again, the European Union cannot be a member of the UN Security Council&#151;only its sovereign member states can.

The right hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that the EU cannot become a member of the United Nations.

There is nothing whatever about that in the existing treaties, nor in the separate European convention on human rights.

 My right hon. Friend is making some powerful points&#151;although spiritually we may be slightly at odds in our approach to the European Union. During the referendum campaign on our accession to the European Union, the Government of the day did not publish any such documents. This document is clearly intended to influence public opinion on the referendum. If it is not accurate, surely it should be referred to the Electoral Commission, because there must come a point when it is partial electioneering as opposed to independent, objective advice given by the Government of the day.

<p><a name="st_143"><a name="41216-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an extremely powerful point. We already know that the Electoral Commission has complained to the Government about the privileged position that the Government have given themselves in the run-up to the referendum. We await the Government&#039;s response on that point. My hon. Friend correctly says that the commission should widen its inquiries and start to look very carefully at what is in this propagandist, one-sided and partial documentation that the Government are printing and publishing with taxpayers&#039; money and may send to every household. If they send it to public libraries, it will immediately be filed in the fiction department.

 The Minister for Europe has missed the point again. I am not saying that the right is good or bad; I am disputing the Foreign Office&#039;s assertion that it is not new. It is clear from the explanations to article 13&nbsp;that it is a new right. They state:


</p>

<a name="stpa_181">I am not considering thought and expression but the possibility of countervailing laws to circumscribe and restrict the right of a scientist to undertake procedures and experiments being deemed illegal under the charter. We can debate whether that is good or bad on another occasion. I am keen on animal welfare and I believe that scientists should be constrained by law in what they can do to animals. However, a scientist would claim that, under the article, his right to research is entirely unrestricted. That is new. There is nothing about that in the European convention on human rights or the existing treaty. It is therefore factually incorrect to claim that the right is not new. I should like the Minister for Europe, at the end of the debate and after taking advice, to correct the contents of this taxpayer-funded document.

Gentleman makes a legitimate point, which he is right to raise, does not article 51, which deals with the field of application at the end of the charter of fundamental rights, cover it? The British Government have gone to extraordinary lengths to get what are called horizontal clauses included to ensure that the provisions of the charter apply to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union. The provisions therefore relate only to the Union&#039;s agencies, not to member states.
</p>








<p><a name="st_147"><a name="41216-20_spnew8"><b> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </b> 
 I hesitate to correct the hon. Lady, but she knows that the charter covers not only EU institutions but member states when they implement EU directives or regulations. As I said earlier, the constitution states that the EU will be able to legislate on research and development. It is therefore entirely plausible that the EU will pass laws on scientific research that member states have to implement. A scientist could therefore easily appeal to the European Court of Justice if he were restricted in any way. Even the hon. Lady&#039;s comments do not undermine my point that the right is new. Nothing like it exists, and that contradicts the assertion in the document to which I have alluded.

When something goes wrong, it cannot be traced back to the person responsible in the Commission&#039;s accounting department for authorising that money. There is a complete lack of accountability at every level, and it will get much worse under the European constitution, because the same institutions will be given even more powers and staff.

One need only compare unemployment in the eurozone and than in Britain since the establishment of the euro to see that things are getting worse there. We are doing relatively better outside the eurozone&#151;the constraints of membership will cause serious political stresses in those countries very soon, especially with the depreciation of the dollar, which could cut the eurozone economy off at the knees. Those countries must start to manage their economies very differently.

Apparently, 80&nbsp;per cent. of its economy is already in the private sector, so 20&nbsp;per cent. in the public sector is not unreasonable for a modern, democratic state.

It did not even say that there would be a phasing-in of the CAP arrangements, as is the case for other new member states, I think, but that there would not be full membership of the CAP. I will return to the CAP later.

<a name="stpa_197">A broader point has been raised about whether Turkey is part of what we might know as Europe. That is not an unreasonable point.

Indeed, if I may pursue the metaphor, if we helped the agricultural nations in Africa and Asia rather than the agriculture sector in the EU, we would do a better job for the world and would be seen in a more benign light by those outside the EU for whom the CAP causes great difficulties.

<a name="stpa_205">There are problems with structural funds as well. Much of Britain&#039;s structural fund spending is to be removed. In that instance at least we received some kind of payback for our EU membership, although not as much as other countries. In fact, many of my hon. Friends who enthuse about the EU do so simply because they have received little bits of European money in their constituencies. Well, those little bits of European money will not be there in future; they will be replaced, I understand, by our own domestic Government spending.

 Belonging to an association of states with shared values in terms of democracy, human rights, the economy, the welfare state, redistribution and trade union and workers&#039; rights is important, and those are the values that I would stress.

The Europe that I am looking to would of course be a much closer arrangement than the Commonwealth, but even the Commonwealth does at least attempt to insist on certain standards of democratic behaviour. We must do the same within the European Union.

Of course, we should spend more&#151;all rich countries should&#151;but we are doing well.

Despite attempts at rigid control from the centre, Europe has, in reality, become &#224; la carte: some member states belong to the eurozone and some do not; some sign up to Schengen and some do not. In some respects, we have opted out and have derogations from European legislation. The Prime Minister has insisted on some of them, and quite rightly so. I believe that there are other respects in which, even now, we would do well to seek exemptions.

<a name="41216-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_213">One such example would be the alcohol and tobacco duties regime. Britain has the right approach to taxing and imposing duties on alcohol and tobacco, keeping up the price for public health reasons. It is also a tremendous producer of revenue that can be spent on other vital aspects of public services. Yet we are being constantly undermined by doubt about the precise rules governing our personal imports of alcohol and tobacco. If there were a definite numerical limit&#151;a lower one than is implied now, and not just guidance about personal use&#151;to the amount of alcohol that could be imported, and if there were rigid controls over the amount of tobacco coming in it would be beneficial in every possible way. Above all, it would raise money for good purposes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_214">We were told in the pre-Budget speech, if I remember correctly, that the evasion of tobacco duties is equivalent to about &#163;2.5&nbsp;billion a year. For half the amount that we lose through the smuggling of tobacco, we could have free long-term care for the elderly. If we had an understanding with Brussels that we were exempt from its insistence on an open market in tobacco and alcohol, we could reap all-round benefits to public health and have more money to spend on other valuable services.

I am indebted to a colleague in the No campaign for pointing out that Europe&#039;s political elites at the top level&#151;the diplomats and governing minorities&#151;are always enthusiastic about Europe. If we come down to the next layer&#151;perhaps to the Parliaments&#151;we will find some sceptics, making more of a balance overall. Probably the majority will go along with the elite because they seek advancement in government and so forth, but at least a proportion of people will be less enthusiastic. By the time we get down to the electorate, we find that a very large number of people, sometimes majorities, are sceptical, and the elites are always worried about such majorities. It seems to me that, in the end, elites have to be governed by majorities. The people have to make their choice and they are not fools, despite the propaganda constantly pumped at them&#151;particularly on the continent&#151;by the elites.

Opposition to the euro was not right-wing, but left-wing&#151;and quite rightly so. Those people saw the EU moving in a neo-liberal direction, which they did not want.

<p>
<a name="41216-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_230">The Under-Secretary would not have volunteered any information on Cotonou in Westminster Hall unless he had been prompted to do so. Even then, he gave us only a short paragraph that had been passed to him by officials&#151;and that was despite having been in Brussels the previous week to discuss Cotonou and at a ministerial meeting on the issue the next day. The coalition against the European Commission&#039;s proposals on Cotonou is widespread. The solitary press article to which I alluded earlier appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> almost two years ago. It raised the concerns set out in a World Bank report, which called on Cotonou to be radically simplified&#151;an important point, given that EU commissioners will have more bag carriers at trade summits than African, Caribbean and Pacific countries will have lawyers. Non-governmental organisations, including ActionAid, Oxfam, Christian Aid, CAFOD&#151;the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development&#151;and a number of others, have been circulating Members with a briefing entitled &quot;Six Reasons to Oppose Economic Partnership Agreements in their Current Form&quot;. I acknowledge that economic partnership agreements are part of the tedious language of trade negotiations, which is why it might be helpful if debates such as this could take place when the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was in the Chamber to answer them; however, they are the new instruments that will be introduced to replace the existing arrangements with ACP nations.

<p>
<a name="41216-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_231">Earlier this month, officials from the Department for International Development and the Department of Trade and Industry gave evidence on Cotonou to the International Development Committee. After hearing that evidence, every member of the Committee believes that we have not sufficiently kept our eyes on the ball on Cotonou and on the impact that discussions will have on the least developed countries, in particular the ACP countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_232">One of the officials described the negotiations on Cotonou as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;a highly uneven playing field&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-23_para16">
<a name="stpa_233">for developing countries to negotiate on. There is no idiot&#039;s guide to Cotonou, but these are the basics. In 2000, the Cotonou agreement replaced Lom&#233;, and it marked a shift from non-reciprocal tariff preferences to establishing reciprocal trade agreements for all ACP countries. The Cotonou agreement proposes to create World Trade Organisation-compatible economic partnership agreements&#151;EPAs&#151;between the EU and the six ACP regions. The ACP group will continue to exist, but its role and scope will be radically altered. That will mean that quite wealthy countries, such as the Bahamas, will negotiate with quite poor countries, such as St. Kitts and Nevis, under the same arrangements.

<a name="stpa_234">The EU has said that the economic partnership agreements should have a strong developmental emphasis&#151;although we have yet to see evidence of that&#151;but that they should also include reciprocity, so preference will go.

In evidence to the Select Committee, officials stated that economic partnership agreements will

It is probable that it will prove impossible to offer all developing countries &quot;Everything but Arms&quot; access, but what steps are the Government taking to ensure that a viable alternative with at least as good access is available to ACP states that do not wish to pursue an economic partnership agreement?

The inter-reliance of countries on exports is significant. We now export more to France than to the 50&nbsp;countries of the Commonwealth, and four times as much to the EU as to the whole of the US.

<a name="stpa_257">Despite some scare stories, EU legislation has spearheaded initiatives to drive the economy forward, and it has made British countries able to compete in a global environment. However, to the people of Britain and Wales&#151;and workers in Ogmore&#151;EU membership means much more than simply free market opportunities for goods and services. It has led to fundamental improvements to working conditions and a minimum level of workplace rights. Those rights, which were voted through with the support of Labour MEPs, include a reduced maximum working week of 48&nbsp;hours, which has been of particular benefit to families and has had an impact on reducing work-related stress. Further rights coupled with that include entitlements to paid leave and one day off a week. It might seem to Conservative Members that I am offloading something,

<a name="stpa_258">It is not only full-time workers who have benefited from advances in workers&#039; rights.

That fundamental change has been driven through in the European Union by Labour MEPs and others. Up to 1.3&nbsp;million temporary workers have benefited from an EU law that has granted them conditions comparable to those of people on full-time contracts.

<a name="41216-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_260">One aspect is health and safety. British workers have benefited from the greater health and safety protection guaranteed by the EU, which is especially significant when one considers that 500,000&nbsp;people in western Europe will die as a direct consequence of previous exposure to asbestos. That is of particular importance in my constituency, not because we have a prevalence of asbestos-related disease, but because those in my constituency who were affected looked across the UK to find support groups. They were also anxious to lobby for the protection of workers in future. Although it is already strictly controlled in Britain, the marketing and use of asbestos will be banned throughout the EU from 2005. Asbestos will continue to pose a risk for those working on older buildings&#151;electricians, builders, plumbers and all crafts. That is why Labour MEPs backed a new package of safety and training measures to target workers who will continue to be exposed to asbestos.

<a name="stpa_267">With the British presidency of the EU next year, the opportunity to fulfil the Lisbon strategy and make it come to fruition as part of a co-ordinated Europe-wide effort led by Britain should not be missed. Britain is already achieving key indicators set by the Kok report, such as those on employment, and is set to be second only to the Danes, Swedes and Finns in areas such as research and development, child care, science and lifelong learning. Why is it wrong for Britain to lead a European effort to achieve those targets, when it obviously benefits Britain, Europe and all of us to continue to seek reform? This country is succeeding as a leader in the EU whose aim is to lift productivity, employment, opportunity and fairness in an environmentally sustainable economy. That success has been nourished, sustained and safeguarded by membership of the Union, which increasingly looks to us for innovative policies that work and for a Europe that works.

<a name="stpa_268">The accession of Turkey is a great opportunity. That point relates to the core of my speech that the EU is a union of not only open financial markets and so on, but of values, not least of which are human rights. The EU cannot, as one Conservative Member mentioned, simply be a trading association. The EU has a greater role as a propagator of fundamental humanitarian values that all progressive EU nations hold, which is its strength. A European Free Trade Association-style organisation would destroy our progress as a community of nations on environmental safeguards, workers&#039; rights and so much more. A pared down economic and trade club is no substitute for a community of nations with shared values&#151;the former knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. The EU, represented by its member states, has beliefs as well as a balance sheet, which is why the accession of Turkey is to be encouraged.

 My hon. Friend has emphasised the need for the European Council to take a positive decision on beginning negotiations with Turkey.

There is nothing in the existing treaties, as compared with the convention of Strasbourg, about human rights. Some would argue&#151;I do not&#151;that the existing treaties have worked well. I believe that they have not worked well not because of the absence of human rights but for other reasons, which I shall consider shortly.

<a name="stpa_277">I would dispute strongly the idea of human rights being the ultimate justification for the constitution of a community of values. After all, this country produced the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights. In many respects, the American constitution was based on the principles that we had enunciated. Jefferson, at the age of 33, had considerable regard in drafting the constitution, which he did himself in only a few months, to the traditions of the British constitutional arrangements. He took the view&#151;I believe, justifiably&#151;that they had gone off key because we relied too much on a constitutional arrangement that was insufficiently democratic.

If the constitution were passed and the House of Commons chose&#151;it is matter of political will&#151;to pass legislation that was inconsistent with any previous enactment, which could, and should in my view, include repeal or amendment of the European Communities Act 1972, judges in the British courts would be obliged not to disapply any subsequent Act but to apply it to the constitution.

 My colleagues may not thank me, but at the risk of encouraging the hon. Gentleman, I do not understand his accusation that the EU lacks democratic accountability. There are two streams of legitimacy&#151;the Council of Ministers, a directly elected assembly of Government representatives, and the European Parliament, which is also directly elected. The public, however, cannot identify where responsibility lies, and are uneasy about the responsibility deficit. There is not a democratic deficit.

 I disagree with the hon. Lady. When decisions are made by QMV about governmental matters, as opposed to matters of trade, that creates serious problems for future elections. The acquis communautaire kicks in, and decisions by British voters, who may wish to change a Government because they do not like the laws that they passed&#151;I would like to repeal many authoritarian laws passed by this Government&#151;are subject to decisions that are binding on this country by virtue of the European Communities Act. We might tolerate for that for the time being, but it prevents us from unravelling those unwanted laws at a general election, which is undemocratic. It is not merely an interference but an inhibition and even a prohibition that prevents the people of this country from changing the laws at an election.

That does not mean that we have to think any less of them for that. I happen to love France and I spend as much time as I can there. I speak French, but that does not mean that I have to agree that the French economic philosophy is better than that of Adam Smith, for example, which I happen to think is far preferable.

 So many matters have been mentioned. For example, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) quite rightly stated that taxation is coming through the back door. Dealing with immigration is a problem under the Amsterdam treaty, even without mentioning what the present Government have done. Under that treaty, which I have to say we renegotiated, there was an agreement that the veto would be lifted in the five years following its coming into effect&#151;April this year, I believe. That is one of the reasons why we have so many difficulties to cope with already.

<a name="stpa_300">Dealing with fraud is another problem. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) made some strong points about that, as did my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks. I believe that fraud is another matter that could be dealt with in this House. Various Conservative Members lost the party Whip during a debate on the Finance Bill in, I think, 1994, although I was not among them on that occasion. We nearly defeated the Government on the day in question, as that Government well knew. I stipulated in the debate that questions relating to fraud should be dealt with by adjusting our procedure to ensure that the Public Accounts Committee could keep an eye on how money is spent here. I urge the Minister for Europe to adopt that proposition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_301">The Minister for Europe intervened on a Conservative Member earlier and got quite heated about fraud. There is a simple answer to the problem, however, and I believe that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee agree with me. If we took advantage of the opportunities available to us, and if the Government were to agree, we could get a handle on how European money is spent in the UK. Our PAC, National Audit Office and Comptroller and Auditor General are superb, and we would be able to hold proper investigations into how that money is spent. That would be a useful and practical way to try and solve the problem of fraud.

<a name="stpa_302">What is the way forward? I wish that the BBC and other media organisations could bring themselves to be less partial in their approach to these matters. I am engaged in a very extensive correspondence with the BBC director-general, and a few days ago received a letter that was four and a half pages long. I shall not go into detail, but it appears that some progress is being made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_303">A committee is being set up under Lord Wilson of Dinton to look into the question of pro-EU bias in the BBC, and a report will appear in due course. I trust that we will make some progress on that front. Experience has taught me not to be over-optimistic, but the matter is terribly important. The BBC is often the main source of information about what is going on in the EU. I told the director-general in one of my letters that I do not argue for one side of the debate by any means, but that the BBC charter requires matters of public policy to be presented in an even-handed fashion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_304">The Gilligan affair demonstrated some of the corporation&#039;s deficiencies in that respect and some very good lessons were clearly learned. However, we have the BBC charter on the one hand and the producer guidelines on the other. Those guidelines are, and must remain, subsidiary to the charter, as they arise from its application. We must press for those two factors to be combined with the agreement attached to the charter by which the BBC governors undertake to ensure proper impartiality.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_306">It is not good enough for us to say that we do not want a constitution in principle and then expect the British people to vote against it. I believe that the British people have already discounted that possibility from the political market place, as they did our proposals for a referendum on the euro in 1997. As the ICM poll with which I began my remarks showed, the people of this country want to return to something along the lines of EFTA. The new arrangement may not be a precise replica of that, but it will be very close.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_307">I urge my colleagues on the Front Bench and in the Government to accept that we cannot proceed without a plan B, which has to be a renegotiation of the existing treaties. Renegotiation has been mentioned, but it cannot be confined only to foreign aid, fishing, the social chapter and, perhaps, the common agricultural policy. It must go much deeper and address the political structure of Europe; the democracy question that I raised earlier; how we relate to the European Court of Justice, on which the House of Lords produced an important report recently; and how we co-operate, not co-ordinate, with other member states. In fact, as I have often tried to express it, we say yes to European trade, but no to European government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_308">We must look at how we would be able to renegotiate those treaties. The Prime Minister talked to the Leader of the Opposition the other day and said that renegotiation was all for the birds. He asked how we would get the agreement of 24&nbsp;other countries. The answer is that it might be difficult, but I predict&#151;and some of my past suggestions have not been entirely wrong&#151;that when we set a course with the political will to achieve constructive objectives in the interests of our own voters and those in other member states, and they see that the present set-up is not working, they will like what we offer. We will offer a renegotiation of the treaties combined with the serious and determined threat of withdrawal, because otherwise no one would take any notice. When the political will of Britain is set out on that negotiating table and we mean what we say&#151;we must do so&#151;people will start to listen and they will act accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_309">The tectonic plates of Europe are already moving. The tectonic plates underneath the Minister for Europe have moved in the past few weeks. The renegotiation is already on the agenda. I know that my colleagues on the Front Bench are grappling with how far down the road they can go. I believe that they are not going far enough&#151;they have not even begun to touch second base. They got to first base by saying that we will renegotiate in principle on fisheries. In the interests of Europe, of this country and of the Conservative party, it is essential that we have a properly formulated policy of renegotiation, combined with the threat of withdrawal, with the aim of associated status and free trade. And we must mean it.

<a name="stpa_312">Everyone acknowledges that the hon. Member for Stone feels strongly and passionately about Europe, but it was deeply depressing to listen to his speech because he seems to lack a vision of what Europe could become and he does not see what has already been achieved. In 1992, when I entered the House, the Gracious Speech referred to the possibility of enlarging the EU. In my maiden speech, I spoke of my hope that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic would be able to join both the European Community and NATO, so it was profoundly moving for me and, more important, for many others when on 1&nbsp;May those countries entered the European Union. For them, in many ways, it was the culmination of world war two&#151;a long journey from 1&nbsp;September 1939&nbsp;to 1&nbsp;May 2004, when they finally achieved true independence in the EU. We should take great pride in that.

Opposition Members who constantly disparage the EU should pause to think. They should remember that we are not the only members of the EU; we are not alone in following the rules, regulations and the acquis&#151;so do 24&nbsp;others. It is mutual; there is shared sovereignty.

<a name="stpa_314">Above all else, the beauty of the EU is that it has become a vehicle for the minimisation and resolution of conflict.

That adjustment is often painful and difficult; for example, the Baltic states had to ignore the scars of 30&nbsp;years of Soviet occupation and come to an accommodation with their Russian minorities. It is to their credit that they did so. Those are great achievements.

<br>&nbsp;<br>but on reflection I decided that perhaps I was wrong, because standing at Tyne Cot cemetery on the Ypres salient or at Langemark, the German cemetery in Flanders, one cannot help but be profoundly moved. We realise how small a village western Europe was and how much pain and trauma it suffered for hundreds of years. The European Union has resolved many conflicts.

<a name="stpa_316">The hon. Member for Stone is extremely proud of his late, gallant father and his contribution to the defence of democracy in world war two and I acknowledge that. However, as he went on to traduce the Republic of France, I remind him that in the early summer of 1940&nbsp;Winston Churchill offered the French Government an indissoluble union. Things have moved on, but I mention that fact because Winston Churchill recognised that the future interests of the United Kingdom and the Republic of France were indivisible and that we had to move forward with common purpose. It is important to bear it in mind that a man of some vision recognised that although France had a republican system and Britain a monarchist system, and although there was a history of conflict, those two great countries, separated by a small channel, needed to work together.

 Very simply, I would recommend that the hon. Gentleman read the biography of Churchill by Roy Jenkins.

I think that all Members share the view that we need to do everything we can to avoid future conflict in our backyard&#151;in the Balkans. Even if we cannot be persuaded&#151;I think most people are&#151;of the need to do it for humanitarian reasons, we need to do so out of naked self-interest, because when there is conflict in south-eastern Europe all of us will have the traditional problems of refugees, asylum seeking, the great burdens that exist and the heartache that we have to deal with in our surgeries and so on.

The very fact that people can live in one community and work in another&#151;the free mobility of labour&#151;in what was the former Yugoslavia is itself one of the great resolvers of conflict.

The Minister looks a bit shocked, but I have raised the subject of Ukraine and Belarus in the Foreign Affairs Committee on a number of occasions. The response has been that these are faraway countries with which we should not be primarily occupied. If the Minister thinks that is wrong, I would love him to amplify on the point.

It has 10&nbsp;million people. It is very close to Poland. It could be absorbed into the European Union, if only there was a change of regime.

The nature of records and censuses is much more limited in that country. It also has common borders with Armenia, Syria, Iran and Iraq. That is a serious problem for us all, because even if Turkey met the Copenhagen criteria, its geography is extremely difficult in terms of commercial security and combating terrorism, given the need to police those vast expanses of border.

 Yes, of course. Turkey has made such a contribution.

That could lead to the growth of federalisation in the region and a place in which the Kurdish people may feel that they have a political identity. It is not for me to redraw the map this afternoon, but our foreign policy should be sensitive to national self-determination and try to find ways of reflecting that in state structures and the European Union. The European Union is important because it has developed the policy of a Europe of the regions. One factor that has driven Poland and even the United Kingdom to have local legislatures is the fact that the EU works in such ways. The Kurdish nationality could well be accommodated.

If the treaty were to go down, as the hon. Member for Stone indicated, we will still have the existing arrangements, which work. I am also keen for compromise and accommodation.

We have a lot of attractive, exciting and intelligent young men and women from the accession countries in London, which I welcome, but that has not presented one problem whatsoever.

He refused to accept that questions regarding a common foreign policy and the activities of the high representative of the EU should be answered by the Department in this country. I stress to the Minister that if the Government are committed to a common foreign policy for the EU, they must at the very least recognise the right of hon.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to know exactly where the Government are facing.

He described a state of paralysis, but graciously accepted a correction from the hon.

Does he agree that the accession negotiations may be a long process, perhaps taking more than 10&nbsp;years? Can he throw some light on the report in yesterday&#039;s edition of <i>The Guardian</i> that the Prime Minister has proposed some Turkish delights to soften opposition to Turkey&#039;s accession in some European countries? Would the Government find it acceptable if the beginning of accession talks was delayed until the second half of next year? Is it true that the Government are already trying to renegotiate the constitution to limit Turkey&#039;s potential voting weight? Are the Government ready to agree to a clause ensuring that accession negotiations with Turkey need not necessarily end in its membership? Would not the latter be a cruel blow to Turkish hopes after the Government have built up its expectation of joining?

<a name="stpa_350">Turning to the priorities for the European Council meeting, we have heard a good deal today about fraud, corruption and hopeless accounting procedures in European Union institutions. The European Court of Auditors has refused to sign off the accounts for the 10th year running. The former chief accounting officer of the EU, Marta Andreasen, has been referred to in the debate, and she has described the problem lucidly. I shall quote from her article in <i>The Times</i> on 6&nbsp;December, which said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">&quot;In 2002&nbsp;I was appointed chief accountant to the European Commission to help&#151;as I then believed&#151;to reform the inadequate systems and stamp out fraud. I drew attention to those inadequacies; I refused to sign accounts that I believed unreliable; for two years I was suspended from my job, obliged to live in Brussels yet forbidden to enter any EU building; and in October I was dismissed, the charge against me being disloyalty, a decision against which I am appealing.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">But I do not believe that I was disloyal to draw attention to the failures that leave the EU&#039;s budget completely vulnerable to fraud and error and to propose urgent changes. The National Audit Office found that in 2002&nbsp;alone there were 10,000&nbsp;examples of possible fraud in the EU&#039;s accounts. For nine consecutive years the EU court of auditors has refused to sign off the budget. The numbers are huge. The annual EC budget is around &#8364;100&nbsp;billion (&#163;65&nbsp;billion). The auditors cannot clear 95&nbsp;per cent. of that. We simply cannot tell what is happening to that money; the system does not allow us to say even if the money is well or fraudulently spent.&quot;</p>

</p>








<p><a name="st_210"><a name="41216-30_spnew5"><b> Mr. Brady: </b> 
 The systems of accounting in the EU do not allow anybody to see how the system is working or know how the money is spent. When I met Marta Andreasen, she made it clear that that is deliberate, because it suits too many people for the picture on EU expenditure to be opaque.

<p>
<a name="41216-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_351">The Chancellor of the Exchequer was prompted to call for the Commission to put its house in order. In turn, he was denounced by Peter Mandelson for &quot;crude Euro-bashing&quot;, and the Minister for Europe attacked Departments whose default setting is to issue press releases attacking Brussels. However, when I asked the Minister for Europe to list those Departments, his brief response to my written question simply said, &quot;No.&quot; Was the Chancellor serious in his determination to clear up the EU accounts or was it just populist posturing to make it appear that he would be less negligent in dealing with EU fraud than the Prime Minister, if only he were in charge?

I wish that we had a mechanism&#151;this is not for me, but for the Leader of the House, for the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, and for the usual channels&#151;whereby we could find ways of discussing these issues in more depth. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary tried to do that through the Standing Committee on the Convention on the Future of Europe, which sat while the Convention was carrying out its work&#151;the first time in British parliamentary history that a treaty was discussed and subjected to cross-examination while the negotiations were going on. Alas, not one Conservative Front Bencher bothered to turn up.

Every law passed in Switzerland has to conform with EU law and the taxpayers of Norway and Switzerland have to pay hundreds of millions of euros to Brussels. If the Conservative party has a vision of our being out of Europe and somehow having a glorious future separate from the EU, let me make it clear, and let every business know, that it would mean still paying a large cheque to Brussels, still obeying every Brussels directive but having no control over the shape and implementation of the directives.

That means, for the first time in British history, that the United Kingdom would vote to put itself in breach of solemn treaty obligations, either meeting large fines from the European Court of Justice or withdrawing from the EU because of one tiny matter. We all have sympathy for the problems of British fishermen. However, outside the EU, no European country would be obliged to allow British fishermen to land their fish at French or other ports.

We had the sit-on-the-hands policy of Conservative Foreign Ministers, one of whom will return to the House if the voters of Kensington and Chelsea are foolish enough to vote Conservative at the next election. He will undoubtedly sit on the Opposition Front Bench before long.

<a name="stpa_367">My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) was, as always, positive. The letter signed by the Prime Minister, Mr. Schr&#246;der and Mr. Aznar in 2002&nbsp;made 10&nbsp;points, many of which have already been achieved. I am happy to write to my hon. Friend with the details rather than detain the House. I have a special affection for the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), as I represent his parents in the House. I am sorry that he was not in Rotherham last Tuesday when, with His Excellency the French Ambassador, I unveiled a plaque in front of the town hall beside the cannon forged in Rotherham that was used to sink Napoleon&#039;s fleet at Trafalgar. However, we

<a name="stpa_369">The right hon. Gentleman, however, made an uncharacteristically pessimistic, dark and apocalyptic speech. He told us that it will be difficult to secure a yes vote on the new treaty of Europe. I welcome that suggestion because, unlike the Opposition, who believe that a no vote on Europe is already in the bag, I am not complacent. I prefer to start with a hill to climb, and I am sure that the British people will not resile from this important treaty and isolate themselves from the rest of Europe. We all remember the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s winning intervention in the election. He warned the British people that if they voted Labour Britain would become a &quot;foreign land&quot;. Would he like me to speak French now? Are the people of Rotherham living in a foreign land? Such scaremongering rhetoric is unworthy of his leadership qualities to which, one day, I expect the Conservative party must return.

 Will the hon. Gentleman respond to an actual point in my speech and explain why Ministers cannot go to the Council of Ministers with an adamant insistence that the hopeless accounting procedures of the European Commission be reformed?
</p>








<p><a name="st_221"><a name="41216-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 That is a perfectly fair point, and I shall deal later with the question of accounting, which was raised by other hon. Members. The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s new book, which we are all reading avidly, is, in one sense, about how Britain had to deal with Europe in the past. It was impossible for Britain to act co-operatively with all our European partners because of the divisions and conflicts to which some hon. Members wish to return. The right hon. Gentleman praises William Pitt&#039;s

</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_370">That is exactly what the new treaty is&#151;it is a redesign of the rule book that allows Europe to function. The right hon. Gentleman, however, embraces the revolutionary prospect that Britain should dishonour the treaty that it signed, resile from it and refuse to ratify it. While the Turks want in, the Tories want out. As he comes to reflect on where his once great party will be after the next election, I hope, and I am confident, that like every sane person born in Rotherham, he will be with me on the British side of the debate, in favour of honouring the treaty that our great country has signed.

<a name="stpa_371">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) took us sensibly into the future Europe of 34&nbsp;or 35&nbsp;countries. That is precisely what this treaty seeks to do&#151;to allow a Europe that expands to have a sensible rule book. She asked me specifically about whether the President of the Commission could also be the President of the Council. If she reads article I-22, she will see that the task of the President of the Council shall be to work

<p><a name="st_222"><a name="41216-32_spnew2"><b> Ms Stuart: </b> 
 With the greatest respect, my hon. Friend is not answering my question. It was not my interpretation. If the Dutch legal services, under the current Dutch presidency, report to their Parliament that, in their legal interpretation, it is a possibility, what is our answer other than saying that we do not agree? Is there any mechanism of pinning that down further?
</p>








<p><a name="st_223"><a name="41216-32_spnew3"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 This is a serious problem. Of course, one can find lawyers in The Hague, Berlin, Paris and in every Inn in the Strand who will give an interpretation. I have read out to my satisfaction&#151;whether the House is satisfied will be seen&#151;that the treaty clearly separates the two, and says that one cannot do the other&#039;s job. We will have to have that discussion with the Dutch, and I am happy to write to my hon. Friend.

<p><a name="st_226"><a name="41216-32_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hopkins: </b> 
 I was merely saying that an opt-out on standardised tobacco duties and free trade would be sensible for a very good reason: we have the right levels of tax and duty, and continental Europe has the wrong levels.

 Many European countries are moving towards our levels, and we do not have the highest ones. My hon.

I can well imagine that some state-subsidised airlines are not keen on competition from easyJet and Ryanair, and he should be careful before he goes down the road that begins to hint&#151;I am sure he did not mean it&#151;at the kind of protectionism that every socialist has fought against all their lives, and that the Conservative party now seems to be embracing.

<a name="stpa_380">The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) made a lengthy speech, in which he made his usual points but also revealed the new thinking of the Conservative party. He rightly said that he was against not just this treaty but the one before it&#151;and the one before that, and the one before that. He unashamedly used the word &quot;withdrawal&quot; in announcing that that was where the Conservative party wants Britain to go. What he said in 1992&nbsp;had become the thinking of many members of the Cabinet by 1997; what he said in 1997&nbsp;became Tory policy in 2001; what he says today is Tory policy for the future. We need to tell every business man in Britain that that is the Conservative party line: that the Conservatives want to pull us out of our biggest trading bloc.

<a name="41216-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_381">As for the important question of errors in the European Commission budget, it is a budget of about &#8364;100&nbsp;billion. As one of my colleagues said, about &#8364;1.5&nbsp;billion of that is contested. Both the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office have drawn attention to lost moneys, accounts that cannot be signed off in Ministries and municipalities, and indeed direct fraud. I do not think that that calls into question the way in which Britain tries to deal with the problems. I fully accept, as do we all, that the EU&#151;like most of its member states&#151;currently operates a cash-based accounting system rather than the accrual system required in the UK public sector. Our public sector has only recently adopted an accrual system, and we are fighting hard to get the EU to do the same.

<a name="stpa_382">About 85&nbsp;to 90&nbsp;per cent. of the EU budget goes back to member states. The complaint is really with Ministries here. Anyone who looks at the accounts in detail will see that some of the payments not just of the countries mentioned, but of Ministries here, cannot be accounted for properly: I fully accept that. In fact, the Commission employs fewer people than the BBC&#151;even the slimmed-down BBC&#151;and its budget is about a quarter of the size of the Pentagon&#039;s. That is a relatively small amount of money, those are relatively few people, and we have 25&nbsp;countries co-operating as never before.

<p><a name="st_243"><a name="41216-33_spnew9"><b> Mr. Huw Edwards  (Monmouth) (Lab):</b> 
 It is an honour to have the opportunity to address the House on the issue of tenant farmers. Apart from not having the security of the capital value of their land and buildings, tenant farmers are also disadvantaged in a number of ways. I shall deal with some of them, particularly with single farm payments, milk quotas, diversification and tenant farmers&#039; personal housing needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_391">For those wishing to enter farming, having a tenancy may be the only method available, so the role of the tenant sector is important to assist new entrants to the industry. I acknowledge that the issues affecting tenant farmers have been considered by the Tenancy Reform Industry Group, under the chairmanship of Julian Sayers, and I also want to acknowledge the Government&#039;s response, which was published last year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_392">My recent interest in the subject was prompted by two tenant farmers who attended my constituency advice surgery in Abergavenny. They are dairy producers with a herd of 95&nbsp;Holstein-Friesians and they also keep sheep. They are Cathy and Nick Sprackling and they run the Ty Mawr farm in Dingestow, near Monmouth. Their concern was with the particular rules governing single farm payments and I will raise the matter briefly here in the House. Because single farm payment is based on three reference years, they were unable, for one reason or another, to submit a claim for sheep annual premium in 2000. As a result, they not only failed to receive that premium, but were further disadvantaged. They wrote to me about their problems and I submitted their letter to the Minister&#039;s office today. That was the issue that they came to see me about, and as I discussed with them particular issues affecting tenant farmers I thought of raising these concerns on the Floor of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_393">They did not have any specific concerns with their own tenancy arrangements and had a high regard for the landlord, Mr. Bosanquet, who I also know well, but they raised important issues that it is right to put to the House. We discussed the price of raw milk, the cost of buying milk quota and especially their concern about future housing. I became intrigued to hear about the problems they faced with regard to housing. Because they are tenants, they will inevitably lose the property that they live in when they decide to retire. In order to find housing, they have currently taken out a mortgage to buy a property in the town of Monmouth, knowing that they will have to let it out until the time at which they retire. They are able to secure only a buy-to-let mortgage, which means that they are being further penalised. They are not going into rented property&#151;a second home&#151;in order to make profit. It is all about security for the future.

<a name="41216-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_394">I understand that, traditionally, tenant farmers often sold their stock to secure sufficient funds to buy a property, often in the countryside if that was their choice, but that possibility is now largely ruled out because of both the relatively low value of stock and the relatively high price of country properties. I was particularly concerned to hear about the way in which

<br>&nbsp;<br>they were being disadvantaged in the housing market and I wondered whether mechanisms could be introduced to help people who have difficulty getting affordable housing. Right hon. and hon. Members who represent rural constituencies know of the great difficulties in being able to live in such areas. My constituency of Monmouthshire is an area of very high property prices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_395">One initiative that I know about in Monmouth is called the shared equity scheme, which is being introduced by a private developer, Lovell, in conjunction with the housing association. Effectively, people buy half the house and the other half is kept by the housing association. It makes housing far more affordable. I wondered whether such schemes could be made available to people in rural areas and I was very pleased to hear that a charity called ARC Addington has such a scheme. Its strategic rural housing scheme allows applicants to choose a property and location. That property is then rented back to them, or made available for purchase under a shared equity arrangement.

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_396">My constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Sprackling, were penalised by having to secure a buy-to-let mortgage, and they tell me that the taxman will penalise them again by treating the rent from their property as unearned income. They believe that it would be fairer to treat that property as their main residence, and to regard any rental income as earned income.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_397">There are not a great many tenant farmers in my constituency, but they do exist. To its credit, Monmouthshire county council has about 50&nbsp;tenanted farms. The scheme governing county council farms was established after the first world war. It allowed local authorities to rent land to farmers as a way of helping men coming back from the war. It was a &quot;farms fit for heroes&quot; scheme, to go alongside the &quot;homes fit for heroes&quot; scheme introduced at that time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_398">In many rural areas, pockets of council houses were built after the Housing Act 1919&nbsp;made it possible for rural and agricultural workers, and others on low incomes, to live in the countryside. That opportunity has largely been lost as a result of right to buy, as many of the properties involved have gone into the private sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_399">One important function of the tenant sector is to allow new entrants to come into the farming industry. However, the Tenant Farmers Association has highlighted the challenges facing new entrants to farming, and called for policies that help rather than hinder their progress. The TFA has always championed the cause of new entrants. Tenancies are the principle mechanisms by which new tenants access the industry, and the TFA is keen to ensure that a strong supply of tenancies remains available to new entrants. Local authorities may be able to continue the traditional role of having tenant farms, but the indications are that they are more likely to divest themselves of their estates than to invest in buying land for tenant farmers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_400">One way to encourage more entrants into the industry would be to increase the opportunity for people to retire from it. There has been much talk about that in recent years. I well remember the crisis of the late 1990s, when I attended packed meetings with the former Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, now Lord Livesey. Many

<br>&nbsp;<br>farmers wished that they had the opportunity to get out of the industry. Early retirement schemes have been available in many other professions and public-sector occupations, and it would not be unreasonable for a similar scheme to apply to the farming sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para17">
<a name="stpa_401">As a result of the inquiries that I have made and the parliamentary questions that I have submitted to the Government, I understand that progress on this matter has been very slow. The TFA has urged the Government to implement a commitment in the new manifesto to develop a scheme allowing people to retire from the industry so that they can make way for others.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para18">
<a name="stpa_402">The Welsh Assembly has also discussed this matter. It was said that implementing an early retirement scheme was inhibited either by the constraints imposed by the EU, or by the Assembly&#039;s limited powers, but I hope that the Government will continue to consider the possibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para19">
<a name="stpa_403">Diversification is another issue that affects tenant farmers. The TFA has highlighted the problem that some tenants face when considering diversification. Business advisers often suggest that farmers consider diversification as an option for business development, but it is not always appreciated that tenant farmers may not be able to take advantage of diversification because of the restrictions that apply under tenancy legislation, and in their tenancy contracts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para20">
<a name="stpa_404">The chief executive of the TFA, George Dunn, has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81">&quot;Most agricultural tenants will require the consent of their landlords before embarking on a non-agricultural project on let land. If such a project would add to the profitability of a tenant&#039;s business and help to sustain the level of rent, it would seem clear that the landlord should support it. However, some landlords insist on the observance of &#039;agricultural only&#039; clauses which appear in tenancy agreements and take a negative attitude to tenants&#039; plans to diversify.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para21">
<a name="stpa_405">A survey by the TFA discovered that on traditional lettings under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986, tenants reported that 53&nbsp;per cent. of landlords had taken or would take a negative attitude to the carrying out of non-agricultural activities on let land. However, other research commissioned by the Country Land and Business Association suggests that landlords are more favourably disposed to support tenants wishing to diversify&#151;96&nbsp;per cent. of all landlords surveyed by the CLBA would grant consent if asked by their tenant, subject only to reasonable terms to protect the landlord&#039;s interest and the value of the land. Examples of diversification include cafes, boat moorings, caravan sites and Christmas tree growing. Those and other forms of diversification have been encouraged. In fact, they have been a necessity in agriculture in recent years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para22">
<a name="stpa_406">Concern has increased over reports that some landlords, including traditional landlords, are taking the opportunity, where available, to bring existing farm tenancies to an end as a lever to extract concessions from tenants on any single farm payment entitlement that might be established. Where that happens, it appears to be very unreasonable. I have not personally come across any cases in my constituency, but I know that it has been a concern of those who represent tenant farmers. In order to avoid that serious problem occurring, the TFA is putting pressure on the Government to introduce a statutory code for the tenant to be able to enforce a valuation of the entitlement at the end of the tenancy if

<br>&nbsp;<br>he does not want to take it away with him. That would then be passed to the landlord for allocation to an incoming tenant in return for the compensation settled. That method would be similar to the provisions contained in legislation that provides compensation to tenants for milk quota or other end-of-tenancy claims on improvements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para23">
<a name="stpa_407">Speaking to my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Sprackling, I was concerned to hear about the problems they have with the price of raw milk. They currently receive 17.2p per litre for raw milk, which is a slight increase on the average price for last year. However, they and other tenant farmers in similar situations cannot make a profit at that price. While we all acknowledge that consumers get a good deal when they go to a supermarket and buy six pints of milk for &#163;1.24&nbsp;or a little more, the worry is how little the farmers get. Several dairy farmers in my constituency have given up in recent years because of the problems faced by the dairy sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para24">
<a name="stpa_408">Together with other hon. Members, I have supported the call for a new strengthened supermarket code of practice. The current code of practice was introduced following the report by the Welsh Affairs Committee on the livestock industry. After publication, we made representations to the Office of Fair Trading that a code of practice be introduced. It was introduced, but on a voluntary basis. There is a strong argument for strengthening it and possibly placing it on a statutory basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-33_para25">
<a name="stpa_409">I am sure that all hon. Members would acknowledge that the tenant farming sector plays an important role, especially for those coming into the industry. The Government have been active in working with all parts of the industry to ensure that the concerns of tenant farmers are addressed and that they are not disadvantaged. We must all support tenant farming and help it flourish, as well as recognising that some of the disadvantages faced by tenant farmers must be addressed.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) for securing this debate and I congratulate him on taking up the cudgels on behalf of tenant farmers. Tenant farmers have long been and remain an integral part of the UK agriculture industry and the social fabric of our rural communities. Before the first world war, 90&nbsp;per cent. of agricultural land in England and Wales was tenanted. Today, the figure is nearer 33&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_410">Despite the reduction in scale, the tenanted sector continues to make an important contribution to farming in several ways. It allows people to farm without the capital needed to buy land. As my hon. Friend rightly pointed out, that is the only way into the industry for many people. The sector also provides opportunities for new and younger entrants to the industry to ensure a dynamic and vibrant future for farming.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_411">That is especially important, given the ageing farming population&#151;although I am not sure that the word &quot;ageing&quot; is accurate. The average age of farmers is

<b>16 Dec 2004 : Column 1768</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>59, and, although that may seem old, when we look at the statistics we find that it was much the same immediately after the war. The farming population is ageing in the sense that we are all ageing, but the extent to which its profile is changing is open to a little more discussion. The industry is certainly changing and it faces a variety of challenges. It is frequently more difficult for older farmers to adjust to changes at a time of transition such as the present, so the current opportunities are relevant. The tenancy option offers landowners and tenants the flexibility to let or rent land according to individual needs.

<a name="stpa_413">I was pointing out the importance of the tenant farmer sector, before I turned to the specific points that my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth raised on behalf of his constituents. If, as we want to do through the strategy for food and sustainable farming, we are committed to ensuring a viable and prosperous future for the tenanted sector it is important that we ensure that tenant farmers are able to adapt to the changing circumstances in agriculture and take advantage of emerging possibilities.

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_414">Farmers today can no longer rely on food production, or food production supported by subsidy-related production, as the sole means of earning their income. Diversification from traditional agricultural activities is often essential to ensure the sustainability and prosperity of a farm business. Greater awareness of the need to protect the environment has led to changes in the way in which land is farmed and managed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_415">Tenant farmers have often been hampered in adapting to those changes due to the legislative framework and the structure of agricultural tenancies, which relates directly to one of my hon. Friend&#039;s points. That is why, at the end of 2002, Lord Whitty and I asked the Tenancy Reform Industry Group to look at the way forward for tenancy reform. I am pleased that my hon. Friend noted the work of the group, led by Julian Sayers. The TFA made a constructive contribution to that work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_416">The main features of the group&#039;s recommendations were proposals for changes to the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986&nbsp;and the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995. At the end of September, the Government issued a consultation document on a regulatory reform order on tenancy reform, which, if adopted, will implement all the proposals for legislative change made by the Tenancy Reform Industry Group. The proposed amendments to the legislation will create a more flexible framework for agricultural lettings and enable tenant farmers to take greater advantage of the opportunities presented by diversification and agri-environment activities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_417">Specifically, the amendments would allow tenant farmers to include income from diversified activities, carried out with the consent of the landlord, in the eligibility criteria for succession to a tenancy. They would allow the simplification of procedures relating to succession to a tenancy on retirement. They would provide for greater flexibility for landlords and tenants to reach agreement on rent reviews and end-of-tenancy compensation. They would also make it easier for landlords and tenants to agree to restructure a holding without jeopardising the status of the tenancy. Each of these points is important not only for the future of the tenanted sector but for the capacity of individuals to move on from a tenancy. My hon. Friend is right to say that that is sometimes a challenge and a problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_418">The consultation period on the regulatory reform order ends this month and I hope that the amended legislation will come into force at the end of 2005. In addition to working on changes to legislation, the Government have worked with the Tenancy Reform Industry Group to produce a code of good practice for agri-environment schemes and diversification projects within agricultural tenancies. The code will assist landlords and tenants in reaching agreement on diversification and agri-environment projects. We have agreed to back up the code by providing funding for an adjudication scheme to consider cases where landlords and tenants have been unable to reach agreement.

<a name="41216-34_para9">

<br>&nbsp;<br>industry group. In particular, fresh start addresses the problems of farmers considering retirement. Representatives of tenant farmers have lobbied strongly for an early retirement scheme under the England rural development programme, which my hon. Friend mentioned. The Government are not convinced that this would be good value for money, and money would have to be diverted from other grant schemes that are providing valuable public benefits, such as the agri-environment schemes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_420">We are aware that there is a particular problem for tenant farmers in finding suitable accommodation for their retirement. Tenant farmers want to be able to retire in rural areas&#151;in other words, to be able to live where they have lived and worked all their lives. I think that that has been dealt with in general by ensuring that more affordable homes are built in rural areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_421">In referring to that and referring specifically to his constituents&#039; experience, my hon. Friend referred to the work of ARC Addington, which has offered interesting and constructive ideas on shared equity. A few months ago, its director made a presentation to the rural affairs forum for England, which I chaired and which was also attended by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning, and I understand that there are proposals with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on that type of model.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_422">Shared equity is one of the ways of ensuring that affordable housing is not only provided but remains and can be recycled for future generations, whether that be 30&nbsp;years on&#151;the next generation&#151;or, as sometimes happens with affordable housing, on a 10-year cycle, so the benefits of that model could be considerable. My understanding is that some elements of the proposal could be accommodated within existing arrangements but others would require changes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41216-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_423">Affordable housing in rural areas is the issue that leads to the problems; if there was sufficient affordable houses it would not be as difficult for people to find accommodation. I met the director of the Housing Corporation recently, and received very strong assurances that it will do what it has done over the past few years, which is to exceed the targets set out in the rural White Paper for the provision of social housing in rural areas. I know that colleagues at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have proposed a number of measures, particularly in relation to planning, that will assist in the provision of specific opportunities at the local level. We are often talking about the very smallest of communities&#151;those under 3,000&#151;and we are also talking about arrangements where the exceptions policy has been very constructive in recent years; that policy will continue.
